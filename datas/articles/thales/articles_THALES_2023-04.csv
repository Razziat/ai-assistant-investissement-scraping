For the third edition of CYSAT, the European event entirely dedicated to cybersecurity for the space industry, taking place on 26-27 April 2023 at Station F in Paris, the European Space Agency (ESA) set up a satellite test bench to simulate attempts to seize control of OPS-SAT, a nanosatellite operated by the agency for demonstration purposes.

Thales's offensive cybersecurity team stepped up to the challenge, identifying vulnerabilities that could enable malicious actors to disrupt operation of the ESA satellite.

The results of the ethical satellite hacking exercise, the first of its kind in the world, will be used to tighten security for the satellite and its onboard applications, helping to improve the cyber resilience of space systems, protect sensitive data and support the long-term success of space programmes.

The European Space Agency (ESA) challenged cybersecurity experts in the space industry ecosystem to disrupt the operation of the agency's OPS-SAT demonstration nanosatellite. Participants used a variety of ethical hacking techniques to take control of the system used to manage the payload's global positioning system, attitude control system1 and onboard camera. Unauthorised access to these systems can cause serious damage to the satellite or lead to a loss of control over its mission. Thales's offensive cybersecurity team worked with the Group's Information Technology Security Evaluation Facility (ITSEF2) for this unique exercise, which demonstrates the need for a high level of cyber resilience in the very specific operating environment of space.

The Thales team of four cybersecurity researchers accessed the satellite's onboard system, used standard access rights to gain control of its application environment, and then exploited several vulnerabilities to introduce malicious code into the satellite's systems. This made it possible to compromise the data sent back to Earth, in particular by modifying the images captured by the satellite's camera, and to achieve other objectives such as masking selected geographic areas in the satellite imagery while concealing their activities to avoid detection by ESA. The demonstration was organised specifically for CYSAT to help assess the potential impact of a real cyberattack and the consequences for civilian systems.

Throughout the exercise, ESA had access to the satellite's systems to retain control and ensure a return to normal operation.

""Thales is grateful to ESA and the CYSAT organisers for providing this unique opportunity to demonstrate the ability of our experts to identify vulnerabilities in a satellite system. With the growing number of military as well as civil applications that are reliant on satellite systems today, the space industry needs to take cybersecurity into account at every stage in the satellite's life cycle, from initial design to systems development and maintenance. This unprecedented exercise was a chance to raise awareness of potential flaws and vulnerabilities so that they can be remediated more effectively, and to adapt current and future solutions to improve the cyber resilience of satellites and space programmes in general, including both ground segments and orbital systems."" Pierre-Yves Jolivet, VP Cyber Solutions, Thales.

In a presentation on 27 April by Thales experts and members of the ESA team, CYSAT participants can find out more about the attack scenario used in this first demonstration of offensive cybersecurity techniques, tactics and procedures.

Thales's cybersecurity capabilities for the space industry

Drawing on more than 40 years of experience in cybersecurity and space activities, Thales applies the principles of ""cybersecurity by design"" to the products it develops for satellite operators and space agencies. Its joint venture with Leonardo, Thales Alenia Space, designs and delivers innovative solutions for telecommunications, navigation, Earth observation, environmental monitoring, space exploration, scientific research and orbital infrastructures. With more than 3,500 cybersecurity specialists, Thales helps to ensure the security of satellite systems for national and European space programmes – in particular Europe's Galileo satellite navigation programme – and at the international level. With its combined expertise in cutting-edge satellite systems and cybersecurity solutions relying on the latest military technologies, Thales offers governments, institutions and enterprise customers a comprehensive range of cybersecurity solutions to guarantee robust protection of all the elements of a space system. The offensive cybersecurity capabilities demonstrated by Thales at CYSAT enable customers to better anticipate and respond to current and future threats. The Group's cybersecurity solutions for the space industry encompass everything from risk and threat evaluation to data protection and network security, incident detection and response, and security maintenance throughout the system life cycle.

Thales today announced the release of 2023 Thales Data Threat Report, its annual report on the latest data security threats, trends and emerging topics based on a survey of nearly 3000 IT and security professionals in 18 countries. This year’s report found an increase in ransomware attacks, and increased risks to sensitive data in the cloud.

Nearly half (47%) of IT professionals surveyed believe that security threats are increasing in volume or severity with 48% reporting an increase in ransomware attacks. More than a third (37%) have experienced a data breach in the past 12 months, including 22% reporting that their organisation had been a victim of a ransomware attack.

Respondents identified their cloud assets as the biggest targets for cyber-attacks. Over a quarter (28%) said SaaS apps and cloud-based storage were the biggest targets, followed by cloud-hosted applications (26%) and cloud infrastructure management (25%). The increase in cloud exploitation and attacks is directly due to the increase in workloads moving to the cloud as 75% of respondents said 40% of data stored in the cloud is now classified as sensitive compared to 49% of respondents in 2022.

These are just a few of the key insights from the 2023 Thales Data Threat Report, conducted by 451 Research, which surveyed both private and public sector organisations. It reveals how businesses are responding and planning their data security strategies and practices in light of a changing threat landscape and the progress they are making to address threats.

Human error and the impact of ransomware

Simple human error, misconfiguration or other mistakes can accidentally lead to breaches – and respondents identified this as the leading cause of cloud data breaches. For those organisations that have suffered a data breach in the past 12 months, misconfiguration or human error was the primary cause identified by 55% of respondents. This was followed by the exploitation of a known vulnerability (21%), and of a zero day / previously unknown vulnerability (13%). The report finds that identity and access management (IAM) is the best defence, with 28% of respondents identifying it as the most effective tool to mitigate these risks.

Meanwhile, the severity of ransomware attacks appears to be declining, with 35% of 2023 respondents reporting that ransomware had a significant impact compared to 44% of respondents reporting similar levels of impact in 2022. Spend is moving in the right direction too, with 61% reporting they would shift or add a budget for ransomware tools to prevent future attacks – up from 57% in 2022 – yet organisational responses to ransomware remain inconsistent. Only 49% of enterprises reported having a formal response ransomware plan, while 67% still report data loss from ransomware attacks.

Addressing the challenges of digital sovereignty

Digital sovereignty is becoming more top of mind for data privacy and security teams. Overall, the report found that data sovereignty remains both a short- and long-term challenge for enterprises. 83% expressed concerns over data sovereignty, and 55% agreed that data privacy and compliance in the cloud has become more difficult, likely due to emergence of requirements around digital sovereignty.

Emerging threats from quantum computers that could attack classical encryption schemes are also a cause for concern for organisations. The report found that Harvest Now, Decrypt Later (“HNDL”) and future network decryption were the greatest security concerns from quantum computing – with 62% and 55% reporting concerns respectively. While Post Quantum Cryptography (PQC) has emerged as a discipline to counter these threats, the report found that 62% of organisations have five or more key management systems, presenting a challenge for PQC and crypto agility.

Sebastien Cano, Senior Vice President for Cloud Protection and Licensing activities at Thales, comments: “Enterprises continue to see a serious threat landscape. Our findings indicate good progress is being made in certain areas, including MFA adoption and increased use of data encryption. However, there is still a lot of security gaps regarding data visibility. In an increasingly cloud-first world, organisations must maintain better control over their data so they can serve their stakeholders with greater safety and trust. As data sovereignty and protection regulations around the world tighten, security teams will need far more confidence in protecting where their data is being stored and how it is moving and being used.”

About the 2023 Thales Global Data Threat Report

The 2023 Thales Global Data Threat Report was based on a global 451 Research survey commissioned by Thales of almost 3000 executives with responsibility for or influence over IT and data security. Respondents were from 18 countries: Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Organisations represented a range of industries, with a primary emphasis on healthcare, financial services, retail, technology, and federal government. Job titles ranged from C-level executives including CEO, CFO, Chief Data Officer, CISO, Chief Data Scientist, and Chief Risk Officer, to SVP/VP, IT Administrator, Security Analyst, Security Engineer, and Systems Administrator. Respondents represented a broad range of organizational sizes, with the majority ranging from 500 to 10,000 employees. The survey was conducted in November and December 2022.

Trusted AI: a strategic challenge - Thales,"Thu, 13 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi9ncm91cC9pbm5vdmF0aW9uL21hZ2F6aW5lL3RydXN0ZWQtYWktc3RyYXRlZ2ljLWNoYWxsZW5nZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Trusted AI: a strategic challenge Artificial intelligence Innovation Share this article

Making the right decision at a critical moment can be a matter of life or death. That’s why Thales, which serves sensitive industries such as aerospace, space and defence, is taking steps to build trusted artificial intelligence (AI) technologies that keep humans at the centre of the decision-making process. As global leaders in the field, the Group’s R&D teams are rising to the challenge of developing AI systems that work as intended, can explain how they reached their conclusions and are certifiable for use in critical situations.

David Sadek, VP, Research, Technology & Innovation at Thales, specifically in charge of Artificial Intelligence & Information Processing, tells us more.

Thales is investing heavily in the development of AI-based systems. But how can we be certain that we can trust AI in aerospace, defence and other critical industries?

Thales operates in critical sectors and industries, where the stakes can be incredibly high. When it comes to developing digital systems for these markets, especially AI-based systems, the requirements are particularly tight. If the step-counter app on your smartphone produces an inaccurate reading because the algorithm is only approximate, it’s hardly a big deal. But for the systems that get planes safely on and off the ground – and one in three aircraft worldwide uses Thales technologies for just that purpose – the standard is entirely different. For critical systems like these, where lives are at stake, trusted AI is the only option. And merely saying that an AI system can be trusted isn’t enough. You have to prove it. Thales operates in a heavily regulated environment with strict controls. We can’t simply do as we please: the AI technologies we build into our systems have to meet stringent requirements, and in some cases, they need to obtain certification before they can be used in real-world applications. Our approach to trusted AI is based on four key principles: validity, security, explainability and responsibility.

These principles might sound a little abstract. How do these properties of trusted AI translate into the day-to-day work of Thales’s R&D teams?

Our people working on AI systems are tackling some of the biggest challenges in science and technology today. When you’re developing an AI-based system, your first priority is to demonstrate its validity. In other words, you have to make sure it works as intended – nothing more, nothing less. There’s no question of installing AI technology in an aircraft or other critical system unless it’s been validated. We do this using mathematical tools, methods and processes, all of which takes time and resources. To take one example, there’s still no sure-fire way to validate a machine learning system. How do you prove that such a system will do exactly what it’s expected to do in its operational design domain (ODD), or the precise conditions in which it was designed to function? If the algorithm under-calculates the length of runway needed to land an Airbus, that’s a problem. But if it over-calculates the length, we could live with that. This raises the question of what’s acceptable. And things could become even more complex with the emergence of continuous learning AI – systems that learn from the data they collect and improve their performance as they go along. Therein lies the challenge – proving that these systems will remain valid after they’ve entered service, even though they keep learning. But we also need to strike a balance, or we risk losing those nice surprises that AI throws our way every now and then. For instance, when the AlphaGo algorithm beat the world Go champion in 2017, it came up with new strategies that had never occurred to even the brightest human mind. In avionics, there’s no room for error: the maximum allowable probability for a hazardous failure condition is 10-9 per flight hour. It’s a tiny number, but that’s the standard we have to meet. In fact, we’re aiming for a probability of 10-12 for our systems.

Protecting AI-based systems from cyber risks is another huge challenge. How do we eliminate vulnerabilities and make sure these systems can withstand cyberattacks and other threats?

Cybersecurity is, of course, a top priority. It’s important to demonstrate that AI systems are robust enough to withstand cyberattacks and other malicious acts. These days, the relationship between security and AI works both ways: as well as building cybersecure AI-based systems, we’re also using AI to develop cybersecurity algorithms. Machine learning algorithms, for instance, can scan an event log and pick up weak signals that may point to an impending cyberattack. We’ve seen examples of attackers exploiting flaws to trick artificial neural network-based systems into misbehaving, such as by using online software to alter images in ways that are barely perceptible to the human eye or, as in one recent case, placing stickers on street signs to fool self-driving cars. When it comes to cyberfraud and other forms of malicious activity, AI technology is progressing at the same pace as the threats. Thales has put together a team of ethical hackers, based at the ThereSIS laboratory in Palaiseau, to make sure our AI systems are resilient to cyberattacks. They identify vulnerabilities by subjecting algorithms, and neural network architectures in particular, to a battery of “crash tests”, then recommend countermeasures to make our applications as robust as possible. The team is currently developing a suite of tools known as the “Battle Box”. This “crash test” laboratory is an integral part of the certification process for our AI-based systems.

The algorithms built into critical systems make decisions automatically. We expect AI to get these decisions right, but how do we understand and explain why they were made?

Explainability is a key priority. It isn’t a new concept, but it’s come to the fore again with the emergence of artificial neural networks. In short, it’s about explaining why a system made a particular decision, and some algorithms are so complex that nobody – not even experts – can explain how they work! We know why a particular decision was reached, but we don't know how. This is what’s known in the industry as the “black box” phenomenon: we can explain an output without understanding every detail of the process that caused it. On a similar note, it’s important to be able to demonstrate that a system has actually learned what we wanted it to learn. Explainability is one of the main focuses of our research at Thales, in particular at the Sinclair lab (Saclay Industrial Collaborative Laboratory for Artificial Intelligence Research), a joint R&D unit set up with EDF and Total to work on this very topic, as well as on simulation and reinforcement learning. Mislearning can be a real problem for AI technologies. I recall one case where a system was taught to recognise lions in the savannah. One day, it was shown a picture of a cow in the savannah and identified it as a lion. The system had learned to recognise the savannah – the background – but nothing else. In other words, it had mislearned. To take another example, towards the end of the Cold War, the US military was using an AI-based system to spot Soviet tanks in images. The system worked well until, one day, it identified “Soviet tanks” in a set of blurry holiday snaps. Using reverse engineering techniques, the team came to realise that the system was erroneously marking all blurry images as containing tanks. The issue of explainability also applies to symbolic, or rules-based, AI: when systems rely on a spaghetti-like jumble of rules to make deductions, it becomes almost impossible to determine the process by which inputs are converted into outputs.

What is the answer to this problem of mislearning?

At Thales, our aim is to achieve real-time explainability by developing “self-explaining” AI – systems that can account for their behaviour on the fly. Take a digital co-pilot system on board an aircraft, for example, and imagine it tells the human pilot to turn 45 degrees in 30 miles. The pilot needs to be able to ask “Why?” especially if they were planning a quite different course of action. And the system needs to answer in way that the pilot can understand. It needs to say “because there’s a (military) threat ahead or a storm brewing” – not “because neural network layer 3 was 30% activated”. What qualifies as an explanation? Should it be appropriate to the context and to the pilot’s cognitive burden? Should it be provided in real time in the primary sense of the term, i.e. before the environment changes? If the pilot has five seconds to make a decision, the AI system cannot take more than five seconds to respond. These are crucially important questions with significant implications for how the explanation is provided: using the right channel of communication, keeping the language level appropriate and the message short enough, and tailoring all of this to the receiver’s mental state and stress level. In other words, the aim is to use carefully chosen key words without going into unnecessary details that could cloud the message.

So it's crucially important not to overlook the human dimension of AI-based systems.

Exactly. At Thales, we’ve set a high bar for ourselves on this point. Most of our systems are designed around decision-making chains and therefore require human input. Human-machine dialogue is a matter of strategic importance. Our challenge is to develop and deploy AI systems that support intuitive human-machine interaction and dialogue – in other words, a conversation that extends beyond mere questions and answers. You could say that this is the holy grail of AI. There’s a good reason why the Turing test (designed to measure a machine’s ability to exhibit human-like intelligence, ed.) was built around dialogue. Until now, explainability has been the preserve of experts, but we absolutely have to bring users into the loop, so they can tell us whether a given explanation works for them. It’s a technically complex subject, but we mustn't lose sight of how AI systems interact with human beings. Indeed, our commitment to keeping humans in control of AI is set out in black and white in our Digital Ethics Charter. And anyone who’s read Isaac Asimov will know that his Three Laws of Robotics*, which govern the interaction between robots and humans, are as relevant today as they were in 1942. Today, our approach to AI is fundamentally guided by the notion of responsibility – designing systems and technologies that adhere to legal, regulatory and ethical frameworks. Going forward, documenting, modelling and implementing these rules should be a priority.

*1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. 2. A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. 3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.

What sets Thales apart from other players in the AI space?

At Thales, we firmly believe that hybrid AI offers the best way forward, since it combines the benefits of data-based systems and model- and knowledge-based algorithms. We were also among the first companies to push back against indiscriminate data collection and to advocate for collecting only the data that's needed. In doing so, we rejected the concept of “big data” – a lazy approach to AI development – and adopted the principle of “smart data”, which allows us to keep the amount of data we use to a minimum while applying techniques such as transfer learning (using knowledge gained while solving one problem to solve a different but related problem, ed.) to make our algorithms smarter and more human-like in their behaviour. This frugal approach to data is consistent with the advances we’re making in “neuromorphic” processors, which are far less energy-hungry than conventional artificial neutral networks.

So you’re factoring environmental concerns into the way you develop your AI systems?

Indeed we are. This is precisely the thinking behind my proposals for the Green AI and AI for Green initiatives, which are key aspects of our current work. AI technology is incredibly energy-intensive. At Thales, we’re employing frugal learning methods – which are proportionate in the use of data – to make our AI systems as environmentally responsible as possible. But AI can actually help to reduce carbon emissions too. For instance, Thales is leading the way on developing algorithms that adjust aircraft trajectories to limit the production of environmentally harmful contrails. We’re also exploring cutting-edge AI technologies such as reinforcement learning (where a machine learns not from training data but through trial and error, ed.), which is an incredibly promising field. And we’re using AI-based systems that factor in the wake vortex effect to limit how long aircraft spend in the air on final approach and reduce their carbon emissions. Internally, we’re planning to launch a call for ideas on how we could leverage AI to reduce the Group’s carbon footprint. Ethical and environmental considerations should be perceived not as constraints but as opportunities for value creation and differentiation. In our view, when you have a choice between solutions with comparable functionality, it’s always best to go for the greenest and most ethical option.

What avenues of innovation are you currently exploring at Thales? And what would you say to a young engineer interested in working in AI?

Much of our current work focuses on AI engineering – on building the tools, methods and processes we need to develop these systems at scale. We’re also working on distributed AI, which involves decentralising decision-making through multi-agent systems (MAS). The Thales School of AI* was set up specifically to provide the Group with a pool of fully trained AI experts. To a young engineer interested in working in AI at Thales, I’d say that a career with us is a chance to take on some of the most exciting challenges in science and technology today. And I’d stress that AI isn’t limited to specific use cases –these technologies have applications in fields across a whole spectrum of areas: aerospace, space, defence, digital identity and security, to name but a few. Given that science is a constant search for simple, universal truths, I’d describe the development of trusted AI as a perfect opportunity to harness the power of technology to build a better world for all."

Thales, the leading global technology and security provider, today announced the introduction of a new secrets management solution as part of its CipherTrust Data Security platform which unifies the discovery, classification, protection, and control of sensitive data across cloud, on-premises and hybrid environments. Thales’s new secrets management solution, powered by Akeyless’ Vault Platform, enables customers to manage and secure DevOps and cloud workloads’ secrets. The new capability enhances the capabilities of the CipherTrust Data Security platform to help security and governance teams reduce risks by streamlining security processes across their operations.

Thales’ new secrets management solution helps ensure that only authorized workloads and applications can access their passwords, API keys, and certificates, protecting them from unauthorized access, theft, or misuse. The process of secrets management typically involves generating and storing secrets securely, controlling access, and monitoring to alert when there is a suspicion of a breach and associated details.

Todd Moore, vice president of data security products at Thales: ""Combining secrets management with key management is like having a fortified vault for all your valuable assets. We are pleased to meet our customers growing business needs by offering a single data security platform that can simplify the management of all their sensitive data, improve security and compliance, foster development collaboration, and scale their security infrastructure.""

The addition of secrets management enables the CipherTrust Data Security Platform to solve several pain points for customers related to the storing and managing of secrets securely, including:

Mitigating the risk of data breaches: By providing secure storage and access control to sensitive data such as passwords, API keys, and certificates, which are valuable targets for attackers, it mitigates the risk of data breaches.

Simplifying the management of secrets: In many organizations, passwords and certificates are managed manually or with ad-hoc processes, which are time-consuming and error-prone, especially in large or complex environments.

Ensuring compliance with regulations and standards: Some industries and regions require compliance with specific regulations and standards for data security which could be very complex to navigate.

Enabling collaboration:Multiple teams or individuals who need access to secrets now have a centralized and secure way to collaborate on projects.

With support for secrets management, the CipherTrust Data Security Platform further simplifies customers' processes by allowing centralized management of secrets and keys and scaling up to encryption solutions and other data security use cases.

New drone completes first firing of missile in significant unmanned air combat milestone - Thales,"Mon, 17 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi93b3JsZHdpZGUvZGVmZW5jZS9uZXdzL25ldy1kcm9uZS1jb21wbGV0ZXMtZmlyc3QtZmlyaW5nLW1pc3NpbGUtc2lnbmlmaWNhbnQtdW5tYW5uZWQtYWlyLWNvbWJhdNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"New drone completes first firing of missile in significant unmanned air combat milestone United Kingdom DSEI Share this article

A new versatile drone system capable of multiple types of combat mission over land, sea and air has completed a highly successful first trial firing of a Thales Lightweight Multirole Missile (LMM) to bring the potential of unmanned air combat a step closer to reality.

The JACKAL drone capability has been designed and developed by experts from UK-based Flyby Technology, with Turkish partners FlyBVLOS Technology and Maxwell Innovations providing design engineering and prototyping expertise, to fill a recently discovered gap in modern combat operations.

As a Vertical Take Off and Landing (VTOL) platform, JACKAL is designed to satisfy a number of roles, including Battlefield Air Interdiction, Close Air Support, engaging helicopters in flight and killing tanks, to denying the use of runways and roads.

The trial - sponsored by the Rapid Capabilities Office (RCO) of the Royal Air Force – involved teams from Flyby and the technology giant Thales which also manufactures the LMM.

Within a demanding six-week window, they were able to build two operational JACKAL aircraft and successfully fire two LMMs in an impressive demonstration of agile teamwork.

As a plug-and-play system, new equipment and technologies can be incorporated into JACKAL between missions as well as during continued development. The company says this novel streamlined procurement process ensures that future aircraft are not obsolete before they go into service and will remain relevant for longer. It also gives a pathway to future regulatory compliance and airworthiness standards.

Flyby Technology CEO Jon Parker is a former RAF and Royal Navy fighter pilot and he and his team have brought many years of operational experience to bear in the design of the capability.

The company says many nations cannot afford attack helicopters or access fast jets that are modern enough to survive today’s battlefield. JACKAL can give them the same effect with little risk at a fraction of the price. Because the aircraft was born from the ideas of Harrier pilots, the aircraft takes off and lands vertically, another advantage over traditional fighter jets as there is no need for vulnerable runways. It also means that JACKAL can operate from hidden locations such as woods and urban built-up areas. A unique selling point for JACKAL.

Following the invasion of Ukraine, Flyby Technology was asked to brief the RAF’s Rapid Capabilities Office (RCO) on their new drone system.

The Flyby team also contacted Thales in Belfast - where the LMM is designed and manufactured - to explore the possibility of firing it from JACKAL in a trial.

The Thales team accepted the opportunity to work with Flyby to be the first to fire their LMM (also known as Martlet in the Royal Navy) from a drone in flight. Flyby Technology planned and built two operational aircraft from scratch and fired two LMMs in the demanding timescale of six weeks.

Firing a sophisticated missile is not an easy task under the best of conditions and then only with meticulous planning taking many months. JACKAL then being an unproven, experimental aircraft, just added to the complexity of the challenge says the company.

The Belfast team rose to the challenge magnificently and just six weeks after getting the call, the combined teams successfully fired two LMMs proving that JACKAL had arrived as a devastating combat capability able to fire modern battlefield weapons in flight.

Air Commodore Jez Holmes, Head of the RAF Rapid Capabilities Office, said “Given the impressively short time scale it took the team to deliver the initial trial, it’s clear that Flyby could have an exciting future in this sector, and the partnering and support from Thales was outstanding in lowering the barriers to entry for innovative start-ups. I’m looking forward to seeing the ongoing developments in this area.”

Jon Parker, Flyby Technology CEO, said: “War is about winning, and JACKAL is designed by war fighters for that ultimate aim. The days of having a Fighter Pilot in the cockpit are numbered and I realise I will not perhaps be loved for bringing about the end of my own kind. But the future of warfare is changing and JACKAL is part of that future as a true multi-role attack aircraft. We want to make JACKAL a flagship product, creating secure UK jobs and contributing to a new future for the British aerospace and defence industries.”

Philip McBride, Managing Director of Thales in Northern Ireland, said: “One of the unique selling points of LMM is its ability to be integrated onto multiple platforms, including armoured vehicles, helicopters, naval vessels or indeed, shoulder-launchers, each designed to address different threats. It has been a privilege to work with the Flyby team on this time-compressed and ground-breaking trial and has proved that both Thales and Flyby can produce impressive and agile results when focussed on a collective, shared objective.”

The JACKAL team is now developing plans for productionising the capability, whilst the aircraft is undergoing other enhancements and tactical development.

About Flyby Technology

As a former RAF and RN pilot, Air Warfare Instructor and Senior Weapons Instructor, Jon Parker has also brought to bear his project design, development and management experience gained previously from his role as aviation integration manager for the two new British aircraft carriers.

The original design development, prototyping and testing of JACKAL brought together the formidable warfighting expertise of Flyby together with the rapid prototyping and drone building expertise of partners FlyBVLOS Technology and Maxwell Innovations. This also meant the team could fly and test their aircraft at their dedicated range in Turkey without the regulatory restrictions placed on the flying of drones weighing more than 25 kilos in UK airspace.

Flyby Technology will continue development in Turkey as well as the UK, but is now seeking UK manufacturing partners to build JACKAL at scale. They are also designing weapons perfectly suited to both the JACKAL and its new Attack Drone role.

Thales has built its innovation strategy around openness and collaboration because we believe that innovation needs to be a shared endeavour, and because open innovation is the most effective way to harness the breadth of technologies our customers require.

The strategy works on three levels: innovation with academic research partners, innovation in ecosystems of start-ups, SMEs and other industry partners, and co-innovation with customers.

It makes the Thales Group an integral part of extensive innovation ecosystems that combine the strength of fundamental research by the academic community with the agility of high-tech start-ups.

Innovation with prestigious academic partners

Thales conducts early-stage research at its central laboratories – Thales Research & Technology (TRT) – and in the Group's various competence centres. The teams from TRT have a more broad-based approach to research and technology, while researchers at the competence centres work directly with engineers on more specific sets of technologies or products, depending on business priorities.

However, the competence centres are progressively becoming less focused on the needs of one specific business, and tend to develop solutions – particularly software – for several of the Group's business lines. This is often the case for the competence centres in Romania and India.

All these projects share the same goals:

bringing innovations to maturity across the whole spectrum of technologies, with a particular focus on sovereign solutions for customers in our countries of operation

developing new product concepts and system architectures

creating new engineering tools and methods for critical information systems.

The members of Thales's international network of central laboratories collaborate closely with a number of prestigious academic partners. The TRT laboratory in Singapore, for instance, has worked with Nanyang Technological University and the CNRS (French National Scientific Research Centre) since 2009 in an international joint research unit – one of the few units of its kind to include an industry partner. The laboratory is called Cintra and focuses on the nanotechnologies required to develop nanoelectronics and nanophotonics applications.

In the United Kingdom, Thales has ties to several major universities, including the University of Southampton, the University of Bristol and Cranfield University. The Group is also working on cybersecurity with several academic partners, including the Centre for Secure Information Technologies (CSIT) at Queen's University Belfast, and the London Office of Rapid Cybersecurity Advancement (LORCA).

In Canada, the Group is part of a number of research networks and has projects underway with the Institute for Data Valorisation (IVADO), the University of Toronto, McGill University, Polytechnique Montréal, Université Laval and others. With the same research partners, we have also teamed up with telecom industry leaders such as Ericsson and Ciena to form the ENCQOR consortium, an innovation platform dedicated to 5G technologies.

In France, Thales has a number of strategic partnerships with leading institutions including the CNRS, the Atomic Energy Commission (CEA), École Polytechnique, Telecom ParisTech and Sorbonne Université.

The most advanced form of partnership is the joint laboratory; Thales has set up joint laboratories with partners including the CNRS (seven laboratories in all), CEA-LETI (as part of the III-V Lab consortium with Nokia), CEA-LIST for research into artificial intelligence and formal development methods for critical software, and Sorbonne Université for artificial intelligence.

In countries with strong growth potential, Thales is developing its research capabilities as well as its engineering centres. In India, for example, a Thales research team at the Group's Bangalore site is working on open hardware architectures with the Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology (IIIT) in Delhi. The team also collaborates routinely with the Central Manufacturing Technology Institute (CMTI) in Bangalore.

Innovation ecosystems

Joining forces with other major industry players

In striving to meet the technological and societal challenges of tomorrow, the Group is also open to teaming up with other major industry players. Our industry partnerships include the III-V Lab for advanced III-V semiconductor technologies (see above), Software République with Atos, Dassault Systèmes, Groupe Renault and STMicroelectronics, an open innovation ecosystem focusing on smart mobility, and Sinclair with EDF and TotalEnergies, our first joint laboratory with other industry partners in the field of artificial intelligence.

Start-ups: the age of reason

Seven years ago, Thales adopted a structured approach to its interactions with start-ups, and created a database of all the young tech companies working with Group entities worldwide. Since then, 2,000 of these companies have been accredited, and we have conducted 200 proof-of-concept* projects with them and incorporated about 20 of their new technologies into our solutions for customers.

We also work with start-up accelerators In France. The Group is the cybersecurity lead for Station F and one of the founding members of La Place Stratégique, a start-up incubator dedicated to sovereign technologies that we set up with the French defence procurement agency, the French defence innovation agency and the armoured vehicle manufacturer Arquus.

In Canada, Thales has teamed with the largest start-up incubator in Quebec, Centech at the École de Technologie Supérieure de Montréal (ÉTS), to create a six-month international accelerator programme for start-ups working in artificial intelligence.

Co-innovation with customers

To fully understand what they expect and tailor our solutions to their specific requirements, we routinely involve customers in co-innovation projects with our engineers and researchers, in particular at our Innovation Hubs in France and Singapore.

Patricia Besson is Head of Thales’s Reasoning and Analysis in Complex Systems Lab.

""How can AI help us make better decisions at critical moments? How do we build AI systems we can rely on?

Questions like these guide much of our AI work at Thales, and most of our products and systems already incorporate AI in one form or another. And because we operate in strategic industries such as aerospace, space, ground transportation and defence, we naturally set a high bar for ourselves.

Our approach to AI is based on the principles of validity, explainability, security and responsibility, which we consider the defining properties of trusted artificial intelligence. Our R&D teams are using innovate approaches to overcome the obstacles inherent in these four criteria so we can develop trusted AI applications for critical systems.

More broadly, we’re working to make human-machine dialogue more intuitive, and to make our systems more energy-efficient. AI is an exciting and challenging field that is not only driving growth and job creation at Thales, but unleashing a whole new wave of creative thinking."""

Why choose between a career in scientific research, engineering or management when you can have all three? Dunlin Tan has worked at Thales's corporate laboratory in Singapore since 2012 and explains how the Group has offered her all the career opportunities she ever wanted.

2023 is an anniversary year in Singapore. Exactly 50 years ago, Thales (or Thomson-CSF as the Group was known at the time) established a permanent presence in the country, initially to expand its aerospace business in Asia. Half a century later, more than 2,000 people work for Thales in Singapore, imagining and developing new solutions for the defence, security and ATM & Aerospace markets. ""I was put in charge of arranging this year's celebrations,"" says Dunlin Tan, ""and it's been much more than just organising a gala reception! We're also running a series of seminars and special events for our employees, customers and partners to explain our vision for the future and outline our plans for the next 50 years.”

A team of 15 engineers and researchers

At just 41, Dunlin Tan heads up Thales's Research and Technology (R&T) centre in Singapore, one of the Group's five research centres worldwide, and leads a team of about 15 engineers and researchers working in areas as diverse as hardware, materials science and algorithms. She says she has always wanted to pursue a career in scientific research, following in the footsteps of her role model Prof. Mildred Dresselhaus, a pioneer in the physics of carbon nanotubes and the first woman to be appointed an Institute Professor at MIT. ""I always wanted a career in research, but I also knew that someday I wanted to lead a technical team. Thales has given me the opportunity to do both."" Her first encounter with the Group was when she interned at Thales Electro-Optics and worked as a researcher in CINTRA1, a joint research unit set up by the CNRS, Nanyang Technological University and Thales that worked on nanoelectronics and nanophotonics, before going on to work on a doctoral thesis partly financed by the Economic Development Board of Singapore and Thales. Since it was established in 2009, the CINTRA lab has been a real melting pot of expertise and an opportunity for French and Singaporean researchers to share their complementary skills and capabilities. ""I chose to study EM simulations and the realisation of carbon nanotubes for RF packaging,"" continues Dr Tan. ""That experience really convinced me that applied research was the direction I wanted to take, because I can't think of anything more rewarding than developing innovations for products and systems that will have a real impact on everybody's daily lives.""

An immersive experience

Thales offers its 81,000 employees a vast array of opportunities to develop their careers, learn new skills and assume leadership roles within the organisation. ""Ever since I joined the Group in 2012,"" says Dunlin, ""the guidance I have received from senior colleagues as well as formal training and professional development courses have been instrumental in shaping my career path."" As a young scientist, for example, she took part in the Emerging Leaders Programme, which was put together with the ESSEC business school by the human resources department at Thales Singapore to develop strategic thinking and a culture of customer-centric innovation among high-potential employees. ""Our Singapore leadership team sets us practical challenges, and we needed to solve them as a team and come up with our own action plans,"" she says. ""For me, the programme was a chance to interact with people from other departments working in very different fields from my own, discuss the challenges with a whole range of stakeholders and understand the issues they face. It was an immersive experience that has served me extremely well ever since. And now it's my turn to share my own experience with the people on my team and in other departments.""

A supportive environment

Throughout her career at Thales, Dunlin Tan has felt empowered to develop her full potential. ""In my mind, very few companies can claim to cover such a broad range of use cases, from development of underwater acoustic sensors to microchips in passports, from securing bank transactions to satellite communications."" And she sees the same diversity reflected in the career paths and opportunities that Thales offers its employees. ""At Thales, you set your own career path. You can start out as a scientist in a research centre before becoming an engineer or a subject-matter expert, or moving into sales or management. And when you take on responsibilities, you can define the scope of those responsibilities yourself. In my case, I see myself first and foremost as a technical manager, responsible for aligning our research directions with the needs of our customers in Singapore and across the Group, and for empowering my team to flourish in their respective technical domains."" As Thales Singapore begins its 50-year anniversary celebrations, Dr Tan knows there will be some busy months ahead, but she's unfazed by the prospect. ""I think I'm in a privileged position to be working with men and women who represent some of the best talents in the industry. There is always something new I can learn each day. It's a demanding role, but I never feel overwhelmed because the environment I work in always seems so caring and supportive. When we're on a project with other teams in the Group, for example, and with Palaiseau in particular, everyone goes out of their way to adjust their schedules to the different time zones. That may seem a tiny detail, but in a Group with operations in 68 countries, it's very important!

Sebastien Lejeune is Thales Open Source Community manager.

""The web, the cloud, artificial intelligence… The chances are than none of these life-changing technologies would exist today without open source.

By breaking free from proprietary solutions, sharing knowledge, making source code freely available and allowing anyone to contribute, the open-source model stimulates innovation and has upended our vision of R&D by exploiting the concept of community development. In the space of a few years, the open source movement has evolved from a niche activity to a professional, structured environment, and today it plays a crucial role in enterprise IT strategies.

The advantage of open-source software – and now open-source hardware – is that anybody can use it to try out new concepts without needing to develop everything from scratch. Working collaboratively and transparently within a community of experts and specialised developers, we use open-source solutions on a routine basis. They make our innovations more competitive, but they also enhance the performance of our products and services and offer better protection from security risks.

More than ever before, the digital transformation is powered by open-source technologies and an increasingly popular model of participative development."""

By 2040, quantum computers could use their unprecedented computational power to decode encrypted data, incomparably threatening the security of even the best-protected communication systems. EuroQCI aims to counter that threat by developing sovereign systems to protect the communications and data assets of critical infrastructure providers and government institutions.

The longer-term objective is to create a Quantum Information Network (QIN) that will harness the phenomenon of quantum entanglement not only to guarantee communications security but also to create networks of quantum sensors and processors, which have the potential to drive exponential increases in the already outstanding performance of quantum sensors and quantum computers.

As part of this effort, Thales is breaking new ground as a member of multiple new consortia that have been set up since late 2022 in the following fields:

Quantum repeaters, with the Delft University : QIA (Quantum Internet Alliance) – led by the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands – is working to demonstrate the feasibility of connecting users in two metropolitan areas 500 km apart, using quantum repeaters, which can compensate for the loss of information via a quantum memory;

Quantum key distribution : QKISS – coordinated by Exail – and QUARTER – led by LuxQuanta – are developing Quantum Key Distribution systems to protect users' critical communications from cyberattacks.

Certification of quantum communication : PETRUS – led by Deutsche Telekom – is the official coordinator of 32 EuroQCI projects, on behalf of the European Commission. It is also developing a framework for certification and accreditation of quantum communication products and networks.

Satellite quantum communications: TeQuantS – led by Thales Alenia Space – aims to develop quantum space-to-Earth communications technologies, necessary for cybersecurity applications and future quantum information networks, through the construction of satellites and optical ground stations by the end of 2026.

Specifically, the Thales teams taking part in these projects are working to develop quantum key generation, distribution and management equipment and the associated communication encryption devices, as well as defining the architecture of these quantum communication infrastructures.

Thales operates the largest quantum physics research facilities in Europe, in partnership with the CNRS, and some 100 engineers and researchers are currently engaged in the development of the quantum solutions (sensors, communications and algorithms) that will play a foundational role in tomorrow's world. These new consortia will all benefit from Thales's multi-disciplinary expertise, in particular in the field of secure communication networks."

Along with protecting against rising phishing threats, SafeNet eToken Fusion Series helps organisations meet their compliance needs for emerging cybersecurity standards. PKI/CBA and FIDO2 are the only two authentication methods recognised as phishing-resistant by U.S. EO 14028. This expands the reach of the Thales portfolio of industry-compliant authenticators, including the IDPrime FIDO Series.

Haider Iqbal, IAM Director of Product Marketing at Thales: “Many organisations have heavily invested in PKI infrastructure to secure access to their internal resources. They want to leverage PKI to secure access to cloud based resources or move to a modern form of authentication (FIDO2) while maintaining the usage of PKI for digital signature, data encryption. The SafeNet eToken Fusion Series provides the best of both FIDO and PKI worlds, and we are thrilled to equip customers with a solution that ensures enhanced security and compliance measures for access to their Azure AD resources.”

Natee Pretikul, Principal Product Management at Microsoft, Identity and Network Access: “Supporting phishing-resistant authentication methods is core to our mission to protect users against account compromise. The Microsoft team has been hard at work to extend our Azure AD capabilities, providing support for certificate-based authentication (CBA) along with Conditional Access Authentication Strength. We are pleased to announce that, Azure Active Directory combined with Thales new phishing-resistant hybrid authenticators offer agencies and overall industry leaders an overall solution to maintain US President’s Executive Order 14028 compliance and strengthen the protection of their most sensitive data.”

Users who leverage SafeNet eToken Fusion Series and Azure AD can benefit from:

Using one single authenticator to securely access cloud apps and sign or encrypt digital documents from any desktop or mobile phone

Protecting access to modern resources that support FIDO and “legacy” resources that support CBA

Reducing the risk of data breaches by deploying phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication (MFA)

Adopting FIDO while maintaining traditional PKI use cases like qualified digital signature and file encryption

The SafeNet eToken Fusion Series is available for use today. For a demo, visit Thales’s booth # N-5369 and Microsoft’s booth # N-6044 at RSA Conference 2023 (April 24 – 27 in San Francisco, USA). For more information, visit our landing page.

Thales Researchers: Daniel Brooks - Thales,"Thu, 13 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi9ncm91cC9pbm5vdmF0aW9uL21hZ2F6aW5lL3RoYWxlcy1yZXNlYXJjaGVycy1kYW5pZWwtYnJvb2tz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales Researchers: Daniel Brooks Innovation R&D Share this article

After three years working on a doctoral thesis funded by Thales, Daniel Brooks joined the R&D department at the Group's Limours site, which specialises in radar systems and air surveillance. He tells us how he has managed to strike the right balance between a passion for research and the need to meet industrial challenges.

Half of the aircraft taking off and landing at any time around the world rely on Thales systems to ensure their safety, and the technologies developed by the Group at its Limours site make a key contribution. Located about an hour from Paris, the facility opened in 1957 and now has a workforce of over a thousand employees involved in the development and integration of air defence and surveillance radars. Daniel Brooks, 29, has worked at the site for four years, the first three as a research student, and is now an AI research engineer at Advanced Radar Concepts (ARC), an R&D department whose role is to propose new algorithmic tools and simulation interfaces to the Thales business units that design ground mobile radars, multifunction radars and other advanced systems,” explains Daniel.

Practical industrial applications

After following a conventional route through his initial studies and culminating in a first degree in telecommunications engineering, Daniel took a double research master’s at the ENS Cachan engineering school, before joining Thales to prepare a thesis entitled “Deep learning and information geometry for time-series classification”. Looking beyond its intriguing title, the thesis proposes a new method for classifying drones, which conventional techniques struggle to detect at long distance due to their small size and low speed. Conventional radar systems regularly confuse them with other moving targets, such as ground vehicles, or with atmospheric turbulence or even the beating of birds’ wings. “I didn’t define the topic myself. It was suggested by Thales, in conjunction with the MLIA (Machine Learning and Information Access) laboratory, which is part of the LIP6 computer science research unit at Sorbonne Université. But it was an ideal area for me, because I wanted to address concrete challenges, so that my work could be applied to real-world products developed by a major industrial group.”

Thales funding

David's thesis, like more than 1,500 doctoral research projects every year, qualified for France's research-based training programme (CIFRE), which aims to strengthen ties between public research institutes and the private sector. Thales financed the project in partnership with the French Defence Innovation Agency (AID), and for three years David commuted between Limours and the Sorbonne in Paris. In 2021, he was awarded the Thales PhD award, alongside two other doctoral candidates, and his logical next step was to join the ARC department's Artificial Intelligence team. ""I was one of the first on the scene,"" he says, ""and we needed to build virtually everything from scratch. It was quite an exhilarating experience!""

Ramping up for business applications

AI is widely seen as one of the disruptive technologies that is going to upend our daily lives. Today it has a central role to play in Thales's roadmap for the future, and the Group expects to incorporate AI functionality in about 100 of its products in the near term. To achieve that goal, the ""AI ramp-up to business"" initiative creates opportunities for dedicated AI researchers to interact regularly with all Thales business areas to explore ways of leveraging AI in industrial applications at scale. ""It's a good approach,"" says David. ""It was important to move up the maturity curve in terms of our AI capabilities and available talent, but we needed to do it in a structured, progressive way. Many of our competitors are rushing into these new technologies when they have no real need for them but just want to follow the latest trends. It's refreshing to see Thales adopting a much more reasoned approach to AI investment, and it's particularly encouraging to see how these AI developments are gaining traction throughout the Group. Everything seems to fit together, and there's a real dialogue between all the different sectors and businesses involved.""

A healthy professional environment

Would he encourage an engineering graduate or researcher to apply for a job with Thales? ""If they want to focus on applied research and see how months of hard work in the laboratory translate into products with practical applications, I would highly recommend a job at Thales. I have managed to find an excellent work-life balance, and I really feel I'm working in a healthy professional environment,"" concludes the young research engineer, who now lives in Igny, about 20 miles north of Limours. He does add a cautionary note, however, about working for a company that's involved in geostrategically important areas like defence. ""It comes with some strings attached,"" he smiles. ""Lots of companies involved in AI today can simply store their data or run their AI models using cloud services from the major cloud providers. But for reasons of sovereignty, Thales obviously can't depend on American servers. Unlike companies in other sectors, we need cast-iron guarantees about the integrity of our infrastructure, the confidentiality of our data and the intellectual property of our datasets and data models. It can make life a bit more complicated, but it's definitely worth it in the end!"""

First lasers, then drones and now electronic warfare systems — for Marie Antier, an engineer at the Élancourt site, Thales gives her the opportunity to work in different worlds and with a wide array of advanced technologies.

She's not a restless person by nature. “Each of my career decisions is carefully thought out,” says Marie Antier, systems engineering lead for the drones business at the Élancourt site. And in a few weeks, she’ll be joining Thales Defence Mission Systems (DMS) as a systems architect. “I’ve always needed to be stimulated intellectually. So, when I realise I’m spending more time training others than educating myself, it’s time for a change…”

Four-year cycles

For Marie Antier, 35, each career move is driven by the excitement of a new challenge and the chance to work with new technologies. After graduating from the École Centrale de Paris engineering school in 2011, she did a PhD in partnership with Thales R&T at the Waves and Matter Doctoral School (EDOM) at Université Paris-Saclay. The title of her thesis was 'Interferometric phase measurement and application to the coherent combination of a large number of amplifying fibres'. “After my doctorate, I was offered a position at the Élancourt site as a laser hardware engineer and was later appointed as a product line manager.” In December 2018, she joined the drones business. “Looking at my CV, I realise I’m making a career break every four years. At first glance, it might seem a bit odd to go from lasers to drones and then to electronic warfare, but there’s a definite pattern in my career moves. At the École Centrale, you learn to be multidisciplinary and to dare to step out of your comfort zone. For the last few years, I’ve devoted part of my time to data-driven engineering and producing critical reviews of existing research, and that has helped me to see the big picture about the Group and its activities.”

From mini-drones to Rafale self-protection

To find her next challenge, Marie Antier told her manager she was open to suggestions, but she didn’t start by browsing job offers on the intranet. “That’s not my strategy,” she says. “I network a lot and talk to other engineers and researchers at the company. It's an instinct I developed when I was doing my PhD with Thales R&T and constantly interacting with the Group’s experts.” In the last few years, Marie has been working on the Spy’Ranger mini tactical reconnaissance drone system (SMDR), which heralds a new era in automated intelligence gathering by front-line units and has been successfully deployed by the French forces on operations in Mali. “We all felt really proud when the SMDR system was first deployed in a real operational setting,” she recalls. Now she's about to join the teams working on the next evolution of the SPECTRA electronic warfare and self-protection system, which uses electromagnetic, laser and infrared technologies to anticipate and locate threats and shield the Rafale from danger.

True to her principles

“The two projects are actually closely connected. I wanted to carry on working on airborne systems, which I’ve always been passionate about, and both projects are also about defence capabilities, national sovereignty and protecting people’s lives. Before 2018, I was only working on civilian technologies, but I was well aware of the Group's other activities and I knew that Thales was no ordinary technology company. So what’s next for Marie Antier? She says she's delighted to be joining the Thales DMS team but she will always stay true to her principles – taking an interest in everything the Group is doing, staying abreast of the latest innovations and keeping her feelers out for new opportunities. “But I've stopped counting how many Thales sites there are in the Paris region,” she says with a smile. We'll check back in with her in four years for the next exciting instalment!"
Thales aiding airline clients given SITA plan to exit cabin IFC - Runway Girl Network,"Tue, 04 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMjMvMDQvdGhhbGVzLWFzc2lzdHMtYWlybGluZS1jdXN0b21lcnMtYXMtc2l0YS1leGl0cy1jYWJpbi1jb25uZWN0aXZpdHkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"French multinational corporation Thales says it is working with its airline customers to come up with “the best long-term solution for their connectivity needs” given the news that SITA is exiting the cabin IFC service business and that Inmarsat is in line to be potentially acquired by Viasat.

The revelation that SITA intends to withdraw from the space first broke at the Airline Passenger Experience Association’s APEX TECH conference in Los Angeles, and was later confirmed to RGN by Yann Cabaret, CEO of SITA For Aircraft.

Thales has a longstanding relationship with Inmarsat, having pursued a technology roadmap that tracked alongside Inmarsat’s aero service offerings, including embracing SwiftBroadband (SBB) L-band-supported connectivity for its airline clients and later Inmarsat Aviation Global Xpress (GX) Ka-band.

Notably, Thales’ TopConnect integrated connectivity/IFE solution facilitated OnAir (later SITA unit SITAONAIR) as the communications service provider.

In one example of how the three entities — Thales, SITA and Inmarsat — are intertwined on various airline projects, your author recalls that Thales in 2010 announced a rather significant SBB connectivity + nextgen IFE deal with Qatar Airways, whereby cabin connectivity was to be integrated with the IFE, and OnAir was to coordinate with Qatar Airways on the service offering. (Qatar later migrated to GX. And roughly in 2017, Inmarsat started taking a more direct approach with Qatar, obtaining a STC to retrofit the carrier’s 777s. SITA appears to still act as a service provider for Qatar, whose website refers to its inflight GSM service, for instance, as OnAir. Inmarsat and its GX service, however, have been front and center in Qatar’s most recent IFC and live television deals,)

“Obviously, we are aware of SITA’s public announcements. We have a number of airline customers that use Inmarsat GX connectivity and have a variety of relationships with Inmarsat, SITA and ourselves,” Thales InFlyt Experience chief executive officer TK Kallenbach told RGN in a statement.

“In addition, we have to be mindful of the changing landscape with Inmarsat’s possible merger with Viasat,” he said.

RGN asked Thales if it intends to transition out of being an Inmarsat GX value added reseller (VAR) itself in the commercial aviation space.

Kallenbach stated:

We take an airline-centric approach to connectivity and are working with each of our airline customers to come up with the best long-term solution for their connectivity needs in light of SITA and Inmarsat’s situation as well as emerging new technologies, solutions and aircraft OEM sponsored programs. We have no plans to exit global connectivity, but the landscape of potential offerings are certainly changing. And we want to offer the best solutions tailored to our airline customers and their passengers. We also continue to actively offer our FlytLIVE connectivity solution using the new SES-17 satellite over the Americas. FlytLIVE provides state-of-art high speed aero Ka connectivity with unrivaled inflight performance and gate-to-gate coverage. It is fully deployed with Spirit Airlines on their current fleet of A320 family of aircraft. In fact, we just celebrated our 1 year anniversary of Spirit’s full connectivity service across north, central and south America. FlytLIVE is a terrific connectivity service for single aisle aircraft operating in and across the Americas.

Asked if any of Thales’ customers have begun the transition process over to Inmarsat as ISP, an Inmarsat spokesperson told RGN:

Whilst this decision by SITA For Aircraft doesn’t impact any other VAR partnership, we continue to engage with any company impacted to ensure a smooth transition for the airlines.

Inmarsat, which continues to operate as a separate company to Viasat until the latter’s acquisition of the former is complete, stressed to RGN that it has not opted to end its GX VAR program.

“SITA For Aircraft’s decision to move out of the inflight cabin connectivity domain will not impact Inmarsat Aviation’s other VAR partnerships. This is a symptom of the increasingly competitive environment in the IFC sector, which is causing companies to reassess their strategic priorities,” said the Inmarsat spokesperson.

But will Inmarsat simply assume all 1000-plus aircraft that are fitted with SITA’s IFC (powered by Inmarsat SBB and GX) in the world fleet?

The Inmarsat spokesperson stated: “Inmarsat Aviation and SITA For Aircraft are liaising with each of the affected airlines to support a smooth transition as required, so they can continue to deliver seamless global connectivity to their passengers via Inmarsat Aviation’s award-winning solutions.”

The European Commission is presently in Phase 2 of its investigation of the proposed $7.3 billion acquisition of London-based Inmarsat by Carlsbad, California-headquartered Viasat, and has expressed concerns that the transaction may allow Viasat to reduce competition in the commercial broadband inflight connectivity market. As certain customers of SITA’s cabin IFC service migrate to Inmarsat, will this have any impact on the EC’s probe?

Meanwhile, in an interview last week with CNBC, Inmarsat CEO Rajeev Suri said he expects the merger with Viasat to receive unconditional approval from the US FCC “soon, in the next couple of months”.

Is it possible to think about innovation not as a closed loop but as an open process that thrives on input from the outside? For Daniel Glazman, VP Software Technologies at Thales, the open-source development model is the best way to encourage creativity and speed innovation. He explains why the Group is increasingly adopting open source solutions to guarantee the performance, security and maintainability of its products and services.

When we talk about open source, we think about free software or some libertarian ideal of resisting the dominance of the software giants. Has open source finally come of age?

It's been a long time since open source was considered the ugly duckling of the computer industry or just for a bunch of pirates! It became an important feature of the landscape as far back as 25 years ago. Remember that the CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) server, the first used to connect to the Internet, had an open-source licence. In 2011, Mark Andreessen, founder of Netscape, published a groundbreaking article entitled ""Why Software is Eating the World"". But he forgot to mention that it was actually open-source software that was going to eat the world! Open-source solutions are no longer the reserve of a small circle of experts; on the contrary, they are now deeply embedded in modern information systems and have come to play a predominant role in enterprise IT infrastructure.

What explains the rise in open-source solutions?

It's a natural phenomenon. Programmers have always been passionate about coding. And when they're pleased with their results, they tend to make their source code openly available, either to let other coders contribute, or simply to show off their achievements. But several events took the open-source movement into a new dimension. In 1991, a Finnish student, Linus Torvalds, took inspiration from a UNIX clone, the MINIX system created by Andrew Tanenbaum, to develop the kernel of his own operating system. The result was Linux, whose open-source code quickly attracted the interest of thousands of volunteer coders around the world. Long story short, Linux servers are now more popular by far than Windows servers. In 1997, the famous American hacker Eric Raymond published a seminal book, ""The Cathedral and the Bazaar"", in which he outlined the fundamental differences between open-source and proprietary software, with open-source software being developed horizontally (the 'bazaar'), while proprietary software is designed vertically (the 'cathedral'). Raymond concluded that it was better to publish software that is imperfect but functional, and to open it up to contributions from everyone, rather than to hold it back from users until it has reached some hypothetical advanced phase of development. This resulted in his famous motto, ""Release early, release often"", laying the foundation for the principle of rapid prototyping. When Netscape opened its browser source code a year after the publication of his visionary book, it shook the entire industry. The software world had clearly moved into a whole new ballpark.

Is cost still the main motivation for a company to use open-source solutions?

© Thales

Not necessarily. It is important to distinguish between open-source and free software. To build your information system, you can always duplicate a data repository in freemium mode with open code, but that does not mean that the accompanying support will be free. Open-source software is still less expensive than proprietary software, but that does not mean copyright is dead! The real reasons for a company to use open-source software can be found elsewhere. Participating in open-source projects, using open-source bricks in their projects and integrating 'outside' elements, allows companies to be less dependent on technology suppliers. It sets them free from proprietary ecosystems that seek to preserve revenue in a global market for digital licences and services that is concentrated in the hands of a few large companies, mainly based in the US. Remember that dependence on any outside entity constitutes a risk. With the decentralised model of software development, any company can become a software publisher itself, join a wider community and allow others to benefit from its own innovations, all of which can significantly raise the company's profile. But above all, being part of an open-source culture, with its fast-changing processes and systems, is an incredible driver of an organisation's digital transformation. Sharing, co-creation and open innovation have profoundly changed the system, making open-source software a strategic option for many companies.

What are the main open-source solutions being used today?

Open-source solutions can be found in every layer of IT, from databases to application servers and operating systems. The open-source model encourages creativity and speeds the innovation process. Open-source software has played a key role in the biggest innovations of in recent years, like cloud computing, Big Data, artificial intelligence and IoT (the Internet of Things). Companies quickly realised that community development could lead to more efficient systems. They saw that it was in their best interests to share what could be shared and to think about innovation and R&D not as a closed loop but as a process open to outside collaboration, and focused on developing IT building bricks that create value in their own right. In short, targeted use of open-source software allows companies to attract new talent and focus their resources on their core business and special strengths.

What are the benefits of open-source software in terms of security?

Just like proprietary software, solutions can be found to mitigate every risk identified in open-source software. But having access to the source code is always an additional guarantee of maintainability. You can access it at any time and make sure it has no bugs that could be vulnerable to attack, such as a buffer overflow [when a programme tries to write more data in a temporary storage area than it was designed to hold], which is still the most common flaw in system security. If a code can be read, it is much easier to put together a team to assess the risk potential, and to check all the functions to make sure they perform optimally and that there are no backdoors or other malware that could allow hackers to connect remotely. It takes more time, but it's worth the extra effort. In fact cybersecurity, independence and transparency have become key reasons for companies to move to open-source systems and components.

How is Thales participating in this revolution?

The Group developed an open-source strategy quite a long time ago. As part of its work with the Eclipse and Linux Foundations, Thales is helping to promote the adoption and implementation of free and open architectures. By sharing software bricks and expertise and leading an open-source community of experts and specialised developers through a GitHub open-source organisation, we allow our customers to benefit from our expertise so they can accomplish their most ambitious projects. For example, to connect all the stakeholders in a port, airport or land-based location, Thales completely overhauled MGI's Cargo Intelligence 5 software based on a cloud-native application making extensive use of open-source code. Similarly, to help betting operator PMU modernise its horse-race wagering systems using racehorse tracking, Thales developed a Big Data platform that is continuously updated with the latest versions of open-source components. And recently, the Group developed Gokube, a tool that facilitates laptop use of Kubernetes, an open-source platform for automating the deployment, scaling and management of application containers. With all of these initiatives, Thales is helping to set new standards and create new ecosystems.

Thales operates in sensitive markets in the defence, aerospace and maritime sectors. Doesn't open collaboration raise potential legal issues and security risks?

Some contributors are not necessarily individuals but organisations, companies or associations subject to specific regulations, which raises the question of extraterritoriality [a principle of international law according to which a State relinquishes legal jurisdiction over a part of its territory to another State or international institution]. But you can set up restricted communities where only selected contributors, filtered by nationality or European Union membership, for example, can modify the source code. The risk of malicious acts, like injecting a bug, is never zero, but remember that there are always ways to revert to a previous version of code. The possibility of sabotage can never be ruled out completely, but in open-source communities, where transparency is key, any form of malicious activity can be identified straight away. Being in an open system does not eliminate risk, but it reduces it considerably.

How is Thales involved in open-source hardware?

Open-source hardware emerged in the 2000s, when a community of engineers wanted to apply the principles of open-source software to electronics and propose designs for motherboards, components and processors that manufacturers could reproduce and modify as they wished. In 2018, Thales joined the RISC-V Foundation to help design the RISC-V open instruction set and above all to rally manufacturers and academics around a subject that is crucial for our sovereignty. By opening up electronics manufacturing to multiple actors, Europe is considerably reducing its dependence, particularly on the US, where the majority of chips are produced, while at the same time protecting itself from potential disruptions to hardware supply chains. Thales is more active than ever in this field, which has grown to an unprecedented scale in recent years. The Group is now collaborating with open-source hardware communities to design processors for critical embedded systems, particularly in the aerospace and naval defence sectors. And for the past two years, Thales has organised a national RISC-V competition, and handed awards to three teams of students in Strasbourg in the summer of 2022 for their solutions to reduce the power consumption of the CORE-V CVA6 processor. Open-source solutions for hardware as well as software are becoming more integral than ever to Thales's innovation strategy."

Chief Technical Officer Bernhard Quendt explains why innovation is playing a more central role than ever in Thales's business strategy, and how the Group is already ahead of the field in the race to develop the disruptive technologies that will transform our lives in the coming years.

In 2023, Thales was recognised for the 10th year as one of the world's 100 most innovative companies in Clarivate’s Top 100 Global Innovators™, setting a new record for a French company. What’s your reaction?

We are all immensely proud to be recognised once again for our capacity to innovate, which has never wavered over the years. In a world where crises have been coming thick and fast, we are committed to building a future we can all trust, in which technologies are harnessed to serve the public interest, to improve safety and security for all. We are convinced that, to achieve this, innovation and the technical community must continue to be the mainstays of our company and our strategy. I don’t know of any other company where researchers and engineers benefit from such freedom, while working within such a broad technical scope.

What would you say to an engineer who was thinking of applying for a job at Thales?

Joining Thales provides an opportunity to develop the innovative solutions of the future, while benefiting from excellent professional development opportunities and a good work-life balance. We now employ 33,500 engineers, accounting for almost one-third of our global workforce, 3,000 of whom are dedicated to research. Every year, we invest a billion euros in self-funded R&D, with an additional 2-3 billion euros funded by our customers. Joining Thales also means having the chance to see innovations take shape in the field, while engaging with an extremely wide array of projects, on topics as varied as maintenance activities for the Port of Sydney and microprocessors for bank cards, safe in the knowledge that all of these solutions, on whatever scale, are helping to change people’s day-to-day lives.

We are pulling out all the stops to train our engineers and mathematicians to become a leader in applications that draw on the power of quantum computing for both civil and military users

How many patents do you file every year?

We file between 350 and 400 patents each year, with 45% of our innovations directly linked to digital technologies. But it’s the quality of our patents which counts as much as the quantity. Nature magazine, for example, has recognised us as the leading European industrial company for research excellence in physics.

What, in your opinion, are the most important prerequisites for creation and innovation?

The key to a successful R&T policy is never thinking that you can do everything on your own. Thales’s strategy is based on collaboration with a broad and diversified ecosystem. We work with start-ups, SMEs, large companies, and with our customers, as well as in close partnership with research centres and public and private institutions. Our partners include the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS), the Institut Polytechnique de Paris, the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA), and Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, to name but a few. The academic world is often said to be completely cut off from industry, but we have proven otherwise a thousand times over!

Take, for example, the extraordinary success of the joint CNRS/Thales physics team led by Julie Grollier, who received the prestigious Irène Joliot-Curie prize in 2021 for advances made in the field of nano-neurons. Creating multiple partnerships, and building a collaborative ecosystem where everyone can share ideas, ensures that we move forward faster, together. Start-ups, for example, can call on Thales’s expertise to help resolve their industrial issues, while, in return, our teams get to be involved in improving and adding new functionalities to their technological breakthroughs. This kind of open collaboration is key to building win-win solutions.

Which technologies will be the focus of your development efforts in the next few years?

We will continue to consolidate our expertise in core sectors where we have long-established know-how, particularly in areas of growing importance such as radars, cameras and other sensors, petawatt lasers and digital technologies. In order to prepare for the future as effectively as possible, however, we have also needed to identify the disruptive technologies where we have to really challenge ourselves and beef up our skills. We have selected six technological domains – we call it our “six-pack” – which we believe will make the biggest difference in the world of tomorrow.



How did you define these six areas of focus?

We started by working with technical directors across the Group to identify the key new technologies of the future. We initially selected around a hundred topics, eventually narrowing them down to the final six, classed according to their short-term or long-term focus. First comes the move from cloud computing to edge computing, a key step in the gradual opening-up of critical systems, which have traditionally been isolated from the internet. Put simply, it’s about being able to transfer new software functions, safely and remotely, to embedded systems. The second key area of development focus is open source, which has transformed approaches to innovation and R&D, and has become a key driver of the digital transformation. For years now, we have been convinced of the benefits of using open-source software and hardware as much as possible, in particular to design processors which are compatible with embedded critical systems. This is a crucial issue in terms of sovereignty in the short term, given the potential for the market to break free from its dependence on chip designers and manufacturers. The third technology we want to focus on is trusted artificial intelligence, which is playing an increasingly important role in our products. Thales currently chairs France’s national Confiance.ai programme, which brings together players from industry and academia to work on ensuring the reliability of AI algorithms.

What is meant by “trusted” artificial intelligence?

Given the importance of Big Data, the Internet of Things (IoT) and cybersecurity, AI is one of the technological pillars underpinning our digital transformation. However, we are aware that the use of AI raises a number of important questions. Because Thales works in critical environments, we have to be able to meet key requirements in terms of guaranteeing the validity and explainability of the results, and in terms of security and responsibility. That means we need to develop robust, transparent AI, within a secure system that offers users interpretable models as well as access to the data used to draw conclusions. A system that meets these needs delivers understandable AI, capable of justifying its outputs, as well as ethical and responsible AI that complies with all relevant protocols and legal requirements, for example in terms of environmental responsibility. These are the key principles of our approach, which we have named “Thales TrUE AI”. It's all about developing AI that keeps human intelligence at the heart of the decision-making process.

It's also important to point out that we don’t see AI as an isolated technology. The “AI ramp up to business” initiative, for example, gives our AI researchers a chance to interact regularly with all of our business areas to ensure that advances in AI are injected into a variety of technologies to help address the issues facing the Group and its customers. This approach has brought some tremendous successes, such as the AI embedded in the payload of the OPS-SAT satellite operated by Thales Alenia Space, which opens up excellent prospects for applications in defence as well as environmental monitoring, such as real-time detection of forest fires or marine pollution events.

Each of these disruptive technologies has the potential to make the critical decision chain more reliable and more efficient by guaranteeing the accuracy, safety and security of the data involved

There's a lot of talk about the second quantum revolution and the many benefits it will offer. How is Thales positioned in this area?

Quantum technology is central to our disruption strategy, and it’s the fourth component of our “six-pack”. We know that speed is of the essence: quantum computers will soon be capable of solving problems that have so far been beyond the reach of conventional machines. We are pulling out all the stops to train our engineers and mathematicians to adapt to this paradigm shift, and we aim to become a leader in applications that draw on the power of quantum computing for both civil and military users. In the medium term, we should be ready to produce quantum sensors capable of measuring magnetic fields with 1,000 times greater sensitivity and precision than conventional sensors, whilst also being 100 times smaller.

Quantum 2.0 also allows us to completely rethink the fundamentals of cybersecurity. Thales is already positioning itself as a key player in post-quantum cryptography, with the aim of developing the capability to withstand attacks from new quantum decryption algorithms. We are ready for this revolution, just as we are fully committed to the development of 5G technologies (and the preparation of 6G), which will pave the way for the emergence of a vast IoT ecosystem capable of meeting the communication needs of billions of connected objects with data rates of up to 10 Gbps.

The final component of our “six-pack”, neurosciences, exhibits extraordinary potential in the area of brain-machine interfaces, provided that a suitable ethical framework can be established beforehand.

What is the common thread between all of these disruptive technologies?

In all its core areas of business – aerospace, defence, security and rail transport – Thales plays a central role in critical systems, where making the right decisions and taking the right actions can be a matter of life and death. Each of these disruptive technologies has the potential to make the critical decision chain more reliable and more efficient by guaranteeing the accuracy, safety and security of the data involved. Quantum sensors optimise data capture and collection. Cybersecurity, quantum communications and cloud computing take care of data transfer and storage. AI and neurosciences make data processing more efficient, helping to ensure that the best possible decision is reached within an ever shorter timeframe. Thanks to our research ecosystem and our common core of technologies, not to mention the combined talents of our engineers and researchers in 68 countries, Thales has everything it needs to push back the boundaries of what is possible and build a safer, more connected world. It certainly promises to be a fascinating ride in the years ahead!"

52% of IT professionals surveyed in India reported an increase in ransomware attacks in past 12 months, higher than global figure of 48%

82% of respondents in India who were affected by ransomware attacks experienced data loss

Less than half (48%) of enterprises surveyed in India have a formal ransomware plan

Of those who recently suffered a cloud data breach, 52% of respondents in India identified human error as the primary cause

Thales today announced the release of 2023 Thales Data Threat Report, its annual report on the latest data security threats, trends and emerging topics based on a survey of nearly 3000 IT and security professionals in 18 countries. This year’s report found an increase in ransomware attacks, and increased risks to sensitive data in the cloud.

Half of IT professionals surveyed in India believe that security threats are increasing in volume or severity with 52% reporting an increase in ransomware attacks. The figure from India is higher than the global figure of 47% of IT professionals believing that security threats are increasing in volume or severity, while 48% indicated an increase in ransomware attacks.

More than a third (38%) of respondents in India (37% globally) have experienced a data breach in the past 12 months, including 23% (22% globally) reporting that their organisation had been a victim of a ransomware attack.

Respondents identified their cloud assets and IoT devices as the biggest targets for cyber-attacks. 53% of respondents in India said that their IoT devices were the biggest targets, followed by Cloud-based storage (41%) and Cloud delivered applications (SaaS) (40%). At the global level, 28% respondents said SaaS apps and cloud-based storage were the biggest targets, followed by cloud-hosted applications (26%) and cloud infrastructure management (25%). The increase in cloud exploitation and attacks is directly due to the increase in workloads moving to the cloud as 75% of respondents globally said 40% of data stored in the cloud is now classified as sensitive compared to 49% of respondents in 2022.

These are just a few of the key insights from the 2023 Thales Data Threat Report, conducted by 451 Research, which surveyed both private and public sector organisations. It reveals how businesses are responding and planning their data security strategies and practices in light of a changing threat landscape and the progress they are making to address threats.

Human error and the impact of ransomware

Simple human error, misconfiguration or other mistakes can accidentally lead to breaches – and respondents identified this as the leading cause of cloud data breaches. For those organisations that have suffered a data breach in the past 12 months, misconfiguration or human error was the primary cause identified by 52% of respondents in India and 55% globally. This was followed by the exploitation of a known vulnerability (21% in India as well as globally), and of a zero day / previously unknown vulnerability (21% in India and 13% globally). The report finds that identity and access management (IAM) is the best defence, with 28% of respondents globally identifying it as the most effective tool to mitigate these risks.

Meanwhile, the severity of ransomware attacks appears to be declining, with 35% of 2023 respondents globally reporting that ransomware had a significant impact compared to 44% of respondents reporting similar levels of impact in 2022. The global spend is moving in the right direction too, with 61% reporting (in India and globally) they would shift or add a budget for ransomware tools to prevent future attacks – up from global figure of 57% in 2022 – yet organisational responses to ransomware remain inconsistent. Only 48% of enterprises in India (nearly same as 49% globally) reported having a formal ransomware response plan, while 82% (67% globally) still report data loss from ransomware attacks.

Addressing the challenges of digital sovereignty

Digital sovereignty is becoming more top of mind for data privacy and security teams. Overall, the report found that data sovereignty remains both a short- and long-term challenge for enterprises. 82% (nearly same as 83% globally) expressed concerns over data sovereignty, and 44% (55% globally) agreed that data privacy and compliance in the cloud has become more difficult, likely due to emergence of requirements around digital sovereignty.

Emerging threats from quantum computers that could attack classical encryption schemes are also a cause for concern for organisations. The report found that Harvest Now, Decrypt Later (“HNDL”) and future network decryption were the greatest security concerns globally from quantum computing – with 62% and 55% reporting concerns respectively. While Post Quantum Cryptography (PQC) has emerged as a discipline to counter these threats, the report found that 62% of organisations globally have five or more key management systems, presenting a challenge for PQC and crypto agility.

Ashish Saraf, VP and Country Director, Thales – India, comments: “Enterprises continue to see a serious threat landscape in India and globally. The findings of our report indicate good progress is being made in certain areas, including Multi-Factor Authentication adoption and increased use of data encryption. However, there is still a lot of security gaps regarding data visibility. In an increasingly cloud-first world, where cloud based storage is being perceived in India as one of the biggest target for cyber-attacks by the report, organisations must maintain better control over their data so they can serve their stakeholders with greater safety and trust. With half of the organisations surveyed in India observing an increase in cyber-attacks, businesses need to focus on implementing robust security measures to protect against.”

Thales is an IT consultancy specializing in defense and security, aeronautics and space, and digital identity and security.

Protecting Against Cyberattacks From Quantum Computers

The EuroACI aims to develop a quantum communication architecture for EU member states within three years. The goal of the initiative is to secure European infrastructures against cyberattacks from quantum computers in the not-so-distant future.

In less than 20 years, Thales and others believe that quantum computers could leverage their computational power to decode encrypted data and threaten sophisticated communication systems. EuroQCI intends to counter that threat by developing the ultimate systems to safeguard the communications and data assets of critical infrastructure providers and government institutions, Thales said.

The longer-term objective of the initiative is to create a Quantum Information Network (QIN) that not only will guarantee communications security but also create networks of quantum sensors and processors, which could drive exponential increases in the performance of quantum sensors and quantum computers, according to Thales.

The Thales teams taking part in these projects are working to develop quantum key generation, distribution and management equipment and the associated communication encryption devices, as well as defining the architecture of these quantum communication infrastructures.

Quantum Security Innovations

Along those lines, Thales is a member of multiple new consortia that have been set up since late 2022 in these domains:

Thales Alenia Space Gears Up For Seventh Spacebus Neo Launch - Aviation Week,"Mon, 17 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9kZWZlbnNlLXNwYWNlL3NwYWNlL3RoYWxlcy1hbGVuaWEtc3BhY2UtZ2VhcnMtc2V2ZW50aC1zcGFjZWJ1cy1uZW8tbGF1bmNo0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"CANNES, France—Thales Alenia Space has matured technologies and production processes for its Spacebus Neo all-electric telecommunications satellite platform, to maintain competitiveness with low-Earth-orbit constellations.

A SpaceX Falcon 9 is planned to launch Indonesia’s Satria—the seventh spacecraft using the Spacebus Neo—into geostationary transfer orbit this summer. Common modules make design and assembly easier, while leaving room for customization.

The Indonesian government did not want any unproven technology, says Marc Courbin, Thales Alenia Space’s Satria program manager.

The first Spacebus Neo was launched in 2020, a few months before Thales Alenia Space signed a contract with operator SNT, a single-purpose vehicle created for Indonesia’s PSN internet provider. That country’s government will buy services from SNT.

Satria is using the fifth generation of Thales Alenia Space’s digital transparent processor, which can quickly adapt traffic to the needs of the moment.

“Think of it as a giant hub,” says Cyril Baud, who is responsible for Satria’s assembly, integration and testing at Thales Alenia Space’s manufacturing facility here. Moreover, for weight reduction, the number of parts produced with additive-manufacturing techniques (in aluminum or titanium) has increased, Courbin says.

The satellite will distribute 150 Gbps in Ka-band over 116 user spot beams. PSN’s mission is to provide schools and other national infrastructure in rural areas and remote places with broadband internet, says Nia Asmady, PSN’s satellite project manager. The number of “service points” in the archipelago expected to benefit from Satria is targeted at 150,000, she notes.

For the Spacebus Neo family, the production cycle has been shortened faster than planned thanks to a swift learning curve, Courbin says. It now stands at two years, down from five years for a more conventional design, he emphasizes.

Satria will be operational in orbit late this year, for a life expectancy of 15 years. It weighs 4.6 metric tons (10,100 lb.) in launch configuration with a full load of xenon in the electric propulsion system’s tanks. It is 7.6 m (22 ft.) high, and its solar array is 44 m long. The satellite is undergoing the final phases of testing before being shipped to Cape Canaveral for launch.

The program is worth €540 million ($587 million) including the ground segment—which Thales Alenia Space partly supplies—and financing, Asmady says. Relying on a low-Earth-orbit constellation would have been too expensive and ground antennas too complex for Indonesia’s use case, she explains. Use of a geostationary satellite thus was found to be the most cost-effective option.

The exhibition at the Musée de l'Armée des Invalides in Paris (from 12 October 2022 to 29 January 2023) dedicated to Special Forces gives us the opportunity to revisit the success story of the BONIE HP, the night vision goggles used by the special forces, these land, sea and air commando units whose extreme missions require the most high-performance equipment in the most demanding ergonomics. Designed and produced at the Thales site in Saint-Héand (France), the Thales centre of excellence for dismounted combatant optronics, they regularly contribute to the success of operations.

From the statement of need by the Special Operations Command in 2014 to the serial production in 2018 to the deployment in the units, discover the behind-the-scenes success story of the BONIE HP NVG.

In this video Damien Bajard - former SF in charge of equipment and innovation - gives us a rare testimony on the operational benefits of the BONIE NVG.

“The most important thing for a special forces operator is to have full confidence in his equipment to carry out these missions, and this is what the BONIE NVG has to offer both in terms of optics and ergonomics. Having exchanged with other special forces units around the world, we can underline that the JVN Bonie is among the best night vision equipment in the world.” Damien Bajard"
JACKAL drone fires Thales missile in unmanned air combat milestone - Airforce Technology - Airforce Technology,"Mon, 17 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmZvcmNlLXRlY2hub2xvZ3kuY29tL25ld3MvamFja2FsLWRyb25lLWZpcmVzLXRoYWxlcy1taXNzaWxlLWluLXVubWFubmVkLWFpci1jb21iYXQtbWlsZXN0b25lL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The JACKAL drone system. Credit: Thales.

The JACKAL drone system is capable of a range of combat missions over land, sea, and air and has completed a first trial firing of a Thales Lightweight Multirole Missile (LMM), bringing unmanned air combat a step closer to reality.

The JACKAL drone capability has been developed by UK-based Flyby Technology, with Turkish partners FlyBVLOS Technology and Maxwell Innovations providing design engineering and prototyping to fill a recently discovered gap in modern combat operations.

As a vertical take-off and landing platform, JACKAL is designed to satisfy several roles including Battlefield Air Interdiction, Close Air Support, engaging helicopters in flight, killing tanks, and denying the use of runways and roads.

The trial, sponsored by the Rapid Capabilities Office (RCO) of the Royal Air Force, involved teams from Flyby and technology giant Thales, which also manufactures the LMM. Within six weeks, they built two operational JACKAL aircraft and successfully fired two LMMs.

Air Commodore Jez Holmes, head of the RAF RCO, said, “Given the impressively short time scale it took the team to deliver the initial trial, it is clear that Flyby could have an exciting future in this sector, and the partnering and support from Thales was outstanding in lowering the barriers to entry for innovative start-ups.”

The aircraft takes off and lands vertically, which is an advantage over traditional fighter jets as there is no need for vulnerable runways. JACKAL can operate from hidden locations such as woods and urban built-up areas.

The JACKAL team is now developing plans for the productisation of the capability while the aircraft is undergoing other enhancements and tactical development. With the completion of the trial, the JACKAL drone has taken a step towards being able to carry out complex, unmanned air combat missions.

Thales has also delivered milestones on other projects such as the UK’s Type 31 Inspiration class frigates, with a successful NS110 radar surveillance system test as the UK and Thales strengthen.

Last month, Thales announced that the UK would see a significant jobs boost as part of a major global expansion. The French company announced it would create 1,000 new jobs in the country as part of a broader global push. Thales also reported 5.5% organic growth in sales for FY22."

Experts from French defense giant Thales announced on Tuesday that they, alongside members of the ESA team, will provide an in-depth explanation of the attack scenario at the CYSAT conference in Paris.

The exercise was planned before the release of a tranche of highly classified U.S. intelligence documents, one of which warned that China is developing similar capabilities to seize control of what it assesses to be hostile satellites.

The document, which was first reported by the Financial Times, suggests that China intends to surpass the traditional form of communications jamming that blocks signals between satellites and terrestrial terminals.

Instead the attackers would mimic the operator signals, potentially enabling them to “seize control of a satellite, rendering it ineffective to support communications, weapons, or intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance systems,” stated the document.

The demonstrative hack was specifically organized for the CYSAT conference to provide an example of the consequences that real-world cyberattacks could have on civilian systems in space.

It targeted ESA’s OPS-SAT, a nanosatellite about the size of a shoebox that was launched in December 2019 and contains “an experimental computer ten times more powerful than any current ESA spacecraft.”

The point of OPS-SAT is to address the risks involved in live testing mission control systems. Thales stated that ESA retained access to the satellite’s systems throughout the exercise so it could return to normal operation afterwards.

“This unprecedented exercise was a chance to raise awareness of potential flaws and vulnerabilities … [and] to improve the cyber resilience of satellites and space programmes in general, including both ground segments and orbital systems,” said Pierre-Yves Jolivet, the vice president of cyber solutions at Thales.

Although the full nature of the Thales demonstration is not yet clear, the company says its team was able to hijack a number of systems used to operate the demonstration satellite in what appears to be a traditional cyberattack.

The company said its ethical hackers exploited the satellite’s “standard access rights to gain control of its application environment” before then exploiting vulnerabilities and introducing malicious code to the satellite’s systems.

“This made it possible to compromise the data sent back to Earth, in particular by modifying the images captured by the satellite's camera, and to achieve other objectives such as masking selected geographic areas in the satellite imagery while concealing their activities to avoid detection by ESA,” said Thales.

The demonstration comes as space cybersecurity in general has received more attention from experts. A U.S. government-backed panel recently urged the Biden administration to designate space as a critical infrastructure sector."

The second quantum revolution has the potential to upend the world of sensors as we know it… provided that practical industrial applications can be found for these new technologies... Bertrand Demotes, VP Key Technical Domain Hardware, outlines how this will be achievable.

© Thomas Béhuret

Alain Aspect, winner of the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics for his pioneering work on photon entanglement, referred to the “second quantum revolution” when he described the vast potential for innovation unlocked by recent advances in quantum physics. Is this new paradigm also about to revolutionise the world of sensors as we know it?

Quantum physics dates back over a hundred years, and it’s important to understand that many objects that we use today in the field of metrology* – such as transistors, chips for computers and mobile phones, lasers, hard disks, and global positioning devices – are directly descended from the discoveries made in the wake of the first quantum revolution. In fact, all of the electronic and optronic devices that power our information society rely on the disruptive technologies unleashed by advances in quantum physics. The applications that arose out of that first wave, however, only apply these new laws to objects that are “large” in microscopic terms, because they make use of large quantities of atoms or particles. A laser, for example, emits huge volumes of photons, while the operation of a transistor depends on applying a current to enable clouds of electrons to flow in one direction or another. About forty years ago – Alain Aspect’s work on quantum entanglement goes right back to 1986 – scientists realised that it was possible to manipulate a small number of particles, or even single particles, for example by trapping a single electron or a single ion, or by controlling the emission of pairs of photons. This ability to seek out the individual effects of matter, rather than relying only on mean (or average) effects, theoretically opens the door to a whole new world of innovations which could exploit other aspects of quantum physics. It offers huge potential in my area – sensors – provided that all this scientific learning can be turned into concrete applications we can produce on an industrial scale.

So as things stand at the moment, innovation in quantum sensors is more a matter for engineers than researchers?

In a field as demanding as quantum physics, we obviously do need to rely on the fundamental science. At Thales, we devote a great deal of energy to fundamental research. In almost twenty years of existence, our laboratory at Palaiseau, for example, has built a global reputation for its work on future quantum sensors. It's a crucial part of the equation, and it enables our teams to benefit from the huge amount of academic research that has been carried out on the topic and pass it on to the engineers responsible for developing real products. Innovation, whether in the field of sensors or any other area of industry, is less about making major scientific breakthroughs and more about finding practical applications and developing viable products for our markets. In the quantum world, identifying use cases is, in many ways, almost as complicated as the scientific research itself.

Which technologies are the most likely to find viable use cases first?

© Thomas Béhuret

We have identified a dozen or so different technologies with the potential to open up new opportunities. Not all of them are at the same level of maturity, but three technologies that we are keeping a close eye on stand out from the rest. The first relates to what are known as NV (nitrogen-vacancy) centres in diamonds. In simple terms, this technology involves making use of a defect in the atomic lattice of the diamond to trap systems of particles within the crystalline structure itself. This mechanism, which is by nature very stable, potentially paves the way for the development of new types of sensors, for example to measure magnetic fields on a nanometric scale. This is one of the aims of the ASTERIQs pilot project led by Thales.

Another area we are interested in is cold atom technology, which involves isolating particles in a vacuum cell** so they can be cooled down and held in place using pairs of lasers. This enables us to create what we call a Bose-Einstein condensate, which behaves as a single quantum object, from which we could create the atomic-scale equivalent of a laser inertial navigation system***. The many potential applications of this technology include navigation systems which are not dependent on global positioning, and which could be used in space exploration, or even for guiding fleets of driverless cars. But first there is an issue of size that needs to be overcome: how do we scale down the experimental cold atom laser system, which currently needs to be housed in a chamber measuring around 7 cubic metres, to fit in a package of just a few cubic centimetres that could be incorporated into a device?

Our third priority sector is SQIFs (Superconducting Quantum Interference Filters). This technology is more mature than the others, and could be the first to find concrete applications.

How do SQIFs work, and what could they be used for?

SQIFS are interference filters relying on the laws of quantum physics that govern superconductivity. They use a type of magnetometer known as a SQUID (Superconducting Quantum Interference Device), which has been the focus of intensive research and experimentation for several decades. SQUIDs rely on a phenomenon known as the Josephson Effect, and are capable of detecting extremely weak magnetic fields when cooled to temperatures close to absolute zero. Analysing the measurements provided by these tiny cells is a long and difficult process, but the signal can be amplified and is less ambiguous when several SQUIDs are arranged in series. At Thales, we have developed a method for combining a thousand SQUIDs to produce a SQIF, which offers a combination of benefits such as very high sensitivity to magnetic waves, compact design and wide frequency coverage. SQIFs are therefore a very good alternative to conventional antennas, particularly at long wavelengths, where larger-sized devices are required. The many potential applications of SQIF antennas include long-range communication systems for submarines, which use very long wavelengths. In this field in particular, these new quantum sensors are extremely promising.

What are the major challenges that need to be overcome to allow these second-generation quantum sensors to break through into our day-to-day lives?

Understanding the technology behind quantum sensors is clearly a crucial first step and a vital prerequisite for any project. Important as it is, however, this stage only accounts for a small proportion of our work on next-generation sensors. Once this foundation is in place, we have to build everything else. These devices start life on laboratory workbenches, operating under experimental conditions, but the big challenge is to convert them into industrial products that we can manufacture at scale for specific uses. It means getting engineers and researchers from a wide range of specialisms and scientific disciplines to work together – and Thales has a great deal of experience in doing just that. Indeed, one of our distinctive strengths is the ability to combine the capabilities of experts from different fields to move a project forward. Our production facility at Châtellerault, for example, with its world-class capabilities in gyrolaser manufacture, owes its success to the ability to get experts in vacuum technology, electronics, diodes, lasers and other fields to work together. We aim to recreate this type of ecosystem to help us develop the first concrete applications based on quantum sensors.

We already have many of the critical skills right here at Thales. In cooling systems, for example – key to the development of SQIFs – we can draw on over 25 years of experience in the development and manufacture of very similar systems that we use for our infrared sensors.

For young graduates and researchers, joining Thales is a unique opportunity to work in a multi-disciplinary environment and challenge everything they took for granted. It's a chance to ask endless questions and learn how to think about things differently. In the promising new field of quantum sensors, history is in the making – and we’re writing the next chapters. And that’s what’s make it so fascinating!

SonoFlash is a new-generation A-size sonobuoy developed to meet a French Navy anti-submarine warfare (ASW) requirement. As well as forming part of a broader effort to re-establish a sovereign industrial capability in sonobuoy design and manufacture, the programme is also growing an ‘ecosystem’ of small and medium enterprises – such as TELERAD, SelhaGroup and Realmeca – to support local production.

Unlike other sonobuoys on the market, which are either active or passive in operation, SonoFlash offers both modes by integrating a high-powered transmitter and a passive low-frequency directional receiver into a single acoustic buoy. This dual modality is intended to increase tactical flexibility, reduce the overall number of sonobuoys needed in a field, and open up opportunities for multistatic operation.

The SonoFlash is being showcased next to a CAPTAS-4 VDS to highlight the fact it is a family of system that can enable multistatic ASW operations.

Following feasibility studies in 2016, Thales was awarded a contract by France’s Direction générale de l’armement (DGA) in January 2021 for the full development, qualification, and production of SonoFlash. Qualification is planned by late 2024, with the French Navy planning to field SonoFlash on modernised Atlantique ATL2 maritime patrol aircraft and NH90 Caïman helicopters.

Thales and DGA have already completed a number of key test and trials events ahead of completing formal qualification. Trials were performed in the Mediterranean in May 2022 to verify the mechanical deployment of the SonoFlash acoustic antennas after water entry. More recently, DGA has worked with Thales to measure and characterise the acoustic performance of the SonoFlash buoy at the DGA range facility located in a lake in the Alps.

While the French Navy is the launch customer for SonoFlash, Thales sees international sales as essential to drive volume production. As well as dispense from helicopters and maritime patrol aircraft, the company believes the compact size of SonoFlash will find a market for deployment from unmanned air vehicles and unmanned surface vessels.

What is quantum computing, and what problems will it help us solve? David Sadek, Doctor in Computer Science, and VP, Research, Technology & Innovation at Thales, specifically in charge of Artificial Intelligence & Information Processing, outlines the progress made and the possibilities ahead.

Quantum computers exploit the quantum properties of matter to carry out computing tasks, and they're expected to revolutionise the world of computing as we know it. But in terms of practical applications, what impact will these new machines have in the coming decades?

Quantum computing is more than just a technological breakthrough – it’s a completely new way of seeing computing in the conventional sense of the term and will give us unprecedented problem-solving and data analysis capabilities. The supercomputers currently used by mathematicians carry out processing tasks on the basis of bits, in other words series of 1s and 0s. A bit has either the value 1 or 0, but cannot have both values at the same time. Quantum computers use quantum bits, or qubits, units of information which, according to the laws of quantum physics, can be in both states – 1 and 0 – simultaneously. Like Schrödinger’s cat*, this state of quantum superposition allows computation to be performed simultaneously for all of the ""superposed"" states of a qubit. Given that the number of computations that can be carried out grows exponentially with the number of qubits used, we can see that a computer capable of handling a large number of qubits would have unprecedented power to address the kind of problems that were previously unsolvable using a conventional approach, or that could only be partly solved after years of computation. Quantum supremacy – the point at which a quantum computer becomes capable of solving problems that no conventional machine could ever solve – will be the next paradigm shift. It will be a real game changer in the world of computing, and like the digital revolution that preceded it, it will open the door to applications that simply didn't exist before.

Given that quantum computers capable of handling a large number of qubits are still at the prototype stage, how do we prepare for this transformation?

Scientists established the mathematical principles behind this new type of computer long before quantum computers themselves were developed. The first quantum algorithms, designed to leverage the properties of qubits, have been in existence since the 1980s. The Deutsch algorithm, for example, provided the first indication, on a theoretical level, that a quantum computer could one day outperform a conventional computer. Shor's algorithm, which is used for finding the prime factors of an integer, was developed in 1994. Since then, it has come to be seen as a threat – theoretical for the time being, yet nonetheless critical – to public key cryptography systems, which are routinely used in cybersecurity applications, often without users being aware, to protect banking transactions such as credit card payments.

To be part of the coming quantum revolution, we first need to understand the fundamental science behind it. This is why Thales is adapting to this new paradigm in computing to produce a new generation of algorithm developers who are capable of comprehending the IT world in quantum terms – something that requires a fundamental change of mindset. It’s also important to understand that quantum computers capable of handling a sufficiently large number of qubits to achieve quantum supremacy – the Holy Grail of the quantum revolution – may only be at the prototype stage today, but machines with the capacity to run quantum algorithms already exist, so the first concrete use cases are well and truly on the table.

Which technologies are giving us a foretaste of the new world of quantum computing?

© Thales

They fall into two main categories. First, there are the machines and technologies that exploit the quantum phenomena themselves, such as cold atoms, ion traps, superconducting loops, photon polarisation, etc. Even though the computers which harness these phenomena are currently only capable of handling a small number of qubits, they can be used to run quantum algorithms, so the first proofs-of-concept** (PoC) for real use cases can be developed straight away, and applications could emerge by 2030. For example, a French start-up called Pasqal, which is one of the many companies Thales is working with in this field, is developing a PoC using an actual quantum computer based on cold atom technology, which could soon provide a practical solution for banking security applications.

The second category is emulators, which simulate the operation of a quantum computer on a conventional machine so we can implement quantum algorithms and study their performance today. The problem is that emulating a qubit on a conventional machine requires a significant amount of computing power, and the power requirements will rise exponentially as more qubits are added.

Even though these two types of technology only provide a foretaste of the capabilities of future quantum computers, they give us important insights into how the machines will work. That means we can already imagine new uses – which will clearly evolve over time – and get to grips with a technology that will go mainstream in the not-too-distant future. We’re a bit like skiers practising on an artificial slope while we're waiting for the start of the winter season so we can get out onto some real snow!

How will Thales position itself in the race to develop quantum computers?

We’re not aiming to become a manufacturer of quantum computers. But we have significant know-how in key enabling technologies, and this could potentially position us in the supply chain for the future machines. The challenge for a company like ours is to develop practical solutions within the extremely broad field of possibilities opened up by quantum computing. Our objective is clear: we aim to be a pioneer in the development of applications that harness the new possibilities of quantum computing at scale, for both civil and military users, and a leader in the design of the quantum algorithms needed to implement these applications. To achieve this, we will be expanding our capabilities in three key areas simultaneously: the algorithms themselves, by producing a new generation of algorithm developers with expertise in the specific approaches and formalisms used in quantum computing; deployment of actual quantum machines, where Thales is already recognised as one of the only companies in France that can help to benchmark the various quantum computers already in existence; and the software tools that will be needed to take quantum computing into the mainstream and make it accessible to users with less expert knowledge of the underlying theory. By ramping up our capabilities in all these areas and making them available to all the Group's businesses, we will be able to use quantum computing to help solve practical problems in real-world applications that cannot be solved by conventional machines and algorithms.

What type of problems could be solved by quantum computing?

At Thales, we take a pragmatic approach. Our first step has been to identify the practical challenges to applications in our areas of business that could be overcome by quantum computers when conventional supercomputers reach the limits of their capabilities. Then we classified those practical challenges into six categories of problems that quantum computers could solve: (1) combinatorial optimisation, which involves finding the best option from a large number of possibilities, a classic algorithmic conundrum frequently illustrated by the “travelling salesman problem”***); (2) resolution of linear systems (including differential equations), which could have potentially beneficial applications in the field of electromagnetism; (3) so-called Monte Carlo methods, which are based on the principles of random sampling and can be used for large-scale testing or probabilistic simulations; (4) quantum machine learning, which is at the intersection of artificial intelligence and quantum technology and involves using quantum computers to optimise neural networks; (5) testing cryptographic resistance to decryption by quantum algorithms; and (6) the highly promising field of quantum simulation of matter at molecular level, for example to determine the behaviour of a given chemical or to synthesise new molecules.

In all these categories, whenever quantum algorithms and quantum computing could provide new ways of solving problems, we are exploring possible applications in all our areas of business.

Can you give us any concrete examples of applications that Thales has started to explore using quantum algorithms and quantum computing technologies?

Combinatorial optimisation algorithms are among the most likely to benefit from quantum technology, and we recently launched a PoC relating to a mission planning solution for satellite constellations. To coordinate the movements of satellites, operators have to manage large numbers of parameters and interactions. Even with a small group of satellites, this can quickly create so-called NP-hard problems****, i.e. problems that cannot be solved in a reasonable timeframe by a conventional algorithm, no matter how much computing power is used. In a simulation combining a quantum algorithm with conventional techniques, we have already demonstrated the feasibility of the solution for a small number of satellites, which suggests we could solve the mission planning problem for larger constellations. We are also testing quantum approaches to electromagnetic simulation in radar antenna design, for example using an HHL algorithm (named for its inventors, Harrow, Hassidim and Lloyd) to solve linear equations. Another example is the use of ""quantum machine learning"" algorithms to expose cyberattacks and for anomaly detection in images.

Will quantum computing eventually replace conventional IT as we know it today?

It's hard to be sure. What we do know is that a new family of computers will be needed to solve certain problems, such as quantum simulation of matter, which are beyond the computation capabilities of our current machines. We also know for certain that quantum computers will not take over from traditional computers overnight. There will be a long transition, and during this intermediate phase computation tasks will be performed using hybrid solutions that combine high-performance computing (HPC) by conventional supercomputers with the use of quantum processor units (QPUs). In conceptual terms, this hybrid approach is anything but simple, because the tasks to be assigned to the quantum processor and the conventional computer will have to be identified for each operation. It will also be a challenge in terms of the range of skills that the engineers working on these systems will require. But we believe a hybrid approach offers the best opportunities for using quantum algorithms and quantum computing techniques to develop solutions at scale, probably for engineering in the broad sense of the term in the first instance, and then for the development of real-time applications. This is the route that Thales has decided to take.

*Schrödinger's cat is a thought experiment in quantum mechanics that was proposed by physicist Erwin Schrödinger in 1935. The experiment involves a cat in a sealed box with a vial of poison that may or may not be released depending on the state of a subatomic particle. If the subatomic particle is in a superposition of states, the cat would be both alive and dead until the box is opened and the state of the particle is determined.

**A Proof of Concept is aimed at demonstrating that a new idea or product is feasible and can be implemented in practice.

***The travelling salesman problem, a classic mathematical conundrum, has been the focus of extensive research over the years. It continues to be used today, for example as an introduction to computational complexity theory, which focuses on the time and memory required for an algorithm to solve a given problem. The travelling salesman problem can be summarised as follows: given a list of cities to be visited by a salesman, with the distances between each pair of cities being known, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city once and returns to the point of departure? Despite this simple definition, the problem is a complex one: the number of possible routes rises exponentially as the number of cities on the salesman’s route increases. To visit 7 cities, for example, there are a total of 360 possible routes. With 15 cities, the number rises to around 43 billion. If we apply the question to a list of 71 cities, the total would be 5*1080, roughly equivalent to the number of atoms in the universe. A conventional computer would quickly be overwhelmed by this phenomenon, known as a combinatorial explosion, and would be forced to suggest approximate solutions, due to the vast amount of time that would be required to compute all the different possibilities. A number of algorithms developed in recent years have proposed using quantum computing to solve the problem more efficiently. Running such algorithms on a suitable machine would finally enable our travelling salesman to find his ideal route – but they could also be used to optimise telecom networks, bus routes or logistics operations.

****In computational complexity theory, NP (non-deterministic polynomial time) is a complexity class used to classify decision problems. NP-hard problems are particularly difficult to solve."
JACKAL drone launches Thales missile in RAF trial - The Engineer,"Tue, 18 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWVuZ2luZWVyLmNvLnVrL2NvbnRlbnQvbmV3cy9qYWNrYWwtZHJvbmUtbGF1bmNoZXMtdGhhbGVzLW1pc3NpbGUtaW4tcmFmLXRyaWFsL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A UK-developed drone system has fired a Thales missile as part of a trial sponsored by the Royal Air Force, in what is claimed to be a ‘significant milestone’ for unmanned air combat.

The JACKAL drone platform is the work of Flyby Technology, a UK startup founded by former RAF and Royal Navy fighter pilot Jon Parker. An engineering team from Flyby and Thales worked together on a rapid six-week turnaround to build two JACKAL drones capable of firing the Thales Lightweight Multirole Missile (LMM). In a video published by Thales, the VTOL aircraft can be seen taking off vertically while tethered to the ground, before cutting to the drone launching an LLM at a test target a few metres away.

According to Flyby, JACKAL can replicate the capabilities of attack helicopters and fighter jets at a fraction of the cost and with minimum risk. As a VTOL aircraft, it can also operate from locations such as woods and built-up urban areas, negating the need for vulnerable runways.

“The days of having a fighter pilot in the cockpit are numbered and I realise I will not perhaps be loved for bringing about the end of my own kind,” said Jon Parker, Flyby Technology founder and CEO.

“But the future of warfare is changing and JACKAL is part of that future as a true multi-role attack aircraft. We want to make JACKAL a flagship product, creating secure UK jobs and contributing to a new future for the British aerospace and defence industries.”

According to Thales, Flyby Technology was asked to brief the RAF’s Rapid Capabilities Office (RCO) on their new drone system in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Flyby then contacted Thales in Belfast - where the LMM is designed and manufactured - to explore the possibility of firing it from JACKAL in a trial. Thales accepted the challenge, eager to demonstrate for the first time that the LLM could be fired from a drone platform.

“One of the unique selling points of LMM is its ability to be integrated onto multiple platforms, including armoured vehicles, helicopters, naval vessels or indeed, shoulder-launchers, each designed to address different threats,” said Philip McBride, managing director of Thales in Northern Ireland.

“It has been a privilege to work with the Flyby team on this time-compressed and ground-breaking trial and has proved that both Thales and Flyby can produce impressive and agile results when focussed on a collective, shared objective.”

The JACKAL team is now working on plans for productionising the capability whilst the aircraft undergoes further development."
VERTIGO Concluded With Telecom Data Transmission On A Laser Link At Record High Power - Space Ref,"Thu, 13 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VyZWYuY29tL25ld3NwYWNlLWFuZC10ZWNoL3ZlcnRpZ28tY29uY2x1ZGVkLXdpdGgtdGVsZWNvbS1kYXRhLXRyYW5zbWlzc2lvbi1vbi1hLWxhc2VyLWxpbmstYXQtcmVjb3JkLWhpZ2gtcG93ZXIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"VERTIGO Thales Alenia Space

Thales Alenia Space, the joint venture between Thales (67%) and Leonardo (33%), and its partners are pleased to announce that the VERTIGO project has concluded with the successful demonstration of a high-power optical data transmission system at the Thales laboratory in Palaiseau, France.

This is a key success for the development of future geostationary communication satellites using optical feeder links to increase significantly the capacity currently available. These solutions will play a key role to bridge the digital divide and provide broadband connectivity for all by 2025. The objective is also to boost satellites capacity in order to reduce the number of satellites required to meet the users demand.

In this frame, Thales Alenia Space, Thales, G&H and Leo Space Photonics R&D demonstrated the generation and transmission of optical communication signals carrying data at 25 Gbps in a controlled environment at a record breaking optical power of 97 W opening the way to 100W-class transmissions. This was achieved by splitting a modulated optical signal into two paths, each amplified through an individual state-of-the-art G&H high power amplifier, and then coherently combining the two amplifier outputs. This was an opportunity not only to demonstrate high and very high optical power generation but also to prove the possibility to transmit telecom signals at very high power while maintaining data integrity, a necessary condition for use in free-space optical links over long distances.

Following the outdoor trials of free-space optical links in Summer 2022, which notably demonstrated a record transmission at 1 Tbps over an atmospheric optical path of 53 km, the laboratory test campaign performed in Thales facilities concludes the VERTIGO project with a new record.

Capitalizing on the results of the VERTIGO project, the next step will be to target a full-scale coherent laser link between a geostationary satellite at an altitude around 36.000 km and a ground station.

Next generation satellite systems will play a key role to bridge the digital divide and offer broadband connectivity for all by 2025. In this context, optical feeder links are considered as a very promising technology to meet the future VHTS system requirements. VERTIGO ambitions to pave the way towards very high throughput satellite systems and contribute to maintain EU technological leading edge and industry competitiveness.

About the H2020 VERTIGO project

VERTIGO (Very High Throughput Satellite-Ground Optical link) is a H2020 collaborative project, launched on June 1st 2019 and completed at the beginning of 2023, demonstrating concepts allowing for a significant capacity increase of feeder links through the use of state-of-the-art optical technologies. VERTIGO address the key enabling technologies (high optical power generation, high efficiency waveforms, atmospheric impairments mitigation) for the implementation of high-throughput optical links and assess them in ground indoor and outdoor demonstrations thanks to a fully complementary consortium composed of CREONIC GmbH, ETH Zürich, Fraunhofer HHI, G&H, LEO Space Photonics R&D, ONERA, Thales Alenia Space in France and Switzerland and Thales Research & Technology.

South Africa ex-President Zuma's graft trial postponed again - The Associated Press,"Mon, 17 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2phY29iLXp1bWEtY29ycnVwdGlvbi10aGFsZXMtc291dGgtYWZyaWNhLTkzZDQxODg5YmIzNGEzZjZhMjJhOTcxYzMyNzZmZTA10gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — The corruption trial of former South African President Jacob Zuma was postponed again Monday as he seeks to have the lead prosecutor removed from the case by claiming he is biased.

Zuma has already succeeded in getting a new judge to oversee his trial.

Zuma, who turned 81 last week, has argued that prosecutor Billy Downer is biased against him and compromises the former leader’s right to a fair trial. Zuma is involved in a separate legal case against Downer and a journalist over the leaking of the ex-president’s medical records by state prosecutors.

Zuma is facing multiple counts of corruption, as well as racketeering, fraud, tax evasion and money laundering, with some of the charges relating to bribes he is alleged to have taken from French arms manufacturing company Thales to provide political protection for an arms deal worth more than $1 billion signed by the South African government in 1999.

Thales, which was then known as Thomson-CSF, is a co-defendant in the corruption trial.

The charges relate to a time when Zuma was a politician on the rise and later a deputy president of South Africa, but before he became president in 2009. He was forced to resign as president in 2018 because of corruption allegations.

Some of the alleged wrongdoing dates back as far as the mid-1990s, yet Zuma only went on trial two years ago after the charges were dropped and reinstated multiple times amid political interference.

Despite the trial officially starting in May 2021, no testimony has yet been heard because of a series of applications made by Zuma to get the initial judge to recuse himself and to remove Downer.

Judge Nkosinathi Chili, the new judge, said Monday that the case would resume on Aug. 15 and 16, when Zuma’s lawyers and prosecutors will present their arguments over whether Downer should remain on the case.

Zuma faces a minimum of 15 years in prison if he is convicted of involvement in major corruption. He pleaded not guilty to all charges.

The case is highly politically sensitive in South Africa given the support Zuma still holds in parts of the country and the influence he has retained within the ruling African National Congress party.

Deadly rioting and looting broke out and more than 300 people were killed in a week of unrest when Zuma was sentenced to a 15-month prison term in 2021 for contempt of court in relation to another corruption inquiry. Zuma was released early from that jail sentence on medical parole.

The riots were the worst civil unrest in South Africa since the end of the apartheid system of white minority rule in 1994.

The satellite headed over to the port of Savona, Italy, then boarded a ship that is taking it to the port near its launch site in Cape Canaveral, Florida.

The ship is expected to reach its destination at the beginning of May, getting ready for launch no earlier than this July on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Florida, USA.

Euclid will travel 1.5 million km from Earth, in the opposite direction to the Sun, to the Lagrange point L2. From there, ESA's Euclid mission will begin the detective work of exploring the dark Universe.

Euclid will create the largest, most accurate 3D map of the Universe ever. It will observe billions of galaxies out to 10 billion light-years, across more than a third of the sky.

With this map, Euclid will reveal how the Universe has expanded and how large-scale structure has evolved over cosmic history. And from this, we can learn more about the role of gravity and the nature of dark energy and dark matter."
JACKAL Drone Fires First Lightweight Multirole Missile - The Defense Post,"Tue, 18 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRlZmVuc2Vwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA0LzE4L2phY2thbC1kcm9uZS1maXJzdC1taXNzaWxlLWZpcmUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Thales lightweight multirole missile (LMM) has been fired from a JACKAL aerial drone for the first time.

Sponsored by the UK Royal Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office, the test was part of an initiative to explore unmanned air combat advancements.

Within six weeks of launch, the project produced two operational JACKAL drones and demonstrated two LMM live fires.

Thales and JACKAL developer Flyby Technology are working with Turkish unmanned solutions providers FlyBVLOS Technology and Maxwell Innovations on the effort.

“Given the impressively short time scale it took the team to deliver the initial trial, it’s clear that Flyby could have an exciting future in this sector, and the partnering and support from Thales was outstanding in lowering the barriers to entry for innovative start-ups,” Rapid Capabilities Office Head Air Cdre. Jez Holmes said.

Flyby’s JACKAL Drone

The JACKAL is a vertical take-off and landing vehicle capable of close air support and battlefield air interdiction operations.

The drone can engage in-flight helicopters and tanks. It can also protect airfields and roadways against adversaries.

The JACKAL can deploy from vulnerable runways and remote sites such as woods and built-up camps.

“War is about winning, and JACKAL is designed by war fighters for that ultimate aim,” Flyby Technology CEO Jon Parker stated.

“The future of warfare is changing and JACKAL is part of that future as a true multi-role attack aircraft. We want to make JACKAL a flagship product, creating secure UK jobs and contributing to a new future for the British aerospace and defence industries.”

Thales LMM

The LMM is a precision strike multirole missile designated for tactical missions on land, sea, and air.

The weapon can intercept targets such as armored vehicles, fast inshore attack vessels, and autonomous airborne systems. Its warhead consists of blast fragmentation and sharped charge effects for effective threat neutralization.

In the UK Royal Navy, the LMM is operated as the Martlet lightweight missile.

“One of the unique selling points of LMM is its ability to be integrated onto multiple platforms… to address different threats,” Thales Northern Ireland Managing Director Philip McBride explained."
Florida has spent $1.5 million developing smartphone ID apps that hardly anyone is using - Tech Xplore,"Wed, 05 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaHhwbG9yZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIzLTA0LWZsb3JpZGEtc3BlbnQtbWlsbGlvbi1zbWFydHBob25lLWlkLmh0bWzSAUtodHRwczovL3RlY2h4cGxvcmUuY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMy0wNC1mbG9yaWRhLXNwZW50LW1pbGxpb24tc21hcnRwaG9uZS1pZC5hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies .

Are we ever going to be able to leave our driver's licenses at home and use a smartphone app if pulled over by police?

It's an enticing idea—one that has been under discussion by Florida lawmakers since 2014, just a few years after Apple and its competitors introduced smartphones.

But apparently the future is not yet here. Although apps allowing wireless transmission and capture of digital driver's license data have been available for download from Apple and Android stores since November 2021, few police agencies or businesses in Florida have adopted the technology.

Because Florida law still requires drivers to carry the physical plastic versions of their driver's licenses, some users who have downloaded the app complain that it's of little use.

Since 2020, Thales Defense & Security, a Maryland-based subsidiary of French technology contractor Thales Group, has been working with the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles (FHSMV) to develop a platform called Florida Smart ID for use by motorists and police in traffic stops, by customs officials at border security checkpoints, and by businesses, such as liquor stores and groceries, that require proof of age to purchase alcohol and other restricted products.

Thales has been paid about $1.5 million of a $1.8 million contract and is currently working on phase two of the project—expansion of the app for storage of vehicle registrations and proof of insurance.

The way it works is supposed to be simple: A user downloads the app, creates an account and gets their license validated by connecting to the FHSMV. If used during a traffic stop, the driver and officer will authorize data sharing through a wireless ""digital handshake."" The user's phone will generate a QR code that will enable the officer to obtain the user's license information from a department server.

Sharing information with businesses works in a similar way, but users can opt out of sharing data not relevant to the transaction. For example, to get into a bar, a user can choose not to share data fields revealing their address, weight, height, or gender.

At Apple and Android app stores, Florida Smart ID apps are available for drivers, businesses and law enforcement agencies.

According to the FHSMV, there were 17.9 million licensed drivers in the state as of February.

Through March 9, the driver's license app had been downloaded 142,803 times from the Apple and Android stores. Businesses downloaded the proof-of-age verifier app from the two platforms 11,828 times, and law enforcement agencies downloaded the app they need to wirelessly receive driver license data 3,795 times.

Of the 154,631 downloads, more than 95,000 apps have been activated, according to the department.

But the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles doesn't know who is actually using the app, spokeswoman Molly Best said. ""We cannot determine which law enforcement agencies or businesses are using the app (that information is not collected in the app stores),"" she said by email.

Thales Defense & Security did not respond to an email Friday asking how many businesses and police agencies are using the platform.

Users report difficulties

Each of the three apps are rated two of five stars by Apple store users. Several users complained that it doesn't work with Apple Wallet. Others said they had difficulty activating the app or getting it to scan their physical driver's license. Some had trouble taking the required selfie.

One commenter reported in January showing to bouncers at clubs and bars, ""and they have no idea it exists."" The same user reported showing it to law enforcement agencies ""at all levels,"" including city police, sheriff's departments, the Florida Highway Patrol and the federal Transportation Security Administration ""and none know what it is, let alone have QR scanners to read the apps' QR code verification function.""

The complaint was followed by one identified as ""Developer Response"" pointing out that ""Acceptance by businesses is still limited as the (apps) continue to be tested, but we are looking forward to expanding acceptance soon.""

Another user apparently lives in an area where local police have adopted the technology, though the area was not identified. ""I've been stopped many times by cops and would hand them my phone with Smart ID,"" the user said.

Best attributed some users' difficulties to a misunderstanding of how the system works. ""It's a two-part system,"" she said by phone. ""You have to download it, and there has to be someone using the verification app for it to be effective.""

Through the end of 2022, the department has conducted 29 presentations and/or demonstrations of the technology to businesses, law enforcement agencies, state agencies, industry associations, safety coalitions and the general public, Best said, adding, ""We are currently working to identify more audiences for 2023 outreach efforts.""

Asked for a list of the 29 attendees, Best cited six: the Florida Highway Patrol, the Florida Police Chiefs Association, the Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco Division of the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation, Walgreens, AAA and RaceTrac.

The South Florida Sun Sentinel reached out to local law enforcement agencies and a few large retail businesses that sell alcohol and asked if they are using the platform.

Police agencies holding off on adoption

The Fort Lauderdale Police Department, Coral Springs Police Department and Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office responded and said they are not using it.

""FLPD is aware of this new program but we do not currently use it,"" said Ali Adamson, public information officer for the Fort Lauderdale Police Department. ""We will continue to monitor the updates and future use of the program is possible.""

Coral Springs Police Capt. Gerald Irwin said, ""A member of our Traffic Unit has attended a demonstration that the FHSMV conducted. There are no immediate plans to adopt the system. We currently do not provide officers with the devices needed to install the app.""

Irwin said the department would consider looking into the program in the future.

The Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office isn't using the program, either, spokeswoman Therese Barbera said by email. Whether the agency might adopt it in the future is ""unknown at this time,"" she said, ""as it is a requirement by law to show your driver license. If the law changes, then we may adopt the system.""

Similarly, Publix is ""aware of the Florida Smart ID program"" but has not attended demonstrations, media relations manager Lindsey Willis said. ""We continue to evaluate the technology for future consideration.""

Several other businesses and law enforcement agencies, including Broward Sheriff's Office and Miami-Dade Police Department, did not respond to inquiries in time for this report.

In addition to the requirement that users still carry their plastic driver's license, another possible barrier to wider adoption is the need for verification apps to be housed on smartphones, said Mark Rasch, an attorney specializing in cybersecurity and data privacy for the Ohio-based law firm Kohrman Jackson Krantz.

""Whose cell phone at 7-Eleven do I pull out to [verify an age]?"" Rasch said in an interview. ""My personal phone or the store's phone? It's probably my personal cell phone but the app has to be validated as registered to the store.""

That could raise privacy concerns for employees who have to install the app, he said.

Similarly, police would have to install the apps on their personal phones, or their departments would have to purchase separate phones for them. According to Best of the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, the Florida Highway Patrol is currently distributing phones to troopers across the state in preparation for the agency's use of the license verifier.

Competing standards a problem

Another impediment is the absence of standard technology enabling use of the apps across state lines, Rasch said. Various states are developing apps that communicate in different ways.

For example, Arizona, Colorado and Maryland have apps that store digital licenses in iPhone's Apple Wallet. Others use technology developed by Mobile ID. Still others created their own apps.

The absence of a single standard renders the technology less useful for frequent travelers or in states, such as Florida, that get a lot of visitors.

A pilot program by the federal Transportation Security Administration allowing travelers to present a digital ID to move through airport security checkpoints requires users to have their IDs uploaded to their Apple Wallets. Florida, with no Apple Wallet tie, does not participate, even though Miami International Airport is one of 13 airports selected for the pilot.

Besides, the TSA wants travelers to have their driver's licenses with them anyway, travel website The Points Guy reported.

States will likely have to agree on a national standard, such as the Real ID standard adopted by the federal government in 2005 for physical driver licenses, before motorists will be allowed to leave their plastic cards at home, Rasch said.

""Law enforcement agencies need to be able to read driver licenses of everybody,"" he said.

Best said the FHSMV has been talking with other states that have or are developing mobile driver's licenses ""to encourage nationwide adoption.""

But she said, ""There's always going to be a requirement to have your [physical] driver license with you.""

More than 80 European companies were involved in the making of Euclid, with Airbus Defense and Space delivering the payload module encasing visible near-infrared sensors. The pair of instruments were developed by an international consortium led by the Paris Astrophysics Institute (IAP).

Euclid was originally planned to launch on a Russian Soyuz rocket from Europe's spaceport in French Guiana, but Russia's invasion of Ukraine brought an end to the launch agreement."
UK military trials Jackal 'attack drone' firing Thales Martlet missiles - Flightglobal,"Wed, 19 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vZGVmZW5jZS91ay1taWxpdGFyeS10cmlhbHMtamFja2FsLWF0dGFjay1kcm9uZS1maXJpbmctdGhhbGVzLW1hcnRsZXQtbWlzc2lsZXMvMTUyOTE1LmFydGljbGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) has conducted a milestone live-firing trial involving a small remotely piloted air system created by start-up developer Flyby Technology.

Named Jackal, the vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft was used to fire two Thales-produced Martlet lightweight multirole missiles (LMMs) during a tethered test.

The MoD announced details of the effort in mid-April, but Flyby confirms that the test activity was conducted last October.

“Following the [February 2022] invasion of Ukraine, Flyby Technology was asked to brief the Royal Air Force’s [RAF’s] Rapid Capabilities Office [RCO] on the new drone system,” the company says. “Thales accepted the opportunity to work with Flyby to be the first to fire LMM from a drone in flight,” it adds.

“Just six weeks after getting the call, the combined teams successfully fired two LMMs,” Flyby says. The company built two air vehicles within the same period to support the activity.

Headed by chief executive and ex-RAF fighter pilot Jon Parker, the company developed the Jackal with design engineering and prototyping support from Turkish companies FlyBVLOS Technology and Maxwell Innovations, and performed earlier flight-testing at a dedicated range in the country.

Flyby has identified a wide range of potential applications for what it describes as the “attack drone”, including “battlefield air interdiction, close air support, engaging helicopters in flight and killing tanks, to denying the use of runways and roads”.

“Given the impressively short timescale it took the team to deliver the initial trial, it’s clear that Flyby could have an exciting future in this sector,” says Air Commodore Jez Holmes, head of the RCO. “The partnering and support from Thales was outstanding in lowering the barriers to entry for innovative start-ups,” he adds.

“This time-compressed and ground-breaking trial has proved that both Thales and Flyby can produce impressive and agile results when focussed on a collective, shared objective,” says Philip McBride, managing director of Thales in Northern Ireland, where the Martlet round is produced.

“The future of warfare is changing, and Jackal is part of that future as a true multi-role attack aircraft,” Parker says. “We want to make Jackal a flagship product, creating secure UK jobs and contributing to a new future for the British aerospace and defence industries.”

“The Jackal team is now developing plans for productionising the capability, whilst the aircraft is undergoing other enhancements and tactical development,” Flyby says. It adds that it is “now seeking UK manufacturing partners to build Jackal at scale”.

The company says it has also received interest in its VTOL aircraft from nations including Iraq, Taiwan and Ukraine."

Flyby wants to market its JACKAL drone system to nations in need of an affordable alternative to attack helicopters or jets. The drone can take off and land vertically and features a modular architecture to change its payload depending on the mission.

The Thales Lightweight Multirole Missile is also known as the Martlet missile within the Royal Air Force. Its design allows it to be launched against a wide range of targets from various naval, air, and land platforms.

The missile experienced its baptism of fire in Ukraine. It was used both from MANPADS and from the Stormer HVM short-range air defense system to destroy Russian air targets."
ESA - ESA developing Space-Based Solar Power plant plans - European Space Agency,"Mon, 17 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzYS5pbnQvRW5hYmxpbmdfU3VwcG9ydC9TcGFjZV9FbmdpbmVlcmluZ19UZWNobm9sb2d5L1NPTEFSSVMvRVNBX2RldmVsb3BpbmdfU3BhY2UtQmFzZWRfU29sYXJfUG93ZXJfcGxhbnRfcGxhbnPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Enabling & Support ESA developing Space-Based Solar Power plant plans 17/04/2023 11721 views 74 likes

ESA has signed contracts for two parallel concept studies for commercial-scale Space-Based Solar Power plants, representing a crucial step in the Agency’s new SOLARIS initiative – maturing the feasibility of gathering solar energy from space for terrestrial clean energy needs.

Space-Based Solar Power for Earth's energy needs Due to be completed before the end of 2023, the parallel contracts are being led by Arthur D Little and Thales Alenia Space Italy, respectively. These concepts will serve as an up-to-date reference for the overall SOLARIS effort, guiding the scope of specific R&D activities that will follow. The idea behind Space-Based Solar Power is to gather solar power where it is available continuously and in plentiful supply, up in Earth orbit, unperturbed by local weather or darkness, then send it down wirelessly to Earth where it is needed. The concept complements rather than competes with terrestrial renewables, because Space-Based Solar Power can make power available reliably on an ongoing 24/7 basis, providing much-needed stability to the electricity grid as the share of intermittent renewables continues to increase, reducing dependence on large-scale storage solutions.

Solar power, going down SOLARIS was approved at the ESA Council at Ministerial Level in November 2022 as part of Element 1 of the existing General Support Technology Programme. Working with European industry, its goal over the next two and a half years is to undertake studies and technology developments to assess the benefits, implementation options, commercial opportunities and risks of Space-Based Solar Power as a contributor to terrestrial energy ‘NetZero’ decarbonisation for Europe. Results from SOLARIS should allow Europe to make an informed decision by the end of 2025, on proceeding with a full development programme for commercial-scale Space-based Solar Power, beginning with a subscale in-orbit demonstrator to beam power from space to Earth.

SOLARIS: Preparing for Space-Based Solar Power

“These contracts are for the first European concept studies of Space-Based Solar Power for more than 20 years, so today marks an important step,” notes Sanjay Vijendran, ESA’s lead for SOLARIS. “We are really starting from a blank sheet of paper to get an up-to-date design for what working solar power satellites could look like, sourcing promising ideas from everywhere we can, and leveraging the latest advancements in space and terrestrial technologies”. The system studies’ blank sheet approach extends to the methodology of beaming down solar power from orbit, Sanjay explains: “The studies will look at as wide a range of options as possible, including investigating all the different ways to move the energy, safely and efficiently, down to Earth: radio frequency transmission, lasers and simply reflecting sunlight down to solar farms on the ground.

Previous solar-power satellite design “And we are happy that we have major energy players like the French electricity utility ENGIE and the Italian utility ENEL, included as members of the study consortiums, reflecting the potential value the energy sector is already seeing in this capability for the future. It’s important that we engage the energy sector right from the start of this development and listen to their needs, so we know from the beginning that we are building something that end users will want and use.” Unusually for system concept studies at an early phase, these are being implemented by ESA as though they are flight projects, with a rapid pace and strict milestones, because their results will dictate the follow-on studies planned for a sub-scale demonstrator mission as well as research projects into specific key technologies that SOLARIS will support.

Receiving rectenna on the ground The two studies are funded by ESA’s Preparation element, part of the Agency’s Basic Activities, that supports new ideas in space missions and technology. Additionally, SOLARIS funding for technology R&D projects will be made available through ESA’s long-running General Support Technology Programme. “These activities demonstrate the importance of ESA’s Preparation element in supporting ambitious ideas to become a reality,” says Leopold Summerer, heading ESA's Advanced Concepts and Studies Office. “Preparation-funded activities help ESA assess the interest from European industry in novel topics and lay the groundwork for future research and technology development to make them happen.” SOLARIS is taking place at a time of growing global interest in energy from space. In the US, Caltech’s Space Solar Power Demonstrator satellite was launched into orbit in January to test key technologies including space-space microwave transmission of solar energy. Japan plans to fly a demonstrator mission in 2025, while China has its own demonstrator planned for 2028, with a ground-based wireless power transmission test facility already in place. Meanwhile the UK government has been in discussion with Saudi Arabia to supply its Neom smart city region with carbon-free electricity from space.

Preparing Caltech's Space Solar Power Demonstrator satellite “There are a lot of fundamental reasons why Space-Based Solar Power is looking a lot more feasible and desirable than ever before,” adds Sanjay. “These include the reduced cost of launch to orbit with the advent of reusable launchers, the reduced cost of satellite hardware through mass production – seen with new constellations such as Starlink and OneWeb – and trends towards very modular solar power satellite designs. ""In addition, space robotics and in-space assembly and servicing technologies have really come a long way in the last two decades, which will be essential for the construction and maintenance of solar power stations. Finally, the sheer challenge of transitioning to Net Zero within the next 25 years with existing technologies – and the consequences of not doing so – demands exploration of alternative solutions that could help make sure we achieve our goal.” For more information on SOLARIS, click here.

GlobalData’s “The Global Naval Vessels and Surface Combatant Market” report claims that the UK also has ongoing plans to modernize its naval fleet. In this regard, the UK MoD has awarded contracts for five Type 31 general-purpose frigates and eight Type 26 Global Combat Ships, which are expected to replace Type 23 frigates by the mid-2030s.

Speaking about the milestone, Gerben Edelijn, vice president of Thales Above Water Systems, said: “The Type 31 programme is very important to Thales, and we are proud to play such a pivotal role in it. This factory acceptance test demonstrates our commitment to delivery in accordance with specification.”

The Type 31 Inspiration-class frigates are a new generation of warships being built for the Royal Navy. They are designed to provide a flexible, adaptable, and affordable platform for maritime operations, from high-end warfighting to humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.

James Marques, aerospace, defence, and security analyst at GlobalData, said the Type 31 would be adaptable in the future, allowing for future upgrades: “If you have a slightly cheaper and easy-to-operate design like the 31, which should come with much off the shelf technology, then it can be used for ‘lighter’ duties like anti-piracy and patrolling. I can imagine, however, it will learn from recent construction lessons and be highly modular with space for later upgrades.”

Babcock International, the prime contractor for the Type 31 programme, is responsible for the overall design and construction of the frigates. Thales is one of the critical suppliers of mission-critical systems and equipment, including the NS110 radar.

“The success of this milestone is very important to the T31 enterprise. We’re proud to be part of this national endeavour and to be providing mission-critical systems to our customers,” Alex Cresswell, CEO of Thales in the UK, stated."
Thales and Schiebel to Deliver Innovative Uncrewed Rotary Aircraft Solution to Royal Navy - defenceturkey.com,"Wed, 12 Apr 2023 12:14:06 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZWZlbmNldHVya2V5LmNvbS9lbi9jb250ZW50L3RoYWxlcy1hbmQtc2NoaWViZWwtdG8tZGVsaXZlci1pbm5vdmF0aXZlLXVuY3Jld2VkLXJvdGFyeS1haXJjcmFmdC1zb2x1dGlvbi10by1yb3lhbC1uYXZ5LTU0OTfSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Date: Issue 121 - April 2023

International navies now find themselves increasingly threatened by a range of hostile platforms, often in congested maritime environments. The ability of an uncrewed rotary aircraft that can launch quickly and then provide long-range mission endurance and the ability to find, fix, track, and identify targets will bring additional protection for the ship and its crew, providing them invaluable time to prepare and respond.

Thales will act as the lead systems integrator for the program that brings together an unrivaled combination of proven UAS capability from Schiebel and a range of high-precision intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance sensors and systems from Thales."
Inmarsat Government completes cross-country demos of L-TAC service – SatNews - SatNews,"Tue, 11 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5zYXRuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA0LzExL2lubWFyc2F0LWdvdmVybm1lbnQtY29tcGxldGVzLWNyb3NzLWNvdW50cnktZGVtb3Mtb2YtbC10YWMtc2VydmljZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Inmarsat Government recently completed cross-country, multi-site demonstrations of Inmarsat’s L-band Tactical Radio (L-TAC) service. The multi-site demonstration was conducted from Inmarsat Government’s headquarters in Reston, Virginia, as well as locations in Colorado Springs, Colorado and Fort Liberty, North Carolina.

The demonstration proved the ability of L-TAC to augment existing DoD UHF SATCOM capabilities globally by scaling to a large number of users over a vast coverage area. This includes the ability to extend all L-TAC nets to dislocated, major headquarters locations that could be located anywhere in the world using digital, RF-Over-IP technology.

The L-TAC service delivers global, satellite-based, Beyond-Line-Of-Sight (BLOS) communications at fixed sites and Communications-On-The-Move (COTM) for Ultra High Frequency (UHF) and Very High Frequency (VHF) radio users.

Delivered via Inmarsat’s ELERA L-band network, the L-TAC capability works across multiple radio manufacturers and on new or legacy radios to enable seamless communications across radios built to operate BLOS or non-BLOS, using the same keys, waveforms or even in the clear.

During multiple live demonstrations, Inmarsat Government and its partners showcased L-TAC functionality and interoperability using six differing radio types provided by partners L3Harris, Thales Defense and Security, Inc., and Collins Aerospace.

L3Harris demonstrated the ability to operate L-TAC via its embedded L-TAC software operating on the L3Harris AN/PRC-163 and AN/PRC-167 radios as well as using the Spectra Group Slingshot applique operating on the AN/PRC-117G radio. L3Harris also supported an L-TAC data net demonstration which showcased Android Team Awareness Kit (ATAK) functionality across all three demonstration sites.

Thales Defense and Security, Inc. provided multiple AN/PRC-148 radios operating with Spectra Group L-TAC appliques in support of the demonstration operating in both plain and cypher text mode across all three demonstration sites. Thales Defense and Security, Inc. supported a plain text demonstration of the Collins Aerospace ARC-210 aero radio – successfully demonstrating interoperability between the air and ground domains utilizing its AN/PRC-148 radio.

Collins Aerospace showcased the AN/PRC-162 Networked Communications Ground Radio and the ARC-210 aero radio at the Reston, Virginia demonstration site. The Collins Aerospace demonstration included air to ground domain operations, and the ability to extend L-TAC BLOS communications to an additional AN/PRC-162 radio operating in SINCGARS mode.

Demonstration participants experienced how L-TAC, enabled by Spectra Group’s easy to use and highly reliable Slingshot capability, allows UHF and VHF to communicate with each other seamlessly. All partner companies highlighted how L-TAC creates a unique, high-performance solution that can augment the existing Department of Defense (DoD) UHF legacy SATCOM system and its replacement constellation, the Mobile User Objective System (MUOS).

Government users also glimpsed the latest L-TAC innovation that allows global service on demand, providing them with rapid and responsive service activation, as well as digital RF-based, radio frequency over Internet protocol (RFoIP) to support remote operation of L-TAC channels globally.

“U.S. Government and Allied customers are actively utilizing L-TAC to support their missions on land, in the air and at sea around the world. These live demonstrations provide us with the opportunity to showcase our newest innovative solutions and highlight how these capabilities scale to accommodate customers’ real-world operational challenges, today and in the future. We are grateful to our partners at L3Harris, Thales Defense and Security Inc., Spectra Group, and Collins Aerospace for their support and participation in this demonstration.” — Walt Moffitt, Chief Architect, Inmarsat Government"
RAF-sponsored Jackal VTOL UAV Fires LMMs - European Security & Defence,"Wed, 19 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vZXVyby1zZC5jb20vMjAyMy8wNC9uZXdzLzMxMDk0L3JhZi1zcG9uc29yZWQtamFja2FsLXZ0b2wtdWF2LWZpcmVzLWxtbXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"An innovative new vertical take-off-and landing (VTOL) unmanned aerial vehicle called the Jackal has successfully conducted firing trials with Thales Lightweight Multirole Missiles (LMMs).

The trial, which actually took place in October 2022 but was only publicly revealed on 17 April 2023, was sponsored by the Royal Air Force’s (RAF’s) Rapid Capabilities Office, while the Jackal was designed and developed by UK-based Flyby Technology, with Turkish partners FlyBVLOS Technology and Maxwell Innovations providing design engineering and prototyping expertise and Thales providing the LMMs.

According to Thales, within a demanding six-week window this team was “able to build two operational Jackal aircraft and successfully fire two LMMs in an impressive demonstration of agile teamwork”.

Electrically powered, the Jackal can take off, hover and land vertically using four sets of twin contra-rotating propellers, but it also has a 5 m wingspan and four wing-mounted ducted-fan motors for forward flight. The UAV has a fuselage that is about 2.3 m long, into which are mounted two launch tubes for LMMs. These Thales-built missiles are 1.3 m long, weigh just 13 kg and can be launched from a variety of tactical platforms on land, sea or in the air, with a first-stage motor allowing the missile to emerge from its launch tube without recoil and travel to a safe distance before the second-stage ignites.

LMMs travel at Mach 1.5, have an operational range of at least 6 km and use laser-beam-riding guidance to accurately strike a range of conventional and asymmetric threats, such as static installations, armoured vehicles, fast in-shore attack craft, helicopters and UAVs.

With such a potent offensive capability mounted on a very compact VTOL platform, the Jackal UAV thus promises to be truly transformational, given that it could operate from hidden locations in woods or built-up areas.

With the LMM firing trials having taken place in October, ESD asked the Flyby Technology CEO, Jon Parker, where the Jackal programme is now headed.

“We’re now being asked to plan for production at scale,” he replied on 18 April, although he could not talk specifically about contractual agreements with the RAF or UK Ministry of Defence (MoD).

Asked when the Jackal capability could be deployed, Parker said, “It could be ready in six months, but a more realistic figure is 12 months, although a form of capability could be ready in weeks if needed. The problem is not the technology; it’s the means of scaling production.”

Parker explained that the model under which the Jackal capability is being developed is an example of a situation where the UK MoD moving away from large prime contractors, which have the means to produce at scale but are not very agile, towards a model where the primes instead support the small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in their ability to rapidly innovate. “Some primes have really embraced that,” he said.

“We work in six-week surges and then we rest; we don’t do the long, turgid ‘five years for development’ thing,” said Parker, “but SMEs can’t scale to manufacturing in one stride, so at some point you have to join forces with a prime.”

Noting how some large defence companies in the past have tended to ‘gobble up’ the SMEs working with them, Parker warned that “You should only dance with those that don’t step on your toes.”

Parker was not at liberty to disclose where the Jackal capability was headed, but he did note that it was “to plug a capability gap”; it could reasonably be surmised that this gap is in Ukraine. The Thales press release on Jackal’s LMM firing trials, at any rate, noted that Flyby Technology was asked to brief the RCO on Jackal “following the invasion of Ukraine”.

“This capability allows forces to engage enemy lines of communication and material at range in areas where you wouldn’t traditionally risk higher value assets,” said Parker. “Jackal is also highly adaptable, multi-role and modular, so in the morning it could be doing ISR and in the afternoon it could be killing tanks.”

The Jackal is also “a fraction of the price of platforms with a similar capability”, Parker added. “It’s a cheap, attritable but devastatingly capable platform.”

The Jackal concept of operations would see it procured in the hundreds, Parker explained, although he noted that the VTOL UAVs would still be flown by pilots.

“Even if they weren’t armed, we would still choose to fly the aircraft with pilots,” he said, given the intensive nature of operating UAVs. Full use would be made of autonomous take-off and landing capabilities, while two pilots per UAV would take control to execute the actual mission.

"Thales to build cybersecurity hub, hire 110 people in Fredericton with government funding - BetaKit - Canadian Startup News","Mon, 24 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vYmV0YWtpdC5jb20vdGhhbGVzLXRvLWJ1aWxkLWN5YmVyc2VjdXJpdHktaHViLWhpcmUtMTEwLXBlb3BsZS1pbi1mcmVkZXJpY3Rvbi13aXRoLWdvdmVybm1lbnQtZnVuZGluZy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The hub will also house Thales’ North American cybersecurity centre.

French multinational tech company Thales Group has announced plans to establish a hub in Fredericton, with financing from federal and provincial government agencies to build the facility and hire local talent.

The Fredericton hub is expected to hire over 110 workers upon completion. It would represent Thales’ second National Digital Excellence Centre (NDEC) globally, which helps businesses test and develop digital transformation projects. The new centre would also include the company’s North American cybersecurity operations..

The NDEC in Fredericton would also build on Thales’ existing presence in Atlantic Canada, as it opened an office in Halifax in 2018.

“Thales will not only create value for its partners and customers, but also grow its Atlantic workforce.”



According to Thales, the Fredericton NDEC will be a place for small businesses, academia, and the regional ecosystem at large to collaborate, and develop cyber skills as well as partnerships. It is being established in partnership with economic development agency Ignite and the University of New Brunswick (UNB)’s digital technology hub, The McKenna Institute.

The federal government, through Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency (ACOA), is supporting the new centre through two separate contributions: $1.8 million to develop cybersecurity and digital resilience programs for businesses at the UNB, and $1.2 million to support Ignite in the design and establishment of the NDEC Fredericton facility.

Opportunities NB, which is New Brunswick’s economic development agency, is giving Thales a payroll rebate of up to $5.5 million over five years to support the company’s hiring goals.

Thales designs and develops electrical systems and equipment for the aerospace, defence, transportation, and security industries. Headquartered in France, Thales has over 77,000 employees across five continents. It built its first NDEC in Wales.

Thales has delivered projects in cities throughout Canada, including Ottawa’s O-Train Confederation Line, as well as Toronto’s Finch LRT.

The Fredericton hub would build on Thales’ existing network of tech facilities in Canada. In 2017, the company launched an AI centre in Montréal, which was built in collaboration with Mila, the Vector Institute, and IVADO.

“Thales will not only create value for its partners and customers, but also grow its Atlantic workforce,” said Pierre-Yves Jolivet, vice president of cyber defence solutions at Thales. According to Jolivet, Thales aims to increase opportunities for STEM education through “numerous student opportunities and a new cyber range to support access and development of advanced cybersecurity capabilities.”

FRAND: Improved outlook for implementers in the U.K. and U.S. - Allen & Overy,"Thu, 06 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsbGVub3ZlcnkuY29tL2VuLWdiL2dsb2JhbC9uZXdzLWFuZC1pbnNpZ2h0cy9wdWJsaWNhdGlvbnMvZnJhbmQtaW1wcm92ZWQtb3V0bG9vay1mb3ItaW1wbGVtZW50ZXJzLWluLXRoZS11ay1hbmQtdXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Implementers often feel that the deck is stacked against them in SEP litigation, with allegations of hold-out being levelled at them in every available forum, but an interesting new development promises to give them more power to bring matters to a head when negotiations have reached a stalemate.

The best way for an implementer to obtain a license, and to do so on good commercial terms, is by commercial negotiation. However the parties often cannot agree and so a deadlock is reached. The implementer’s options in these circumstances are quite limited, especially when the SEP-holder is a non‑practicing entity. However the U.K. Court has recently added a weapon to the implementer’s arsenal: the defensive, or free-standing, FRAND action.

In a recent decision (Kigen v Thales [1]) the High Court in London considered a claim brought by Kigen, a UK‑based producer of eSIM and iSIM technology, against Thales which is the owner of a portfolio of SEPs which are declared to be essential to the GSM Association standards. Thales wrote to Kigen and accused it of infringing some of its SEPs. Under the GSM IPR Regulations Thales undertook to grant licenses for its declared patents on Fair, Reasonable and Non-Discriminatory (FRAND) terms and it made license offers to Kigen on confidential terms. 14 months after the negotiations started no agreement had been reached and Kigen sued Thales in the UK courts, seeking the following declarations:

that the two UK essential patents asserted by Thales were invalid; that Kigen is entitled to licenses to the Thales portfolio on FRAND terms; and establishing the terms of those licenses.

Neither infringement nor essentiality were an issue before the Court and Thales challenged the Court’s jurisdiction to make a FRAND declaration without making a prior finding of infringement of a SEP.

Crucially, the judge expressly confirmed that the Court did have jurisdiction, saying that:

“…the pleaded case raises a proper basis to bring the disagreement on terms of a FRAND licence before the court. The terms of the licence have to be determined by the national court if the parties cannot agree otherwise. It is not only following a determination of infringement and an undertaking by the implementer to take a licence that a dispute about terms can be brought before the court.”

This route provides a promising new avenue for implementers looking to seize the initiative and to break the deadlock of SEP negotiations. No longer must they simply wait to be sued; now they can bring matters to a head and seek a judicial determination of FRAND terms themselves. However if they do so, as Kigen found out, they would be best advised to undertake upfront actually to sign a license on those terms once it has been determined by the Court.

While we have not yet seen defensive or free-standing FRAND actions in the U.S., there have been some potentially implementer friendly changes. For example, the June 2022 withdrawal of the Trump-era policy 2019 Policy Statement on Remedies for Standards-Essential Patents Subject to Voluntary FRAND Commitments, a policy statement that was supportive of a patent holder’s right to pursue an SEP-related injunction and was perceived by many as being too patent owner-friendly, is a win for implementers, even though it remains unclear whether the Biden administration will ultimately issue a replacement statement.

That said, not all of the recent changes in the U.S. are implementer friendly. For example, the IEEE’s updates to its Patent Policy for standards development includes a new language associate with injunctions. This new language includes an analysis of “good faith” as to the implementers licensing behavior, while the previous IEEE language indicated that the implementer must fail to participate or comply with the outcome of a RAND adjudication in order for an injunction to be appropriate. The subjective nature of the “good faith” analysis is likely to make this a hot area for litigation going forward and lead to uncertainty for implementers given that different judges, jurisdictions, and national courts may view the “good faith” requirement differently.

Thales to Open National Digital Excellence Centre in Fredericton - Huddle Today,"Mon, 24 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vaHVkZGxlLnRvZGF5LzIwMjMvMDQvMjQvdGhhbGVzLXRvLW9wZW4tbmF0aW9uYWwtZGlnaXRhbC1leGNlbGxlbmNlLWNlbnRyZS1pbi1mcmVkZXJpY3Rvbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Reading Time: 3 minutes

FREDERICTON — European technology firm Thales Group is building its National Digital Excellence Centre (NDEC) at UNB’s Knowledge Park in Fredericton. The focus of the centre will be on cyber security in industrial systems.

In a major coup for the province, the France-based multinational says New Brunswick was the right fit for NDEC Canada, as well as Thales’ Cyber Security Operations Centre (CSOC) for North America, which will provide “real-time protection against cyber-attacks in Canada.”

“As Canada’s only bilingual province, New Brunswick is purposefully looking to strengthen our economic and cultural ties with France,” Arlene Dunn, the minister responsible for Opportunities New Brunswick, says in a press release.

Described as a keystone in the company’s North American operations, the new centre will follow in the footsteps of the existing NDEC in Wales. It will focus on four streams: research and development, education, engaging small- and medium-sized businesses, and project work. Both NDECs are collaborations with universities and local economic development agencies.

“Thales’ decision to expand its UK-based National Digital Excellence Centre into New Brunswick is a testament to the strength of our existing cyber security ecosystem, as well as the strength of our working relationship with France and the United Kingdom, and represents another value-added opportunity to help us build on our talent pipeline. This investment further solidifies New Brunswick’s reputation as a national leader in cybersecurity,” Dunn says.

Moving forward with New Brunswick as the location for this strategically significant centre was born of the decisive action of the Government of New Brunswick and the other stakeholders, according to Thales CEO Chris Pogue.

“With the strength of institutions like UNB and the McKenna Institute, combined with the agility of small and medium-sized businesses, New Brunswick stands out for its potential for collaborative innovation on cyber capabilities and industrial systems. We were also able to rapidly establish trust with ACOA, ONB, UNB’s McKenna Institute, and Ignite, and leverage that trust to move this initiative forward together quickly and effectively,” he says in an email exchange with Huddle.

Working with the McKenna Institute at UNB, the CSOC will collaborate on the commercialization of cyber-related products. Thanks to a $1.8-million contribution from the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, the Institute will collaborate with Thales to “develop new cyber security and digital resilience programs to benefit and strengthen the region’s small- and medium-sized businesses,” according to Thales.

“We really view our role as a convener. We’re going to work with other post-secondary institutions in New Brunswick, and the broader education system, to continue to evolve our cyber security education in the province,” says Adrienne Oldford, executive director of the McKenna Institute.

Educational cybersecurity programming for youth is going to be a key component ofthe McKenna Institute’s work, in collaboration with other educational partners.

“It’s just such an important field that we need to start educating our youth earlier in cyber security because it has meaning for their lives but it’s also going to drive a lot of the economy going forward.”

Working with small business will be the other key component of the upcoming programs.

“We have a lot of cyber security companies, and we have a lot of small and medium businesses that are grappling with cyber security issues. The National Digital Excellence Centre is a place where they can come and get some guidance, but then also test some products and test some ideas.”

Oldford says programs will be mapped out over the summer and program development will start in September.

“We want to make sure that in the long-term that New Brunswick companies have the talent that they need, not only to grow and develop here but also innovate from here,” Oldford says.

Thales’ cyber security products are used by NATO member states and major financial institutions to protect assets and infrastructure using tactics such as cryptography. The company itself is multifaceted with a significant presence in defence, aerospace, digital identity, and transport. The company is moving into “deep tech,” with a focus on artificial intelligence, Big Data, and quantum technology.

Thales already has a presence across Canada with more than 2,000 employees from Halifax to Vancouver.

ACOA has also contributed $1.2 million to Ignite Fredericton to contribute to the design and construction of the facility, which will act as a regional hub for cyber skills development and partnerships among academia, and the business community.

The combined contribution of federal and provincial governments to the project is an estimated $8.6 million, including $5.5 million in the form of a payroll rebate over five years to support the development of the centre, via ONB.

It’s anticipated that 110 jobs will be created as a result of the establishment of the centre and that the facility will contribute up to $63 million in direct provincial GDP over a five-year period.

Italy's post-pandemic space industry boost - SpaceNews,"Thu, 27 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9pdGFseXMtcG9zdC1wYW5kZW1pYy1zcGFjZS1pbmR1c3RyeS1ib29zdC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"TAMPA, Fla. — An Italian Earth observation project funded by pandemic relief euros has ordered at least 34 satellites and a pair of Vega launches in recent months.

More than 47 Italian companies have secured contracts for the 1.1 billion euro ($1.2 billion) IRIDE constellation, or International Report for Innovative Defense of Earth, as part of the Italian government’s National Plan for Recovery and Resilience.

The low Earth orbit network would use optical, radar, and other imaging payloads to monitor Italy’s critical infrastructure, air quality, and meteorological conditions.

Arianespace has a contract from the European Space Agency, acting on behalf of the Italian government, for two Vega C rockets to start launching IRIDE satellites in late 2025, with an option for a third to complete the constellation in 2026.

Italy-based Avio is the prime contractor for Vega launch vehicles.

The satellite makers

ESA has awarded IRIDE satellite manufacturing contracts to Italy-based teams led by Thales Alena Space, Argotec, Sitael, OHB, and space logistics company D-Orbit perhaps best known for its last-mile space tug services.

Thales Alena Space said March 27 it won IRIDE contracts from ESA for six small satellites with synthetic aperture radars (SAR) and one based on optical technology.

The contracts are worth 141 million euros for all seven satellites. They also include options for another four SAR satellites and an extra optical satellite that altogether would bring in an additional 94 million euros.

Thales Alenia Space said each SAR and optical satellite would weigh about 170 kilograms and be based on its modular NIMBUS (New Italian Micro Bus) platform.

OHB Italy and Argotec announced their IRIDE contract wins in December for a total 22 multispectral satellites worth a combined 68 million euros.

The contracts signed by OHB and Argotec include options for an additional 12 and 15 satellites, respectively, for an extra 58 million euros combined.

D-Orbit announced April 5 it had secured a 26 million euro contract to build a SAR satellite for IRIDE, which would be based on the ION Satellite Carrier orbital transfer vehicle (OTV) it builds in-house.

Italian technology developer MetaSensing is supplying the radar for this satellite.

D-Orbit’s contract includes a 24 million euro option for an additional SAR satellite.

A decision on a second satellite “should be made by the end of this year,” a D-Orbit spokesperson said, “depending on the performance of the work” on its first IRIDE satellite.

The company declined to discuss specifications for the Earth observation satellite but said it expects to release more details about the project in a few months.

Sitael has a contract for four hyperspectral IRIDE satellites in a deal covering options for another two spacecraft that “may host a payload yet to be selected by ESA,” ESA IRIDE program manager Guido Levrini told SpaceNews. Italian multinational aerospace company Leonardo is providing the instruments for Sitael, which is basing the satellites on its 200-kilogram all-electric satellite platform Platino.

Altogether, that puts IRIDE at 34 commissioned satellites with options for 35 more.

“In addition, nothing prevents us (budget and schedule permitting) to add satellites through extensions of the scope of the current contracts,” Levrini said via email.

Space tug

D-Orbit’s business primarily revolves around an OTV delivery service that it first demonstrated in 2020.

“ION is an OTV, but it is also a satellite platform which can carry out in-orbit experiments, accommodate edge computing applications and space cloud services,” said Stefano Antonetti, D-Orbit’s vice president of business development and institutional sales.

The company says it has transported around 100 payloads in orbit over eight missions to date, including 73 satellites deployed from ION and additional payloads hosted onboard the spacecraft.

This is also not the first time the company has secured a contract to develop a standalone satellite.

The company is prime contractor for a 10 million euro SAR satellite project secured in 2019 called NOCTUA Landscape Monitoring, which aims to keep tabs on infrastructure in Italy’s northern Lombardia region for government agencies and residents. MetaSensing is also part of the consortium for this project.

D-Orbit’s first satellite, a spacecraft the size of three cubesats, was launched in 2017 to validate the company’s propulsive technologies."

A recent Thales Data Threat Report reveals that there has been a significant increase in ransomware attacks and human error-driven cloud data breaches in India and worldwide. In India, 52% of IT professionals reported an increase in ransomware attacks in the past 12 months, higher than the global figure of 48%. Surprisingly, less than half (48%) of enterprises surveyed in India have a formal ransomware plan.

Cloud Assets and IoT Devices Under Fire

The report also identifies cloud assets and IoT devices as the primary targets for cyber-attacks. In India, 53% of respondents claimed that their IoT devices were the biggest targets, followed by cloud-based storage (41%) and cloud-delivered applications (SaaS) (40%). These figures highlight the growing risks associated with the rapid shift towards cloud-based workloads and the need for enterprises to prioritize data security.

Human Error: The Leading Cause of Cloud Data Breaches

Human error, misconfiguration, and other mistakes are identified as the leading cause of cloud data breaches in the report. In India, 52% of respondents who suffered a data breach in the past 12 months cited human error as the primary cause. The report emphasizes the importance of identity and access management (IAM) as the most effective tool to mitigate these risks, with 28% of global respondents identifying IAM as their top choice.

Ransomware Impact Declining, but Data Loss Remains a Concern

Although the severity of ransomware attacks appears to be declining, data loss from these attacks remains a significant concern for enterprises in India. A staggering 82% of Indian respondents reported data loss from ransomware attacks, compared to 67% globally.

Digital Sovereignty and Quantum Computing : Emerging Threats on the Horizon

Data sovereignty is becoming an increasingly pressing concern for data privacy and security teams, with 82% of Indian respondents expressing concerns over data sovereignty. Additionally, the emergence of quantum computing presents a potential threat to classical encryption schemes.

‘No to War and Fossil Fuels’: Students protest USyd ties with Thales and Santos - Honi Soit,"Fri, 28 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vaG9uaXNvaXQuY29tLzIwMjMvMDQvbm8tdG8td2FyLWFuZC1mb3NzaWwtZnVlbHMtc3R1ZGVudHMtcHJvdGVzdC11c3lkLXRpZXMtd2l0aC10aGFsZXMtYW5kLXNhbnRvcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Approximately 40 student activists and community members gathered in the Quadrangle today to protest the presence of French defence and security weapons manufacturer Thales Group and fossil fuel giant Santos on campus.

The rally was chaired by Students’ Representative Council (SRC) Environment Officer Simon Upitis and SRC Education Officer Ishbel Dunsmore, who noted that “It’s great to see people saying no to war and no to fossil fuels.”

The connection between war and fossil fuels was a key theme of the rally, from the demand to sever ties with both Thales and Santos, to their joint role in the destruction of the planet and people.

Simone Maddison, SRC Director of Student Publications and education activist, contextualised Santos as Australia’s largest supplier of natural gas. “Despite their best attempts to position themselves as leading the way in sustainability in the higher education sector, USyd’s greenwashing amounts only to bandaids covering their structural commitment to fossil fuels,” Maddison argued.

This structural integration of the fossil fuel industry is a key concern not just in Universities but across society, Maddison pointed out, as “The Native Title Tribunal last year ruled that the public benefit of Santos’ Narrabri Gas Project outweighed any cultural or environmental concerns of the Gomeroi people.”

The protestors marched briefly to the Quad Lawns where Jack Scanlan, SRC Disabilities Officer and education activist said that “Australia collectively has failed to fight the fossil fuel lobby.”

“Not only have we not fought it but the government has actively propped up what should be a dying industry with enormous subsidies, subsidies that dwarf historically what has been given to renewable energy,” Scanlan continued.

Nick Dean, long-time anti-war activist and convenor of the Marrickville Peace Group, connected war and the climate crisis, saying that “war is the very epitome of social and environmental destruction. Should the wars we are being told to expect break out, they will inevitably accelerate the climate crisis.”

“Military strategists and the governments they serve foresee instability on a global scale. They fear they may lose control and so how do they maintain it? Through the power that comes from the barrel of a gun.”

After marching to the F23 building, the crowd gathered outside the office of USyd Chancellor Belinda Hutchinson, who, as Dunsmore noted, is also the current Chair of Thales Australia.

In 2017, just two years after her appointment to their board, Hutchinson and the University signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Thales and in late 2022 they extended it, further enmeshing the University and the military sector.

SRC Education Officer Yasmine Johnson concluded the rally by condemning the higher education sector for their increasing militarism. Catriona Jackson, chief executive of Universities Australia, “recently spent a week in Washington offering the support of the higher education sector in preparing for war,” Johnson said.

“Students go to uni to get a quality education, not just to be churned out as a cog in the military machine, which is exactly what happens when unis have memorandums of understanding with weapons manufacturers.”

Johnson also denounced the Albanese government’s decision to spend “a further nineteen billion dollars as part of a ramp up in defence spending with a large proportion going towards enhancing Australia’s long-range missile strike capacity. This is in addition to the [over] $360 billion already committed to the AUKUS submarines.”

Rally organises urged attendees to attend the 6 May march against the Port Kembla nuclear base and a protest of the Quad leaders’ summit at Town Hall 6pm Tuesday 24 May."

Jackal drone used to launch Martlet missiles for first time during trials - Forces Network,"Wed, 19 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmNlcy5uZXQvdGVjaG5vbG9neS93YXRjaC1qYWNrYWwtZHJvbmUtdXNlZC1sYXVuY2gtbWFydGxldC1taXNzaWxlcy1maXJzdC10aW1lLWR1cmluZy10cmlhbHPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Watch: A Jackal drone has been combined with the Martlet weapon systems during trials held by the RAF.

The Royal Air Force has completed a ground-breaking trial firing exercise where a lightweight multi-role missile (LMM) was launched from a drone. It is the first time that a Jackal drone, created by the Yorkshire-based company Flyby Technology, has been used to fire an LMM, also known as the Martlet by the British military, from a hover in flight. The Martlet was initially designed by defence firm Thales to help the Royal Navy combat swarms of small, unmanned attack boats, but recent trials have shown how they can be combined with drone warfare.

Flyby Technology CEO Jon Parker said: ""If you want to win you have to be a step ahead and everybody else is racing ahead and we need to be able to either catch up or overtake. Jackal is the start of that process. ""Up until now, drones have been used in a very light tactical way or as a big standoff surveillance platform and reconnaissance platform, sometimes with missiles on them to do small interventions on roads in Afghanistan and things like that. ""And, for the first time, we've been able to get to an aircraft that can fly properly at a tactical level at a price point that is achievable for a lot of forces and a lot of companies.""

Flyby Technology and Thales worked together and shared resources to combine the newly modified Jackal drone and the LMM. The RAF has now successfully fired two Martlet missiles as part of a six-week testing exercise. While the weapons are usually fired from shoulder launchers or larger manned platforms, the trials have demonstrated that the 1,100mph missiles can be fired from the unmanned Jackal drone. Mr Parker said: ""Jackal is the first aircraft to be able to fire a competent missile that's got lethal and devastating effect from a hover in flight.""

The LMM (lightweight multi-role missile) was created by the defence firm Thales (Picture: Alamy).

Thales business development manager James Keown said: ""It is breaking the barriers in showing what is possible by employing existing technology. ""And to show people, to demonstrate visually, that we can use lightweight precision weapons from this latest generation of, let's call it a tactical platform, where we can have, perhaps, two rounds and we can exploit all the benefits of LMM as precise. ""It has a good range, you know, it's like two to 6km, and can be used against a variety of high-value threats,"" he added.

Thales conducted a survey of nearly 3,000 IT and security professionals in 18 countries for its data on security threats, trends, and emerging topics, which was released on Tuesday.

According to the data, nearly half (47 per cent) of IT professionals in India believe that the volume or severity of security threats is increasing, while 48 per cent believe that ransomware attacks are increasing.

In the last 12 months, more than a third (37 per cent) of respondents in India reported a data breach, with 22 per cent reporting a ransomware attack on their organisation.

Most vulnerable to cyber-attacks

Cloud assets were identified as the most vulnerable to cyber-attacks by these respondents.

More than 28 per cent of respondents said software-as-a-service (SaaS) apps and cloud-based storage were the most important targets, followed by cloud-hosted applications (26 per cent), and cloud infrastructure management (25 per cent).

Cloud exploitation and attacks are on the rise, with 75 per cent of global respondents reporting that 40 per cent of data stored in the cloud is now classified as sensitive, up from 49 per cent in 2022.

The 2023 Thales data threat report, which surveyed both private and public sector organisations, also revealed how businesses are responding to and planning their data security strategies and practises in the face of a changing threat landscape, as well as how far they have come in combating threats.

Accidental breaches

Human error and ransomware, according to the report, played a significant role in the cloud data breach in India.

Accidental breaches can occur due to simple human error, misconfiguration, or other errors, and respondents identified this as the leading cause of cloud data breaches. The primary cause identified by 55 per cent of respondents who had experienced a data breach in the previous 12 months was misconfiguration or human error.

This was followed by the use of a known vulnerability (21 per cent), as well as a zero-day or previously unknown vulnerability (13 per cent). According to the report, identity and access management (IAM) is the best line of defence, with 28 per cent of respondents naming it as the most effective tool for mitigating these risks.

Meanwhile, the severity of ransomware attacks appears to be decreasing, with 35 per cent of 2023 respondents reporting a significant impact, compared to 44 per cent reporting similar levels of impact in 2022.

Global spending is also increasing, with 61 per cent saying they would shift or add a budget for ransomware tools to prevent future attacks, up from 57 per cent in 2022, but organisational responses to ransomware remain inconsistent.

Only 49 per cent of businesses reported a formal ransomware response plan, while 67 per cent continue to report data loss from ransomware attacks.

Digital sovereignty

Digital sovereignty is also a growing concern for data privacy and security teams. Overall, the report found that data sovereignty continues to be a short- and long-term challenge for businesses.

Nearly 83 per cent of respondents expressed concerns about data sovereignty, and 55 per cent agreed that data privacy and compliance in the cloud has become more difficult, most likely due to the emergence of requirements around digital sovereignty, the data threat report said.

Organisations are also concerned about emerging threats from quantum computers, which could compromise traditional encryption schemes. The report discovered that the top global security concerns from quantum computing were Harvest Now, Decrypt Later (HNDL), and future network decryption, with 62 per cent and 55 per cent reporting concerns, respectively.

While Post Quantum Cryptography (PQC) has emerged as a discipline to combat these threats, the report found that 62 per cent of organisations worldwide have five or more key management systems, posing a challenge for PQC and crypto agility.

The 2023 Thales Global Data Threat Report was based on a global 451 Research survey commissioned by Thales of almost 3,000 executives with responsibility for or influence over IT and data security.

The survey had respondents from 18 countries and was conducted in November and December 2022."
‘We want Thales off campus!’: Students speak out on Eastern Avenue at Thales recruitment stall - Honi Soit,"Thu, 06 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vaG9uaXNvaXQuY29tLzIwMjMvMDQvd2Utd2FudC10aGFsZXMtb2ZmLWNhbXB1cy1zdHVkZW50cy1zcGVhay1vdXQtb24tZWFzdGVybi1hdmVudWUtYXQtdGhhbGVzLXJlY3J1aXRtZW50LXN0YWxsL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A recruitment stall on Eastern Avenue, manned by representatives of weapons manufacturer Thales Australia, attracted a student speak-out at Eastern Avenue on Tuesday.

Delivering speeches to onlookers and passersby, students denounced Thales’ involvement with the University of Sydney and called for students and staff to oppose Australia’s military buildup in the face of potential war with China.

Jacob Starling expressed disgust at Thales’ presence on campus.

“[Universities are] being primed to play a crucial role in the build up of Australia’s military,” said Starling, “this month, Vice-Chancellors from the Group of Eight are travelling to Washington to collaborate and prepare to roll out the AUKUS plans in our tertiary education institutions.”

Warning against the University’s involvement in militarisation, Starling said “[we] need education that is based around students, staff and learning ways to help people, to improve learning, to make our lives better rather than to create weapons technology (…) it is a disgrace that the University is so tied up with Thales. It is a disgrace that University management wants to be complicit in slaughter.”

Angus Dermody spoke about Australia’s increasing militarisation and how workers and students can resist, drawing a connection with the NTEU’s strike action which has been taking place recently on campus.

Dermody called for resistance to war with China, including the cessation of weapons development at universities involving arms manufacturing companies like Thales. Citing the AUKUS submarine deal, Dermody condemned ties between Thales and USyd.

“We need to oppose University management’s ties with arms manufacturers, their efforts in bolstering war in Ukraine, as well as the march to war with China that our Vice Chancellor wants to see universities play a role in.”

In a comment to Honi, Jordi Parodel explained the motive of the speak-out.

“We want Thales off campus, and Thales out of Ukraine. Thales is profiting hugely from the devastating war in Ukraine. Albanese’s Labor government is contributing to these profits by purchasing more of Thales’ weapons to send to Ukraine. The Labor government, along with other Western states, sees the war in Ukraine as a precursor to war with China over Taiwan. They want to send a message to China.”

Thales’ recruitment drive follows the University of Sydney’s renewal of its partnership with Thales in December of last year. The partnership facilitates Thales-directed research into high-tech weaponry and military systems on campus, and has drawn criticism over USyd Chancellor Belinda Hutchinson’s position as Chairperson of Thales Australia’s board."

The number of payment cards issued via digital card issuance platforms worldwide will increase from 500m in 2023 to more than 1.3bn by 2027, according to a Juniper Research forecast.

“This growth of 170% reflects strong interest in improving the way users access and replace cards from issuers. This is in the context of strong competition between issuers from digital-only banks and new fintechs offering card services,” the researchers say.



“Modern card issuing platforms, also known as digital card issuing platforms, allow card issuers to create cards using an API (Application Programming Interface)-driven approach; enabling cards to be delivered instantly to digital wallets, with the option for a physical card, boosting flexibility, transparency and speed significantly.”

The research also incorporates Juniper’s 2023 Competitor Leaderboard for modern card issuing platform vendors that ranks Thales, Giesecke+Devrient, FIS, Fiserv and Marqeta as the top five market leaders globally “using criteria such as the completeness of their solutions and their future business prospects”.

The leaderboard also identifies Adyen, Idemia and Nexi as “established leaders” with Entrust and Stripe among the “leading challengers” in the market.

A Juniper Research forecast published in February predicted that the number of credit cards issued via digital card issuance platforms worldwide would exceed 320m by 2027.

UK drone system successfully fires missile in unmanned air combat test - The National,"Fri, 21 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVuYXRpb25hbG5ld3MuY29tL3dvcmxkL3VrLW5ld3MvMjAyMy8wNC8yMC91ay1kcm9uZS1zeXN0ZW0tc3VjY2Vzc2Z1bGx5LWZpcmVzLW1pc3NpbGUtaW4tdW5tYW5uZWQtYWlyLWNvbWJhdC10ZXN0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The successful test firing of a missile from Jackal, a new drone system, brings unmanned air combat a step closer to reality.

The Jackal drone was designed and developed by experts from Flyby Technology in the UK, with Turkish partners FlyBVLOS Technology and Maxwell Innovations providing design engineering and prototyping expertise.

The new versatile drone system is capable of various types of combat mission over land, sea, and air.

The test was sponsored by the Rapid Capabilities Office (RCO) of the Royal Air Force and involved teams from Flyby and the technology company Thales, which also manufactures the Thales Lightweight Multirole Missile (LMM).

Within a six-week window, they were able to build two operational Jackal aircraft and successfully fire two LMMs in a demonstration of teamwork.

As a vertical take-off and landing platform, Jackal is designed to perform various roles, including battlefield air interdiction, close air support, engaging helicopters in flight, destroying tanks, and denying the use of runways and roads.

The successful missile firing test is a significant milestone in the development of unmanned air combat capabilities.

The aircraft was created from the ideas of Harrier pilots, whose aircraft take off and land vertically, which is another advantage over traditional fighter jets, and there is no need for vulnerable runways, making it more adaptable and flexible.

The Jackal drone system was designed to fill a recently discovered gap in modern combat operations.

Many countries cannot afford attack helicopters or fast jets modern enough to survive today's battlefield. Jackal can provide the same effect with little risk at a fraction of the price.

Flyby Technology chief executive Jon Parker, a former RAF and Royal Navy fighter pilot, said: “The days of having a fighter pilot in the cockpit are numbered, and Jackal is part of that future as a true, multi-role attack aircraft.

“We want to make Jackal a flagship product, creating secure UK jobs and contributing to a new future for the British aerospace and defence industries.”

As a plug-and-play system, new equipment and technologies can be incorporated into Jackal between missions as well as during continued development.

This streamlined procurement process ensures that future aircraft are not obsolete before they go into service and will remain relevant for longer. It also gives a pathway to future regulatory compliance and airworthiness standards.

The Jackal team is now developing production plans while the aircraft undergoes further enhancements and tactical development."
ADF seeks its own land-based ship killer | The Strategist - The Strategist,"Thu, 27 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFzcGlzdHJhdGVnaXN0Lm9yZy5hdS9hZGYtc2Vla2luZy1pdHMtb3duLWxhbmQtYmFzZWQtc2hpcC1raWxsZXIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"On 13 April 2022 the Moskva, flagship of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet, was hit by two Neptune missiles fired from a truck on the Ukrainian coastline. The warship sank the next day.

This was a spectacular success for the Ukrainian forces, but it also demonstrated more broadly the effectiveness of a mobile, land-based missile system designed to destroy ships far out to sea.

The Australian Defence Force is seeking such a system of its own under a project called Land 4100 Phase 2 for a ‘land-based maritime strike’ capability likely to play a crucial role in any future conflict in littoral areas.

In their defence strategic review, former defence minister Stephen Smith and former chief of the ADF Angus Houston recommended that the government accelerate and expand this program. With its strong focus on the need for ‘impactful projection’ and the need to safeguard Australia’s northern approaches, the Albanese government has accepted that recommendation.

A serious contender is a very serious ‘ute’ with a big bite—the utility version of the Bushmaster troop carrier carrying a pair of Naval Strike Missiles, advanced anti-ship and land-attack weapons with a range of 250 kilometres.

If accepted, the vehicle would be provided by Thales Australia and the missiles by Kongsberg Defence Australia.

The ‘StrikeMaster’ launcher would use the latest Bushmaster technology, with front doors as in variants sold to the Netherlands, and tougher axles as in those sold to New Zealand.

The missile is already operational in Malaysia, Norway, Poland and the US Navy and US Marine Corps, and is being delivered to Germany, Romania, Canada and Spain.

The system is versatile, with the US Marine Corps using a twin launcher on an unmanned joint light tactical vehicle and Poland using four missiles in a ‘quad pack’ carried on a large truck.

The missile can fly over land and sea at a low level, making it highly effective in both the littoral and blue-water environments.

It is designated as ‘totally passive’ in that it uses an advanced imaging infrared seeker to search for, detect and automatically recognise enemy vessels down to specific ship classes.

In April 2022, the Australian government announced the accelerated acquisition of the missile to replace Harpoon anti-ship missiles on the Royal Australian Navy’s Anzac-class frigates and Hobart-class destroyers. The missile would also be suitable for the RAN’s offshore patrol vessels if such a capability is required. A helicopter version could also be carried on the RAN’s MH-60R Seahawk helicopters.

The StrikeMaster launcher configuration can operate independently if needed, but it is designed to be part of the broader Kongsberg coastal defence system with integrated fire control and sensors.

It could be carried on the Royal Australian Air Force’s transport aircraft and on small landing craft, making it highly deployable. That is a core requirement for the US Marine Corps’ operational concept of ‘island hopping’ launchers as part of its anti-access/area-denial activities.

If the StrikeMaster is selected for the ADF, the launcher and vehicle will be made in Australia—the Bushmaster by Thales Australia, and the launcher electronics by Kongsberg.

The companies say this will provide a highly mobile and protected land-based maritime strike capability.

The missile would be common across the navy and army and could be used interchangeably between ships and the StrikeMaster.

Because the missile is already set to enter service with the navy, the companies say the system could be operational in two to three years."
"Protesters demand 'Earthcare, not warfare' - Green Left","Tue, 11 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdyZWVubGVmdC5vcmcuYXUvY29udGVudC9wcm90ZXN0ZXJzLWRlbWFuZC1lYXJ0aGNhcmUtbm90LXdhcmZhcmXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"About 25 protesters have stopped work at a bullet factory in Benalla in Victoria on April 11 and are calling for the police to be disarmed.

NIOA manufactures bullets for Australia’s police and military, and Thales manufactures a range of mortars and shells.

The protesters set up a blockade on the road to the factory, with a brightly painted vehicle and an improvised fence, saying: “NIOA profits from police violence”. The banners read: “Disarm police”, “Ceasefire” and “Karrinjarla Muwajarri”.

This is the second time the group has blockaded NIOA’s bullet factory in connection with a Yuendumu Elders’ campaign to keep police guns out of communities, after the shooting death of Kumanjayi Walker in 2019.

As Thales Australia exports military vehicles to Indonesian special forces group Kopassus, protesters also set up a memorial to the West Papuan civilians killed by the Indonesian military and police since 2021.

The multi-billion dollar French weapons manufacturer exports shells, naval guns, mortars and other munitions to Indonesia. Thales FZ68 rockets were identified in attacks on West Papuan villages last year.

Zelda Grimshaw, spokesperson for the protesters, said: “Weapons corporations like NIOA and Thales are making a killing taking Black lives, while driving dispossession and enforcing ecocide across our region.

“It is past time to put peace and climate justice ahead of the profits of arms manufacturers. We don’t need a billion bullets. We need our children alive, and a planet they can thrive on. We are calling for earth care, not warfare,” she said."

UK-based Flyby Technology designed and developed the technology, with Türkiye aviation consultant partners Fly BVLOS Technology and Maxwell Innovations. The project is sponsored by the Royal Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office.

The vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) drone is capable of battlefield air interdiction, close air support, helicopter engagement in flight and destruction of tanks, runways and roads. It has a 15-kilogram load capacity, 160km/h max speed, and 130-kilometre range.

============== ==============

The lightweight multi-role missile (LMM) is already in service as a high-accuracy precision weapon used against small, fast-moving targets in air, land or sea engagements.

Flyby Technology chief executive officer Jon Parker, who is a former RAF and Royal Navy fighter pilot, said two operational Jackal aircraft were built and fired two LMMs during the short six-week development cycle.

“War is about winning, and Jackal is designed by warfighters for that ultimate aim,” he said.

“The days of having a fighter pilot in the cockpit are numbered and I realise I will not perhaps be loved for bringing about the end of my own kind.

“The future of warfare is changing, and Jackal is part of that future as a true multi-role attack aircraft.

“We want to make Jackal a flagship product, creating secure UK jobs and contributing to a new future for the British aerospace and defence industries.”

Jackal can give nations the attack helicopter or fast jet effect with little risk, better hidden launch sites and at a fraction of the price, Mr Parker said.

Flyby Technology will continue development in the UK and Turkey, as it seeks UK manufacturing partners to build Jackal at scale.

“One of the unique selling points of LMM is its ability to be integrated onto multiple platforms, including armoured vehicles, helicopters, naval vessels or indeed, shoulder launchers, each designed to address different threats,” said Thales Northern Ireland managing director Philip McBride.

“It has been a privilege to work with the Flyby team on this time-compressed and groundbreaking trial and has proved that both Thales and Flyby can produce impressive and agile results when focused on a collective, shared objective.”

RAF head of rapid capabilities office, Air Commodore Jez Holmes, said the office is looking forward to seeing the ongoing developments in this area.

“Given the impressively short time scale it took the team to deliver the initial trial, it’s clear that Flyby could have an exciting future in this sector,” Air Cdre Holmes said.

“The partnering and support from Thales was outstanding in lowering the barriers to entry for innovative start-ups.”

The drone-missile carrier concept should look familiar as Northrop Grumman developed their own MQ-8 Fire Scout unmanned autonomous helicopter during the early 2000s. That aircraft had several variants including a version with stub wings to carry Hellfire missiles, glide weapons, and rockets."

The Thales Data Threat Report 2023 is a comprehensive analysis of cybersecurity trends and threats. It has revealed some concerning findings about ransomware attacks and cloud data breaches in India and globally. The report highlights a significant increase in these attacks, indicating the need for businesses to implement robust security measures to protect their sensitive data.

Ransomware Attacks on the Rise

The report finds that ransomware attacks have seen a significant increase in India and worldwide. In India, more than half (52%) of IT professionals reported a surge in ransomware attacks in the past 12 months. This is higher than the global figure of 48 percent. This highlights the growing threat of ransomware attacks and the need for businesses to be prepared to mitigate such risks.

Main Targets for Cyber-Attacks

The report identifies cloud assets and Internet of Things (IoT) devices as the primary targets for cyber-attacks. In India, 53% of respondents claimed that their IoT devices were the top most targets, followed by cloud-based storage (41%) and cloud-delivered applications (SaaS) (40%). This indicates that businesses need to prioritize the security of their cloud assets and IoT devices to protect against cyber-attacks.

Human Error: Primary Cause of Cloud Data Breaches

Human error, misconfiguration, and other mistakes are found to be major causes of cloud data breaches. In India, 52% of respondents who suffered a data breach in the past 12 months cited human error as the main cause. Proper training, processes, and access management can prevent human error-related data breaches.

Data Loss from Ransomware Attacks Remains a Concern

Data loss from ransomware attacks remains a key concern for enterprises within India. A staggering 82 percent of Indian respondents reported data loss from ransomware attacks, compared to 67 percent globally. This highlights the need for robust backup and recovery strategies to mitigate the impact of ransomware attacks.

Der Auftrag sei im Verhandlungsverfahren ohne Auftragsbekanntmachung vergeben worden, schreibt das BAAINBw, weil aufgrund des Schutzes von Ausschließlichkeitsrechten nur die ARGE SysPÄ CDS F124, vertreten durch Thales Deutschland, die Leistung erbringen könne. Die ARGE besteht aus den drei gleichberechtigten Partnern Thales Deutschland, ATLAS ELEKTRONIK GmbH und T-Systems.
