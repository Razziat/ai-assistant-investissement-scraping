Thales Alenia Space To Build BepiColombo Components - SpaceNews,"Fri, 07 Dec 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS90aGFsZXMtYWxlbmlhLXNwYWNlLXRvLWJ1aWxkLWJlcGljb2xvbWJvLWNvbXBvbmVudHMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Thales Alenia Space Italy has signed a contract valued at 200 million euros ($260 million) with Astrium GmbH of Germany to provide telecommunications, thermal control and electric-power systems for Europe’s $1 billion BepiColombo Mercury orbiter, Thales Alenia Space announced Dec. 5.

The contract comes five years after the two companies signed an original authorization to proceed that allowed hardware design to begin.

BepiColombo, whose budget and schedule have slipped on several occasions as the satellite grew in weight, forcing a launch aboard a heavy-lift Ariane 5 instead of a medium-lift Soyuz rocket, is currently scheduled for launch in 2015.

The European Space Agency (ESA) is managing BepiColombo in cooperation with Japan’s JAXA space agency. ESA’s work includes the Astrium- and Thales Alenia Space-built Mercury Planetary Orbiter. JAXA is providing the Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiter.

Both orbiters will be launched aboard the same Ariane 5 vehicle on a 6.5-year journey to Mercury orbit attached to the Mercury Transfer Module. Once in Mercury orbit, the two satellites will separate.

The satellites are scheduled to operate for a year at Mercury to investigate the origins and evolution of the planet, with a possible one-year extension. One of the principal design challenges is to withstand the temperature extremes in Mercury orbit, as high as 350 degrees Celsius on the side facing the sun."

Thales Sonar as “The Most Potent of Any Navy” - MarineLink,"Wed, 05 Dec 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmluZWxpbmsuY29tL25ld3MvdGhhbGVzLXBvdGVudC1zb25hcjM0OTc3M9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Royal Navy has described how the combination of a Type 23 frigate fitted with Thales UK’s Sonar 2087 and a Merlin helicopter equipped with the Thales FLASH dipping sonar has delivered an outstanding anti-submarine warfare capability.



HMS Northumberland, sailing as part of the UK’s Response Force Task Group on the Cougar 12 Mediterranean deployment, recently conducted advanced anti-submarine warfare (ASW) training with a friendly submarine.



The exercise involved the ASW surface ships trying to ‘sink’ the hunter-killer submarines, while simultaneously trying to avoid being sunk by their stealthy submariner counterparts.



Northumberland is one of eight Type 23 ships fitted with Sonar 2087, a towed array system that enables frigates to hunt the latest submarines at considerable distances and locate them beyond the range from which they can launch an attack.



Type 23 frigates also carry the Merlin helicopter that is fitted with the Thales FLASH dipping sonar. The combination of 2087 and FLASH makes the Type 23 a formidable antisubmarine warfare operator.



Northumberland’s Commanding Officer Commander Paddy Dowsett said: “The opportunity to conduct extended and realistic training against a submarine has been most welcome.



""It reinforced the view that a Type 23 frigate such as Northumberland, fitted with Sonar 2087 and a Merlin helicopter, remains the most potent anti-submarine warfare platform of any navy at sea today.”



Phil Naybour, head of Thales UK’s naval business said: “Once again, the combination of Sonar 2087 and FLASH sonar has proved to be a phenomenal anti-submarine warfare asset to the Royal Navy. We are proud to be such a key sensor supplier to the Royal Navy.”



The eighth and final Type 23 to be fitted with the system, HMS Portland, has been undergoing an extensive refit at Rosyth dockyard that included the installation of Sonar 2087.

The 2087 system is a low-frequency active sonar, consisting of both active and passive sonar arrays. The system is manufactured at Thales sites in the UK (Cheadle Heath in Manchester and Templecombe in Somerset) and France (Brest).

Sagem and Thales transfer infrared expertise to Sofradir - Optics.org,"Thu, 06 Dec 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiH2h0dHBzOi8vb3B0aWNzLm9yZy9uZXdzLzMvMTIvMTDSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Business News

Sagem and Thales transfer infrared expertise to Sofradir

06 Dec 2012

Parent companies are set to equip their joint venture with the full range of infrared detector technologies.

Sofradir, the French company that currently specializes in mercury cadmium telluride (MCT) detectors, will soon be able to offer a far wider range of infrared sensor technologies, following strategic moves by its parent companies Thales and Safran.

The two defense firms are set to transfer their in-house infrared detector expertise to Sofradir – in which both Thales and Safran own a 50% stake – from the start of next year.

Under the terms of the two separate agreements, Safran’s subsidiary Sagem will transfer its indium antimonide (InSb) mid-infrared technology to Sofradir, while the GIE III-V Laboratory, in which Thales holds a major stake, will transfer its indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) and quantum well infrared photodetector (QWIP) technologies. No equity will be transferred as part of the deal, although there will be a cash transfer.

The strategic move follows the memorandum of understanding signed by Safran and Thales earlier this year, which was designed to promote the development of optronics technologies in general through a joint venture.

By consolidating such wide-ranging infrared expertise, Sofradir will join a select band of companies able to offer the full suite of both cooled and uncooled infrared detectors, which are used in a wide range of defense applications such as thermal imaging, missile seekers, surveillance systems and targeting systems.

Technology transfer

Even before that transfer of expertise, Sofradir was widely seen as a leader in the field, with a Maxtech International survey of the market for military applications of infrared detectors earlier this year identifying the French company as holding a 25% market share.

“The technologies from Sagem and the III-V Lab enable Sofradir to have from this point forward the complete portfolio of infrared technologies. These assets consolidate Sofradir’s leadership position,” said Philippe Bensussan, the chairman and CEO of Sofradir.

“With the new technologies, Sofradir along with its subsidiary ULIS [which specializes in mass-produced uncooled IR detectors] will be able to select the technology best adapted to our clients’ applications. We are in a [stronger] position to offer IR products with more innovation, performance and compactness in order to respond to any IR market need.”

Sofradir told optics.org that the two deals will become effective on January 1, 2013, with no loss of personnel – as is required by French law.

III-V expertise

Originally set up by Thales and the telecoms giant Alcatel-Lucent, the III-V Laboratory is focused on research and development of a wide range of advanced semiconductor components – not just infrared technologies. The CEA-Leti research center became a partner in the laboratory in March 2011, and Sofradir says that the scientific collaboration with CEA-Leti will continue following the transfer of resources.

“The agreement includes the transfer of all the industrial resources in place at the III-V Lab and Sagem that are dedicated to those III-V technologies,” said the firm. “Indeed, the III-V Lab has its own specific industrial resources that were not shared with other laboratories. The activities will relocate to a unique facility on the outskirts of Paris, along with Sofradir’s headquarters.”

Sofradir's MCT detector manufacturing facilities, along with those of ULIS, are based in Veurey-Voroize, near Grenoble, while the company also has a US subsidiary in Fairfield, New Jersey. In 2011, its group sales grew to €150 million, of which two-thirds were exports."

The Goalkeeper system has been designed as an autonomous and fully automatic system against highly manoeuvrable missiles, aircraft and fast manoeuvring surface vessels.

In addition to search and track radars, the system comprises 30mm, 7-barrel Gatling gun with special missile-piercing ammunition that can destroy missile warheads.

The weapon system is also capable of providing high detection capability of small targets in all weather conditions using I-band search radar, while pinpoint target tracking is achieved using dual frequency I/K-band track radar.

At present, the system is also in service with navies of Belgium, Chile, Portugal, Qatar, South Korea, the UAE and the UK.

Work under the modernisation contract will be performed at the naval base in Den Helder, the Netherlands, with first system delivery scheduled to be complete in 2015.

The modification contract enables Goalkeeper to extend its service until 2025.

The contract also has an option for two Goalkeeper systems installed on the Royal Belgian Navy’s M-class frigates.

Sandra Dallas

341 pages, hardcover: $24.99.

St. Martin’s Press, 2012.

In the 2012 presidential election, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints emerged from the shadows with the first Mormon candidate for the nation’s highest office. Colorado writer Sandra Dallas’s 11th novel examines the history of a religion not widely understood outside its Utah base, where 62 percent of residents identify as Mormon. True Sisters illuminates the disastrous 1856 Martin Handcart Company journey from Iowa City to Salt Lake, introducing us to a fascinating group of mostly Scottish emigrants.

The pioneers have to make their way first across the ocean, then over the prairies and mountains, starting dangerously late in summer. We already know how perilous the journey will be, the insanity of the leadership’s decision to send 625 people out on foot in August, pushing poorly constructed handcarts across dirt, sand, mud and snow, with the hope of arriving in the Great Salt Lake before winter. Ill-prepared, underfed and poorly supplied, one in four will die before they reach the so-called New Zion.

Dallas homes in on a handful of women, some pregnant and accompanied by husbands, others by brothers and parents, who begin the trek determined to create their lives anew. Recent converts, they’re eager to flee the stultifying Christianity of their native Great Britain for a new faith in a new land — a 19th century version of the Pilgrims’ voyage to New England. The charismatic Thales Tanner, Louisa’s new husband, a missionary who knew Joseph Smith and can personally testify to the wonders of Zion, inspires many to make the arduous journey. They include several members of Louisa’s family, not all of whom survive.

Dallas avoids political pronouncements about the LDS church. Instead, she re-opens an often-overlooked chapter of westward expansion and helps us see it through the eyes of those who lived it: “Jessie joyed to see the vast land, so wide and open, so different from the landscape of the farm, with its copses and hedgerows. ‘I never saw a country I liked better in my life. The earth is as young as a baby, while at home it was as aged as an old man.’ “

Thales... Successful Deployment (SATCOM)



Link 16 illustration, courtesy of Thales

[SatNews] The recent NAWAS and CWIX exercises marked the first successful deployment by...

...French forces of the Thales solution for long-range Link 16 transmission of tactical data via satellite. During the exercises, the compact, readily deployable TopLink-MINT solution from Thales was used for long-range transmission of tactical situation data to NATO and allied systems, providing an opportunity to:

Semonstrate rapid operational implementation of a Link 16 network extension capability

Validate compliance with the JREAP standard (Joint Range Extension Application Protocol) and its interoperability with NATO and allied systems

“Thales is proud to have taken part in these exercises, which have successfully demonstrated the excellent performance of our systems and their inherent interoperability in the context of joint and coalition operations involving several nations,” said Hervé Derrey, VP for Thales Communications & Security’s Radio Communication Products business. “The armed forces now have the assurance that platforms equipped with our solution will deliver the rapid deployability, long-range extension and interoperability they need.”

In addition to the standard Link 16 function via MIDS radio network, the TopLink-MINT station from Thales incorporates the JRE capability (Joint Range Extension) for relaying Link 16 information from the MIDS network over an infrastructure network or via satellite.

The NAWAS 2012 exercise was organised and conducted by the three branches of the French armed forces under the leadership of the Land Forces Command (CFT). Its objective was to confirm the ability of the armed forces to provide an effective air defence capability for expeditionary land forces on the move.

The Coalition Warrior Interoperability eXploration, eXperimentation, eXamination, eXercise (CWIX) is an annual exercise to test and improve the interoperability of operational information systems deployed by NATO nations. The exercise uses a range of scenarios to demonstrate technical and operational readiness and deploy equipment and systems in live situations to test their ability to recognise each other and communicate in the theatre of operations. It is also an opportunity for government agencies and industry to deploy prototypes and demonstrators to showcase new technologies in realistic situations. Around 150 information systems and 800 personnel were involved in this annual exercise."
