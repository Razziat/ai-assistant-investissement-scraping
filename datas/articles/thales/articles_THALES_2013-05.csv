Thales reaches Type 45 communications milestone - ADS Advance,"Wed, 22 May 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFkc2FkdmFuY2UuY28udWsvdGhhbGVzLXJlYWNoZXMtdHlwZS00NS1jb21tdW5pY2F0aW9ucy1taWxlc3RvbmUuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales reaches Type 45 communications milestone

Thales UK has marked one year of successful operations for the Fully Integrated Communications System (FICS) onboard the Type 45 Destroyer, the Royal Navy's most advanced class of surface ship.

First of class HMS Daring (above) was deployed operationally to the Arabian Gulf in 2012, followed by the operational debuts of HMS Dauntless and HMS Diamond. During the deployments, the three ships were tasked with a variety of operations and exercises that thoroughly tested the communications systems.

The FICS system plays a vital role in assisting the ship’s crew to communicate in all environments. It provides the internal and external communications services for the platform including extensive HF and V/UHF systems. The system was designed from the outset to reduce the manpower required to manage and operate the system, ensuring the ship’s company can remain focused on operating the ship.

Thales is the lead contractor supplying the system to all six ships of the new Type 45 Class. These 8,000 tonne vessels are designed to shield the Fleet from air attack, as well as being used as general purpose warships.

Thales has taken the lessons learnt from the Type 45 Project and has ensured that they have been embodied into the product lines that have been selected by the Aircraft Carrier Alliance (ACA) to provide several of the Primary Communications Systems for the new Queen Elizabeth Class Aircraft Carriers, currently under construction.

After keen competition, Thales was selected to provide the Communications Control and Management System (CCMS), which is formed around the ‘Partner’ Management System product. Thales are also supplying the associated Tactical and Command and Control (Voice) (TC2V) Internal Communications sub-system which is formed around its Next Generation IP Network (NGIN) product and its specially designed voice terminals, which are deployed in Navies around the world.

In addition, Thales has been selected by the ACA to supply the HF and V/UHF Communications sub-systems, Land Forces BOWMAN, the Broadcast and Alarms sub-system and Self Powered Telephones that will form the fallback system.

Additionally Thales is working with the ACA to carry out integration of these systems, plus closely coupled third party systems, in a state of the art, purpose built facility at the Thales Crawley site. This integration work is set to capitalise on the lessons learned from the Type 45 Project, and deliver integrated and preconfigured systems to the Platform, therefore significantly reducing the time required at Platform to commission and set to work the systems.

During their deployments east of Suez, Daring and Diamond assumed the responsibility of Air Defence lead while patrolling with a U.S. Navy Aircraft Carrier Group and combined naval forces. Dauntless completed an operational patrol of the Falkland Islands and multi-national exercises in the Caribbean and African waters.

Type 45 Destroyers are also fitted with Thales UK’s new fully digital Radar Electronic Support Measures (RESM) system, in addition to S1850M radar (with BAE Systems).

Ed Lowe, head of Thales UK’s naval business said: “A year of operational service is a significant milestone for Thales UK’s Fully Integrated Communications System. The success of these deployments is testament to the work done between Thales, BAE Systems, the Ministry of Defence and the Royal Navy to ensure such a complex system can operate optimally across the full spectrum of missions and environments.”

The Type 45 Destroyer FICS Programme is the latest in service addition to Thales’ long pedigree in supplying Communications Systems to the RN, building on systems supplied to Type 23 Frigates, Landing Platform Helicopter (LPH), Landing Platform Dock LPD(R), and continuing into future platforms such as the Queen Elizabeth Class and Astute Class submarines.

Reading students get career boost after beating Durham and Exeter in national comp - CentAUR,"Tue, 14 May 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlYWRpbmcuYWMudWsvbmV3cy1hcmNoaXZlL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL3ByNTA2MDA4Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A team of University of Reading students has received a career boost after winning a national competition designed to support the next generation of technology talent.

The five team members, all studying different subjects, joined forces to fend off rivals from the Universities of Durham and Exeter to win paid internships at global technology leader Thales.

Universities from across the UK entered the competition which was organised by Thales Group with support from MyKindaCrowd. Reading, Durham and Exeter were short-listed for the final which was held on 8 April 2013 at Thales UK's headquarters in Crawley, West Sussex.

Students were set the task of providing a training solution using readily available technology to design a 'free' (or very low-cost) training system to meet a civil or military training need. Each team had one month to create a training solution that could double as a good business model and a good training solution.

The winning University of Reading team's training solution focussed on cultural naivety. Team 88mph identified a problem with individuals adapting to different cultures when travelling. Their solution trains one individual to interact with another culture, whilst adhering to the culture's social rules. Individuals' success is measured by how closely their responses match an ‘ideal' response.

All three teams were judged on the relevancy of the training system to its field, market and business potential, the level of innovation and the appropriate use of technology used for their proposed training solution.

Chris Borrill, Vice President of Training Solutions at Thales and one of the judges, said

""Often the best ideas are simple, and as technology increasingly makes the world smaller, it seems very fitting that the University of Reading's Team 88mph used technology to help individuals understand the nuances between cultures.

""Team 88mph's use of a multi-disciplinary team resulted in a well structured and well thought-out solution that can be applied to a variety of applications such as helping humanitarian aid personnel, corporate sales teams and even Soldiers gaining a better understanding of cultural differences in order to achieve their goals. The team richly deserved to win and we look forward to them joining us in the summer for their placements.""

A recent High Fliers report shows just how important work placements are for securing graduate employment. The study found that a third of jobs will be filled by graduates who have already spent time at a company, through work experience or industrial placements during their degree.

Winning team member John Hill, 23, said: ""The challenge has been an excellent opportunity to meet and work with other dedicated Reading students at a task which has already provided me with a unique example for showcasing my skill sets in interviews. Creating our solution was a particularly interesting exercise and the advice from both Thales and MyKindaCrowd along with presenting to a senior board of directors has been invaluable to my personal development, and this was just from taking part! I strongly recommend it for anyone interested in participating next year.""

Between January 2011 and January 2012 the Factory Acceptance Tests for all three radars were performed and in 2011 and 2012 the systems were installed on the three ships of this class: HDMS Iver Huitfeldt, HSMS Peter Willemoes and HDMS Niels Juel.



Thales Nederland CEO Gerben Edelijn says: “This SAT demonstrates our capability to maintain the highest possible level of product quality over a long period of time. We are proud of the excellent relation with the Royal Danish Navy.”



Following this SAT, there will be a Harbour Acceptance Test later this year to test the ship’s Anti Air Warfare and Fire Control capabilities. The program is scheduled to end early 2014.



About APAR

APAR (Active Phased Array Radar) is a multi-function radar (MFR) capable of fulfilling various tasks simultaneously; automatic detection and tracking of low altitude targets (e.g. sea skimmers), detection and tracking of air targets and missile guidance support. It is designed for the terminal guidance (CW/ICWI) requirements of SM-2 and ESSM missiles. ICWI is Interrupted Continuous Wave Illumination. This feature enables a single fire control radar to control several missiles simultaneously, thereby greatly enhancing a ship's defence capabilities.



The APAR antenna consists of four arrays, each array composed of more than 3000 very small radar transmitter/receiver (T/R) elements. The combination of T/R modules in one array can generate narrow beams that can be pointed in any direction within a cone of about 140 degrees in azimuth and 85 degrees in elevation. Combined, the four arrays cover the full 360 degrees. Switching from one beam to another can be done very rapidly. The use of so many T/R modules gives this radar unique performance and high operational availability.

The inherent agility of APAR guarantees a high performance in the most adverse conditions, under severe electronic protection measures."

Lithgow Arms LA101 CrossOver: First civilian firearm mass-produced in Australia in over four decades - - The Firearm Blog,"Thu, 23 May 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZpcmVhcm1ibG9nLmNvbS9ibG9nLzIwMTMvMDUvMjMvbGl0aGdvdy1hcm1zLWxhMTAxLWNyb3Nzb3Zlci1jaXZpbGlhbi1maXJlYXJtLW1hc3MtcHJvZHVjZWQtYXVzdHJhbGlhLWRlY2FkZXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Australia’s famous Lithgow factory, which originally opened just before the first world war to produce Enfield rifles for British Commonwealth troops, stopped producing civilian rifles decades ago and instead focused on military weapons, such as the Australia/New Zealand variants of the FN FAL and Steyr AUG rifles. I was surprised to learn that Winchester Australia have partnered with Thales (owner of the Lithgow factory) to start producing a new tactical/hunting-style bolt action rifle called the Lithgow Arms LA101 CrossOver. The rifle will be officially unveiled at the Melbourne Shot Expo this weekend.

The rifles feature a heavy barrel and a wide forend for bench shooting. The stock is made of the same injection molded nylon as Australia’s new Thales EF88 (F90) service rifle. The pistol grip is described as “more upright” (I believe that tactical-style guns cannot be exported from Australia, so this might be as close to a “tactical” pistol grip they could make without giving up the option of exporting it).

Initially the Lithgow Arms LA101 CrossOver will be offered in 22 LR, .22 WMR and .17 HMR. These will be followed by a center-fire variant chambered in .223 Rem. and .308 Win.

Hopefully this will be first of many new guns from Lithgow. I don’t know when (or if) they plan on exporting these guns to the USA, but I would not be surprised to see Winchester importing them next year or the following year.

Many thanks to Nigel for the tip."
