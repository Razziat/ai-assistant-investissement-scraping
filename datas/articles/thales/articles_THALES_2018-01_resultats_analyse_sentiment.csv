Thales acquires Gemalto in huge digital security deal - SecureIDNews,"Wed, 03 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlY3VyZWlkbmV3cy5jb20vbmV3cy1pdGVtL3RoYWxlcy1hY3F1aXJlcy1nZW1hbHRvLWh1Z2UtZGlnaXRhbC1zZWN1cml0eS1kZWFsL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales acquires Gemalto in huge digital security deal

Gemalto soon will have a new owner. The digital security services provider says it has reached an acquisition agreement with France-based aerospace and defense group Thales in a deal worth approximately $5.5 billion.

The deal, which followed Gemalto’s rejection of an acquisition offer from France-based information technology company Atos, will create a digital services behemoth. Thales said it plans to combine its own digital services under the Gemalto brand, and operate it as one of Thales’ seven global business units.

Gemalto is well advanced in its transition from its historical markets to the fast-growing government, enterprise security, and industrial Internet of Things markets

The deal comes amid a major digital technology push from Thales, which in the last three years has invested more than $1.1 billion to beef up its prowess in such areas as cybersecurity, artificial intelligence and data analytics. “The integration of Gemalto strongly accelerates this strategy, reinforcing Thales’s digital offering, across its five vertical markets—aeronautics, space, ground transportation, defense and security,” Thales said. “The combination creates a powerhouse with a solution portfolio including security software, expertise in biometrics and multifactor authentication and the issuance of secure digital and physical credentials.”

To up digital identity expertise Thales acquires Gemalto

The deal also gives Thales the wide expertise built up over the years by Gemalto, its technology, experience and employees helping Thales strengthen its offerings in digital security systems, including technology that helps to protect governments, airports and data. Gemalto’s offerings include digital security for enterprise and the cloud—which spills over into the Internet of Things—along with EMV chip cards, NFC for mobile phones, SIM cards, and authentication for online banking.

“I am convinced that the combination with Thales is the best and the most promising option for Gemalto and the most positive outcome for our company, employees, clients, shareholders and other stakeholders,” said Philippe Vallée, Gemalto CEO. “We share the same values and Gemalto will be able to pursue its strategy, accelerate its development and deliver its digital security vision, as part of Thales.”

The deal promises to add more than $3.5 billion in revenue to Thales’ balance sheets. Thales is buying Gemalto at a time of rapid change for the company. “Gemalto is well advanced in its transition from its historical markets to the fast-growing government, enterprise security, and industrial Internet of Things markets, with significant growth potential both in revenue and margin terms,” Thales said. It will finance the deal through cash and new debt. Thales expects the deal to close in the second half of 2018.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9125237464904785}",positive,0.9125237464904785,1

Thales Introduces a Protected Ambulance Based on Bushmaster MR6 - Defense Update,"Wed, 24 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vZGVmZW5zZS11cGRhdGUuY29tLzIwMTgwMTI0X2J1c2htYXN0ZXJfbXI2Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales unveiled a new version of its Bushmaster protected vehicle the company proposes for the British Army future Multi-Role Vehicle (Protected) – MRV(P) mission. At the International Armoured vehicles in London, the company displayed the ambulance variant and is also offering a troop carrier configuration – two of seven configurations required by the British Army.

The Bushmaster MR6 is a new version based on the combat-proven, protected mobility Bushmaster vehicle. the new model offers an increased level of protection, with an improved blast and ballistic protection, optional new RPG and additional fire protection capability.

To support the additional weight the vehicle is powered by a new, 330hp EURO-3 compliant engine matched with a six-speed automatic transmission. Improved suspension, anti-lock braking system (ABS) which are mandatory safety features for the UK, are also featured. The central tire inflation system is improved with faster inflation. The vehicle also has a bi-directional winch for recovery operations. It has the maximum range of 800km. It is also capable of fording 1.50-meter deep water.

With extended rear compartment, the MR6 has an increased protected space and with increased suspension it has a capacity to carry additional loads of up to two tons, and has an increased troop capacity, accommodating 10 troops, in addition to the two crew members. The vehicle can carry an overhead gunner position, unmanned weapon station or gun turret mounting various weapons, up to 30mm guns.

The vehicle is designed to address British requirements with Ground Vehicle Architecture (GVA) compliant integral computing system (ICS). It is equipped with 360 AMP alternator and power management system that enables delivery of up to eight kilowatts external power with an optional auxiliary power unit (APU).

The Bushmaster is produced in Australia by Thales’ local subsidiary. Minister for Defence Industry, the Hon Christopher Pyne MP, encouraged the Australian company’s decision entry to the British competition. “Like the Bushmasters operated by the Australian Defence Force, its innovative design protects passengers from explosive devices and has proven itself time and again on operations in high-risk environments, saving countless lives.” Pyne said, adding that “Thales has invested significantly in the design of the new vehicle at its Vehicle Centre of Excellence facility in Bendigo, Victoria. This work enhances the vehicle’s operational capability and increases its competitiveness on the global stage,” he said.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9998761415481567}",positive,0.9998761415481567,1
"Now a gym owner, Thales Leites talks retirement plans and future in UFC - MMA Fighting","Thu, 25 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1tYWZpZ2h0aW5nLmNvbS8yMDE4LzEvMjUvMTY5MzE3NzAvbmV3LWd5bS1yZXRpcmVtZW50LXBsYW4tdGhhbGVzLWxlaXRlcy1pZ25vcmVzLXByZXNzdXJlLWJlZm9yZS11ZmMtZmlnaHTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"NITEROI, Brazil — Thales Leites is getting close to retiring from mixed martial arts, and he’s already working on his next endeavors.

The former UFC middleweight title contender has been fighting professionally since 2003, entering the Octagon 20 times in two runs as a UFC fighter, and recently opened his gym in his hometown of Niteroi, Brazil.

”It’s different. I like it,” Leites said of life as a gym owner. “We have a Nova Uniao training center in Niteroi now, with my own students, something I never had before. I taught jiu-jitsu in Hawaii for six months before in 2004, but it wasn’t my team. I have my students now, I have a place to train close to home. I’ve always wanted to bring Nova Uniao to Niteroi, so now I don’t depend on going to Rio de Janeiro all the time to train.”

The training center also includes muay thai classes with Emerson Falcao, Jose Aldo’s striking coach, and other martial arts training, since its opening in August 2017.

Opening your own business during a crisis that Brazil is going through for the last few years is not as an easy task. In fact, it might be as tough as being a professional fighter.

”That’s a really tough question. I honestly don’t know which one is tougher,” Leites said. “They are both insane, you really need to want it.”

Leites will turn 37 in June, and says that the new gym in Icarai, Niteroi, is part of his retirement plans.

”For sure, no doubt about it,” he said. “That’s something I love doing, that’s the legacy I want to leave. I want to teach what I know, so people can live that as well. If you keep knowledge for yourself, it means nothing. It’s only worth it if you share it.”

The longtime veteran already has a date in mind for the end of his journey as a MMA fighter.

”I think about fighting while God gives me health,” Leites said, “but I think about fighting until I’m 39, so if I fight two, two and half years more, I’ll be satisfied.”

Leites fought for the last time in October, losing to Brad Tavares via unanimous decision at UFC 216. Opening his own gym two months before a fight wasn’t a distraction and didn’t affect him at all, he says. In fact, Leites explains that it wasn’t a drastic change compared to his previous training camps.

”I still train in Rio, but not as much as I used to before,” he said. “I always did my conditioning training, muay thai and jiu-jitsu training in Niteroi, and went to Rio for boxing, wrestling and sparring. I’m not going to Rio that often anymore, so it hasn’t changed much before my last fight.”

On a 2-4 run since July 2015, a big drop compared to his five-fight winning streak since returning to the company in 2013, Leites targets late-March or early-April as an ideal time frame for his next fight, and won’t worry about extra pressure on his shoulders.

”Every athlete has pressure, especially in the UFC, but I don’t pay too much attention to it,” Leites said. “When I was coming off two losses and fought Chris Camozzi, I didn’t pay worry about it and had an excellent performance. The thing is, work hard and believe it. It’s like Mad Max, two men get in and only one gets out. One man will win and one man will lose, and you have to know how to deal with that.

”We analyze the fight and change what wasn’t good. We make sure to watch the mistakes we’ve made, but every opponent is different. Sometimes you made a mistake because your opponent forced that, so you have to analyze that as well. The secret is to continue working to evolve as a fighter.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998632669448853}",neutral,0.9998632669448853,0
Thales SuperCam laser prepares to follow ChemCam to Mars in 2020 - Thales,"Mon, 22 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi93b3JsZHdpZGUvZ3JvdXAvcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZS90aGFsZXMtc3VwZXJjYW0tbGFzZXItcHJlcGFyZXMtZm9sbG93LWNoZW1jYW0tbWFycy0yMDIw0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"NASA has begun building the Mars 2020 rover and integrating the instruments it will carry. The Mars 2020 mission will follow in the footsteps of Curiosity, which has been exploring Gale Crater on the surface of Mars for five and a half years, and will continue the search for evidence of past life. The Mars 2020 rover will look much like its predecessor, but will boast a number of innovations, including instruments never before sent to the Red Planet.

Selected again for NASA’s Mars exploration programme, Thales has now delivered the laser for the SuperCam instrument to the French space agency CNES, which is partnering NASA for Mars 2020. The SuperCam laser developed by Thales is an evolved version of the ChemCam laser on Curiosity.

The ChemCam laser developed by Thales for CNES was the first-ever power laser to operate on another planet. ChemCam is still hard at work on Mars and has fired over 500,000 times to date.

The SuperCam laser developed by Thales is an evolved version of ChemCam. As well as the laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) system used on ChemCam, the SuperCam instrument also features a non-destructive Raman spectroscopy mode for the analysis of molecular vibration energies. This analysis technique has never been tested on Mars and will be used to look for the possible indicators of life.



The powerful image of the Curiosity rover arriving on Mars in 2012 regularly came to mind during the development of SuperCam — especially when we were making choices that could impact the laser’s robustness and durability.

Eric Durand, head of the SuperCam programme at Thales’s optronics business

Delivering the new SuperCam laser is a real challenge, not least because it packs additional functions into a unit the same size as the ChemCam laser, as well as the system that allows operators to switch between the LIBS and Raman modes.

Beyond the size restrictions, the teams have also significantly increased the instrument’s analysis capabilities. The SuperCam laser can produce 10 times as many shots in burst mode for faster sampling — 1,000 shots per burst, compared to a maximum of 100 with ChemCam and at a frequency three times higher (10 Hz). All this has been achieved in an extremely short timeframe of just three years, whereas a typical space programme would have a development cycle of nearer 10 years.

Thales has made innovation a core strategic priority and believes that real innovation hinges on the ability to harness creativity to meet actual customer needs and develop disruptive technologies. The company’s high-power lasers help advance research with practical applications in industry, nuclear energy and the medical sector. A total of almost 60 laser systems are in operation worldwide.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998722076416016}",neutral,0.9998722076416016,0

JetBlue's A320 retrofit finally underway - PaxEx.Aero,"Wed, 24 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiKWh0dHBzOi8vcGF4ZXguYWVyby9qZXRibHVlLWEzMjAtcmV0cm9maXQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The long awaited JetBlue A320 retrofit or “cabin restyling” program is now underway. The project – a gut rebuild of the aircraft interior for more than 100 airplanes – began this week with the first aircraft ferrying to Greensboro, North Carolina where the work will be completed. The project will see new seats, sidewalls, LED-based mood lighting and overhead bins installed, among other updates. The first aircraft is expected to emerge from maintenance at the end of Q1 to reenter revenue service. This project was first announced in November 2014 and has seen multiple delays, mostly due to vendor issues.

Each retrofit aircraft will feature 162 seats, up from the current 150 but down from the 165 initially announced for the retrofit program. The seats (Pinnacle, by B/E Aerospace aka Rockwell Collins aka UTC) will include the LiveTV4 entertainment system with in-seat monitors that are significantly larger, brighter and higher resolution than the current kit. The LTV4 kit includes 100+ channels of live television and on-demand movies; all entertainment options are complimentary. Passengers will also have adjustable headrests, USB & 110V power and water bottle holders throughout the aircraft. These JetBlue A320 retrofit features generally match the A321 fleet flying today.

The company will also redesign the aircraft entryway to add a crew storage closet and additional galley work space. With the additional flight attendant and 12 additional passengers on board the battle for overhead bin space will become more significant. Giving some of the crew a space to store bags outside of the bins is a win for everyone involved, though it is doubtful the extra closet is enough to offset the bin needs of 13 additional people in the cabin.

The retrofit work is spectacularly delayed, owing to issues with vendors Thales and Zodiac. In late 2016 JetBlue called out Thales for delays in delivering its STV+ product for the A320s. That delay carried through to 2017 and over the summer Thales conceded that the STV+ solution would not fly on JetBlue aircraft, “We encountered some delays in the development of STV+ and we made the decision with JetBlue to switch to Avant on their aircraft.”

In November 2017 JetBlue confirmed that the higher-end Thales AVANT system would ultimately fly on the A320 fleet. Alas, that implementation could not be effected in time for even the again delayed initial A320 retrofits. To address that challenge the first tranche of A320s will get the LTV4 kit with AVANT coming later.

While the company was waiting out the IFE system delays it discovered issues with the build quality on the new Space-Flex v2 galley/lav combination it first installed on its A321 all-core fleet. In October 2017 the company informed investors that Space-Flex v2 was not up to spec, delaying the retrofit process.

Regarding our cabin restyling program, the industry has experienced design failures with the space efficient lavatories that we have installed on our A321s, and we are planning to install on the A320s. In September, we began repairing the existing A321s. We’re working with Airbus and Zodiac as well as other business partners to ensure these repairs are effective and address the problems we and other airlines have experienced. We’re doing this before we begin modifications on our A320s to avoid having to take aircraft out of service at a later date.

At the time of that announcement the company promised to revisit the situation monthly until the issues were resolved. Turns out January is when that happened.

As the new layout enters service other changes to the JetBlue inflight service will appear. The additional crewmember on board is a FAA requirement (1 for every 50 seats) but it also means more staff pushing the carts up and down the aisles to deliver the free sodas JetBlue is known for. Carts in the aisle will be new for the company and its passengers as of April 2018.

It is unclear if the planned connectivity upgrades tied to the new arrangement with Viasat and the ViaSat-2 satellite will occur as part of these retrofits or on a separate schedule.

"Babcock, Thales, BMT, Harland & Wolff and Ferguson Marine join forces for Type 31 Frigate bid - UK Defence Journal","Mon, 08 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vdWtkZWZlbmNlam91cm5hbC5vcmcudWsvYmFiY29jay10aGFsZXMtYm10LWhhcmxhbmQtd29sZmYtZmVyZ3Vzb24tbWFyaW5lLWpvaW4tZm9yY2VzLXR5cGUtMzEtZnJpZ2F0ZS1iaWQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Babcock, Thales, BMT, Harland & Wolff and Ferguson Marine have teamed up to form ‘Team 31’ a consortium to bid for the Type 31 Frigate.

Babcock will act as the overall programme lead, whilst Thales will have overall responsibility for the development of the mission system solution.

Babcock CEO Archie Bethel said:

“Team 31 will allow Babcock and Thales to take forward the key lessons from the Aircraft Carrier Alliance and apply them in a new and highly capable team with Harland & Wolff, BMT and Ferguson Marine.”

Victor Chavez, CEO of Thales UK said:

“Thales UK is delighted to be working with Babcock and our partners as part of Team 31. We recognise the diversity of roles anticipated for Type31e and, together, we will create and exciting, innovative and flexible capability for the Royal Navy based on the best of UK and international technologies in an open-system architecture that will ensure long term value for money.”

The Type 31e frigate will replace five of the Royal Navy’s Type 23 frigates. The other eight Type 23s are already set to be replaced by the upcoming Type 26 ‘City’ class.

Geared towards maritime security and defence engagement, the Type 31e will fulfill roles such as the Fleet Ready Escort duties in home waters, fixed tasks in the South Atlantic, Caribbean and the Gulf, and the UK’s NATO commitments in the Mediterranean.

The vessel will be operated by between 80 and 100 men and women and ‘needs to be sufficiently flexible to incorporate future developments in technology, including unmanned systems and novel weaponry’ say the MoD.

The proposed Type 31e frigates will be built in a modular way, which could see the construction work shared between yards around the UK and assembled at a central hub, most likely in Scotland.

Admiral Sir Philip Jones, First Sea Lord and Chief of Naval Staff, said:

“Through the Queen Elizabeth-class carrier project, we proved to the world – and to ourselves – that Britain still has what it takes to be a great maritime industrial nation. The National Shipbuilding Strategy seeks to build upon this achievement by charting a course towards a more sustainable and competitive industrial base that can support regional growth and prosperity as well as strengthen our national security.

With the Type 31e General Purpose Frigate Programme, the Royal Navy will bring our requirements into line with the demands of the export market to help support that ambition. Mostly excitingly of all, this offers a historic and vital opportunity to increase the size of the Royal Navy in the decades ahead.”

Babcock were originally offering the ‘Arrowhead 120 while BMT were offering the Venator 110, the companies now say that they will be exploring both available designs to determine the best possible option. The companies say that new arrangement draws on the combined strengths of Babcock and BMT and will deliver ‘innovative, capable, affordable and flexible customer solutions, within a fast changing and increasingly demanding environment’.

Craig Lockhart, Managing Director – Naval Marine at Babcock said:

“Babcock and BMT will work closely together to create a strong design alliance at what is an exciting time within UK and International ship design and build.”

Jeremy Berwick, Managing Director for Defence at BMT said:

“This is the beginning of a deeper strategic relationship with Babcock founded on many years of working together successfully both with the Royal Navy and navies around the globe. The T31e programme is the catalyst where excellence of design, innovation and certainty of delivery combine to offer a highly credible contender for the Royal Navy’s next warship. The agreement will provide a strong basis for understanding and serving the different needs of many other navies.”

Both organisations will jointly explore their available designs to determine the best possible option that meets the cost, capability, and delivery requirements of the Royal Navy but we’ve outlined them both below.

Tony Douglas, the Chief Executive Officer of DE&S, said:

“The Type 31e programme will drive the change that is needed through the entire system, because we have set tough time and cost constraints.

The collective challenge for DE&S and industry is to deliver Type 31e in a different, more innovative way than has gone before. I want this to be a transformation in the way we do business – not just in ships and acquisition but across the entire defence equipment and support portfolio.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999913215637207}",neutral,0.999913215637207,0

Thales Australia unveiled its new multi-role protected MR6 vehicle, which it is putting forward for the UK Multi-Role Vehicle Protected programme, at the International Armoured Vehicles (IAV) show in Twickenham London this week.

Building on lessons learned from the original Bushmaster deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan and East Timor, the MR6 includes enhanced levels of blast, ballistic, RPG and fire protection and a “deep V” hull, which Thales says is designed to blast energy away from the crew and protect the complete driveline. A Thales spokesperson at IAV said the vehicle is designed to meet multi-role vehicle requirements for the next 15-to-20 years.

The variant on display at IAV 2018 was the ambulance variant, but the MR6 can be used in more than a dozen different configurations, including as a command and control vehicle, counter-IED route clearance, troop carrier and maintenance vehicle.

The MR6 features a flexible configuration for storage and improved central tyre inflation for enhanced tactical mobility.

The UK Multi-Role Vehicle (Protected) (MRV-P) is designed to provide the British Army with a ""family of adaptable, protected general purpose vehicles for command and logistics. It is broken down into two classes of vehicle: The MRV-P Group 1 for logistics, command and control, and liaison, which Oshkosh's Joint Light Tactical Vehicle is being considered for.

MRV-P Group 2, which the Bushmaster MR6 is being put forward for — alongside General Dynamics' Eagle 6x6 vehicle and ,potentially, a Mercedes-Benz vehicle based on a Unimog chassis — includes Armoured Personnel Carriers (APCs) and protected ambulances.

More than 1,150 of the original Bushmaster protected mobility vehicles have been delivered to Australian, UK, Dutch, Fijian, Japanese and Jamaican defence forces.

We are extremely proud to be launching this new Bushmaster MR6. It demonstrates our absolute commitment to saving soldiers’ lives through continual improvement, taking into account the experiences on the ground and the concrete needs of our customers.

Pierre Bénard, Vice-President in charge of Vehicles and Tactical Systems at Thales

Designed and manufactured by Thales Australia, the new Bushmaster MR6 builds on Bushmaster’s battle-proven capability and continues its record of safety and reliability. Bushmaster’s true “deep V-Hull” deflects blast energy away from the crew providing tremendous protection against land mines and IEDs. This protection has proven itself in numerous operations such as Iraq, Afghanistan or Mali. Now in service in 8 countries, the Bushmaster is used in more than a dozen variant configurations in multiple roles.

Thales invests significantly in new products and applies a continuous improvement strategy in leveraging customer feedback from combat operations. This new tactical platform is designed to meet the needs of the digitised battlespace and is currently being competed in the UK’s Multi-Role Vehicle Protected (MRVP) program, and if successful will create jobs in both Australia and the UK.





Greater protection, mobility and capacity – with the power and management systems to lead in the digitised battlespace

The Bushmaster MR6 sets the new benchmark for protected vehicles in its class. Providing more protection, mobility, capacity and a range of valuable features and options, the vehicle is well positioned to meet customers’ future needs.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999997615814209}",positive,0.9999997615814209,1
“Addictive” manufacturing - Thales,"Mon, 15 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi93b3JsZHdpZGUvc3BhY2UvbmV3cy9hZGRpY3RpdmUtbWFudWZhY3R1cmluZ9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Additive manufacturing, also known as 3D printing, is blossoming! First proven in the medical, auto and aircraft industries, 3D printed objects are now spreading to a wide range of sectors. Part of the company’s digital transformation, additive manufacturing made its appearance at Thales Alenia Space a few years ago. Today, all communications satellites made by the company feature 3D printed parts.



How additive manufacturing works

Additive Manufacturing starts with a digital model, then melts plastic or metal filaments or powders in a large number of superimposed layers to form the virtually finished object. This operation uses a computer-controlled “printing” machine, calling on a 3D digital model in a CAD (computer-aided design) file. Complex single-piece parts can be made using this technique, parts that would be impossible to make using conventional manufacturing processes.

Success Story



In 2017, 45 communications satellites built by Thales Alenia Space as prime contractor were successfully orbited – and all of them were fitted with 3D-printed parts. It all started a few years ago, when a 3D-printed aluminum antenna bracket was fitted to the TurkmenAlem/MonacoSat satellite, in orbit and operational since 2015. The launch pace really picked up over the next two years, with 45 of our satellites launched in 2017, including 40 for the Iridium NEXT constellation. As a result, the number of 3D-printed parts in orbit beat all previous records. An announcement in 2015 said that that the upcoming Koreasat-7 and 5-A satellites (successfully launched in 2017), would include the largest 3D-printed parts ever made in Europe at the time. In the meantime, the record was broken by the RF (radio-frequency) horn and antenna bracket for the Hellas Sat 3/Inmarsat S EAN satellite launched in June 2017… and the race is far from over. Today, all Thales Alenia Space communications satellites use 3D-printed antenna brackets and reflector sleeves.

Everybody’s doing it!



At first a technique only for specialists, additive manufacturing is now gaining aficionados at most of Thales Alenia Space’s facilities. In fact, it has become a standard production process, for a number of good reasons. Depending on the application, making these single-piece parts, instead of assembling a number of pieces using conventional techniques, offers significant weight and cost savings. Furthermore, additive manufacturing provides a high degree of design freedom, and does away with the need for most machine tools. The upshot is that it’s an ideal technology for one-of-a-kind complex parts, or those made in small quantities – especially parts with complex curves, or cavities. Depending on the structure in question, weight savings range from 20 to 50%. Just calling 3D printing a new production process would be far too limiting. On the contrary, it marks a revolution in design, leading to the use of new software and methods, and the emergence of new job fields.



Additive manufacturing for spacecraft: what’s next?



Since 3D printing is still a relatively recent technology, there is quite a bit of leeway to explore and test new applications. The next step for Thales Alenia Space will be to make larger and increasingly complex parts. Among the developments under way is a program to integrate multiple functions – mechanical, thermal and RF for instance – in a single part. Thales Alenia Space is also working on ways to expand the range of materials that can be used with this technology. All Thales Alenia Space-built satellites will eventually incorporate parts made by additive manufacturing.

Two more O3b satellites arrive at launch site - Thales,"Fri, 26 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi93b3JsZHdpZGUvc3BhY2UvbmV3cy90d28tbW9yZS1vM2Itc2F0ZWxsaXRlcy1hcnJpdmUtbGF1bmNoLXNpdGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Two more O3b satellites, manufactured by Thales Alenia Space for SES have arrived at the Guiana Space Center, Europe’s Spaceport in French Guiana, joining two other satellites which arrived on January 11th. This batch of four O3b communications satellites will be launched into medium Earth orbit by Arianespace in March 2018, using a Soyuz rocket. Another batch of four O3b satellites are expected to be delivered and launched in 2019.

These eight new satellites will expand the current O3b constellation of 12 satellites, which has been operational since 2013. Coming from Thales Alenia Space’s clean rooms in Rome, the latest satellites will augment and seamlessly scale the existing O3b constellation. Together, they offer more capacity, enhanced coverage, increased efficiencies and greater reliability. Thanks to these high performance satellites, SES Networks, the data-focused unit of SES, is delivering carrier-grade services to telcos, mobile network operators (MNOs), internet service providers (ISPs), and energy, mobility and government customers.

Orbiting at an altitude of 8,000 kilometers – four times closer to the Earth than geostationary satellites – these Ka-band satellites provide high-speed, low-latency Internet and telecommunications services to consumers and businesses in growing markets.

Forty-five communications satellites built by Thales Alenia Space as prime contractor were orbited last year. This all-time record clearly illustrates the company’s ability to manage several programs simultaneously, especially LEO and MEO satcom constellations. Looking forward, Thales Alenia Space continues to develop breakthrough telecommunications solutions that are even more powerful, integrated and digital.

Stay tuned for the latest news on the upcoming launch of SES’s next four O3b satellites!

Bong Go intervenes in P15.5-B project to acquire PH warships - Rappler,"Tue, 16 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJhcHBsZXIuY29tL25ld3NicmVhay9pbnZlc3RpZ2F0aXZlLzE5MzczMy1kdXRlcnRlLXBoaWxpcHBpbmUtbmF2eS13YXJzaGlwcy1jb250cm92ZXJzeS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This is AI generated summarization, which may have errors. For context, always refer to the full article.

Special Assistant to the President Bong Go issues a blanket denial, saying someone might be using his name. But documents show otherwise.

Part 1

MANILA, Philippines – President Rodrigo Duterte’s right hand man, Special Assistant to the President Christopher “Bong” Go, intervened in the multi-billion-peso project to acquire two brand new frigates or warships for the Philippine Navy (PN), documents obtained by Rappler show.

In January 2017, Go gave Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana a white paper endorsing a supplier that now stands to be selected to provide the critical Combat Management System (CMS) to be installed in the warships. The total project cost is P15.5 billion.

Go’s office also asked a Navy officer involved in the implementation of the project – then Frigate Project Technical Working Group chairman Commodore Robert Empedrad – to a meeting in Malacañang to discuss the selection of the CMS. Empedrad would later submit a written report addressed to Duterte and Go.

Go issued a blanket denial when reached for comment, saying he never intervened in the project. He said he did not give Lorenzana any white paper related to the project nor asked Empedrad to brief him on the CMS selection.

Go said someone might be using his name.

“I have not intervened in the procurement of DND of its computer system for its ships. I have not participated nor intervened, directly or indirectly, in the transactions of DND,” Go told Rappler reporter Pia Ranada.

Lorenzana also denied that Go intervened. But signed documents provided by sources privy to the project showed otherwise.

Big-ticket AFP modernization project

The frigates project is one of the big-ticket modernization projects initiated and practically completed during the administration of Benigno Aquino III, and finalized and signed in the early months of the Duterte administration. It is the Department of National Defense (DND) that conducts bidding for projects of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP).

Hyundai Heavy Industries (HHI) won the bid to build two ships for the Philippine Navy. Under the contract, the South Korean company will also acquire several systems – based on the technical requirements of the Philippine Navy – from secondary suppliers to install in these ships.

The importance of the CMS, considered the heart of warships, cannot be understated. It integrates real-time data from all the ship’s sensors and data from other parties or other nearby ships necessary for situational awareness at sea.

Former Philippine Navy chief Vice Admiral Ronald Mercado stood by another CMS supplier that technical working groups from the Navy selected as most suitable for the warships. (READ: PH Navy relieved after disagreement over P16-B warships)

Mercado’s actions would cost him his post. Just before Christmas last year, he was unceremoniously relieved for alleged insubordination.

The officer that Go asked to meet in Malacañang – now Rear Admiral Robert Empedrad – was installed Navy officer-in-charge in a hastily organized change of command ceremony on December 19, 2017.

The DND has submitted to Malacañang names for Mercado’s permanent successor. Empedrad is among them.

Go’s white paper in January 2017

A year ago, in the first week January 2017, Go gave Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana a white paper expressing preference for Hanwha Thales, another South Korean company, to provide the CMS.

Lorenzana gave the white paper to Mercado. He wrote on an attached Post-it note:

1/12/17

To: Admiral Mercado

Ronald,

This was given to me by Bong Go.

Go over it and prepare a report/rebuttal

to be submitted to the Pres.

(Signature)

The white paper argued “there is no specific logic or justification on the preferred list of PN where seven (7) equipment of Thales are included.” It was referring to the other supplier – Tacticos Thales of The Netherlands – that the Philippine Navy preferred.

It also trashed the Dutch company that supposedly caused many countries “suffering from their poor supports of logistics services and upgrade of their outdated CMS.”

In contrast, the white paper gave a glowing endorsement of Hanwha Thales to counter arguments raised against it.

“Hanwha will provide the Philippine Navy the most economic and effective logistics and upgrade etc (almost free riding or on boarding) after delivery or brand new CMS with the logistics support based on large number of ships and continuous upgrade/modernization policy of Korean Navy with government funding supports,” the white paper read.

Meeting in Malacañang

A week after Go gave Lorenzana the white paper, his office sent a letter to Empedrad inviting him to Malacañang on January 20, 2017, to discuss the CMS Selection.

The letter was signed by Undersecretary Christopher Lao of the Office of the Special Assistant to the President. Rappler has no details about the meeting in Malacañang nor the people who attended it.

Go claimed he didn’t know about it and that Lao had long left his office. (Lao is now Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board CEO and commissioner.)

But Empedrad sent a report to Malacañang 3 days later, dated January 23, 2017, addressed to the President and Go. He upheld that Tacticos Thales was the better supplier of CMS and debunked most of the arguments that favored Hanwha Thales.

Go told Rappler he also didn’t know about this report.

Empedrad wrote, “The Frigate Acquisition Project PMT (Project Management Team) sustains its preference on Tacticos of Thales Nederlands as the CMS for the two PN Frigates.”

The debate did not end there, however. For the rest of the year, the DND and the Navy continued to discuss which company should supply the CMS, delaying the project altogether.

In early December 2017, a supposed copy of Lorenzana’s letter to Duterte circulated in the military. It was calling for the removal of Mercado over his insistence on Tacticos Thales.

When Rappler asked Lorenzana to confirm it, he said, “Look. I did not sign it.” A week later, Malacañang ordered the relief of Mercado. – with reports from Pia Ranada/Rappler.com
