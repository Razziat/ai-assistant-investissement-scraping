Germany's Hensoldt hires Thales executive to lead company - Defense News,"Mon, 08 Jan 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS9pbmR1c3RyeS8yMDI0LzAxLzA4L2dlcm1hbnlzLWhlbnNvbGR0LWhpcmVzLXRoYWxlcy1leGVjdXRpdmUtdG8tbGVhZC1jb21wYW55L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Defense electronics specialist Hensoldt has hired a competitor’s executive as its new leader, the German company announced Monday.

Oliver Dörre will become CEO at Hensoldt and replace outgoing boss Thomas Müller on April 1.

Dörre joins Hensoldt from the French firm Thales, where he led the company’s German arm. Dörre has already started work on Hensoldt’s management board, the company noted.

“The handover process that is now beginning and the familiarisation of Oliver Dörre are part of our long-term succession planning,” Müller said in the statement. “Oliver is the ideal candidate to optimally develop HENSOLDT’s potential in a new defence policy environment and to implement our international growth strategy.”

Dörre is set to take over at Hensoldt amid rising defense budgets around the world. The company estimates business opportunities in the 2024-2028 time period will be worth about €34 billion (U.S. $37 billion), with almost a quarter of that coming from Germany.

The company in November reported nine-month revenue rose 3.2% year over year to €1.14 billion.

Hensoldt provides radar systems used in the Eurofighter jet and the U.S. Navy’s littoral combat ships, as well as optoelectronics for the Leopard tank. It is also leading the sensor development for the European Future Combat Air System program. With sensors at the core of the connected battlefield, Hensoldt expects that business to grow at twice the rate of the overall defense market.

Dörre holds a degree in computer science and worked as a general staff officer in the German Air Force from 1988 to 2010, most recently as a policy officer with a rank of lieutenant colonel in the planning department of the German Defence Ministry. He held several management roles at the tech firm Frequentis before joining Thales in 2015, and then becoming CEO of Thales Germany at the start of 2021.

Thales has appointed Christoph Ruffner to replace Dörre, the company said in a statement. Ruffner will report to Philippe Duhamel, Thales’ executive vice president for defense mission systems. Ruffner previously led the spectrum dominance and airborne solutions division at Hensoldt, where he was a member of the executive committee.

Rudy Ruitenberg is a Europe correspondent for Defense News. He started his career at Bloomberg News and has experience reporting on technology, commodity markets and politics.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999923706054688}",neutral,0.9999923706054688,0

Thales Helping Enterprises Prepare for a Post-Quantum World - Technology Magazine,"Tue, 23 Jan 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaG5vbG9neW1hZ2F6aW5lLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy90aGFsZXMtaGVscGluZy1lbnRlcnByaXNlcy1wcmVwYXJlLWZvci1wb3N0LXF1YW50dW0td29ybGTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Quantum computers have initiated a paradigm shift in the ways researchers think about data security, with research predicting that quantum computers could be able to crack current cryptosystems in as little as five years.

With 61% of organisations yet to define a strategy for a post-quantum world, and with quantum algorithms capable of solving the computational problems that underpin encryption schemes already in development, organisations must take measures to protect their data now.

To help enterprises on this journey, technology and security provider Thales has announced the launch of its PQC Starter Kit in collaboration with Quantinuum, aimed at helping enterprises prepare for Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC). The kit, which the companies say is the first of its kind, provides a trusted environment for businesses to test quantum-hardened PQC-ready encryption keys and understand the implications that quantum computing will have on the security of their infrastructure.

According to a report by DigiCert, almost three-quarters (74%) of organisations today are concerned that bad actors can conduct ‘harvest now, decrypt later’ (HNDL) attacks, in which they collect and store encrypted data with the goal of decrypting it in the future.

Post Quantum Cryptography helps mitigate this threat. As a result, organisations around the world must test their ecosystem applications, data, and devices currently relying upon traditional cryptography to ensure minimal disruption when quantum-safe protocols become mandatory.

“Research suggests that within three years, there is a one in seven chance that quantum computers will break the most used computer encryption systems — this number goes as high as 50% by 2031,” Andersen Cheng, CEO of Post-Quantum told Technology Magazine recently. “Therefore, failing to secure your digital infrastructure against the threat of quantum computing leaves your data and systems vulnerable to attack.”

Post-Quantum resilience should be on the radar of every organisation today

Thales and Quantinuum’s PQC Starter Kit will allow organisations to test within a trusted lab environment. Using current NIST proposed algorithms, customers can test various security use cases and observe the impact of implementing PQC technology in simulated test-lab scenarios, all without impacting operational processes in real-world environments.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9997122883796692}",neutral,0.9997122883796692,0

ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems press release

Four MEKO® 200 HN (Hellenic Navy) frigates have been in service with the Hellenic Navy since the mid-1990s. In order to extend the service life of the fleet, the Navy intends to commission a comprehensive modernization (mid-life upgrade). The original equipment manufacturers of the four MEKO® 200 HN frigates, ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems and Thales, were approached for the modernization program.

Thales and Thyssenkrupp Marine Systems have now joined forces to form a consortium for the planned modernization program. The consortium agreement was signed by both partners on December 12, 2023.

As part of the consortium, ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems is to be responsible for modernizing the ship’s platform. As a system house, ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems will supply not only the design documents but also the communication systems. For this purpose, a subcontract is to be awarded to Hagenuk Marinekommunikation, a subsidiary of ATLAS ELEKTRONIK. Thales will in turn provide the combat system, with the combat management system TACTICOS as its foundation, for the MEKO® 200 HN frigates and assume the role of spokesperson in the partnership consortium based in Hengelo, the Netherlands.

“With the joint contract for the modernization of the frigates, we are once again a strong partner for the Hellenic Navy. On the one hand, this further strengthens our order book and, on the other, underlines our role and strength as a maritime powerhouse that combines electronics, surface, and underwater shipbuilding under one roof. A further milestone on our road to the independence of ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems.”

Oliver Burkhard, CEO of ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems

ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems will subcontract the ship platform modifications to a local Greek shipyard. The consortium will be the exclusive contact for the Hellenic Navy. It is expected that the order will be received in 2024.

PRESS RELEASE — Thales, the leading global technology and security provider, today announced the launch of its PQC Starter Kit in collaboration with Quantinuum. This first-of-its-kind offering helps enterprises prepare for Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC). The kit provides a trusted environment for businesses to test quantum-hardened PQC-ready encryption keys and understand the implications that quantum computing will have on the security of their infrastructure.

While 73% of organizations recognize quantum computing poses a threat to traditional cryptography, 61% have yet to define a strategy for a post-quantum world. Post Quantum Cryptography helps mitigate this threat. As a result, organizations around the world must test their ecosystem applications, data, and devices currently relying upon traditional cryptography to ensure minimal disruption when quantum-safe protocols become mandatory.

Todd Moore, Global Head of Data Security Products at Thales commented: “Thales is excited to offer a new solution to its customers to help them prepare for the implementation of Post-Quantum Cryptography. We understand the enormous challenges and complexities behind this upcoming disruption in cryptography and want to support customers as they transition to these new algorithms.. For organizations unsure of navigating this transition, we highly recommend testing current applications, data, and devices that use cryptographic protection as soon as possible to ensure a smooth shift to PQC. Although quantum computing may seem like a future-looking risk, with hackers using Harvest Now, Decrypt Later tactics, post-quantum resilience should be on every organization’s radar today.”

“Hardening encryption keys is critical for the post-quantum era, and Quantum Origin is a unique technology that provides verifiable quantum randomness to maximize encryption key strength. The combination of Quantum Origin and the Thales HSM is a strong solution for IT teams to help them with their PQC transition. We look forward to working with Thales to help smooth the shift to PQC,” added Duncan Jones, Head of Cybersecurity at Quantinuum.

The PQC Starter Kit will allow organizations to test within a trusted lab environment. Using the current NIST proposed algorithms that are built into the system, customers can test various security use cases including PKI, code-signing, TLS, and IoT, and observe the impact of implementing PQC technology in these simulated test-lab scenarios, all without impacting operational processes in real-world production environments. Organizations will also be able to identify potential weaknesses in their encryption deployment and apply changes to their IT infrastructure to protect themselves.

The first available PQC Starter Kit option incorporates Luna HSMs and Quantinuum’s quantum random number generation (QRNG) technology through which customers can ensure their keys are securely generated and stored while testing the PQC algorithms. The kit offers a choice of Luna HSMs (i.e. appliance or PCIe card) and Quantinuum’s Quantum Origin – the world’s only source of verified quantum entropy. A PQC Starter Kit for network encryption using Thales High Speed Encryptors (HSE) will be available next.

Thales S.A.'s (EPA:HO) Popularity With Investors Is Under Threat From Overpricing - Simply Wall St,"Wed, 03 Jan 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3NpbXBseXdhbGwuc3Qvc3RvY2tzL2ZyL2NhcGl0YWwtZ29vZHMvZXBhLWhvL3RoYWxlcy1zaGFyZXMvbmV3cy90aGFsZXMtc2FzLWVwYWhvLXBvcHVsYXJpdHktd2l0aC1pbnZlc3RvcnMtaXMtdW5kZXItdGhyZWF0LWbSAYgBaHR0cHM6Ly9zaW1wbHl3YWxsLnN0L3N0b2Nrcy9mci9jYXBpdGFsLWdvb2RzL2VwYS1oby90aGFsZXMtc2hhcmVzL25ld3MvdGhhbGVzLXNhcy1lcGFoby1wb3B1bGFyaXR5LXdpdGgtaW52ZXN0b3JzLWlzLXVuZGVyLXRocmVhdC1mL2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"With a price-to-earnings (or ""P/E"") ratio of 23.6x Thales S.A. ( ) may be sending very bearish signals at the moment, given that almost half of all companies in France have P/E ratios under 15x and even P/E's lower than 8x are not unusual. Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the highly elevated P/E.

Recent times have been advantageous for Thales as its earnings have been rising faster than most other companies. The P/E is probably high because investors think this strong earnings performance will continue. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason.

What Are Growth Metrics Telling Us About The High P/E?

If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our .

There's an inherent assumption that a company should far outperform the market for P/E ratios like Thales' to be considered reasonable.

Taking a look back first, we see that the company managed to grow earnings per share by a handy 5.6% last year. This was backed up an excellent period prior to see EPS up by 91% in total over the last three years. Therefore, it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been superb for the company.

Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 12% per annum during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. That's shaping up to be similar to the 10% per year growth forecast for the broader market.

With this information, we find it interesting that Thales is trading at a high P/E compared to the market. It seems most investors are ignoring the fairly average growth expectations and are willing to pay up for exposure to the stock. These shareholders may be setting themselves up for disappointment if the P/E falls to levels more in line with the growth outlook.

The Bottom Line On Thales' P/E

We'd say the price-to-earnings ratio's power isn't primarily as a valuation instrument but rather to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations.

Our examination of Thales' analyst forecasts revealed that its market-matching earnings outlook isn't impacting its high P/E as much as we would have predicted. Right now we are uncomfortable with the relatively high share price as the predicted future earnings aren't likely to support such positive sentiment for long. Unless these conditions improve, it's challenging to accept these prices as being reasonable.

And what about other risks? Every company has them, and we've spotted you should know about.

The projected fair value for Thales is €176 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity

Thales is estimated to be 23% undervalued based on current share price of €135

is 11% less than our estimate of fair value

In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Thales S.A. ( ) by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.

We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model.

Step By Step Through The Calculation

We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.

Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:

10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast

2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 Levered FCF (€, Millions) €1.66b €1.67b €1.72b €1.75b €1.78b €1.80b €1.82b €1.84b €1.86b €1.88b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x7 Analyst x5 Analyst x3 Est @ 1.65% Est @ 1.41% Est @ 1.25% Est @ 1.13% Est @ 1.05% Est @ 0.99% Est @ 0.95% Present Value (€, Millions) Discounted @ 5.6% €1.6k €1.5k €1.5k €1.4k €1.4k €1.3k €1.2k €1.2k €1.1k €1.1k

(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)

Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = €13b

The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (0.9%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 5.6%.

Terminal Value (TV)= FCF 2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = €1.9b× (1 + 0.9%) ÷ (5.6%– 0.9%) = €40b

Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= €40b÷ ( 1 + 5.6%)10= €23b

The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is €37b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of €135, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 23% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.

The Assumptions

Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Thales as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 5.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.820. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.

SWOT Analysis for Thales

Strength Earnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry. Debt is not viewed as a risk. Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows. Weakness Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Aerospace & Defense market. Opportunity Annual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the French market. Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%. Threat Revenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.

Looking Ahead:

Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price? For Thales, we've compiled three fundamental factors you should consider:

Risks: Be aware that , you should know about... Future Earnings: How does HO's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market? Dig deeper into the analyst consensus number for the upcoming years by interacting with our . Other Solid Businesses: Low debt, high returns on equity and good past performance are fundamental to a strong business.

The European Commission signed a Grant Agreement to launch the LATACC project (Land Tactical Collaborative Combat) coordinated by Thales to improve the collaborative capabilities of European coalition forces.

The LATACC project brings together 34 industry players and research institutes (including core team members Thales, Rheinmetall, Leonardo, Indra, Saab, ISD and John Cockerill Defense) from 13 European countries. The project is financed by the European Commission with €49 million of funding from the European Defence Fund.

With the return of high-intensity conflict, the project aims to develop a solution that will optimise and accelerate allied decision-making and response in order to guarantee operational superiority on the battlefield.

The LATACC project aims to enable the different land combat systems being developed by each Member State (such as the Scorpion programme in France, CAMO in Belgium, DLBO in Germany, BMS-ET in Spain, FNEC in Italy, Ledningsstödsystem Mark (LSS Mark) in Sweden, MIME in Norway…) to coordinate their actions in coalition with very short response times, while interfacing with other domains (air, space, cyber) as well as civil systems (5G, etc.).

The LATACC project, coordinated by Thales, is led by a team of experts with proven experience of complex land systems, and will benefit from the partners' strong capacity for innovation in key areas such as cloud technologies, communications, sensors, integration of complex systems, robotics, effectors, AI and system resilience in constrained environments.

Over the next three years, the consortium of the LATACC project bringing together 34 industries will analyse the requirements of European users and conduct a series of studies to identify common operational scenarios, define interoperable open architectures that are compatible with current and future standards, and develop the key technological building bricks needed to produce advanced technology demonstrators.

Trials will be conducted under realistic operational conditions and during large-scale demonstrations to confirm the tactical benefits of land collaborative combat in European coalition operations.

A possible second phase of the LATACC project could develop additional functionalities and bring to maturity the key components developed in the first phase.

This initiative will define a European framework and tactical-level collaboration services to speed up innovation, enhancing interoperability between national programs as well as cooperations such as the future European tanks project, and will help to safeguard the sovereignty of European industry in the field of collaborative combat and the key technologies required to make the concept a reality.

LATACC is a good illustration of federation of a large number of industry players (major companies and SMEs), institutional partners (research institutes, etc.) and government agencies (European defence ministries) to tackle a complex topic with ground-breaking implications and strategic importance for the European defence community.

EU invests $200M in quantum technology to secure communications networks - SDxCentral,"Fri, 19 Jan 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNkeGNlbnRyYWwuY29tL2FydGljbGVzL25ld3MvZXUtaW52ZXN0cy0yMDBtLWluLXF1YW50dW0tdGVjaG5vbG9neS10by1zZWN1cmUtY29tbXVuaWNhdGlvbnMtbmV0d29ya3MvMjAyNC8wMS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In a major step toward securing its communications networks with quantum technologies, the European Union (EU) has commissioned a consortium dubbed Nostradamus to build the test infrastructure for quantum key distribution (QKD). The move is expected to enable the evaluation of QKD devices from European manufacturers.

The consortium is led by Deutsche Telekom (DT), a digitalization partner for the EU and a network provider for several EU institutions. Other partners include French tech company Thales, the Austrian Institute of Technology and experts from across industry and academia.

“The €16 million (around $17.4 million) Nostradamus project has just been launched by the European Commission to provide Europe, in four years’ time, with a center of excellence able to assess the security of these technologies against the most advanced attacks and threats, which only nation-states or state-sponsored actors would be able to implement,” Joan Mazenc, head of licensed security evaluation facilities (ITSEF) at Thales, told SDxCentral.

EU doubles down on quantum technologies

This latest quantum push from the EU aims to pave the way for developing and implementing the European Quantum Communication Infrastructure (EuroQCI), a secure pan-European communication network based on quantum technology.

The infrastructure is intended to provide more security for data centers, communications networks and critical infrastructure such as hospitals and power plants via fiber optics and satellite.

The future encrypted EU satellite network IRIS2 (Infrastructure for Resilience, Interconnectivity and Security by Satellite) is also based on EuroQCI. IRIS2 will provide governments with communications services and network critical infrastructure, and businesses and organizations with fast satellite Internet, according to DT.

“Over the past four years, Europe has invested heavily in quantum technologies with the EuroQCI project, investing nearly €180 million (around $196 million), to develop a robust scientific and industrial ecosystem, foster the emergence of national champions and enable the forthcoming implementation of a secure communications network between member states,” Mazenc said.

Offering certifications to QKD manufacturer

The overall goal of this Nostradamus consortium is to prepare the EU for quantum threats, which requires offering security certification services to QKD product manufacturers, Mazenc noted.

QKD is a technology that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to secure communication and data exchange. The keys for decoding information are sent using single photons — quantum light particles. Any eavesdropping attempt to intercept these photons leaves traces in their physical state.

Mazenc said that the QKD device certifications are awarded by national security agencies, based on security evaluation results provided by licensed security evaluation facilities (ITSEF). It assures that the awarded system is robust against hackers with a holistic approach.

“For QKD devices, in addition to standard threats and attack vectors, hackers may target the quantum link between two devices,” he said. “Evaluating the security of such link, relying on quantum physics principles, is new, requires a dedicated lab and new approaches.”

Thales develops an attack lab for quantum threats

To address these quantum threats, Thales will build a laboratory to simulate and analyze attacks targeting the quantum link, as part of the consortium.

“This laboratory will identify methods for evaluating ground-based quantum key devices, based on fiber optic technology,” Mazenc noted.

He added the lab will be designed and developed in Toulouse, France, which is the heart of the European space ecosystem. Around 2027, the lab will be transferred to a location that the European Commission is still keeping secret.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999823570251465}",neutral,0.9999823570251465,0

Thirdstream, a Canada-based account onboarding FinTech company, has extended its collaboration with Thales, a global leader in advanced technologies in digital identity and security.

The partnership aims to reshape the landscape of identity verification solutions for financial institutions, introducing in-person document scanners and reader technology to support identity verification (IDV) solutions for bank branches.

Haider Iqbal, Director Product Marketing, IAM at Thales, stated, “Thales is looking forward to providing a seamless and secure in-branch ID proofing experience for both financial institutions and their customers in a time of increased risk from fraud and growing regulatory requirements.”

Focused on addressing in-person fraud attempts in financial services, Thales’ Intelligent document reader solutions authenticate or capture data from electronic travel and government-issued identity documents quickly and reliably.

Since 2020, Thirdstream has used the Thales’ IdCloud platform to offer remote know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) services for digital banking benefiting from mobile devices to capture images from government issued photo IDs and selfies. The document is checked for authenticity and the ID photo is matched against the selfie, with liveness detection to guarantee a live person is performing the request.

By leveraging Thales’ expertise in secure digital identity and Thirdstream’s continually deepening relationships with Canadian banks, credit unions, and trust companies, this collaboration will bring even more advanced identity verification options to the market.

This collaboration promises to set a new benchmark for secure, convenient, and efficient in-person identity verification solutions in the Canadian market. Further announcements are expected before the end of the year.

“The expansion of our partnership reflects on both companies’ commitment to remain at the forefront of innovation for the financial services industry,” added Keith Ginter, thirdstream’s CEO. “This advancement elevates the standards for identity verification in Canada. We are creating what some refer to as a ‘friction-right’ experience for consumers, which, research shows, is the single greatest contributor to defeating identity theft.”","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9996084570884705}",positive,0.9996084570884705,1

Thirdstream will supply ID document scanner devices from Thales to Canadian financial institutions to enable them to read and check the authenticity of government-issued travel and identity documents. Thirdstream notes in an announcement that Thales’ scanners have been proven in deployments at international borders and other applications.

The scanners are being integrated with Thirdstream’s configurable onboarding platform to provide a seamless customer experience and ensure regulatory compliance.

Fraud attempts have spiked in the financial services sector, according to the announcement, raising the need for protection against both in-person and remote attacks.

The two companies are already partners: Thirdstream has been using Thales’ IdCloud platform to provide remote KYC and AML checks through ID document, selfie biometrics checks and liveness detection since 2020.

“The expansion of our partnership reflects on both companies’ commitment to remain at the forefront of innovation for the financial services industry,” says Keith Ginter, Thirdstream’s CEO. “This advancement elevates the standards for identity verification in Canada. We are creating what some refer to as a ‘friction-right’ experience for consumers, which, research shows, is the single greatest contributor to defeating identity theft.”

Video IDV for legal profession

The rules for identity verification via video conferencing by lawyers and paralegals in the Canadian province of Ontario have been updated, effective January 1, 2024.

Legal professionals are now required to authenticate the government-issued photo ID of people on video conferences, rather than simply view both the person and their ID during the call.

There are three options available to legal professionals to carry out authentication. They can accept ID scans through the client’s mobile phone or computer, obtain consistent biographic information from two sources defined by the Law Society of Ontario as reliable, or perform a credit file check, if the credit file has three years of history.

If they chose the ID-scanning method, lawyers and paralegals must also apply technology to confirm the authenticity of the document. The Law Society of Ontario provides a list of services that can be used, provided by 1Kosmos, Applied Recognition, AuthenticID, bluink, Folio Technologies, Treefort, Trulioo and Vaultie Digital Trust Solutions. The list is non-exhaustive however, and a link is also provided to a directory compiled by the Digital Identification and Authentication Council of Canada (DIACC), which includes FaceTec, iProov, Jumio, Regula and Thales, among others.

LinkedIn

Have you ever wondered, as you roam the floor at an event like the International Armoured Vehicles Conference (IAVC), how far back in history you would have to go before the equipment you’re seeing became unrecognisable, even to a trained military mind?

Given this year’s IAVC theme – ‘How will we fight in the future?’ – it’s a question that commands more than idle speculation. Perhaps, if people try to view the present through the eyes of the past, they stand a better chance of glimpsing how warfare will evolve in the years and decades ahead.

Consider the vehicles themselves. It’s hard to imagine a Napoleonic artilleryman knowing what to make of a Challenger II. If, however, he saw it rumbling across the battlefield in his direction he would, no doubt, quickly come to appreciate its utility.

Then consider some of the more abstract systems. Although a WW2 veteran might be nonplussed by a term such as C6ISR, they’d soon grasp the concept itself if you started by defining command and control, and went step by step from there.

What history can teach us about the future of warfare

The specific utility of asking what a mid-20th-Century soldier would make of the systems the defence industry is developing is threefold.

First of all, it keeps organisations like Thales, as industry suppliers, humble. It reminds them that the essential nature of warfare doesn’t change. However sophisticated industry believes their equipment to be, the fundamental principles – and the fundamental risks – are the same.

Second, it prompts industry suppliers to look beyond the PQQs, ITNs and long lists of technical requirements, and to appreciate ‘the need behind the need’. While the essential nature of warfare doesn’t change, it’s vital to understand its ever-changing character if industry is to help deliver an enduring, battle-winning edge to our armed forces. Suppliers must always remember that, whether new technologies guide, enable or respond to changes in how we fight, the technology itself is of no inherent value outside of its purpose – and that purpose, if it changes at all, often does so very slowly.

Take, for example, a tank sight. In many essential respects, the central purpose of Thales’ work in this area remains unchanged: to enable users, as the adage goes, to ‘see first, shoot first, hit first’. Look beyond the lasers, the thermal imaging technology, the tracking systems and the threat-detection algorithms, and you’ll find that a system like the Panoramic Above Armour Gimbal (PAAG) is simply the latest incarnation in a long and uninterrupted line of optics and optronics dedicated to keeping troops safe and making them more effective.

Again, let’s imagine strapping a veteran of the Mark IV Churchill into a contemporary, PAAG-equipped infantry fighting vehicle. Although they might not understand what makes all this twenty-first century technology so great, they’d have no trouble at all grasping how great it would make them. The PAAG lets them see for miles in every direction in any weather, day or night. It lets them identify threats and engage targets at long range. Perhaps most importantly, it lets them do all this while on the move and without anyone needing – quite literally – to stick their neck out.

It might take a little longer for this veteran to appreciate how all this technology, as well as accelerating the OODA loop, reduces the cognitive burden in an operating environment that’s arguably more complex, fluid and fast moving than it’s ever been. After all, AI systems like Thales’ DigitalCrew don’t make warfighting less mentally demanding; they simply enable users to focus their abilities where they’re going to make the biggest impact, offloading the tasks that machines excel at so that operators can focus on applying their uniquely human skills – their experience, their imagination and their judgement – to the mission.

But when you start putting all this cutting-edge hardware and software together, when you start building systems of systems, you don’t just start doing things differently, better and faster, you’re able to start doing different things altogether.

Only connect: how networked systems will change how we fight

And that’s the third reason we should be looking at contemporary technology through a historical lens when people think about how we’ll fight in the future.

It’s been said that ‘the only creation of Graham Bell’s that was more important than the world’s first telephone, was the world’s second telephone’. In the context of today’s optronics, sensors, and software-defined hardware, you could make a similar point. Capabilities like the PAAG are individually extraordinary but, taken collectively and effectively networked, they’re nothing short of revolutionary. Their potential to change how we fight is, to extend the analogy, as great as the potential of a telephone network to support not just conversations but a World Wide Web.

Take, for example, collaborative combat. The name suggests ‘interoperation’ but it’s so much more than that. Truly collaborative combat is the fusion of soldiers, systems and data to form a single instrument, operating in total synergy and with near-zero latency.

The concept extends beyond the individual team or vehicle. Whereas a single vehicle might in the past have been responsible for identifying, prioritising and engaging a given threat, now those tasks can be swiftly and optimally apportioned across a troop or squadron. Surveillance and sighting systems like the PAAG are typical (as well as critical) enablers of collaborative combat.

The further you step back from the tactical level to the strategic, the greater the potential of collaborative combat to enhance safety and mission success. The advantages increase as the mass of personnel increases and as vehicles and sensors, linked by common architectures, proliferate.

Threats diversify, strategies evolve, but the mission remains the mission

Concepts like this – ones that accommodate changes to the character of war instead of trying to anticipate them – are going to be increasingly important. It is evident that threats will continue to diversify and proliferate, but it’s impossible to know how. The sector also knows that the Army’s strategies, tactics and technical capabilities will need to evolve in line with modernisation and transformation priorities laid out in the Land Industrial Strategy and that the commercial frameworks, through which industry and academia deliver, need to change, hence the importance of initiatives like Programme Mercury, which aims to transform ways of working between MOD and industry.

But some things don’t and won’t change. Innovation, technical or otherwise, will always be crucial but the British Army’s continued success will ultimately depend, as it has always depended, on its readiness, ability and willingness to fight that much harder and that much smarter than its adversaries – and for that much longer.

This means that the role of industry suppliers will remain unchanged, too. The work of industry may occasionally initiate or anticipate change but, more often, it will need to allow the armed forces to accommodate, adapt to and exploit it.

So next time you’re attending an event like IAVC, take a moment and consider what you’re seeing through that historical lens and ask: Why does it exist? Does it do what it’s designed to do? More importantly – and with an eye to the future – ask yourself what it could enable that it’s not designed to enable.

To find out more, visit Thales at IAVC, Stand F1, where you’ll be able to get hands on with the PAAG and go to the outdoor exhibition space to sit inside Hawkei, Thales’ next generation protected vehicle.

The partnership between Hellas Sat and Thales Alenia Space aims to provide cutting-edge communication services with very high data rates from geostationnary orbit. This innovative payload aims to connect with Optical Ground Station of the National Athens Observatory in Greece, Optical Ground Stations in France, Optical Ground Stations of ESA and Thales Alenia Space’s LEO HydRON telecommunication satellite.

After Vertigo H2020 programme, Thales Alenia Space is currently advancing the development of very high data rate capacities (up to 1 terabit/second) facing long distances from ground to geostationnary orbit and cross-atmospheric turbulence, with support from France Relance (CO-OP), CNES (DYSCO) and ESA (HydRON).

The MoU signing ceremony took place at Hellas Sat’s headquarters in Athens, Greece, with representatives from the Prime Minister’s Office, the French embassy in Greece, ESA, CNES, Thales Alenia Space France, Italy and Switzerland, the National Athens Observatory, along with various Greek ministries and local authorities in attendance.

Christodoulos Protopapas, CEO of Hellas Sat, stated: “We are honoured to work once again with Thales Alenia Space in the realm of optical communication technology, introducing the optical connectivity communication services to the European and International market thus effectively achieving the implementation of new technologies and sealing a new era.”

Free Space Optical laser Communications are emerging as a space standard, offering significantly greater capacities compared to current satcom systems (terabit/sec vs. gigabit/sec). This technology is poised to revolutionise space telecommunication infrastructure, similar to the impact of optical fibre on the ground.

Various use cases include universal internet access, direct data transmission from observation satellites at any time, private links to data center and optical fiber redundancy on the ground in case of crises. Introducing optical fibre in space is expected to reduce the need for a high number of satellites in orbit, contributing to the sustainability of space infrastructure and minimising sky pollution.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999933242797852}",neutral,0.9999933242797852,0

According to the manufacturer, Hawkei is “a light, versatile and C4I integrated vehicle, offering first-of-its-kind protection, mobility and payload alongside advanced mission system integration, making it adaptable and scalable to operational requirements. Described as a ‘force multiplier’ for the Australian Defence Force, the 1000th Hawkei was recently lifted off the production line in Thales’ vehicle manufacturing facility in Bendigo, Victoria.”

Back in mid-December, Thales UK gave us a heads-up that Hawkei would be exhibited in the UK this week and invited us to catch up on the vehicle during its UK outing (at an event which we had attended in previous years and to which I had previously registered for 2024 press accreditation). Unfortunately, a few days ago the event organisers told us they would not be admitting JOINT-FORCES this year. We are sure our many of readers will be disappointed not to have been brought up to speed on the current configuration Hawkei, so as a consolation we have delved into our archives to find images of a pre-production vehicle which toured the UK and French defence expo circuit in 2014 and we have supplemented these photos with a few more recent ADoD images taken in more tactical situations.

Quoting Thales:-

Hawkei is a 10-tonne, 4×4, new generation protected vehicle with a 3-tonne payload, designed to meet the demanding requirements of land forces world-wide.

Hawkei delivers class-leading protection, mobility and payload with unparalleled levels of blast and ballistic protection for a helicopter transportable vehicle

Highly effective across a diverse range of mission profiles

Designed for current and future integrated C4I systems.

Currently produced in both 4-door and 2-door versions, able to transport five or three troops respectively in an air-conditioned protected crew cell, Hawkei has an already high level of built-in blast and ballistic protection but can be further enhanced with an appliqué armour package that can be adapted to meet the threat environment. Powered by a 200kW (268hp) twin-turbo Euro-compliant diesel engine with 8-speed automatic transmission, Hawkei has a maximum road speed of 115km/h or 72mph and a range in excess of 600km or 375 miles. It is capable of being underslung by CH-47F Chinook helicopters, but is too large to fit inside, though it can easily be transported inside C-130 Hercules or A-400M Atlas transport aircraft.

Basic dimensions for the 4-door Hawkei are 5780mm long by 2400mm wide by 2300mm high to top of roof and GVW is 10,400kg. Either a pulpit ring or remote weapon station can be fitted, and weapons can include machine gun up to 12.7mm, 30mm cannon, 40mm automatic grenade launcher, or a guided rocket or missile system. In 2-door logistics / utility vehicle version Hawkei can carry a cargo payload up to 3000kg.

With the UK now looking to replace and consolidate its current ageing mixed wheeled vehicle fleet, as part of the Protected Mobility Pipeline / PMP programme, which incorporates the former UK GSUP programme, with the HUSKY TSV de-fielded with many gifted to Ukraine, and with plans to procure the Oshkosh JLTV as part of the UK Multi-Role Vehicle – Protected / MRV-P programme (which replaced the cancelled Operational Utility Vehicle System / OUVS programme) stalled, it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that Hawkei might yet be procured for UK Land Forces.

Thales and Thyssenkrupp Marine Systems have formed a consortium to oversee this program, with both partners signing an agreement on December 12, 2023. Under this consortium, ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems will be responsible for modernizing the ship's platform and providing design documents and communication systems. The subcontracting for communication systems will be awarded to Hagenuk Marinekommunikation, a subsidiary of Atlas Elektronik. Thales will supply the combat system, using the combat management system TACTICOS as its foundation, and acting as the consortium's spokesperson from their base in Hengelo, the Netherlands.

To execute the ship platform modifications, ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems plans to subcontract the work to a local Greek shipyard. The consortium will serve as the exclusive point of contact for the Hellenic Navy, with expectations of receiving the order for the modernization program in 2024.

This endeavor aligns with the Hellenic Navy's broader goal of enhancing the capabilities of its MEKO 200 frigates, part of the Hydra class, consisting of HS Hydra (F 452), HS Spetsai (F 453), HS Psara (F 454), and HS Salamis (F 455). These frigates, originally designed in Germany as part of the MEKO group of modular warships, have been in service since the mid-1990s.

The program's history dates back to 1988 when it was initiated with partial funding through Foreign Military Sales (FMS) aid, aiming to construct six vessels. The first Hydra-class ship, HS Hydra, was commissioned in 1992, with the remaining vessels experiencing delays due to financial constraints and the acquisition of Dutch Kortenaer-class frigates.

In 2007, an upgrade to the STIR fire control system enabled the firing of RIM-162 ESSM surface-to-air missiles. The first upgraded vessel, Salamis, completed a live firing test in August 2008, followed by the remaining three ships.

Although Greek Defense Minister Panos Kammenos announced the modernization of the four vessels in 2018, details were scarce at the time. The Joint Chiefs of General Staff Council (ΣΑΓΕ) decided to commence the modernization program in May 2019, and it was finally approved by the Greek Parliament in April 2023.

The Hydra-class frigates have a standard displacement of 3,360 tons, increasing to 4,000 tons when fully loaded. They measure 117.5 meters in length, with a beam of 14.8 meters and a draught of 6.0 meters. Propulsion is provided by two-shaft CODOG with controllable pitch propellers, two General Electric LM2500 gas turbines, and two MTU 20V 956 diesel engines, allowing them to reach speeds of up to 31 knots with gas turbines and 21 knots when operating on diesel engines alone.

Equipped with various sensors and processing systems, including air search and surface radars, Racal Decca navigation radar, and Raytheon sonar systems, these frigates are also armed with a range of weaponry. These include a Mk 45 Mod 2A 5"" gun, Harpoon missile launchers, and a vertical launcher for ESSM missiles. Additionally, they feature a hangar capable of housing a Sikorsky S-70B-6 Aegean Hawk helicopter.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999675750732422}",neutral,0.9999675750732422,0

The satellite comms sector has been building in hype for the last couple of years, and looks to be one of the key themes of MWC next month. There are a lot of partnerships being announced and a lot of money sloshing around in the costly pursuit of putting satellites into space. And it’s been a particularly big month for satellite news.

Last week AST SpaceMobile got $200 million investment from AT&T, Google and Vodafone which will be used to support the commercial rollout of its network, while SpaceX sent and received its first text messages using its new Starlink Direct to Cell satellites and T-Mobile US' spectrum.

Meanwhile over in China, China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC) announced it has completed construction of launchpad number one at the country's first commercial spaceport, currently being built in the city of Wenchang, on the island province of Hainan.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999996542930603}",neutral,0.999996542930603,0

Celebrating over 25 years in Singapore - Thales,"Thu, 18 Jan 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi93b3JsZHdpZGUvdHJhbnNwb3J0L21hZ2F6aW5lL2NlbGVicmF0aW5nLW92ZXItMjUteWVhcnMtc2luZ2Fwb3Jl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Singapore’s metro – better known as the MRT – is one of the most reliable in the world. It is also one of the most sustainable. Yu Feng Tang, director of Thales Ground Transportation Systems in Singapore, describes the work Thales is doing – and highlights the success of a partnership that spans over a quarter of a century.

What is the scope of Thales’ work in Singapore?

We provide technology to support urban rail operations – specifically, railway signalling, integrated communications and supervision, and ticketing. We also provide Long Term Support Services to the supplied technologies. We work with three main customers. One of these is the Land Transport Authority (LTA), who is the asset owner and governing authority for land transportation. In addition, we work with two major public transport operators. These are the SMRT Corporation Ltd and SBS Transit. We are immensely proud of the work we are doing with our customers and the trust they place in us.

How important is rail transport in Singapore?

Rail plays a huge role. Singapore is committed to achieving net zero emissions by 2050 and one of the key policies supporting this is Walk, Cycle, Ride – the aim is that all journeys to the nearest neighbourhood centre should be possible to complete in less than 20 minutes. Rail is a really important part of this because it provides connectivity between the major nodes of the city. Singapore already has a comprehensive metro network, as well as Light Rapid Transit (LRT) lines, and there are plans for further expansion.

How does Thales’ signalling help?

Modern signalling makes it possible to run more trains on existing tracks. On the North-South and East-West Lines, two of Singapore’s busiest commuter routes, we replaced a legacy signalling system with Thales’ SelTrac™ CBTC (Communications-Based Train Control). This provides our customers with the capacity they require, especially during the peak hours. With SelTrac™, the headway – the time gap between trains – was reduced from 120 seconds to 90 seconds. That means more frequent trains for passengers, as well as improved reliability.

How do you modernise a busy working railway?

Teamwork is critically important in a major resignalling project. A real game changer was working as “One Team” with LTA and SMRT – communicating transparently whenever we encountered issues, finding solutions together, and staying aligned. Regular contact is the key: we had a meeting every week with the customer during re-signalling, which included both the local Thales’ team and our overseas team from Toronto or France. Having all three parties working together was a key success factor for the project.

The MRT has a reputation for reliability. How is this achieved?

First and foremost, the railway has to be safe. Secondly, it must be reliable. This is in line with the Singapore government’s objective to encourage people to take public transport: reliability is the key to making the railway attractive to travellers.

One of the big reliability drivers in Singapore has been the adoption of joint metrics. The measure used is MKBF: mean kilometres between failures. In this context, failure is defined as a delay of more than five minutes. Back in 2015, this metric stood at around 150,000km – so that was the starting point. To drive improvement, an approach was adopted that involved identifying root causes when an incident occurred and closing the loop with the customer. As a result of doing this week by week, reliability on the North-South and East-West Lines has gone from an average of one failure every 150,000km to one more than every 1million kilometres – a huge achievement for everyone.

What about energy savings?

Our signalling technology – Thales’ SelTrac™ CBTC – makes it possible to save energy by adapting the way that trains are driven. It’s like how you drive a car – sometimes, you can reduce acceleration and rely on coasting to save energy. We call this Green CBTC and it is already an integral part of the signalling we deployed for SMRT on the North-South and East-West Lines since 2017

In Sep 2022, we launched an initiative of Green CBTC Next Gen to identify where energy savings can be further made on the North-South and East-West Lines, we first collect data logs from trains and transfer them to the cloud. We then use data analytics to find out how we can improve the speed profile or the operation patterns. Ultimately, it is about being able to predict the savings in kilowatt hours on the customer’s energy bill.

Our analysis suggests that we have good potential to achieve further energy savings of 10-15% with Green CBTC Next Gen. Right now, we are moving towards the very first milestone and we want to do some quick wins to reach 5%. The first quick wins could come from optimisation of the timetable. Green CBTC Next Gen is a fantastic tool for achieving these objectives.

You’re using “digital twin” technology – what is this, and how does it help?

We worked with our customers to build a CBTC Simulation Facility – a digital twin – that replicates the North-South and East-West Lines. This has two important benefits. First, it makes it possible to test new software changes before they are put into service. This reduces delays and increases confidence in deployment.

The second big benefit is familiarization training, because we can replicate failure scenarios using simulation. People from the Operation Control Centre (OCC) take part in exercises so they know exactly how to react to different types of incidents. It goes back to reliability: we have a five-minute window to react to avoid a delay. The CBTC Simulation Facility is a good example of how customer-supplier partnerships can make a real difference to passengers. We were the first to implement such a facility in Singapore.

What about ticketing?

This is another area where we a proud of our contribution. We are currently upgrading Automatic Fare Collection (AFC) gates across more than 80% of the metro network. The new gates are ergonomically designed, with contactless technology to provide a smoother journey for passengers. We have a long heritage in revenue collection in Singapore – we equipped the North East Line with fare gates 20 years ago. We run a Digital Competence Centre (DCC) as part of our revenue collection activities. This is a framework created by Thales to encourage innovation projects with our customers.

How important is innovation?

It’s a vital part of improving the passenger experience. A good example is crowd detection using our Distributed Intelligent Video Analytics solution. This makes it possible for station managers to receive alerts about overcrowding and – in the future – to dispatch additional trains. This has already been piloted at one of the interchange stations. Four stations on the North East Line are now in the pipeline. It’s a good example of how our Digital Competence Centre works. We regularly conduct workshops with our customers to understand what kind of use cases they have in mind. A recent example for SBS Transit is the “Smart Station” initiative to detect automatically scenarios where the operator can intervene to improve passenger comfort and safety.

What work are you doing in the wider region?

We have customers in several countries in east and south-east Asia. For example, we are supporting three LRT lines in Taiwan with integrated communications and supervision systems. Thanks to the success of Taiwan, we are venturing into the Philippines and the team has been working on a new project for Metro Manilla Subway. Support is provided by the technical engineering team from Singapore together with the onshore project team. And in conjunction with Thales Canada, we are supporting three signalling projects in Kuala Lumpur – the Kelana Jaya Line, the Ampang Line and the KL Monorail.

Local capability building is a critical success factor for our projects. We develop people to support our customers locally. That means improved collaboration with customers, shorter turnaround times and quicker project delivery.

Finally, how are you recruiting the next generation of talent?

We are engaging with universities in Singapore to promote our internship programmes. We have more than 40 interns working on our Advanced Development Projects (ADPs): these are innovation projects in areas that include signalling, communications and supervision, and ticketing. In terms of education, we are looking for people with a background in areas such as software engineering, computer science and data science. The other two main areas are electrical and electronic engineering: these skills are the bedrock of the signalling business.

We also run a Testing and Commissioning (T&C) engineering programme for new and recent graduates. This is a two-year training programme under the guidance of experienced T&C engineers. Participants acquire familiarity with our domain, and benefit from expert on-the-job training to build their competence.

At Thales, we are immensely proud of what we have achieved in Singapore over the past 25 years – and we are really excited about what we can achieve in the years ahead.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.8163575530052185}",positive,0.8163575530052185,1
Reforging the iron triangle: five qualities that every future armoured vehicle needs - Thales,"Tue, 23 Jan 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGFsZXNncm91cC5jb20vZW4vY291bnRyaWVzLWV1cm9wZS91bml0ZWQta2luZ2RvbS9uZXdzL3JlZm9yZ2luZy1pcm9uLXRyaWFuZ2xlLWZpdmUtcXVhbGl0aWVzLWV2ZXJ5LWZ1dHVyZS1hcm1vdXJlZNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Reforging the iron triangle: five qualities that every future armoured vehicle needs Share this article

Jonathan Welch, Capture Leader at Thales

Some are small and nimble, stealthy and discreet. Others are formidable in their size and bulk. Despite the variety of vehicles on show at this year’s International Armoured Vehicles Conference (IAV), they’re united by one promise: We’ll get you where you need to go – safely and at speed – to meet any threat, from any adversary.

Getting soldiers, supplies and weapons systems to the right place at the right time is a goal that’s remained constant across the globe since the early part of the last century. It is only the means of achieving it that have changed.

Today’s battlefield is more contested, congested and nuanced than it has been for decades. The traditional ‘iron triangle’ requires review and adaptation to meet the challenges of this increasingly complex operating environment. Firepower, Protection, and Mobility are all qualities that an armoured and protected vehicle needs to balance to be deemed battle-ready, but they are qualities that need supplementing if we’re to help future Land Forces achieve their objectives.

With the Army’s current fleet of Protected Mobility vehicles rapidly approaching their Out of Service Dates – and as the MOD looks to rationalise its vehicle types in the Land Mobility Programme – there is a need to reforge the iron triangle into something more fit for the modern operating environment. It’s why the customer will walk the floor at IAVC24 with a particularly critical eye as they identify, examine and assess the sorts of qualities that will make sure its streamlined fleet of vehicles can keep pace with the shifting character of war.

Of all the supplementary qualities the Army will be looking for, I’d argue that they could be boiled down to five key factors.

Survivability: safeguarding against conventional and unconventional threats

Survivability isn’t just a matter of protecting personnel from underbelly blasts. In today’s operating environment, soldiers face complex threats that proliferate rapidly and often in more covert, unconventional ways. All Protected Mobility vehicles require some form of active soft-kill protection measures, such as obfuscating smokes and electronic countermeasure systems to deflect inbound explosive threats and protect against cyberattacks on vehicle systems. In a resource-constrained environment, these vehicles may need to be fitted for – rather than with – these systems, providing flexibility on deployment and without having to go through full refit programmes.

Survivability is not just about protection. On encountering enemy threats, the vehicle that is network enabled to instantly share its position, status and systems with other combat vehicles will deliver tactical advantage while improving its own chances of survival. It provides a systemically protected network for personnel, technologies and equipment, each working in tandem to protect the other. It’s a cornerstone of Collaborative Combat: data, machines, systems and soldiers working as one, sharing not only situational awareness but also the burden of identifying, prioritising and engaging any given threat to keep the entire force better protected while delivering tactical advantage.

Commonality: the strength of shared systems

Collaborative Combat and systemic protection rests on our ability to build vehicles that aren’t simply people carriers. Instead, they need to work as a platform for mission systems, where these same systems, components and technologies can be shared across different variants or models of armoured vehicles within a common family or class.

Take a GVA-compliant platform like Hawkei. It can, of course, get soldiers where they need to go. But it can do so while enhancing networked awareness across crews thanks to a connection with a shared system on another platform. The effect is immediate and hive-like: teams know where each other are, what’s going on and who’s involved to make better-informed decisions, and make them that much faster than the adversary. The vehicle becomes a mission system bearer that, with generic vehicle architectures, can quickly and effectively swap out sensors and effectors to reflect the changing circumstances of the modern battlefield.

Modularity: swift transformation, rapid adaptation

Reducing vehicle fleets will unquestionably optimise maintenance and logistic supply chains but it means that new designs will need to be flexible, scalable and endlessly adaptable to meet evolving threats. The commonality outlined above begets their need to be modular. Modularity means swappable systems, faster reconfiguration times and more agile fleets in pursuit of front-line readiness and battlefield superiority.

Modular by design can mean both the ability to transfer mission systems easily and effectively on the battlefield and an inherent ability to be assembled quickly, with a minimum of tooling. The innovative and modular design of Hawkei, for example, enables simplified assembly. Hawkei is deliberately designed to be constructed anywhere and in significantly less time than conventional protected vehicles. With logistics and attrition becoming increasingly important as near-peer and peer-to-peer conflicts emerge, escalate and proliferate, accelerating the production line can help armed forces withstand sustained pressure from adversaries.

Lethality: packing the biggest possible punch

Lethality is – for obvious reasons – hugely important for fighting echelon vehicles in the line of fire. But the technology-enabled, 360° battlefield now requires all armoured and protected vehicles used in the operational support role to possess a robust self-protection capability. The PROTECTOR RS4 Remote Weapon Station (RWS) exemplifies industry’s response to this need – with the cutting-edge, modular platform-mounted weapon system, providing digitally enhanced situational awareness, combining to increase lethality and improve the survivability of the platform and its crew.

Naturally, lethality packages will differ depending on the tactical role of the vehicle. But one thing must remain constant if the MOD’s streamlined fleet is to be effective: they must provide lethality packages that can respond to 360° threats and provide tactical commanders with versatile options. This necessitates integrating mission-critical sub-systems into the core protected vehicle, ensuring it can seamlessly and safely transport troops under armour, manage battlefield casualties, allow for the rapid change of gun or missile launcher calibre, serve as a command and control hub and effectively handle short-range air defence and counter-unmanned aerial vehicle capabilities.

The success of such a comprehensive approach is exemplified by Bushmaster, showcasing the adaptability of a core protected vehicle with integrated lethality sub-systems across a spectrum of mission requirements. As the MoD continues to evolve its strategies, it is evident that the ability to respond to a multitude of threats while maintaining adaptability remains a cornerstone of effective modern warfare.

Mobility: higher payload, bigger pay off

Imagine trying to manoeuvre a 15-tonne vehicle around the hard corners and sharp edges of a small but tightly-packed town. Imagine its residents crowding the streets, its cars causing congestion, its buildings blocking what’s around the corner. It’s a scene that modern soldiers are increasingly having to contend with as operations move from open land to urban spaces – and our adversaries know it.

If we’re to develop and deploy new vehicle designs for MOD that are as agile as they are protected, and that are as modular as they are adaptable, we need to consider payload as an integral part of mobility. The higher the payload, the more mission systems you can equip on a vehicle; the more mission systems shared across a fleet, the better the situational awareness, and the sharper the decision-making advantage.

A unified front for industry, a new dawn for armoured vehicle development

The apparent complexity of IAVC24’s theme – ‘How will we fight in the future?’ – belies one singular, overarching ambition of our armed forces: to fight harder, smarter, and for that much longer than our adversaries.

Our role as industry suppliers remains unchanged in its aim: to allow the armed forces to accommodate, exploit, and adapt to change. If we’re to help the MOD reforge the iron triangle into one that integrates survivability, commonality, modularity, lethality and mobility, we need to learn to share. We need to open our architectures, agree a common baseline and combine our technologies.

We can take our cue – and our courage – from the MOD. When 80% delivered on time is better than 100% delivered late, the MOD understands that it ‘can’t wait endlessly for the gold standard’. It’s unafraid to ‘take decisions earlier to bring good equipment into service’. It needs to mobilise now – and industry’s ability to meet this need, to get coherent, innovative solutions off the drawing board and available for deployment, rests on our willingness to collaborate.

With so much innovation under one roof, and with so many skilled technologists walking the floor, opportunities for collaboration are rife at events like IAV. I think it’s important not to see each stand as a silo, but rather as a chance to extend, augment and amplify another tool, technology or even company. By taking an unabashed interest in one another’s work, we can start to ask and answer the question: how can these systems and capabilities be combined to help get MOD where it needs to go?

To find out more, visit Thales at the IAV conference, Stand F1, where you’ll be able to get hands on with the PAAG as well as sitting inside Thales’ Hawkei, its next generation protected vehicle.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9979296922683716}",neutral,0.9979296922683716,0

This announcement came as India and France adopted a joint defence production road map and an agreement on defence space partnership, following talks between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and French President Emmanuel Macron.

French defence major Thales, too, said it is bringing its “trusted” high-tech capabilities to India and that it plans to set up an avionics MRO (maintenance, repair, and operations) unit in Delhi to provide world-class services to its airline customers. Click here to follow our WhatsApp channel

Under negotiation for the past year, the India-France Defence Production Roadmap could catapult Indian defence producers into the global league by allowing them access to European technology and exposure to France’s list of clients in the Asia-Pacific and beyond.



“The road map will identify opportunities for partnership in the defence industrial sector that prioritises co-design, co-development, and co-production, with an eye on building the defence supply chains between the two countries, so that they can be a useful contributor to the security partnership with other countries which use similar products,” said Foreign Secretary Vinay Mohan Kwatra on Friday at a press briefing, outlining the visit of the French president to Delhi.



The partnership would include air and space tech, maritime tech, including underwater domain awareness, and equipment and systems related to land warfare. It also heavily focuses on cutting-edge technology, including robotics, artificial intelligence, cyber-defence, and autonomous vehicles and platforms.



Also, in partnership with Tata Advanced Systems Limited (TASL), Airbus Helicopters will set up a final assembly line (FAL) for H125 civilian helicopters. This will be India's first private helicopter manufacturing facility. “The FAL will take 24 months to set up and deliveries of the first ‘made-in-India’ H125s are expected to commence in 2026. The location of the FAL will be jointly decided by Airbus and the Tata group,” Airbus said in a statement.



The proposed helicopter manufacturing facility will be the second FAL to be established in India by Airbus in partnership with TASL. The two companies are currently building the C295 military transport aircraft FAL in Vadodara. India currently has fewer than 250 civilian helicopters in service vis à vis more than 15,000 that are operating in the US.



These made-in-India helicopters will also be exported to some of the neighbouring countries.



While Civil Aviation Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia called it a “historic day”, N Chandrasekaran, chairman, Tata Sons, said, “This facility will have the final assembly line in partnership with Airbus for the world’s bestselling Airbus H125 single-engine helicopter for the Indian, as well as export markets.”



Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury said: “Helicopters are crucial for nation building. A ‘made-in-India’ civil helicopter will not only be a symbol of the confident New India but will also unlock the true potential of the helicopter market in the country.”



Along with transportation of passengers and goods, the H125 can be used for segments, such as emergency medical services (HEMS), disaster management, law enforcement, tourism, and aerial work missions.



“Providing last-mile connectivity to remote areas, the H125 will significantly contribute to India's regional connectivity scheme – Ude Desh ka Aam Naagrik (UDAN) -- that will further promote the tourism sector in the country,"" Airbus noted.



Meanwhile, Vice-president and Country Director of Thales India Ashish Saraf, in a PTI report, described the decision to set up the avionics MRO unit in Delhi as a ""key initiative"" and asserted that Thales would fully support India's domestic defence manufacturing. On whether India's planned procurement of 26 Rafale-M fighter jets (marine version) and three Scorpene submarines from France would open new pathways for defence ties, Saraf did not give a direct reply but said Thales is proud to be a member of the Rafale team.

Space ties get stronger



A key anchor of India's strategic partnership with France, space has found significant mention in the latest talks. A letter of intent agreed upon by both nations focused on space situational awareness to understand the increasingly crowded upper atmosphere where thousands of active and defunct satellites remain in orbit, Kwatra said.



Both nations would also work together on collision avoidance, earth monitoring, remote sensing, communications, and broadcasting, he further said.



New Space India Limited (NSIL), a public sector undertaking under the Department of Space, and French commercial launch service provider Arianespace have launched a partnership. NSIL is responsible for producing, assembling, and integrating the launch vehicle with the help of an industry consortium.



The Department has also signed two agreements with counterpart French institutions to jointly research decarbonized hydrogen, applied mathematics, digital technologies, and precision agriculture.



President Draupadi Murmu was set to hold a state banquet in Macron's honour on Friday evening.



Macron had a busy schedule on the second day of his trip on Friday. Apart from attending the Republic Day parade as the Guest of Honour, he addressed the French community in Delhi and visited the Nizamuddin Dargah, a sufi shrine

Hawkei

Designed and developed in Bendigo, Australia, Thales is bringing its Hawkei vehicle (above) to the UK at IAVC 2024. It’s a light, versatile and C41 integrated vehicle, offering first-of-its-kind protection, mobility and payload alongside advanced mission system integration, making it adaptable and scalable to operational requirements.

Described as a ‘force multiplier’ for the Australian Defence Force, the 1000th Hawkei was recently lifted off the production line in Thales’ vehicle manufacturing facility in Bendigo, Victoria.

Panoramic Above Armour Gimbal (PAAG)

Thales’ cutting-edge vehicle optronics product, PAAG (right) features state-of-the-art sensors, including: high-resolution daylight colour cameras, a cooled thermal imager, SWIR sensor, laser rangefinder, laser pointer and a laser target designator.

PAAG enables long-range threat detection, identification and weapon aiming on the move, as well as fire support capabilities – day and night and in all weather conditions. Thales sights can also come with DigitalCrew smart processing – providing image enhancement, video and image combination and automated threat detection and tracking to significantly reduce cognitive burden.

Also at the show, Thales will be displaying its indirect fire support system and technology, its ruggedised inertial system for geo-positioning and target acquisition, and its mounted software defined radio.

As the world’s premier meeting ground for the armoured vehicles community, IAVC 2024 is a perfect opportunity for attendees to investigate, demonstrate and discuss innovative capabilities like Hawkei and PAAG.

Hitachi Rail to sell European signalling businesses to MerMec - International Railway Journal,"Fri, 26 Jan 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJhaWxqb3VybmFsLmNvbS9zaWduYWxsaW5nL2hpdGFjaGktcmFpbC1kaXZlc3RzLWV1cm9wZWFuLXNpZ25hbGxpbmctYnVzaW5lc3Nlcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"HITACHI Rail has agreed to sell several European signalling businesses. The value of deal has not been disclosed. However, it is a necessary precondition for the completion of the company’s €1.66bn purchase of Thales Ground Transportation Systems (GTS), first announced in August 2021.

Italian-based MerMec has agreed to buy Hitachi Rail’s existing signalling business units in Germany and Britain, as well as the company’s mainline signalling business in France (formerly CSEE). In total around 550 employees will transfer to MerMec.

Hitachi Rail has sought, and received, clearance from 13 competition authorities for its proposed takeover of Thales. Most recently, the European Commission (EC) gave its approval in October after Hitachi agreed to divest signalling platforms in France and Germany.

This followed an EC investigation that found that the deal as originally proposed would have reduced competition and led to higher prices and less innovation in the mainline signalling market.

Hitachi had already offered to divest its British signalling business unit after Britain’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) raised similar concerns relating to reduced competition.

No timescale for the divestment has been announced.

“Today we have achieved a major milestone towards the final acquisition of Thales GTS,” says Hitachi Rail group CEO Mr Giuseppe Marino, “which is a key part of our growth strategy.”

“The agreement follows a key commitment to European and UK regulators… This solution also will grant the divested business a long-term future.”

Hitachi says that it will retain its other operations in Britain, France and Germany, including its centre for CBTC technology in France and rolling stock and maintenance business in Britain.

MerMec formed a joint venture with Stadler in 2018 under the AngelStar brand to develop signalling systems. In November two DB Cargo class 185.2 locomotives were successfully retrofitted with the company's Guardia Baseline 3.4.0 ETCS automatic train protection system.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9997100234031677}",neutral,0.9997100234031677,0

Vice President and Country Director of Thales India Ashish Saraf said the company is fully committed and mobilised to support the modernisation and indigenisation efforts that are underway in the Indian aerospace and defence sector.

New Delhi : As New Delhi and Paris looked to expand strategic partnership, French defence major Thales on Friday said it is bringing its “trusted” high-tech capabilities to India and plans to set up an avionics MRO in Delhi to provide world class services to its airline customers.

Macron was the chief guest at the Republic Day celebrations at the Kartavya Path on Friday.

Saraf described the decision to set up the avionics MRO (maintenance, repair, and operations) in Delhi as a “key initiative” and asserted that Thales would fully support India’s domestic defence manufacturing.

“We are actively bringing our trusted high-tech capabilities coupled with decades-long experience and working closely with the local industry to support Make-in-India for India and for the world,” he told PTI.

Asked whether India’s planned procurement of 26 Rafale-M fighter jets (marine version) and three Scorpene submarines from France would open new pathways for defence ties, Saraf did not give a direct reply but said Thales is proud to be a member of the Rafale team.

“We are proud to be a member of the Rafale team of which Dassault Aviation is the lead. Thales provides a number of state-of-the-art equipment and systems aboard the Rafale including the radar, the electronic warfare system, optronics, the communication navigation and identification system (CNI), the majority of the cockpit display systems, among others,” he said.

India has already procured 36 Rafale jets from France for the Indian Air Force (IAF).

“We see huge potential to tap and to further build in-country capabilities across all our key markets including defence, aerospace and digital identity and security in India,” Saraf said.

“We have shifted gears and have been taking numerous initiatives to expand our local footprint. One such initiative is our second state-of-the-art facility in Bengaluru that we recently inaugurated,” he said.

The French aerospace major has been engaged with the Indian military for over the past seven decades.

“We are also further building on our defence foothold by developing local services capacity to better support our Indian defence customers to achieve their operational readiness,” Saraf said.

“Apart from presenting immense business potential, India is also an excellent hub for research and development, backed by abundance of its engineering talent,” he added.

The Thales executive said the company is ramping up its engineering centres and teams in Bengaluru and Noida.

“Another key initiative we are undertaking is the setting up an Avionics MRO in Delhi NCR to provide world class service efficiency to our airline customers,” he said.

Saraf said Macron gracing the Republic Day celebrations as chief guest is symbolic of the strong India-France bilateral relationship.

“As a French multinational with a solid legacy built in defence and other sectors in India for the past seven decades, we see this partnership growing further, especially in design, development and manufacturing of advanced technologies in India,” he noted.

Saraf said Thales is excited by the opportunities the fast-growing India-France partnership will present to both sides in various areas of cooperation like defence and security, space and cyberspace, among others.

The second Thales facility in Bengaluru is an extension of its engineering centre that works on complex avionics systems, in-flight entertainment, cockpit connectivity, video systems and radar software, among others.

“This Bengaluru engineering centre works every day with its peer-engineering center in Bordeaux, France,” he said.

The defence and strategic ties between India and France have been on an upswing in the last few years.

The two strategic partners also expressed commitment to cooperate in the co-development and co-production of advanced defence technologies, including for the benefit of third countries.

The two sides are also expanding cooperation in the maritime domain including in the Indian Ocean Region. PTI MPB ANB ANB

Only 73 jobs would remain when the existing manufacturing business transferred to the company’s Glasgow site by the end of the year.

A couple of years previously French-owned Thales took over the former Avimo factory, which opened in Taunton in 1937 and at its peak employed 850 workers.

Company spokesman Guy Douglas said: “While there will be an option for employees to transfer to Glasgow, numbers can’t be guaranteed.

“Regrettably, as a result approximately 140 jobs are potentially at risk of redundancy.

“We now go into a period of consultation with staff and trades unions, during which all individual options will be investigated, including the transfer of staff to Glasgow and other Thales UK business units where

possible.

“Following transfers within Thales UK it’s anticipated that the number of compulsory redundancies will be significantly lower.”

The business moving to Glasgow included the manufacture of armoured fighting vehicle sights, lasers and aircraft reconnaissance products.

Mr Douglas said Thales UK needed to reduce costs and increase efficiency, and the work was going to Glasgow as it was the firm’s “optronics manufacturing centre of excellence”.

Engineering, sales and marketing functions would stay in Taunton, as would the beryllium and aerospace component businesses, though they were up for sale.

Workers were offered the afternoon off to digest the news.

One, who asked to remain anonymous, said: “Rumours had been rife, but everyone’s gutted.

“Some have worked here for 30-odd years and aren’t going to find another job.

""No-one wants to move to Glasgow.

“It looks as though things are quiet in Glasgow, so they’ve decided to take our work away.”

Taunton MP Jeremy Browne said he was sad about the announcement and he had spoken to managing director Gary Francis.

Mr Browne said: “Thales is exactly the type of high skills employment we need to encourage in Taunton Deane.

“The company is renowned for its pioneering research and willingness to train people from our local community.

“Large international companies like Thales are free to make their own decisions, but I believe they’ve made a mistake in downgrading their Taunton operation.

“There are people who have worked for the company for decades and I’ll be pressing very hard for everyone affected by this announcement to be treated generously.""

“This is a very important purchase,” the minister underlined.

The agreement signed between the defence ministries of Lithuania and the Netherlands also provides for cooperation in the field of multifunction radar support. The possible participation of the Lithuanian defence industry in similar projects is also under discussion.

The deal is worth 126.7 million euros and it also includes a logistics package that covers technical documentation, the training of operators and maintenance personnel, the initial spare parts package, special tool kit and test equipment.

The first radar systems are expected to be delivered to Lithuania by 2026.

Thales GM200 MM/C artillery radar systems have been developed in cooperation with the Dutch Armed Forces as a multifunctional system so that they can be used both for air surveillance and can also be integrated into air defence systems, if required.

Thales GM200 MM/C systems have been purchased by the Dutch and Norwegian armies.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9818260669708252}",neutral,0.9818260669708252,0
