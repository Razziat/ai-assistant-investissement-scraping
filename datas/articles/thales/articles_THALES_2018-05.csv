UFC 224 results: Injured Jack Hermansson scores emotional comeback over Thales Leites - MMA Junkie,"Sat, 12 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vbW1hanVua2llLnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS8yMDE4LzA1L3VmYy0yMjQtcmVzdWx0cy1pbmp1cmVkLWphY2staGVybWFuc3Nvbi1zY29yZXMtZW1vdGlvbmFsLWNvbWViYWNrLW92ZXItdGhhbGVzLWxlaXRlc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Gallery Jack Hermansson def. Thales Leites at UFC 224: Best photos View 20 photos

In one of the more impressive wins in his UFC career Jack Hermansson scored a memorable third-round finish of Thales Leites.

The middleweight bout was part of the preliminary card of today’s UFC 224 event at Jeunesse Arena in Rio de Janeiro. It streamed on UFC Fight Pass ahead of additional prelims on FX and a main card on pay-per-view.

Hermansson was effective from the start, showing great movement in the cage and leaping in and out of range with strikes. Leites eventually found a way to latch on to the body, driving the action to the cage and eventually dragging the fight to the floor. As Leites tried to advance to the back, Hermansson hit a beautiful reversal, scoring top position, where he looked to strike from the top.

Leites refused to stay on his back, working up to his feet and looking to attack in the clinch, though Hermansson defended well against the cage, forcing a bit of a stalemate against the fence. Hermansson actually wound up on top when the two hit the ground in the final minute, and the round ended with him there.

Leites turned to his grappling early in the second, and with an awkward takedown seemed to torque his opponent’s left knee. With Hermansson wincing on the floor, Leites happily advanced position, scooting up the body and latching in an arm-triangle choke. Hermansson showed heart on his back, looking to angle his trapped right arm in a manner that would give him room to breathe, and Leites did eventually let go after several tense moments. Still, Leites held the dominant position, eventually working to mount, where he finished the round.

Hermansson came out wild in the third, missing on a flying knee but immediately latching on to the neck and trying to squeeze on a guillotine choke. The hold looked briefly tight, but Leites patiently worked through the hold and then reversed course, switching out front and looking for the anaconda choke. Hermansson somehow survived another tough spot and then actually moved to mount, where he started to tee off with powerful punches. Swinging away like a man desperate for a finish, Hermansson blasted his opponent with big shots, drawing a stoppage from referee Marc Goddard at the 2:10 mark of the final round.

After the win, Hermansson screamed out in what seemed part elation, part pain, and he later revealed he broke his rib in the opening frame.

“I broke my rib in the first round, and it was difficult to continue,”Hermansson said after the win. “Thales is a great fighter, but I learned that defense in my first jiu-jitsu class.

“I have the best ground and pound in the world. When I connect, no one stands a chance.”

Hermansson (17-4 MMA, 4-2 UFC) improves to 3-1 in his past four appearances. Leites (27-9 MMA, 7-5 UFC) has dropped consecutive bouts for just the third time in his career.

Video: 25 years of Thales TACTICOS Combat Management System - Navy Recognition,"Sun, 06 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL25hdnlyZWNvZ25pdGlvbi5jb20vaW5kZXgucGhwL2ZvY3VzLWFuYWx5c2lzL25hdmFsLXRlY2hub2xvZ3kvNjE5OC12aWRlby0yNS15ZWFycy1vZi10aGFsZXMtdGFjdGljb3MtY29tYmF0LW1hbmFnZW1lbnQtc3lzdGVtLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This year Thales celebrates 25 years of its TACTICOS combat management system (CMS). Navy Recognition recently went to the Thales site of Hengelo in the Netherlands to find out what makes TACTICOS one of the most popular CMS among navies around the world.

Human factors specialists and Navy personnel collaborated on the design of the TACTICOS HMI. The HMI standsout by adhering to the operator workflow which reduces the operator workload to a minimum.

TACTICOS was conceived in the early 1990s as an integrated and highly automated multi-warfare combat management system (CMS) to manage command and weapon control functions on board naval surface combatants. In 25 years, TACTICOS has been selected by 23 navies, aboard 127 ships: small, medium and large naval vessels making it one of the most popular CMS on the 7 seas.



TACTICOS was introduced in 1993 with the Turkish Navy Barbaros-class (MEKO 200) frigates and Kılıç-class fast attack craft. It is itself based on previous generations of CMS: STACOS (by Signal which is now Thales Nederlands) and TAVITAC (by Thomson-CSF which is now Thales). The merger of these two CMS resulted in the very first TACTICOS (baseline 0). Baseline 1 was introduced in 2005 (with addition of Link 16). Baseline 2 was introduced from 2009. There are today seven navies using TACTICOS Baseline 2.

Our video on Thales TACTICOS CMS recorded at Thales Nederlands in Hengelo



Some of the current TACTICOS users include the U.S. Navy (with the Independence-class littoral combat ship), Columbia (Almirante Padilla-class corvette), Poland (Orkan-class fast attack craft), Greece (Roussen-class fast attack craft), Germany (Braunschweig-class corvette), Morocco (SIGMA corvettes), South Korea (Chungmugong Yi Sun-sin-class / KDX-II destroyer), Indonesia (PKR Frigate, the largest TACTICOS CIC with 10 consoles), Malaysia (Kasturi-class corvette), Qatar (Barzan-class fast attack craft)...



A future user of TACTICOS is no other than the Royal Navy: Thales' CMS has been selected by the Babcock-led ""Team 31"" in a bid for the Royal Navy’s Type 31e frigate programme. Team 31 is composed of Babcock, BMT Group, Thales, Harland & Wolff, Ferguson Marine and Danish naval architecture firm Odense Maritime Technology (OMT). It is not clear yet which Frigate design is being pitched by Team 31: BMT's Venator, Babcock's Harrowhead or a variation of the Danish Iver Huitfeldt-class frigate designed by OMT. Team 31 is competing with BAE Systems and Steller Systems.

Easy teaming in a CIC with the MOC Mk4, Inter Console Unit and Collaboration Wall.

To keep TACTICOS up to date, Thales sticks to a ""product management"" approach: A new release/update to the TACTICOS system is released every six months and deployed in Thales' training and demonstration centers.

Thales also worked on new modules for its customers: Three years ago a ""anti-piracy and counter drugs operations"" module was successfully launched to help TACTICOS users with these specific missions.

The next generation of TACTICOS - the baseline 3 - is set to be unveiled in 2022. It will feature the latest improvements and technologies in term of elecronic warfare and cyber security."

Poland is working to significantly modernise its military capabilities and is looking to initially acquire about 50 protected mobility vehicles, with follow-on acquisition programs expected to increase this figure to approximately 700 vehicles. Thales Australia with partners could take part in an upgrade of Polish Army.

The vehicle was fitted with ZSMU-1276 Remote Controlled Weapon Station. The RWCS integrated sensor unit includes a daylight video camera, a thermal imager for night operations and a laser rangefinder. The ZSMU-1276 enables to destroy lightly armored ground targets and low-flying aircraft during the day and night conditions.

The ZSMU-1276 provides the one-man crew with the ability to acquire and engage targets while inside a vehicle, protected by its armor. The installation of the RWCS does not require any significant changes in the structure of the vehicle or object. The ZSMU-12.7 have the ability to work in safe mode (with no electric supply) with manual guidance of machine gun and trigger service.

Hawkei is proposed in the context of the Polish Armed Forces program that has been carried out for a long time as part of the Pegaz program. This platform could also potentially serve as a vehicle for reconnaissance in artillery fire modules of the Homar system or as a carrier of heavy anti-tank guided missiles.

Hawkei meets the requirements of global defence forces for a highly protected, mobile and integrated vehicle able to operate in an environment under threat from Improvised Explosive Devices, mines and ambushes.

According to the armyrecognition.com, the Hawkei 4×4 light protected vehicle was designed to offer high level of protection against modern ballistic and mine explosion threats. A high level of built-in blast protection is combined with ballistic protection that can be scaled to match the operating environment.

The Hawkei vehicle is motorized with a Steyr V6 diesel engine manufactured by Steyr Motors GmbH, Austria coupled to a 8-speed automatic transmission. It can run at a maximum road speed of 115km/h with a maximum cruising range of 600 km. The vehicle is based on a 4×4 wheeled drive with independent coil suspension."
JFK Airport's Terminal 4 Debuts Security Operations Center - Aviation Pros,"Tue, 15 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hdmlhdGlvbnByb3MuY29tL2FpcnBvcnRzL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2UvMTI0MTI1OTIvamZrLWludGVybmF0aW9uYWwtYWlyLXRlcm1pbmFsLWxsYy1qZmtpYXQtamZrLWFpcnBvcnRzLXRlcm1pbmFsLTQtZGVidXRzLXNlY3VyaXR5LW9wZXJhdGlvbnMtY2VudGVy0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"On May 14, Terminal 4 at John F. Kennedy International Airport opened a best-in-class Security Operations Center (SOC) as part of an extensive security modernization project in partnership with Thales, a world leader in airport security. The SOC and its advanced technology will enhance the terminal’s security operations, supporting the growth of Terminal 4 and providing its more than 21 million annual travelers with a safe and secure customer experience.

“We are pleased to partner with Thales to further improve Terminal 4’s security operations,” said Gert-Jan de Graaff, president and CEO of JFKIAT, the company which operates Terminal 4. “This new Security Operations Center will prove to be an integral component in keeping passengers and employees at Terminal 4 safe and secure. The system will grow with the terminal, as it was designed to allow for expansion both inside Terminal 4 and strategically connect stakeholders outside the terminal facility.”

Complete with an Airport Operation Control Center (AOCC) platform and Physical Security Information Management software, the SOC promotes efficiency, effectiveness and situational awareness for T4’s security department while significantly improving outcomes through real-time management capabilities. The integrated security control center consolidates all security management and operational tools, providing those operating the system with complete control of subsystems and enabling a more timely and accurate response by Terminal 4’s security personnel and law enforcement. Processes are pre-programmed, for consistent responses allowing operators to focus on alternate security items.

“Providing a secure and hassle-free airport experience is no small feat in a world that is increasingly fast moving and unpredictable,” said Alan Pellegrini, CEO of Thales USA. “Airport security is an important issue and with the capabilities of this new SOC, Terminal 4 can rely on Thales to help provide first class security operations.”

Terminal 4 is the first U.S. air terminal to implement Thales’ proven security solution, joining several other global airports – including Bahrain, Doha, Dubai, Durban, Lyon, Madrid, Muscat, Pisa, Salalah, and Singapore. The SOC will improve current operations and passenger experiences, while empowering a more proactive security culture for years to come. Thales will provide T4 with ongoing airport security engineering support for the next three years.

In 2017, Terminal 4 launched 14 automated security screening lanes in coordination with the Transportation Security Administration and Delta Air Lines. The state-of-the-art checkpoint technology enhances security effectiveness while decreasing the time travelers spend in security screening. The automated screening lanes offer several features designed to improve the screening of travelers by automating many of the functions previously conducted manually, which allows travelers to move more swiftly and efficiently through the checkpoint."

But you should — and the name that you should think about is Thales of Miletus.

Thales was a brilliant man, and one of the first real Western philosophers and scientists (although “scientist” wasn’t a term used at the time). He is best known for his thesis that “all things are water,” which we know now to be erroneous, but was a groundbreaking thought given the scientific infancy of 6th-century B.C. Moreover, Thales was among the first thinkers to make hypotheses that were testable and falsifiable, bedrock principles of scientific inquiry today, but absent among his fellow thinkers at the time.

According to the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, none other than the great Aristotle identified Thales as the first person to investigate basic principles, the first to question the origins of substances and matter, and therefore the founder of the school of natural philosophy.

Among his accomplishments was the successful prediction of an eclipse of the sun that occurred on May 28, 585 B.C.E. Although it’s not known exactly how Thales was able to predict this event, the most likely explanation is his study of the solar and lunar cycles.

Yet what can we learn, as investors, from Thales?

To answer that, we have to realize that Thales was a philosopher, and a man not particularly concerned with the accumulation of monetary wealth. And because of his lack of wealth, he often was criticized in Athenian society by the elites of the day. So just to prove the elites wrong, and to demonstrate the power of reason and natural philosophy, Thales did something that should put him in the trading history books.

Based on his study, assessment and knowledge of the Greek climate, Thales reasoned that there would be a particularly good harvest one year for olives. But rather than sit on this information, Thales took the next step and put deposits during the preceding winter on all the olive presses in Miletus.

Thales had basically cornered the market on olive presses for a small investment. Stated in modern trading terms, Thales bought call options on olive presses, and paid a small amount for the right to control those presses (i.e. he paid a small premium for the option).

When his prediction of a bountiful olive harvest did indeed come to pass, Thales’ bet paid off handsomely. The boom harvest created heavy demand for the olive presses, and because Thales held a virtual monopoly on the presses he was able to rent them out at a huge profit.

In my opinion, this was perhaps one of the most important events — not only in market history, but in the whole of human history.

The reason why is because Thales demonstrated that “science” and the accumulation of wealth really are connected. And, as the old saying goes, knowledge truly is power. He also demonstrated that if you know what your competition doesn’t, then you will have a tremendous advantage of them.

It is for this life lesson, as well as the accompanying investing lesson of Thales and the olive presses, that we should be thankful for the man from Miletus.

Celebrating 75 Years of ‘The Fountainhead’

Can reading a novel make a real difference in one’s life?

I know that for me, the answer is an unequivocal “yes.” And, I know I’m not alone, because many people have said that reading that same novel profoundly altered their perspective, deeply challenged their thinking and also inspired them to become who they really wanted to be.

The novel I’m referring to here is “The Fountainhead” by Ayn Rand.

Advertisement.

If you don’t know about “The Fountainhead,” it’s the story of Howard Roark, an innovative architect, who, as the author once described him, “struggles for the integrity of his creative work against every form of social opposition.” That struggle for the integrity of his work is really the struggle of the individual vs. the collective, not just in society or politics, but in a single individual’s soul.

As the events of the novel play out, and in what is a brilliant integration of both plot and theme (the two most essential components of a novel), protagonist Roark faces constant challenges from those who are threatened by his genius and who are afraid of his uncompromising independence.

That independence runs so deep for Roark that when a building he designed on the one condition that no changes be made to it is, in fact, changed, he takes matters into his own hands and physically destroys the creation of his own mind.

For those who haven’t read the novel, I’ll stop there, as I don’t want to spoil the profound pleasure that awaits you. Yet the reason I bring the novel up is because this month, on Monday, May 7, fans like me of the “The Fountainhead” celebrated the 75th anniversary of its publication.

While some people I know took time to post accolades to social media sites, others I know actually held “The Fountainhead” parties. I chose to celebrate this life-changing work by discussing its significance with fellow fans, and by talking about the role it has played in so many lives.

That discussion also happened to be recorded, and it’s the latest episode of The Atlasphere podcast.

The Atlasphere is a website designed to connect admirers of “The Fountainhead” and Ayn Rand’s other game-changing novel, “Atlas Shrugged” (hence the site’s name).

The Atlasphere podcast is hosted by my friend Heather Wagenhals, who also happens to host the highly recommended and extremely popular Unlock Your Wealth radio show. Like me, Heather has a love of money, prosperity and helping readers/listeners achieve economic freedom. Also like me, Heather has been profoundly influenced by the works of Ayn Rand.

On this podcast, we were joined by Ed Hudgins, research director of The Heartland Institute, a great organization dedicated to discovering, developing and promoting free-market solutions to social and economic problems. Before Ed was with The Heartland Institute, he was a senior scholar at The Atlas Society, an organization that promotes the philosophy of reason, freedom and individualism espoused in the works of Ayn Rand.

I really enjoyed my conversation with Heather and Ed, and I think readers who are interested in literature, the works of Ayn Rand, the primacy of reason, the morality of capitalism and the eminent virtue of independence portrayed so exquisitely in the character of Howard Roark will find this discussion both interesting and uplifting.

So, if you want to celebrate a great intellectual achievement that’s been influencing people for some 75 years, I invite you to do so with me.

It comprises a 26.4km north line from Rangsit to Bang Sue and a 14.6km west line from there to Taling Chan. Part of these lines have four tracks, while the remainder is double track. The lines will be used by both Red Line commuter trains and long-distance services."
France: Jaguar unveiled ahead of Eurosatory exhibition - EDR Magazine,"Thu, 17 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVkcm1hZ2F6aW5lLmV1L2ZyYW5jZS1qYWd1YXItdW52ZWlsZWQtYWhlYWQtb2YtZXVyb3NhdG9yeS1leGhpYml0aW9u0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Paolo Valpolini

May 16th 20018 marked the first public appearance of the Jaguar 6×6 contact reconnaissance vehicle, the second of the French Army Scorpion programme vehicle to become reality. The event took place on Nexter’s premises, the company being part of the Scorpion team together with Renault Trucks Defense and Thales. The vehicle is 7.8 meters long, including the gun at 12 o’ clock, 3.0 meters wide and 3.5 meters high, and has a combat weight of 25 tonnes. The 6×6 chassis was developed by RTD and is fitted with a Volvo engine providing 500 hp, coupled to the same ZF automatic six-speed transmission used in the Griffon 6×6 APC. It is to note that the reverse movement is obtained through an inverter and not through the transmission, which provides a much higher reverse speed. To reduce the vehicle’s length the engine and transmission, located at the back, are not mounted in sequence but in a ”U” configuration, through a horizontal transfer box. On road the Jaguar uses the four rear wheels, the 6×6 traction being used only when going cross country, differentials being blocked progressively, depending on terrain conditions. The suspensions, provided by Quiri, allow to change the ground clearance depending on situations, lower on roads and higher in cross country, suspensions stiffness also changing depending on the height. An extra-low position allowing to better hide the vehicle when observing; it is also used for maintenance, to ease access to some elements, and when the vehicle is transported by rail. To reduce the turning radius both the first and third axle are steerable.

The Jaguar is fitted with the same pneumatics adopted on the Griffon, and is equipped with CTIS and run-flat systems. The front and rear axles are identical to those of the Griffon, which increases commonality, each axle being able to carry 9 tons. The Jaguar has a range of 800 km thanks to its 465 litres fuel tank; the one in the prototype is provisional, the final design foreseeing ne fuel tank heavily protected and one less protected but of the self-sealing type. The driver, located at the centre, has at his disposal three screens, two on the left and one on the right, the latter used to show all mobility parameters. His hatch is fitted with thee episcopes, the central one being bigger, as it provides a wider field of view, and it can fuse in the images provided by dedicated E/O sensors. No details were provided on electric output, the Jaguar being equipped with six batteries, currently of the standard lead type. Beside the two prototypes that have just been finished, two mobility test vehicles were produced, one of them having carried out durability tests for the last six months; in these vehicles the 6.5 tonnes turret is replaced with an equivalent weight. According to the Jaguar team design is frozen at 80-90%, some improvements being foreseen i.e. in the stealthness area.

Coming to observation, the commander, located on the right side of the turret, can use an all-optic panoramic sight located at the centre of the turret, as well as Safran’s dedicated Paseo electro-optic all-digital panoramic sight fitted on the remotely controlled weapon station. His hatch s fitted with episcopes allowing a 360° view. As for the gunner, seated on the left, he is also equipped with a direct optical channel, on the left, and with a Safran E/O viewer, on the right, aligned with the gun. Close situational awareness is provided by Thales’ Antares, which also doubles as a laser warning receiver, two being mounted, one front right and one rear left, to provide all-round coverage. A Metravib Pilar V acoustic sensor is also installed. Thales also provides the entire vetronic architecture of the Jaguar.

Coming to firepower, the Jaguar main weapon is the CTAI 40 mm telescoped cased gun; HE, APDS and ABM munitions are available, the gun effective range being between 2,000 and 2,500 meters. A total of 180 ready rounds are available. For longer range engagements against heavy armour two MBDA’s MMP missiles are available in a twin launcher fitted on the right side of Nexter’s two-man turret and controlled via the gunners sight. Two reload missiles are available in the hull. The RCWS fitted on top of the turret is produced by RTD and is dubbed T3, being a dedicated model specifically designed for the Jaguar although it uses some components of the other RCWS developed for the Scorpion programme, such as the electric motors; it is usually armed with a 7.62 mm machine gun, and hosts 550 rounds. The Jaguar is fitted with Galix grenade launchers providing 360° coverage, four launchers being fitted on each side of the turret, while two per side are embedded in the rear armour.

As for protection, levels remain classified. The survival cell hosting the crew is made of aluminium and then fitted with add-on armour, various ballistic, mine, IED and RPG kits being available. Thales provides the jammer which is part of the DGA Barage programme, while in the long term the vehicle might be fitted with an active protection system against missiles and RPGs, a system being under development at TDA as part of the Diamant programme, the Jaguar being fitted for receiving such system. As for communications, the vehicle will be equipped with one Thales Contact radio, allowing simultaneous data and voice communications in VHF and UHF bands, and with two PR4G radios.

Two prototypes of the Jaguar will be visible at Eurosatory next June, one on the French Army stand and one at Nexter’s stand. Following the exhibition the prototypes will start the test programme, first firings being expected for late 2018."
"Due to 'unreasonable' delays with Metro Line, city delivers Notice of Default to Thales - CTV News Edmonton","Tue, 01 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vZWRtb250b24uY3R2bmV3cy5jYS9kdWUtdG8tdW5yZWFzb25hYmxlLWRlbGF5cy13aXRoLW1ldHJvLWxpbmUtY2l0eS1kZWxpdmVycy1ub3RpY2Utb2YtZGVmYXVsdC10by10aGFsZXMtMS4zOTEwNTcy0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"After Monday’s deadline, the City of Edmonton said it had issued a Notice of Default to Thales, the contractor behind the problem-plagued Metro Line LRT.

The city’s deputy city manager of integrated infrastructure services said the decision to issue the notice came after the April 30, 2018 deadline for Thales to complete its contract for the Metro Line passed.

The deadline was set by councillors in December, 2017.

Adam Laughlin said the notice begins a resolution process under the contract the city has with Thales.

“Publicly, we’ve put Thales on notice that they’re in default, and they have to remedy that situation in a timeframe that’s acceptable to the city, and if they don’t we’re going to a different solution,” Laughlin said in a news conference Tuesday. “If they do, we get the service we originally asked for.”

The line opened to riders in September, 2015, and it was nearly two years behind schedule.

Since then, signalling issues have plagued the system, resulting in slow-speed trains, and errors in the system.

A report in 2017 found dozens of cases where something went wrong with the line, usually issues with brakes and sensors. A handful of those issues were categorized as “risks to the public.”

Mayor Don Iveson issued a statement on Twitter following the city’s announcement. In the statement, Iveson called the move a “line in the sand.”

“We have a contractor that has consistently let down Edmontonians in meeting their contractual obligations to the city,” Iveson said.

“They have failed to achieve the deadline we set and we cannot continue to wait for a solution that may not arrive. Enough is enough.”

Thales will have the chance to respond to the Notice of Default issued Tuesday.

The company issued a statement Tuesday afternoon after the notice was issued. The company said it was “disappointed” by the decision.

“The activities of Thales and the City are mutually dependent, demanding timely coordination and decision-making. We remain committed to delivering the next steps of this project for the benefit of Edmontonians and will continue to work, as we always have, per our contractual obligations.”

The company was awarded the $55 million contract in May, 2011."

Thailand’s main rail operator, the State Railway of Thailand (SRT), will adopt the European Train Control System (ETCS), ensuring the highest safety standards of operation. Through a contract signed with Nippon Signal, Thales will deliver the ETCS on two sections of the Red Line suburban train in Bangkok, totalling a distance of 41 km.

© Thales Transportation

Red Line Commuter Train System

The Red Line commuter train system is a suburban rail project proposed by the SRT to address traffic congestion and encourage a shift from road transport to urban rail. The line is expected to serve 131,000 commuters daily when it goes into service. As part of Bangkok’s Mass Rapid Transit Master Plan which aims to develop an urban rail transit network to serve metropolitan Bangkok and its surrounding urban areas, the Red Line is the first line which is fully integrated into SRT’s conventional main line rail network.

On the Red Line, new electrical commuter trains will run as well as long distance passenger trains. It will consist of the following two lines: North Line (from Rangsit to Bang Sue) and West Line (from Bang sue to Taling Chan).

Thales ETCS System

The Thales ETCS system will ensure the highest safety standards for railway transport on the complete line. 25 new electric multiple unit trains and two existing non-electrified vehicles will be equipped with Thales ETCS on-board system, resulting in a total of 53 on-board units. Being fit for the future they will run in a pure Level 1 configuration but can easily be adapted for Level 2. The Red Line sections to be equipped are partly built in a four-track alignment and the remainder as a double-track line. The signalling part is planned to be finished in 2020.

Thales stands ready to support SRT’s plans for growth. With proven signalling competencies and international market knowledge based on previous partnerships with Nippon Signal and earlier ETCS installations for SRT in Thailand, Thales hopes to enhance the technology and expertise delivered to the Thai transportation industry.

Tommy Ayouty, Country Director of Thales in Thailand, said:

As Thailand develops its transportation infrastructure to support a growing urban population, Thales continues to be a committed partner to the country, as we’ve done for close to 30 years across various businesses. We are supporting Thailand’s ambitions in developing a robust urban rail network, and providing systems that ensure the highest level of safety to the SRT’s commuters. We look forward to working closely with our partner Nippon Signal to bring the Red Line to the Thai people.

Edmonton takes step toward terminating $55M Metro Line LRT signalling contract - CBC.ca,"Tue, 01 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9uZXdzL2NhbmFkYS9lZG1vbnRvbi9lZG1vbnRvbi1jaXR5LWhhbGwtbWV0cm8tbGluZS0xLjQ2NDM1MDLSASBodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYmMuY2EvYW1wLzEuNDY0MzUwMg?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The City of Edmonton has taken a step toward terminating its $55-million contract with Thales, the signalling contractor for the problem-plagued Metro Line LRT.

The city's decision comes a day after Thales failed to meet its latest deadline of April 30 to fix problems with the software.

The city has issued Thales a notice of default on its contract — a necessary legal first step.

""This begins the resolution under the contract, which may end in termination,"" the news release said.

""Rushing to a conclusion that is termination does not put us in the best position,"" Adam Laughlin, deputy city manager of integrated infrastructure services, told reporters Tuesday.

Thales was awarded the signalling-system contract in May 2011.

In a statement issued shortly after the announcement, Thales said it was disappointed by the city's decision.

""We remain committed to delivering the next steps of this project for the benefit of Edmontonians and will continue to work, as we always have, per our contractual obligations.""

Under the contract, Thales has five days to respond to the notice of default with a plan to solve the problems.

If they proceed, Laughlin expects it will take months to rectify the problems.

'Enough is enough': Iveson

Mayor Don Iveson issued a strongly worded statement on the city's action against Thales.

""We have a contractor that has consistently let down Edmontonians in meeting their contractual obligations to the city,"" Iveson said.

""They have failed to achieve the deadline we set and we cannot continue to wait for a solution that may not arrive. Enough is enough.""

Iveson said the notice of default is council's ""line in the sand"" for Thales.

""My expectation of Thales is that they take this notice of default very seriously and do everything possible to avoid the next steps in our legal process.""

'Enough is enough' Duration 0:39 Mayor Don Iveson talks about the city's decision to issue Metro Line signalling contractor Thales a notice of default. Iveson also stressed that the Metro Line is safe and will continue to run while work continues on fixing the signalling system.

City council endorsed the course of action after receiving an update in private. Councillors have also endorsed administration to investigate ""alternative operations"" on the Metro Line, the city said.

Laughlin said the alternatives are not necessarily the same as the communication-based train control (CBTC) system used by Thales. They could be more traditional train systems, similar to the one used on the Capital Line.

In December, councillors passed a motion demanding Thales rectify the lingering problems after a report showed there had been 50 incidents of signalling malfunctions or mishaps on the Metro Line since it opened in 2015.

Since then, Laughlin said the city and Thales have made ""incremental progress — certainly not to the pace that we want to see.""

Deputy city manager has seen “incremental” progress on the Metro Line but expects it will take months for Thales to finish work <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/yegcc?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#yegcc</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/yeg?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#yeg</a> <a href=""https://t.co/y1qjt62RGY"">pic.twitter.com/y1qjt62RGY</a> —@natashariebe

In five cases, crossing gates went up or down at the wrong time. In two other instances, two trains ended up on the same track, headed toward each other, at the NAIT station.

Councillors had to ask administration for that data after media learned about the mishaps in November.

Despite the malfunctions, the city insisted the train was safe to ride with conductors calling ahead to the command centre to ensure the track is clear.

Coun. Mike Nickel challenges Edmonton city staff on their idea of safety, after five major situations and 44 mishaps on the Metro Line. (CBC) Coun. Mike Nickel, a consistent critic of the project, called the revelations ""disconcerting"" and the line ""dysfunctional"" and a ""failure.""

The city has paid Thales $23 million of the $55 million contract and is withholding $22 million until there's a resolution, Laughlin told media.

Iveson pointed out that the new Valley Line is based on a newer and more sophisticated integration system that ""will behave, we hope, better at intersections.""​

Aircraft carrier's fighter jets to arrive at new UK home - Thales,"Tue, 22 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi91bml0ZWQta2luZ2RvbS9uZXdzL2FpcmNyYWZ0LWNhcnJpZXJzLWZpZ2h0ZXItamV0cy1hcnJpdmUtbmV3LXVrLWhvbWXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Aircraft carrier’s fighter jets to arrive at new UK home Share this article



LinkedIn

Britain’s next generation of fighter jets will start arriving in the UK next month in preparation for future duties on board HMS Queen Elizabeth, the Ministry of Defence has revealed.

The first F-35 Lightning stealth jets will arrive at their new land base at RAF Marham in Norfolk in June where they will be operated by the newly formed 617 Squadron. The squadron’s personnel are currently in the United States training with the new aircraft.

The announcement coincides with the recent 75th anniversary of the original Dambusters mission in 1943. Find out more about Thales’s involvement here.

617 Squadron’s Commanding Officer, Wing Commander John Butcher, said: “The original Dambuster Squadron did not know what their mission was going to be until the last moment.”

“Yet they had to make sure they were ready and that is as true for us today. The spectrum of missions we can undertake in the F-35 will be huge and we have to make sure we are ready to do whatever is asked of us.”

The F-35B Lightning, multi-role fighter jet is the first to combine radar evading stealth technology with supersonic speeds and short take-off and vertical landing capability.

The jets will be jointly manned by the Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy and can operate from land and sea, forming a vital part of Carrier Strike when operating from the Queen Elizabeth Class aircraft carriers.

On board the carriers, Thales was responsible for design and integration of the ship’s aviation systems such as aircraft lifts, fuelling, aircraft electrical supply, visual landing aids and also the lead on ship air integration working closely with F-35 team.

As part of its aviation lead responsibilities, Thales led the procurement of the flying control tower from the Special Projects division of Ipswich-based key supplier Tex ATC Ltd, one of the world’s leading providers of military and civilian airfield visual control rooms.

The ship will control all flying operations of the F-35s, Merlins and other aircraft from this floating air traffic control tower – including using Thales communications systems to talk to all personnel on board.

In a world that is increasingly fast moving, air forces have to be capable of conducting several missions simultaneously, including reconnaissance, air defence and precision strikes. Thales helps the pilots to master environments increasingly complex in order to take quick and efficient decisions. Thales’s active array radar addresses this fundamental requirement with added reliability, enabling pilots to manage more complex situations than was possible with conventional radar technology. The ability to perform several mission types at the same time delivers a huge boost to the operational performance of combat aircraft.









Over a period of several years, Thales’s teams have applied their solid technological expertise to the development of the RBE2 electronic scanning radar with active array technology to tailor the radar to the tactical missions carried out by Rafale combat aircraft. The RBE2 features state-of-the-art digital technologies, offering pilots greater flexibility in reconnaissance missions, and helping them to take the right decisions in real time.

The RBE2 is Europe’s first active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar. Technology development for the RBE2 radar commenced in the Nineties, and the first Rafale equipped with the system was delivered to the French defence procurement agency (DGA) in 2012. All of the Rafale aircraft sold in export markets now benefit from this active array technology."
Press Release: JFK Airport's Terminal 4 opens Security Operations Center - Runway Girl Network,"Tue, 15 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTgvMDUvcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZS1qZmstYWlycG9ydHMtdGVybWluYWwtNC1vcGVucy1zZWN1cml0eS1vcGVyYXRpb25zLWNlbnRlci_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Yesterday, Terminal 4 at John F. Kennedy International Airport – one of the world’s most active air terminals – opened a best-in-class Security Operations Center (SOC) as part of an extensive security modernization project in partnership with Thales, a world leader in airport security. The SOC and its advanced technology will enhance the terminal’s security operations, supporting the growth of Terminal 4 and provide its more than 21 million annual travelers with a safe and secure customer experience.

“We are pleased to partner with Thales to further improve Terminal 4’s security operations,” said Gert-Jan de Graaff, President and CEO of JFKIAT, the company which operates Terminal 4. “This new Security Operations Center will prove to be an integral component in keeping passengers and employees at Terminal 4 safe and secure. The system will grow with the terminal, as it was designed to allow for expansion both inside Terminal 4 and strategically connect stakeholders outside the terminal facility.”

Complete with an Airport Operation Control Center (AOCC) platform and Physical Security Information Management software, the SOC promotes efficiency, effectiveness and situational awareness for T4’s security department while significantly improving outcomes through real-time management capabilities. The integrated security control center consolidates all security management and operational tools, providing those operating the system with complete control of subsystems and enabling a more timely and accurate response by Terminal 4’s security personnel and law enforcement. Processes are pre-programmed, for consistent responses allowing operators to focus on alternate security items.

“Providing a secure and hassle-free airport experience is no small feat in a world that is increasingly fast moving and unpredictable,” said Alan Pellegrini, CEO of Thales USA. “Airport security is an important issue and with the capabilities of this new SOC, Terminal 4 can rely on Thales to help provide first class security operations.”

Terminal 4 is the first U.S. air terminal to implement Thales’ proven security solution, joining several other global airports – including Bahrain, Doha, Dubai, Durban, Lyon, Madrid, Muscat, Pisa, Salalah, and Singapore. The SOC will improve current operations and passenger experiences, while empowering a more proactive security culture for years to come. Thales will provide T4 with ongoing airport security engineering support for the next three years.

In 2017, Terminal 4 launched 14 automated security screening lanes in coordination with the Transportation Security Administration and Delta Air Lines. The state-of-the-art checkpoint technology enhances security effectiveness while decreasing the time travelers spend in security screening. The automated screening lanes offer several features designed to improve the screening of travelers by automating many of the functions previously conducted manually, which allows travelers to move more swiftly and efficiently through the checkpoint.
