HiFiction Thales TTT-Slim II turntable & Simplicity II tonearm - Stereophile Magazine,"Thu, 01 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0ZXJlb3BoaWxlLmNvbS9jb250ZW50L2hpZmljdGlvbi10aGFsZXMtdHR0LXNsaW0taWktdHVybnRhYmxlLXNpbXBsaWNpdHktaWktdG9uZWFybdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Money, that unreliable buyer of happiness, has at times proven effective at delivering good sound. It can buy other things, as well: Audiophiles can swap cash for products that function as objets d'art, as status symbols, or even as canny investments.

Butdo you think money can buy peace of mind for the audio enthusiast who frets over binding voice-coils, leaking capacitors, drifting resistor values, oxidizing connectors, aging or incorrectly biased tubes, and that most pernicious worry of all, distortion and premature record wear from incorrectly aligned phono cartridges? Sadly, most of those neuroses, some quite reasonable, remain unaddressed by cash almighty.

Early attempts at solving that last one had promise but failed to deliver. That's been especially true of straight-line tracking tonearms, which look good in theory but often wind up torqueing the phono-cartridge cantilever to an extent that compromises the newfound tangency and stresses the poor thing's suspensionone step forward toward peace of mind, two steps back toward audiophile angst. A different path was taken by proponents of the pivoting tangential-tracking tonearm, as originated with the Garrard Zero 100 record player of the 1970s, but that example was compromised by less-than-perfectionist levels of engineering and build quality, not to mention a mindset that disregarded the deleterious effects of resonances and micro rattling.

Pivoting tangential-trackers are once again appearing in showrooms and at shows, none more than those sold under the name Thales, designed by engineer and former watchmaker Micha Huber and manufactured by Swiss company HiFiction. At this writing, there are no fewer than three Thales tonearmsMichael Fremer wrote about their top-of-the-line Statement tonearm ($21,090) in the May 2019 Stereophileand two similarly distinctive Thales turntables to support them. Earlier this year, Huber sent me the combination of Thales TTT-Slim II turntable (at $6750, the least expensive of his two models) and Simplicity II tonearm (at $9450, in the middle of the Thales line; the two can be bought as a package for $14,180) and suggested I give them a trywhich I happily did.

Description

Thales borrows its name from Greek philosopher-mathematician Thales of Miletus (ca 624 BCca 545 BC), who noted that in a semicircle, triangles where one vertex is a point on the arc and the other two are at the ends of the arc are, invariably, right triangles. Micha Huber used Thales's Theorem as the basis for a tonearm whose arc of travel across the record is such that no matter where the stylus lands, that point is the vertex of a right angle that has the axis of the headshell and the radius of an LP as its sideswhich precisely duplicates the angle of the mastering lathe's cutterhead to the master lacquer.

Huber patented this de sign in 2004 and since then has refined its construction to its present realization: a 9"" tonearm comprising two not-quite-parallel aluminum armtubes with an articulated headshell at one end, a split counterweight at the other, and a Gimbal referred to by Thales as a Cardanic bearinga nod to Gerolamo Cardano, another dead mathematicianat its fulcrum.

In the Simplicity II, the individual bearings that comprise the gimbal, and that enable the headshell's articulation, are HiFiction's patented TTF (Thales Tension-Free) bearings. Ostensibly, these are ball-and-race bearings, but their inner races, as well as their axles, are shaped and machined in such a way that they also offer the benefits of single-point jeweled bearings.

The Simplicity II employs a clever split counterweight: Fastened to the rear of each armtube is a weight of semicircular cross-section with a cylindrical auxiliary weightthe position of which determines downforcefastened only to the inboard armtube. To correct for inconsistent downforce from the beginning of the LP groove to the end, as can result from such a design under the worst of conditions, an eccentrically weighted disc is fastened to the auxiliary weight and can be rotated and then locked in place to compensate for imbalances.

VTA is adjusted in a familiar manner. After loosening the grub screw that secures the arm pillar within the arm-mount collet, the user adjusts a vertically oriented machine screw that passes through the arm gantry and bottoms out in a dimple on said collet; as that screw is turned clockwise, the gantry and thus the arm rise up, and as it is turned counterclockwise, the gantry is lowered. The grub screw is then retightened. Azimuth is adjusted by loosening two lock screws that secure the gimbal to the structure supporting it, then turning a setscrew hidden away in that structure before retightening the lock screws. The Simplicity II does not offer an anti-skating mechanism, perhaps because this arm, with its distinctive geometry, isn't susceptible to the lateral forces that plague traditional pivoted arms, which rely on generous amounts of stylus overhang and headshell offset to achieve near-tangency. I'll leave it to the manufacturerwho specifies the Simplicity II's tracking error as a remarkably low 0.006° maximumto comment.

At first glance, the very compact TTT-Slim II turntableit measures only 16.5"" wide by 12"" deep appears to be a simple, low-mass, solid-plinth design, not unlike so many others available today. Only one of those assumptions proves correct. The platter bearing, drive motor, and tonearm are indeed all fastened to a single structure, but that structure is neither simple nor lightweight: The plinth, like the platter, is machined from solid aluminumboth have a lightly textured anodic finish in anthracite graythe combination tipping the scales at a surprising 26.4 lb. (Compare that to 13.2 lb for a Rega Planar 3.)

The plinth is machined with a number of hollows and grooves and channels, the largest of these to accommodate its inset platter; as with the classic and no-less-Swiss Thorens TD 124 turntable, the Slim II's platter mat rises less than an inch above the surface to which the tonearm is mounted. The platter is supported by a machined polymer subplatter, next to which sits a small DC motor that's isolated from the plinth by means of an intricately shaped mounting apparatus. The metal motor pulley is positioned as close as possible to the edge of the subplatter, to keep the round-cross-section rubber belt as short as possible. Wiring for the motor run through a channel machined for that purpose, which leads to the onboard drive circuitry and battery pack: Although it's connected to the user's household AC when its Li-Ion batteries need charginga running time of 20 hours is specifiedthe external charger is claimed to be electrically separate from the drive circuitry when the turntable is switched on. That said, in order to prevent any electrical emissions from polluting playback, howsoever slightly, HiFiction recommends disconnecting the charger when it isn't needed, thus keeping the Slim II off the grid during playback.

The platter bearing has a well of ductile iron, lined with a sintered bronze bushing that's said to be saturated with oil during a heated soaking process, guaranteeing maintenance-free operation ""for many decades."" The bearing shaft is made of hardened tool steel, hand-polished with basswood and diamond paste. The 7.7 lb platter, machined with a heavy rim to maximize inertial mass, is said to be tuned to one single resonant frequency, then fitted with an inlaid record mat of an unspecified high-density material. (It looks and feels a little like lead, but I'm sure that's not so.)

The final contributor to the Slim II's performance is a trio of isolation feet: smallish, height-adjustable fittings in which the contact elementssteel ballsare centered with pliant rubber fittings. The manufacturer suggests that these ""spikes"" effectively isolate the turntable from horizontal vibrations.

Installation and setup

My review sample of the TTT-Slim IISimplicity II combination was installed in my system, with all apparent skill, by Wynn Wong of HiFiction's North American distributor, Wynn Audio. That being said, the Thales turntable and tonearm, not to mention their well-executed packaging, seem to have been designed to ensure both ease of setup and consistently precise results.

Nowhere is this more apparent than in the Plexiglas-and-aluminum cartridge-alignment jigin their very good manual, HiFiction refers to this as a sight unit (footnote 1)supplied with the Simplicity II: To avoid compromising the arm's articulating headshell, the design requires that cartridges be mounted on a small aluminum plate that can, more or less quickly and easily, be removed from that headshell, to which it's locked with a single 0.9mm setscrew. The Thales sight-unit is itself made with a recess into which the cartridge and plate fitperfectlyand has sight-lines that enable unambiguously correct positioning of the cantilever and stylus. I was impressed that HiFiction invested the effort and care to create such a tool. To borrow a phrase from a soap commercial of yore, Don't you wish everybody did?

In the weeks following Wynn Wong's setup, I disassembled the player in part, mostly just to see what makes it tick. And well into the review, I installed the Simplicity II tonearm on my vintage TD 124 turntable (footnote 2). I have now handled, adjusted, and just plain used virtually every element of these two products, and I have to say this: In 34 years of writing about playback gear, I have seen no products better made than the Thales turntable and tonearm, and precious fewthat equal them. Indeed, to merely handle the Simplicity II tonearmto note how utterly free of friction yet also how solid, smooth, and free of play its bearings areleft me in awe of its manufacturing quality. And although I'm far from obsessed over VTA adjustments, I couldn't help being impressed by how easy it was to adjust arm height. Again, this is accomplished in the same manner as any number of other tonearms of my experienceyet to a one, all are downright crude compared to the way this has been executed on the Simplicity II.

Listening to the TTT-Slim IISimplicity II combination

If only because the Thales record player was so different from my ownsmall instead of large, new instead of vintage, DC instead of AC, low-torque instead of high-torque I was a bit startled by how well it performed in many of the performance aspects that are most important to me: color, drive, momentum, sheer juice. I prejudged and came away shocked. There it is.

Footnote 1: The Thales sight unit is reminiscent of, if much more sophisticated than, the clear-plastic cartridge-alignment jig supplied with the Thorens TD 145 record player I bought new in 1975. This was meant to be slipped over the tonearm's headshell and required the user to shim the cartridge, sometimes drastically, in compensation for the player's frustratingly non-height-adjustable tonearm.

Footnote 2: That one was a second sample, which HiFiction kindly dispatched to my home.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9930993318557739}",neutral,0.9930993318557739,0

To celebrate the 40th anniversary of APEX EXPO this year, we’re looking back at APEX members’ most significant achievements. Today, we consider how Thales pioneered the use of Android in its IFE solutions.

Register for APEX EXPO (Los Angeles, September 9-12)

Thales has been designing solutions with a view to improving the passenger experience for almost two decades. During this time, one of the company’s most significant investments – and accomplishments – has come as a result of its decision to build a next-generation in-flight entertainment (IFE) and connectivity solution around the Android platform.

Following the success of the iSeries IFE system, Thales created AVANT to bridge the gap between a passenger’s experience at home and in the air. AVANT was the industry’s first Android-based IFE solution and was launched in 2013 on an Airbus A350 operated by Qatar Airways.

“We were able to tap into a network of third-party developers already designing apps for smartphones, and integrate them directly to the seatback.” – Tudy Bedou, Thales InFlyt Experience

“By using the Android platform, AVANT revolutionized the IFE industry. We were able to tap into a network of third-party developers already designing apps for smartphones, and integrate them directly to the seatback,” said Tudy Bedou, chief technology officer, Thales InFlyt Experience. “Passengers now had access to the latest games and applications, which airlines could continually introduce and easily integrate to meet their customer’s demands.”

AVANT is now in its sixth generation. It features the latest 4K displays and new state-of-the-art security and encoding capabilities to enable the streaming of premium ultra-high definition content. Powered by Thales’s InFlyt360 digital platform, Thales’s IFE system will soon leverage big data and analytics to give passengers targeted recommendations and offers throughout their travel journey.

To date, Thales’ AVANT IFE system has been selected by over 35 airlines and committed on 1,600 aircraft, as the company continues on its mission to “move the passenger experience from entertainment to true engagement,” Bedou explained.

Video: French Navy's SLAMF Unmanned Mine Warfare System to be Qualified in December - Naval News,"Sat, 10 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdmFsbmV3cy5jb20vbmF2YWwtbmV3cy8yMDE5LzA4L2ZyZW5jaC1uYXZ5cy1zbGFtZi11bm1hbm5lZC1taW5lLXdhcmZhcmUtc3lzdGVtLXRvLWJlLXF1YWxpZmllZC1pbi1kZWNlbWJlci_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Video: French Navy’s SLAMF Unmanned Mine Warfare System to be Qualified in December The unmanned surface vessel of the SLAMF/MMCM program carried out a demonstration of its capabilities in Brest harbor in June 2019. Testing with teams from the French Navy, French Armament General Directorate (DGA) and Thales is ongoing while qualification for the whole system (USV + payload) is set for December this year.

SLAMF / MMCM (Système de Lutte Anti-Mines du Futur / Maritime Mine Counter Measures) results from a Franco-British cooperation initiated in 2010 as part of the Lancaster House agreement. France and the United Kingdom share a vision in which mine warfare of the future will consist in unmanned systems operating remotely from a command centre deployed either on board a mother-ship or ashore.

C-Sweep USV with TSAM sonar, during the demonstration in June 2019

The objective of the programme (managed by OCCAR), is to develop, manufacture and qualify two systems to achieve this vision by demonstrating prototype technologies, combined to deliver agile, interoperable and robust mine warfare capability.

According to the DGA, and from a French perspective, SLAMF is the system that will renew the French Navy (Marine Nationale)’s mine warfare capacity in the next decade. The launch of the prototype was realized just over two years ago to prepare for the implementation phase in 2020.

The Espadon UUV by ECA Group with Thales payloads onboard.

The SLAMF system includes:

1 Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV), the Multi-Shot Mine Neutralization System by Saab, to identify and neutralize sea mines.

3 Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV), the Espadon (Swordfish) by ECA Group with Thales payloads

1 Unmanned Surface Vessel (USV), the C-Sweep by L3Harris ASV equipped with a towed sonar (the TSAM by Thales), to detect, classify and locate (DCL functions) the mines.

Naval News attended a demonstration day involving the USV, the TSAM and the ROV in June. We saw the USV at sea, the Command and Control (C2) center and the ROV in a pool.

The USV had to demonstrate its ability to perform its DCL functions. Once in the designated area (a potential mine field), the USV delpoyed the TSAM which transmited sonar images in real time to the C2 center via data-link. The C2 was located at the Thales site of Brest, several miles away. The operator and USV detected, classified and located all the exercise mines of different types (bottom mines, moored mines…) placed beforehand by DGA teams.

Next, the ROV was demonstrated to us, in a pool with a mine placed at the bottom of the tank. Saab and Marine Nationale operators showcased the high maneuverability of the vehicle, and the quality of some of its sensors (onboard camera, sonar…).

The qualification review of SLAMF is scheduled for December 2019. By then, the components of the system must be validated one by one. A busy schedule for all parties involved: The qualification of the DCL functions with the AUV must take place this month (August), Qualification of the ROV’s neutralization subsystem in October and those of the DCL functions of the USV in November.

Thales Purchases Troubled Steyr Motors - Overt Defense - Overt Defense -,"Thu, 01 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm92ZXJ0ZGVmZW5zZS5jb20vMjAxOS8wOC8wMS90aGFsZXMtcHVyY2hhc2VzLXRyb3VibGVkLXN0ZXlyLW1vdG9ycy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Pin 0 Shares

The future of the Australian Thales Hawkei Protected Mobility Vehicle (Light) (PMV-L) has been secured by the purchase of Austrian engine manufacturer, Steyr Motors. Steyr Motors went into insolvency in February, leading to delays in the supply of completed Hawkei vehicles to the Australian Army and questions about future supply and maintenance.

Jane’s reported that the deal was agreed on 25 July, by “legal firm Schoenherr [which] confirmed that it had overseen the signing of the deal between the French defence company and Steyr Motors…”

The Hawkei is now approaching full-rate production after completion of a range of user acceptance tests, including blast tests against all variants simulating land mines and improvised explosive devices. A pair of Hawkei platforms were also deployed to Iraq under Operation Okra and Afghanistan under Operation Highroad for field testing alongside the Bushmaster PMV. The Australian Army has agreed to purchase some 1100 Hawkei PMVs and trailer units.

A Hawkei Protected Mobility Vehicle Light, two-door variant at the Taji Military Complex, Iraq

The Hawkei has not escaped controversy during its procurement with the Australian Auditor General criticising the government’s choice of the Hawkei over the American JLTV (Joint Light Tactical Vehicle) in 2018. His report claimed that the selection of the Hawkei was based around keeping Thales domestic factory in Bendigo open and securing Australian jobs. He also argued that an Army purchase of additional Bushmasters was made for the same reason rather than operational necessity.

Hawkei was almost 25% more expensive than the competing JLTV, a claim which today may stand up to less scrutiny after reports of cost-overruns on the JLTV program (which may impact on planned UK adoption of the platform, ironically paving the way for a potential adoption of the Bushmaster).

The Auditor General’s report led to the extraordinary occurrence of Thales requesting that the Australian Attorney General redact portions of the Auditor General’s report to avoid any “prejudice [against] Thales, the Commonwealth of Australia and Australian entities in the supply chain for the production of the Hawkei because it would detrimentally impact the marketability, and therefore the export prospects, of the Hawkei.” Thales’ request was granted.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.6091664433479309}",neutral,0.6091664433479309,0
HiFiction Thales TTT-Slim II turntable & Simplicity II tonearm Page 2 - Stereophile Magazine,"Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:04:12 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0ZXJlb3BoaWxlLmNvbS9jb250ZW50L2hpZmljdGlvbi10aGFsZXMtdHR0LXNsaW0taWktdHVybnRhYmxlLXNpbXBsaWNpdHktaWktdG9uZWFybS1wYWdlLTLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Thales combo, equipped with an EMT TSD 15 N SPH cartridge (the standard-mount version of the TSD 15 pickup head), played Sonny Rollins's ""Without a Song,"" from(RCAJapan Victor RCA-6011), like somebody's life depended on it: The music lost not one iota of itsin the translation from my Garrard 301 -based player to this one. And I was especially pleased that Bob Cranshaw's double bass sounded no less full, and no less snappy, than via my reference player, although the Thales combo lacked the vintage rig's sense of impact.

But there was more to it than that. In ""Without a Song,"" during his last break before the bass solo, Rollins plays back-to-back triplets that swim against the song's rhythmic stream in a manner I'm unable to describe. The Thales player nailed it, just as well as I'm used to hearing from my Garrard (and few others). And in the comparatively pensive ""Where Are You,"" each one of guitarist Jim Hall's luxuriantly arpeggiated chords was a pure, tactile delight. Tactile goodness also characterized the piano sound on Herbie Hancock's debut album, Takin' Off (Blue Note Cisco 84109), especially Hancock's solo on ""Three Bags Full.""

Lately, I've spent a lot of time listening to the Electric Recording Company's reissue of Henriette Faure's recording of Book One of Debussy Preludes for solo piano (EMIERC 350 C 004, footnote 3). Thus, I can say with confidence that the Thales player allowed the piano every bit the same (large) scale as my Garrard-based player and conveyed the same eerie languidity, right down to the last weird, disembodied A at the very end. And the Thales combo wasn't far off the mark in its ability to suggest the instrument's corporeality, al though my Garrard allowed it to sound meatier still. Another good piano recordingby Reinbert De Leeuw, performing early pieces by Erik Satie (Telefunken 6.42198 AW)sounded similarly good via the Slim II and Simplicity II, with good weight and concomitantly good scale.

But there's nothing like Satie's music, with its reliance on slow tempos and richly voiced sustained chords, to show up speed instability of whatever originand my copy of that De Leeuw LP has a bit of a warp in it: I'm accustomed to hearing from it a bit of warp-wow. I went back and forth a number of times between the Thales and Garrard-based players, and there was no question that unwanted pitch variations were less severe through the latter, presumably owing to the greater effective length 307mm vs the Thales's 229mmof my EMT 997 tonearm. All other things being equal, the longer the tonearm, the less severe the audible effects of warped and off-center records.

On one of those freewheeling Saturday mornings when I felt like annoying my neighborthe one who plants things on my lawn and whose dog is bigger and even barkier than mineI rooted around for the perfect loud Neil Young song to blast and hit upon the live version of ""Ohio"" from Journey Through the Past (2 LPs, Reprise 2XS 6480), performed by Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young with Calvin Samuels on bass and Johnny Barbata on drums. On this track, which segues brilliantly from the last note of a live performance of Steve Stills's ""Find the Cost of Freedom"" (both songs are in D, played with drop-D tuning on the guitars), Stills and Young both play big, hollow-body Gretsch guitars that seem forever on the verge of feedbacka sound I adore: they scream with thick, sustainy notes that complement the very emotional vocal performances. On the Thales, that all came across as well as I've ever heard, along with a fantastically impactful, resonant sound from drummer Johnny Barbata's ride toms. It was a satisfying and altogether moving experience. No one called the cops.

One of my two favorite versions of the Bruckner Symphony No.8 is the one recorded in 1964 by Eugen Jochum and the Berlin Philharmonic (2 LPs, Deutsche Grammophon 138 91819); my copy is an early tulip pressing, and it sounded thrilling on the Thales. The Wagner tubas in the first movement sounded especially realat the other end of the dynamic spectrum, so did the very delicate harp playing in the scherzo and the adagio. The Thales combo seemed to do the best it could with DG's less-than-lushly-textured string sound, but it was the equal of my Garrard in scale.

My only criticism was that the Thales player didn't equal my reference in its ability to shrug off surface noise. (What is it with DG records from just about any era Is it my bad luck, or were their records less durable than average?)

Listening to the Thorens TD 124Simplicity II combination

Though it may strike some as faint praise, the first thing that impressed me about the sound of the Thales arm on my vintage Thorens was that it maintained my system's core musical strengths: Lines of notes moved in time with realistic momentum and flow, and neither musical timing nor pitch relationships became the least bit ponderous or unclearhigh praise, indeed, considering that I've been spoiled by such musically accomplished arms as the Schick, the GrooveMaster II, Sorane ZA-12 and SA-1.2, and, of course, the EMT 997. The scale that opens Maazel and the Vienna Philharmonic's Sibelius Symphony No.4 (Decca SXL 6236) was as spellbinding as ever. In the chords that open Mendelssohn's Overture to A Midsummer Night's Dream, by Peter Maag and the LSO (DeccaSpeakers Corner SXL 2060), the harmonies between the notes played by the flutes and, ultimately, the oboes, clarinets, bassoons, and horn, sounded true, not sour. And the moderate swing tempo of Frank Sinatra's ""Oh, You Crazy Moon,"" from Moonlight Sinatra (Reprise FS-1018), was propelled by relentless rhythm guitar and drum kit, sufficiently steady that Sinatra's own timing shifts dazzled rather than annoyed.

Among the other records I tried was a long-time favorite: 1979's Manzanita, by the Tony Rice Unit (Rounder 0092). Apart from his groundbreaking lead work, guitarist Rice is celebrated by fellow musicians for his no-less-accomplished rhythm playing, characterized by a unique combination of fluidity and hard-charging momentum. The Thorens-Thales combination perfectly captured that soundin both Rice's playing and its real-time influence on the other musicians in the ensembleon ""Blue Railroad Train"" and others. No less delightful was the way this combination reproduced the tautly sustained notes from Todd Phillips' double bass on ""Midnight on the Stormy Deep"" and highlighted the stylistic differences between David Grisman and Sam Bush's mandolin playing throughout the album.

Conclusions

In the sense that I'm accustomed to thinking that the ultimate in involving playback is the sole province of high-torque idler-drive turntables and transcription-length tonearmsand of phono setups that require hours of painstaking tonearm and pickup alignmentthe combination of TTT-Slim II turntable and Simplicity II tonearm was a surprise, and a very pleasant one. While it never delivered the sheer impact I continue to associate with old-style low-compliance pickup heads, both stereo and mono, it consistently played music in a way that captured and held my attention and brought out most of the things I love about my favorite records.

I admit coming away from this review thinking of the Thales tonearm as the star of the show: Just as the above-mentioned Sorane tonearms transformed my lovely old Thorens TD 124 into a drivemeister of a player that all but rivaled my Garrard 301's ability to communicate music's sheer physicality, the Thales Simplicity II enhanced its ability to play lines with musical clarity and nearly hypnotic momentum and flow: playback that was just as involving, but in a slightly different way. And it must be said: The Thales Simplicity II is nothing less than the most well-made tonearm I've ever used.

While the Thales products aren't cheap, they betray a level of craftsmanship that's hard to find in any consumer productthat and an engineering approach that's as conservative as it is original: What else can you say about a designer who, unlike so many competitors, can make a turntable this good without having to make it grotesquely, uselessly big?

Especially for the user who prefers standard-mount cartridges over old-style pickup headsa group that surely includes the vast majority of phonophilesthe Thales player, and especially the Thales tonearm, absolutely must be given serious consideration by anyone whose budget can stretch this far.

These specialist Merlins are fitted with Thales Sonar 2189, a Folding Light Acoustic System (FLASH), which includes an active sensor dipped into the water by winch to locate submarine targets.

FLASH-equipped Merlins and their highly-trained crews can operate over deep and shallow water, making them highly flexible and mobile platforms.

During this recent exercise, the deployed Merlins were described by the Royal Navy as “the world’s number one submarine-hunting helicopter.”

With the Royal Navy – and NATO – re-focusing their efforts in the North Atlantic in light of increased Russian activity, anti-submarine warfare in the Royal Navy – normally delivered by a combination of Merlin helicopters, Type 23 frigates and Trafalgar or Astute-class submarines beneath the waves – is undergoing a renaissance.

The Norwegians offered their naval base at Haakonsvern as home to the Merlin detachment, plus the frigate Roald Amundsen at sea, for the exercise.

Hiding in the North Sea and fjords around Bergen – where the water temperature is similar to that off the Cornish coast, but depth and salinity are completely different – were two diesel-powered submarines: Norway’s Utsira and Germany’s U-36.

The Merlins flew sorties to locate, track and attack the submarines, first in open waters, then in the more confined environment of the narrow, deep fjords of the Hordaland region.

To come here and operate against a foreign submarine in their own backyard is both a privilege and a challenge

said Sub Lieutenant Micky Hutton, a student observer – in charge of the submarine hunt by operating the hi-tech suite of sensors in the rear of the Merlin.

“We’re extremely thankful to the Norwegian and German crews for the opportunity to further develop our skills.”

Gemalto part of group awarded contract for 15 million biometric passports by Thailand - Biometric Update,"Tue, 27 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpb21ldHJpY3VwZGF0ZS5jb20vMjAxOTA4L2dlbWFsdG8tcGFydC1vZi1ncm91cC1hd2FyZGVkLWNvbnRyYWN0LWZvci0xNS1taWxsaW9uLWJpb21ldHJpYy1wYXNzcG9ydHMtYnktdGhhaWxhbmTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thailand’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has awarded a contract for the supply of 15 million biometric e-passports over the next seven years to a consortium including Gemalto, according to a company announcement.

The contract awarded to the DGM consortium represents one of the largest passport programmes for the Thales Group, of which Gemalto is a member, in the world. Other consortium members include Data Products Toppan Forms Ltd. and MultiCert.

The passports are being launched under the government’s ‘Thailand 4.0’ initiative to provide a technically advanced, high-security travel document for Thai citizens as part of a transition towards an economy based on innovation and dynamism. The document includes multiple images, one a true color UV photo, to meet the security standards recommended by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), along with secure embedded software for fast border crossing. The consortium will also implement an end-to-end electronic passport system to adhere with the Personal Data Protection Act of Thailand.

Two active high security production sites will be established to increase capacity and ensure business continuity and security, and Thales will provide continuous training to develop local expertise. Enrolment operations will also be expanded for more efficient registration.

“Having supported the ambitions of our Thai customers over the last three decades in multiple industries, Thales is strongly committed to developing local industrial capabilities in close collaboration with our partners. The Group has developed some of the world’s most sophisticated e-passports that continuously support governments’ push towards the use of biometrics to ensure quick and secure cross-border movement,” states Thales Thailand Country Director Massimo Marinzi.

“Today, we are proud to add Thailand to that list and to help the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) strengthen homeland protection and improve the travel experience of Thai citizens. We look forward to close collaboration with MOFA and our partners to design and develop a superior e-passport that meets their unique requirements, and that exceeds the highest level of security recommended by ICAO.”

Thales has a long history of partnership with Thai public sector organizations.

Thailand is also launching a national digital ID service this year, and recently moved to increase biometric controls for SIM registration in three states.

Company chaired by USyd Chancellor Belinda Hutchinson found to have underpaid workers by $7.44 million - Honi Soit,"Fri, 30 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL2hvbmlzb2l0LmNvbS8yMDE5LzA4L2NvbXBhbnktY2hhaXJlZC1ieS11c3lkLWNoYW5jZWxsb3ItYmVsaW5kYS1odXRjaGluc29uLWZvdW5kLXRvLWhhdmUtdW5kZXJwYWlkLXdvcmtlcnMtYnktNy00NC1taWxsaW9uL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales Australia, an arms manufacturing company chaired by University of Sydney Chancellor Belinda Hutchinson, has been found by the Fair Work Ombudsman to have underpaid workers by $7.44 million during the period 2011-2018.

Thales self-disclosed the underpayment last year, which occurred after the company took insufficient steps to ensure that the salary contracts it entered into were compliant with enterprise agreements and award rates.

Hutchinson has been the Chair of Thales Australia since 2015. In 2017, the University of Sydney signed a memorandum of understanding with the company, promising to collaborate closely in the areas of defence and security research.

Thales has been one of the primary targets of the student-led Books not Bombs campaign, which has sought to expose the ties between Australian universities and the arms industry.

A 2018 Freedom of Information request revealed that USyd holds significant investments in numerous arms companies amounting to over $4 million.

Students’ Representative Council Education Officer James Newbold spoke to Honi about Hutchinson’s involvement.

“As a chair of Thales, there is no way Belinda Hutchinson wasn’t aware of wage theft occurring […]. Those responsible for wage theft are given a slap on the wrist while working class people responsible for petty theft can end up in and out of prison, secure housing and employment, for their entire lives,” Newbold said.

“Our tertiary education should be run for the public good, yet Hutchinson seemingly has no qualms with weapons manufacturing and wage theft.”

Hutchinson has held the position of Chancellor since 2013, and continues to hold a number of positions in the private sector, including a non-executive position on the Qantas board. Qantas was embroiled in its own underpayment scandal earlier this year.

Thales frequently engages with the federal government in the supply of defence goods

Thailand to supply 15 million e-passports to its citizens - Thailand Business News,"Thu, 29 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWlsYW5kLWJ1c2luZXNzLW5ld3MuY29tL3RlY2gvNzU1OTAtdGhhaWxhbmQtdG8tc3VwcGx5LTE1LW1pbGxpb24tZS1wYXNzcG9ydHMtdG8taXRzLWNpdGl6ZW5z0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"he Ministry Of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) of Thailand awarded the DGM Consortium which includes Gemalto, a member of Thales Group, the contract to supply 15 million e-passports to its citizens over the next seven years.

In 2018, the Thai Government launched ‘Thailand 4.0’ with a vision to develop Thailand into an innovative, dynamic and value-driven economy.

With this in mind, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) of Thailand will provide 15 million technically-advanced, high-security e-passports to Thai citizens thanks to the DGM Consortium, which includes Gemalto, a Thales Company, Data Products Toppan Forms Ltd., and MultiCert.

The Thai E-passport project is the largest passport project contracted for the Group in 2019.

Thai citizens can look forward to a newly-designed 64-page biometric travel document which includes an e-Cover with a thin, flexible datapage made of polycarbonate as well as a window containing a second image of the citizen and a true colour UV photo.

High standards of security

These security features ensure that the document complies with the highest standards of security recommended by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO).

Thai citizens will benefit from the highest level of performance of the secure embedded software for fast border crossing. Furthermore the DGM Consortium will also implement a highly secure end-to-end electronic passport system that will also strictly comply to the Personal Data Protection Act of Thailand.

This contract is one of the largest passport programmes for the Thales Group worldwide, and supports Thailand’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs in creating a technically-advanced, high-security travel document for its citizens.

By bringing superior standards of technology and enhancing local technical expertise, Thales aligns closely with the Government’s ‘Thailand 4.0’ initiative which aims to drive Thailand towards an innovation and value-based economy.

The current passport production capacity will increase significantly, as two active high security production sites – a Remote and a Main facility – will be established as part of the project to ensure business continuity and security for passport issuance.

By providing continuous training and transfer-of-technology to develop local expertise in passport issuance, Thales is leveraging its global technological expertise to upskill the Thai workforce as it moves towards a digital future.

Beyond a newly-designed passport, Thai citizens will benefit from greater efficiency in registering for their passports as the project will upgrade citizen-facing enrolment operations in 22 existing managed sites throughout Thailand, as well as include an expansion plan to establish 15 new sites throughout the country, offering more service points for Thai citizens to obtain their travel documents.

As a committed partner to Thailand for more than 30 years in industry sectors ranging from defence to air traffic management and to ground transportation, Thales aligns with this vision by now bringing its technology expertise in the digital identity and biometrics sector, making us a trusted partner to the Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs as they deliver a highly-secured and modern passport for their citizens.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9997215867042542}",positive,0.9997215867042542,1

Rowan grew up in Towamba, in regional NSW on his parent’s sheep and cattle farm. With a total population of 234 and a primary school of 15, Towamba is the definition of a small Australian country town.

“The Bega Valley area is absolutely beautiful,” he says proudly. “There are tiny towns dotted along the coast and plenty of farms. The place I grew up on was just over a thousand acres. As a kid, I was never short on places to explore.”

Thinking back to his childhood Rowan freely admits his life could have headed down a completely different path if it hadn’t been for his love of science.

“I was an absolute ratbag in class at times,” he laughs. “But I had a strong respect for science and loved to answer questions people don’t usually ask. I used to search for definitive answers in whatever class I was taking. Even during English, not my strongest subject, I could focus in on topics like linguistics.”

Rowan is a strong advocate for the benefits of growing up in regional areas.

“We had an amazing local community which generally came together for sport and music” he recalls. “I had a lot of time to myself to develop different practical skills like welding and carpentry with my grandfather. I learnt how to be self-sufficient and manage expectations of myself.”

The Engineer

“To be honest I hadn’t thought much about what I wanted to do when I finished school,” he admits. “I thought being chippy or a boilermaker in early high school but had a certain magnetism for problem solving which led to discussions around an engineering degree with a good friend and careers advisor in my later years.”

For Rowan, the move to the coastal town of Wollongong was definitely exciting, and the beginning of a steep learning curve. “Turns out I couldn’t cook to save my life” he laughs out loud. “But apart from that I settled in really quickly. The steepest learning curve for me was probably centred around my professional communication and cooperative learning skills, particularly when coming from a remote farm to live in a town full of students on the New South Wales coast. It was all pretty different.”

Something that Rowan picked up very early on at university was there was much more to success than just hours at the desk.

“I realised very quickly that I could get a lot more out of my four years if I put time into soft skills as well as study,” he says. “I guess it was a strange direction to head at the time, but around the third year I gave up saying no to pretty much anything my network offered. And of course, there were heaps of dead ends, but it was still one of the best decisions I made at the time.”

After his first year studying, Rowan moved to Albury/Wodonga for a ten-week placement with a metal casting company. The placement continued for two more ten-week stints, one in the company’s head office in Newcastle, and then in Ipswich on the outskirts of Brisbane.

“The time in Ipswich was particularly challenging,” he notes. “It was over summer so the temperature was around 45 degrees [Celsius] and I spent some of it working directly beside a furnace. There were days it got so hot they had to cancel the shift. I learnt a lot about traditional casting and manufacturing sites and formed early ideas about what I really liked and didn’t like in the manufacturing.”

Enter Thales

In his last year of university, Rowan’s final project aimed to characterise a specialised welding process known as Keyhole TIG welding, developed here in Australia by the CSIRO. It was on this project that he was introduced to Thales.

“Thales actually sponsored the project, I believe,” he says proudly. “It investigated a new high speed welding process that could potentially be applied to applique armour on Hawkei. Through discussion and mentorship on this project I learnt about the difficulties in developing and implementing cutting edge joining technologies.”

He admits, however “while a beautiful welding process, I don’t think Keyhole TIG met the requirements for Hawkei at that stage.”

During the project Rowan was searching for jobs online and came across Thales. After seeing the kinds of challenges the company engaged with on his final project, he immediately applied for a job and was accepted into the Graduate Program.

The position he was offered was at Lithgow Arms, so Rowan moved to the Blue Mountains and started work in January 2018. When an R&D opportunity arose at Thales Australia’s head office in Sydney Olympic Park, he took the opportunity to get back on the beach and moved to Coogee.

“I still head out to Lithgow every now and then,” he notes. “I remember when I first saw the site on day one, eighteen months ago, it looked like a place with a rich heritage and history. I got out of the car and I could hear the F90s being tested on the range and in the indoor testing facility and there’s definitely something exciting about that. And I noticed straight away that although the site is old, the intent to exploit cutting edge technology was definitely there.”

Since starting with Thales Rowan has been involved in plenty of core projects and has even been involved in establishing new processes for rifle manufacturing.

“The amount I’ve learned in such a short space of time is pretty incredible,” he says with a smile. “Learning fast is all about tapping into the wealth of experience we have within the company, and consolidating that with new technologies and processes. But I’ve also read through many papers on existing processes from metrology, to Non-Destructive Testing to barrel forging and everything in between.”

When asked what excites him most about his job Rowan doesn’t hesitate for a second.

“I’m doing things that have not previously been done before,” he beams. “Like pushing the boundaries of light-weighting through materials optimisation on products that will be used by our current and future Defence Force, where every technical advantage we can offer may literally mean the difference between life and death for them. We rely on these men and women to keep us safe, and they rely on us. That’s pretty special.”
