Stratobus is an autonomous stratospheric airship that was just approved by the French government’s “investment in the future” programme, with funding of EUR17million. These funds cover a 24-month development phase for key enabling technologies, culminating in the construction of a demonstrator. Since the project has also won support from four different French regions, additional funding of about EUR3million is expected.

Stratobus will be positioned at an altitude of about 20 kilometres over its theatre of operations, in the lower layer of the stratosphere, which offers sufficient density to provide lift for the balloon. Winds at this altitude are moderate and stable throughout the entire zone between the tropics, at not more than 90 km/h, allowing the airship to remain stationary by using its electric propulsion system. Stratobus will carry payloads to perform missions such as the surveillance of borders or high-value sites, on land or at sea (video surveillance of offshore platforms, etc.), security (the fight against terrorism, drug trafficking, etc.), environmental monitoring (forest fires, soil erosion, pollution, etc.) and telecommunications (Internet, 5G).

High-altitude pseudo satellites

The new market for high-altitude pseudo satellites, or HAPS, is estimated at one billion dollars from now to 2020, but is awaiting a product. With Stratobus offering a field of view of 500 kilometres, Thales Alenia Space is convinced that it will win a large share of this market, said Jean-Loic Galle, president and CEO of the aerospace manufacturer.

Drone and satellite

Thales Alenia Space project manager Jean-Philippe Chessel added that Stratobus is midway between a drone and a satellite, making a low-cost product offering permanent regional coverage and ideally complementing satellite solutions. Using only solar energy and green technologies, Stratobus has a very small carbon footprint – much smaller than that of a small private plane.



Thales Alenia Space and partners plan to launch a demonstrator in 2018, followed by the first qualification and certification flights in 2020. A number of potential customers have already been identified. Market forecasts indicate a return on investment in less than three years following its commercialisation.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999780654907227}",neutral,0.9999780654907227,0

VIENNA: With the rolling out of Indian Railways ' ""zero-accident mission"", several global players, including French firm Thales , have geared up to be part of the plan to provide latest technology for strengthening the safety of India's rail network.Indian Railways intends to implement Train Protection Warning System (TPWS) on a total of approximately 7,900 km of main lines across the country out of which 3,300 km has already been budgeted.Currently, TPWS, a technology meant to prevent train accidents due to drivers' failure, is being implemented on 68-km long rail line near Chennai on a pilot basis by Thales, a major player in rail transport market which offers effective signalling and supervision to telecommunications for mainline rail and metro system.The pilot project is expected to be completed by the year-end.""Indian market is very important for us. It is in our interest to be in Indian market,"" said Alfred Veider, CEO of Thales in Austria.""We are involved in Delhi Metro fare collection system as we have provided the technology support to Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC). We are also providing communication-based train controlling system for Hyderabad Metro which is a public-private partnership project,"" Veider said.There are 28 TPWS projects in Indian Railways which involves equipping tracksides and onboard systems with latest technology which have already been identified. The implementation of these projects are slated to be in the next five years.Thales has developed the signalling system known as the European Train Control System (ETCS) to prevent train mishaps and Indian Railways chooses the system as the basis of TPWS to enhance safety in train operation.As per plan, a total of approximately, 2600 ETCS on board systems shall be installed on locomotives. Currently two projects are on tender and both are in Kolkata region.While the 128-km long line, 30 stations, 62 electric multiple unit (EMU) trains to be equipped in the Eastern Railway, another 121-km long rail line, 27 stations, 70 EMUs to be equipped with the modern signalling system as accident prevention measure.Veider said ETCS was developed to replace all existing signalling systems in Europe , thus it offers the widest spectrum of functionalities of all available ATP systems and is suitable for all railway environment , high-speed lines, high-density commuter lines, and conventional mixed traffic of freight and passenger main lines.The TPWS is a technology meant to prevent train accidents due to driver's failure. If the train driver fails to observe a signal, through this technology the brake of the train is automatically activated.The TPWS would also give information about the signal aspects and also the permissible speeds. Electronic loops are placed between 50 to 450 metres on the approach side of the stop signal. It is the distance that separates the loops which controls the speed of the train. In addition to this another pair of loops are placed at the signal which indicates danger.Moreover, at the signal the loops are placed together which will detect speeds and immediately stop a train if it runs past a signal.Inside the train, a TPWS panel is placed which is linked to the loops placed on the track. This is considered to be a fool proof system which would go a long way in preventing train accidents.""It is a challenging task. We are in the Indian market for the last ten years and we hope to provide the best railway signalling system,"" Veider added.Railways aim to achieve zero level accident with the implementation of modern signalling system in the network.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999810457229614}",neutral,0.9999810457229614,0

Taking place in October 2016, Unmanned Warrior will see over 50 vehicles, sensors and systems operating in a number of themed activities in the MOD exercise areas based around Scotland and in West Wales.

Unmanned Warrior brings together British industry to demonstrate their innovation, as the Royal Navy looks to understand how unmanned systems might add real capability in a Maritime environment.

As a leader in autonomous and unmanned systems, Thales will be showcasing its capability through three categories: Intelligence Surveillance Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance (ISTAR) trials, Mine Countermeasure (MCM) exercises, and through the provision of Unmanned Systems Command and Control.





Watchkeeper

For the first time, Thales’s Watchkeeper Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS), currently in service with the British Army, will fly in a littoral environment operating alongside a Type 23 warship and merchant ship. Watchkeeper will be integrated into a series of exercises varying from persistent wide area surveillance support, to landing forces and naval gunfire support. This demonstrates the potential of using Watchkeeper to enhance the Royal Navy’s ability to defend itself and conduct operations at sea and over land.

Watchkeeper will operate up to 150 kilometres off-shore, working collaboratively with the Royal Navy to survey the littoral environment. The combination of Watchkeeper’s EO/IR sensor and I-Master Radar make Watchkeeper optimised for both land and sea operations, and for tracking fast moving targets such as jet skis and small boats. Data collected by Watchkeeper will be streamed down remotely to the vessels and analysed by trained operators to make better informed command decisions in support of the trials exercises.





Halcyon Unmanned Surface Vehicle

Also as part of the Unmanned Warrior exercise, Thales’s Halcyon Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) equipped with a Thales Towed Synthetic Aperture Sonar, will take part in a number of mine hunting challenges aimed at demonstrating the significant benefits of autonomous technology when operating in hostile environments, including the reduction of risk to life. MCM missions using Halcyon will be planned and coordinated using Thales mission management software, providing comprehensive command and control of the USV operation.





MAPLE

Thales, with industry partners is also involved in the Defence Science Technology Laboratory (DSTL) innovative research programme called MAPLE (Maritime Autonomous Platform Exploitation). The MAPLE programme is developing the future architecture for Unmanned Systems Command and Control, by enabling multiple unmanned platforms, such as unmanned air vehicles (UAV), unmanned surface vehicles (USV), and unmanned underwater vehicles (UUV), and their payloads to be innovatively commanded and controlled from a single control station.

Thales has been instrumental in the design of the multi domain architecture and has brought experience of operating USV, UUV and UAS into the design activity. The MAPLE activity will form a key part of Unmanned Warrior, providing initial implementations of the Unmanned Systems control station, incorporating the Thales mission management software for the seamless command and control of the Halcyon USV.

Thales welcomes the opportunity to support the Royal Navy’s commitment to innovation and exploring the future utility and integration of autonomous and unmanned systems into maritime operations.

Founded in 1996 by His Majesty King Abdullah II, Jordan’s biennial Special Operations Forces Exhibition and Conference (SOFEX) continues to grow with each edition and has acquired paramount ranking amongst the specialized global defence exhibitions and is considered by the international Special Operations and homeland security decision makers as well as the specialized industry as the vital gathering for exchanging views and experiences.

SOFEX provides an ideal platform to present new and innovative equipment in order to deliver swift, decisive and effective solutions, that will help decision makers maintain the security and safety in their countries, regions and around the world. SOFEX is a four-day event that is proceeded by a prominent one day conference that includes a series of comprehensive and topical seminars delivered by top military officials from around the world, tackling a wide range of issues pertinent to current counter terrorism and homeland security issues.

Held every two years in Amman – Jordan in conjunction with SOFEX, The Middle East Special Operations Commanders Conference (MESOC) takes place under the patronage of His Majesty King Abdullah II of Jordan with the support of the Jordanian Joint Special Operations Command. The conference was opened by Prince Faisal Bin Al Hussein, in the presence of the King’s Adviser for Military Affairs, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Mashal Mohammad Al Zabin, officials and senior military commanders.

MESOC 2016 feature special operations forces commanders, offering briefings to some 750 political and military leaders, diplomats, and industry representatives among Arab and international delegations headed by Ministers, Chief of Staffs, followed by opportunities for direct questions and answer sessions between the audience and a panel of discussants, punctuated with regular, informal networking opportunities in between main sessions.

Prominent among the speakers was the newly appointed Commander, U Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), General Raymond Raymond A Thomas III, the Commanding General of the German Special Forces Command KSK, Brigadier General Dag Baehr, and Colonel Andre Panya Harivongs, Chief, Special Operations Development Division, French Special Operations Command. The focus of their presentations was how Special Operations can combat the emerging hybrid threat environment, about which Gen. Thomas said, “Complex fails to describe the current conflicts.” The common theme of all the speakers was to prepare for the unexpected, information is dominance, and communications, co-operation and physical and psychological training has to be shared among the Special Forces community involved in combatting the hybrid threats.

SOFEX takes place biennially at the King Abdullah I Airbase in Amman and this year attracted 384 exhibitors from 37 countries, and 115 military delegations from 58 countries. During SOFEX, Jordan’s Prime Minister Abdullah Ensour, discussed bilateral relations, military cooperation and expertise exchange with the defence ministers of Croatia, Pakistan and Sudan, and with the deputy defence ministers of Turkey and Brunei.

SOFEX opened with a spectacular tactical demonstration by the Royal Jordanian Air Force and Jordan’s Joint Special Operations Command in attended by King Abdullah II, the Commander of the Jordan Armed Services. The demonstration featured the CASEVAC of a wounded soldier by Jordan’s newly created Quick Reaction Force (QRF) under attack from a mobile ISIS-type group. The QRF has been established to provide a rapid response to contain ISIS forces from infiltrating Jordan’s borders. Although the largest number of exhibitors at SOFEX were from the United States, there was a sizable contingent of European companies attending SOFEX 2016 including 13 from France, eight from Germany, nine from Italy and 15 from the United Kingdom.

In the French sector, in addition to COGES and DCI, Thales was prominent in highlighting its lightweight I-Master radar, and the Searchmaster radar that was recently selected by Qatar to provide a radar for its optionally piloted vehicles aircraft. Thales also features a route clearance and explosive ordnance disposal variant of its Bushmaster, a highly mobile, ballistics, mine and improvised explosive device (IED) blast resistant Protected Mobility Vehicle (PMV). Bushmaster has an established family of modular armoured vehicles offering high levels of protected mobility for combat, combat support and combat service support troops across a diverse range of mission profiles including troop movement, command and control, engineer support and ambulance variants.

Produced by Thales Australia, the Bushmaster has protected and saved lives during numerous incidents including offensive operations, ambushes and roadside bombings involving IED, FSP and RPG attack and comes with a range of field upgradeable protection packages depending on the threat environment. The Bushmaster’s large internal volume within its monocoque body has open architecture that can be easily adapted to meet multi-role requirements even in the field. Externally Bushmaster’s field of view (FOV) have been designed with a modular approach allowing reconfiguration, and simplicity of repair with high levels of interchangeability between variants. The air-transportable Bushmaster proved to be a very capable vehicle when deployed to Afghanistan by the Australian Army. In 2009 the Bushmaster was a possible contender for the French VAB replacement programme under the name of Broussard.

The ECA Group has been designing, developing, supplying and supporting robotic systems worldwide as well as military vehicle training simulators, remotely operated systems and special equipment, to support Special Forces. At SOFEX it displayed the Chameleon, a lightweight unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) designed for inspecting, handling and neutralising explosive devices. In its CBRN configuration, the Chameleon C has been tested by the French Army equipped with an AP4C chemical sensor.

Two years after the acquisition of Infotron, the ECA Group has sold eleven of its man-portable IT 180-5 VTOL mini-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with contracts totalling over €3 million. These orders originate from Europe and the Near and Middle East, including for four to the UAE. In 2016 between 30 to 40 IT 180-5 UAVs will be produced.

Photonis Night Vision, a global manufacturer of electro-optic components used in the detection of ions, electrons and photons, it innovates and engineers quality components for integration into a variety of applications such as night vision optics, digital cameras, mass spectrometry, physics research, space exploration and many others. At SOFEX, its optics were integrated in the CMOS night observation device produced by the US company Rochester Precision Optics, a high definition sight that enables its operator to see in the day (bright sun) as well as low light (night) with high contrast and high resolution. The CNOD is neither an image intensifier nor a thermal system, it is a digital system that can be deployed three ways. As a hand-held monocular, a clip-on in-line weapon sight, or as a standalone weapon sight. Currently there is no device on the market that can perform all these functions and at its heart is Photonis electro-optic components.

Zodiac Aerospace promoted its range of military tactical assault ram air gliding parachute systems which are in many Special Forces units worldwide. These included the ARZ G9 high glide high altitude free fall (HALO) and static line (HALO) system has been developed by AERAZUR to provide the Rapid Deployment Forces with a ram air parachute system capable of increasing stand off capabilities with enhanced safety and easier landing. The ARG has been approved by the French Ministry of Defense and adopted by the French Army, Air Force, Navy and exported to other armed forces.

The few European aerospace companies that attended SOFEX was Ecarys GmbH, the military division of Germany’s Stemme AG which won the French Army’s tactical UAV contract for the Sagem Patroller against the Thales Watchkeeper. At SOFEX, the company was promoting is ES15, a single-engine manned multisensor surveillance variant of its high-performance composites aircraft that the Patroller is based. With an endurance of up to 20 hours, and a maximum range of 2,500 km at low consumption cruise, the ES15 can carry a 350 kg payload including an electro-optical gimbal system and an infrared sensor on underwing pods and an airborne laser scanner or synthetic aperture radar in the fuselage. The aircraft’s composite construction gives a very low radar signature and low cross section. With its low noise emissions and operating cost of only €300 per hour, Ecary of confident of a wide market especially in the Middle East.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9993816614151001}",neutral,0.9993816614151001,0

Thales' reach in Australia explodes - CONTACT magazine,"Sun, 08 May 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbnRhY3RhaXJsYW5kYW5kc2VhLmNvbS8yMDE2LzA1LzA4L2V4cGxvc2l2ZXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales and Orica, the world’s largest provider of commercial explosives, have signed a 10-year contract for Thales in Australia to produce five million explosive boosters each year, in a deal that is good news for regional manufacturing.

Boosters are small explosive devices that help detonate larger charges, and are used extensively across Australia’s mining and construction industries.

The new contract with Thales will replace imported products with Australian ones, and strengthens Orica’s leading position in this market.

The order will increase manufacturing activity at the Benalla (Vic) and Mulwala (NSW) facilities operated by Thales, including the establishment of a new multi-million dollar production line for the boosters, designed and built in Victoria. The boosters themselves are an advanced new product designed by Orica.

“At a time of ongoing economic uncertainty, this is a great result for manufacturing in regional Victoria and New South Wales,” said Thales in Australia CEO Chris Jenkins. “Not only are we increasing employment and production levels at the sites, we’re also giving a leading Australian company committed to technology and innovation the reassurance of a high quality supply chain based in this country. Credit to Orica for investing in local skills and local manufacturing. We would also like to thank the Department of Defence for their strong support of this initiative.”

Orica CEO Alberto Calderon said: “The agreement with Thales will make Orica even more competitive in Australia, with better quality booster products. It will enhance security of supply for our customers, and be more efficient for Orica. Solidifying a deal with Thales, with its reputation and leadership in technology and innovation, is an excellent strategic fit for Orica. In addition, sustaining jobs in regional Australia as a result of this agreement is a very positive flow-on benefit for the broader community.”

The new contract sustains around 100 jobs. Approximately 200 people currently work at Benalla, and 400 at Mulwala. Key Australian component suppliers will also benefit through increased annual orders from Thales as a result of the deal.

Minister for Defence Materiel Dan Tehan said [27 April] the announcement the Benalla munitions facility would make mining boosters demonstrated the commercial applications of Defence investment.

Orica CEO Alberto Calderon and Thales Australia CEO Chris Jenkins today announced a commercial arrangement to manufacture mining boosters at the Defence-owned Benalla facility, in northern Victoria.

The contract will sustain 100 jobs across Benalla and the Mulwala facility, in New South Wales.

Defence recently acquired the Benalla facility, at the end of a long-term lease arrangement with Thales, that will utilise manufactured high explosive from the government-owned explosive and propellant factory at Mulwala.

Thales is contracted to operate both factories and encouraged to pursue commercial opportunities.

Mr Tehan said the Benalla and Mulwala factories would supply the ADF with top-class munitions and explosives and create commercial opportunities in Australia and overseas.

“I was impressed by the dedication of the highly-skilled workforce at the facility during a recent visit to Benalla with Liberal candidate for Indi Sophie Mirabella,” Mr Tehan said.

“The Turnbull Government through its Defence White Paper is supporting local defence capability to make Australia safer, create jobs and drive innovation.

“Government investment in Defence capability will increase to about $195 billion over the next 10 years, including a $1.6 billion investment to provide advanced home-grown Defence capabilities.“.

"Lithgow Arms USA Importing Thales Aus. EF88/F90 as ""Atrax"" Rifle [NRA 2016] - - The Firearm Blog","Mon, 23 May 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZpcmVhcm1ibG9nLmNvbS9ibG9nLzIwMTYvMDUvMjMvbGl0aGdvdy1hcm1zLXVzYS1pbXBvcnRpbmctdGhhbGVzLWF1cy1lZjg4ZjkwLWF0cmF4LXJpZmxlLW5yYS0yMDE2L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Big news at the National Rifle Association Annual Meeting 2016, importer Lithgow Arms USA will be bringing the EF88/F90 improved bullpup assault rifle to the USA. The F90 is a variant of the Steyr AUG developed for the Australian Defence Force to replace the F88 (their designation for the AUG) bullpup rifle.

While I did not catch the Lithgow Arms booth at the show (much to my dismay!) I caught up with the company over the telephone and via email. Also, Larry Vickers, who did visit the booth, graciously allowed me to use his photographs of the select-fire F90s that Lithgow Arms brought to the show:

Thanks to Larry Vickers for all of these photos.

Thales/Lithgow advertises the F90’s improvements versus the AUG as reduced weight (3.25kg vs. 3.60kg), improved trigger pull, improved removable barrel mechanism integrated with the optics rail, compatibility with a new grenade launcher, and an improved ambidextrous ejection pattern facilitated by a shell deflector.

The Lithgow Arms Atrax is just the latest in a renaissance of bullpup rifles on the American civilian market. Demand for a shorter weapon – driven in large part by the increasing popularity of suppressors – that is unregulated by the NFA has led to a resurgence in popularity of this concept that had almost died out on the military market.

Lithgow Arms representatives said that the rifle has been submitted to the ATF for review, and they hope sales can begin by the 2017 SHOT Show. The rifle will retail for around $2,000.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.8625065088272095}",positive,0.8625065088272095,1
