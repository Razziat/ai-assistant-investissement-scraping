"Thales, Finmeccanica say geopolitical uncertainty boosts defense, security spending - CNBC","Tue, 16 Feb 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMTYvMDIvMTYvdGhhbGVzLWZpbm1lY2NhbmljYS1zYXktZ2VvcG9saXRpY2FsLXVuY2VydGFpbnR5LWJvb3N0cy1kZWZlbnNlLXNlY3VyaXR5LXNwZW5kaW5nLmh0bWzSAXpodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS9hbXAvMjAxNi8wMi8xNi90aGFsZXMtZmlubWVjY2FuaWNhLXNheS1nZW9wb2xpdGljYWwtdW5jZXJ0YWludHktYm9vc3RzLWRlZmVuc2Utc2VjdXJpdHktc3BlbmRpbmcuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"watch now

Global geopolitical uncertainty has pushed defense to the top of national agendas, helping prop up sales at major defense products suppliers, CNBC has been told.

Speaking to CNBC at the sidelines of the Singapore Airshow, Patrice Caine, chairman and chief executive of French aerospace, transport and defense company Thales , said, ""All the countries we deal with continue to invest massively in their security and in their defense.""

In Asia Pacific, for example, Thales is currently involved in a bidding war for the contract to supply and maintain Australia's new fleet of submarines, a deal that is reportedly worth A$50 billion ($35.83 billion). Thales owns a stake in French naval defense company DCNS which is one of the bidders; other bidders are from Japan and Germany, with a decision to be made mid-year.

Caine's views were echoed by Giovanni Soccodato, executive vice president of strategy at Finmeccanica , the Italian industrial group. Soccodato told CNBC that demand for security, defense and aerospace products was growing, with Asia Pacific demand unscathed by the region's economic slowdown.

""Because this area is still seeing some tensions, it's still seeing some increased development in security and safety infrastructures, and all these needs defense,"" he said.

The ongoing civil war in Syria, North Korea's aggressive moves in recent months that included a nuclear test, and China's territorial claims in the South China Sea are just a few examples of the heightened political tensions that are spurring countries to invest more in defense and security.

Both suppliers reported seeing particularly robust demand from the Middle East. ""For them it's a top priority,"" Caine said.

Thales' results for the six months to June 30, 2015 showed the company's order book from the Middle East for aerospace, transport, defense and security products was 1.68 billion euros ($1.87 billion), a leap of 158 percent on-year, and second only to sales to Europe.

The Middle East has been engaged in particularly heavy conflict since 2011, when the Syrian civil war broke out. Since then, the terrorist group which calls itself the Islamic State has occupied large swathes of land in Syria and Iraq, adding to further instability in the region.

foxsports

Through 40 professional fights over more than 12 years in MMA, Gegard Mousasi had never been knocked out or TKO'd until he faced Uriah Hall last September in Japan.

Mousasi faced Hall as a late replacement and after a good opening round, he got caught with a spinning heel kick right in the face that sent him stumbling backwards towards the cage. Hall followed up with a flying knee and a few mores strikes before the fight was stopped in the second round.

The staggering defeat still sticks with Mousasi even today as he prepares for his return to action against Thales Leites at UFC Fight Night in London.

""That fight still haunts me a little bit,"" Mousasi told FOX Sports. ""I did everything right, I don't feel I didn't anything wrong. I didn't underestimate him. I was prepared. The only thing I maybe did wrong was I wanted to finish him too bad. But if you don't go for the finish maybe he could come back and get the finish. I don't know, I don't think I did anything wrong in that fight.

""If you fight long enough, there's going to be a kick or a punch that you won't see coming. And I didn't see that kick. Eventually, it's going to happen. It's difficult to accept it but I have to accept that loss.""

Fighters routinely note after every loss that there was always something to take away as education for the next one. Mousasi doesn't exactly discount that theory, but he's just not taking that approach when looking at the fight with Hall.

Instead, Mousasi would rather chalk it up to happenstance rather than dwell on what he could have done differently.

""I was pretty sure that I would beat Uriah Hall and that happened. It's disappointing,"" Mousasi said. ""I didn't learn anything in that fight. Only that s--t happens.""

Following the loss, Mousasi was anxious to book another fight but hoped to land a ranked, well-known opponent to get his name back in the spotlight.

He thought he got it when the UFC came calling with an offer to fight Michael Bisping at UFC Fight Night in London, but only weeks after the matchup was announced, Mousasi got some bad news.

The UFC decided to pull Bisping from their fight and put him in the main event against Anderson Silva. In his place, Mousasi was matched up against Thales Leites.

""Obviously, I was not happy but I get to fight,"" Mousasi said about the change of opponents. ""Thales Leites is a tough opponent. He's a worse matchup for me than Michael Bisping because he will try to go for takedowns to score points and stuff like that. So Michael Bisping was a much better opponent style wise and Michael Bisping is very well known.

""It's a lot better fight for me than Thales Leites, but he's a tough opponent and I cannot overlook him.""

Regardless of the opponent, Mousasi knows he needs to get back on track with a win because a second loss in a row just isn't an option he chooses to accept.

Mousasi has never lost back-to-back fights in his entire career, and he's not looking to add that first to his record after what happened the last time out.

""I'm very confident I'm going to be dominant in the fight,"" Mousasi said. ""Zero chance he's going to take me down, I believe. I'm not going to take unnecessary chances like the last fight.

""Everything has to be technical, precise and punishing. I'm going to be sharp.""

The worldwide demand for telecom satellites is driven by replacement of old satellites and business growth from new services.Xenon is a very scarce gas on Earth. Air Liquide, one of the global leaders for xenon, uses its proprietary technologies to extract xenon from air and relies on diversified sourcing capabilities to ensure a sustainable supply. Advanced analytical equipment is used to produce customer-specific xenon, from standard to ultra-high purity, for the industrial, medical, electronics and space sectors.Its density, potential for ionisation and inertness make this noble gas extremely valuable for different applications, such as the electric propulsion of satellites. High purity xenon is used as propellant for the satellite’s orbit raising and station-keeping.Satellite propulsion recently entered a new era with the development of all-electric engines, a breakthrough technology that has revolutionized the satellite industry. These engines use energy produced by the satellite’s solar panels to eject a gas (usually xenon), which then generates the thrust. All-electric engines increase the satellite’s load capacity by 50 percent, greatly reducing launching costs. In the coming years, at least one-third of the market is expected to switch to this technology.Guy Salzgeber, senior vice president, Europe Industries and member of the Air Liquide group’s Executive Committee, commented, “We are proud to have been chosen by Airbus Defence and Space and by Thales Alenia Space as their technological partner for the supply of high purity xenon. Through these contracts, we are happy to contribute to the European leadership in satellite construction by bringing our expertise in the management of sourcing and in the supply chain of noble gases which it requires.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.8879464864730835}",neutral,0.8879464864730835,0

LinkedIn

On February 22, 1986, exactly 30 years ago, France’s first civilian optical Earth observation satellite, Spot-1, financed by the French space agency CNES, was launched by an Ariane 1 rocket. The satellite had a design life of three years, but it remained operational in orbit for 17 years, finally being deorbited in November 2003 and burning up during reentry. Spot 1 sent nearly 2.7 million high-quality images down to Earth, for the benefit of scientists, government agencies, regional authorities and many other stakeholders.

Thales Alenia Space’s contribution to Spot-1

Thales Alenia Space supplied a number of major components for Spot-1: telemetry payload, solar array, reaction wheels, structural and thermal control parts for the platform, and electronics units for the instruments – a key to the satellite’s performance. The French-Italian company later provided the Vegetation 1 and 2 payloads for Spot-4 and Spot-5, respectively. These supplementary payloads were designed to continuously monitor the state of the vegetal cover for the entire planet, including both natural and cultivated vegetation.

Paving the way for high and very-high resolution

While Spot-1 impressed everybody with its extraordinary lifespan, it also paved the way for the advent of Earth observation satellites with high-resolution (HR) or very-high-resolution (VHR) optical payloads, for civilian, military or dual applications. Through this program Thales Alenia Space became one of the world’s leading experts in spaceborne observation, providing the HR and VHR optical instruments for France’s intelligence satellites, including the Helios, Pleiades and CSO families.

Export markets

In the international market, Thales Alenia Space provided the Gokturk high-resolution optical observation system for the Turkish Ministry of Defense. In 2014 Thales Alenia Space was chosen to produce the two optical payloads in the Falcon Eye high-resolution observation system for the United Arab Emirates.



French industry, also supported by Telespazio and Thales (Services), is ideally positioned to provide HR and VHR optical observation systems in export markets, within the scope of a proven and cost-competitive offering.



These systems enable countries to protect their sovereignty, monitor borders and high-value sites, support decision-making and foreign operations, etc. At the same time, they contribute to France’s balance of trade, and bolster employment in the country. For example, when Thales Alenia Space wins a satellite export contract, 80% of the total amount is reinjected into the French economy.

UFC Fight Night 84 results: Gegard Mousasi decisions Thales Leites - MMA Fighting,"Sat, 27 Feb 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1tYWZpZ2h0aW5nLmNvbS8yMDE2LzIvMjcvMTExMjc0MjIvdWZjLWZpZ2h0LW5pZ2h0LTg0LXJlc3VsdHMtZ2VnYXJkLW1vdXNhc2ktZGVjaXNpb25zLXRoYWxlcy1sZWl0ZXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales Leites has by and large looked like a rejuvenated fighter in his second run through the UFC. The Brazilian took a 5-1 record in his past six UFC fights into UFC Fight Night 84.

Unfortunately for Leites, Gegard Mousasi was there in London to greet him. And Mousasi turned it into a throwback Leites, the guy who once got cut from the UFC, in their middleweight co-feature bout.

The judges' scores were a pair of 30-27s and a 29-28, all in Mousasi's favor

Leites had no answer for Mousasi in the standup. Mousasi was brutally efficient with his striking, choosing ruthless precision over volume in landing crisp combos and sharp kicks.

Mousasi also demonstrated tight takedown defense, preventing the submission ace from from getting his ground game untracked. By the end of the second round, Leites had a busted left eye from the accumulated damage.

Leites finally showed a little life in the third, as he picked up the pace at the midpoint, but that ended up with Mousasi on top on the ground and in control.

Mousasi, who was knocked out by Uriah Hall in a bout he was handily winning last time out, defended his safe approach against Leites.

""I was dominating the round, I wasn’t going to give it away in the last 30 seconds,"" Mousasi said. ""I was ready, I could have taken it down and I played it smart. Last fight I took chances and I paid for it.""

Mousasi (38-6-2), the former Strikeforce light heavyweight champion, has won three of his past four. Leites (25-6) has dropped his past two.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9958454966545105}",neutral,0.9958454966545105,0

UFC Fight Night: Silva vs. Bisping main card

5 Round main event: Michael Bisping defeats Anderson Silva



In a five-round war that went the distance, perennial UFC middleweight contender Michael Bisping defeated the legendary Anderson Silva by unanimous decision (48-47, 48-47, 48-47). In a crazy end to the third round, Silva landed a flying knee after Bisping lost his mouthpiece and looked to the referee to halt the action. But Silva kept fighting and it looked like Bisping was knocked out, but the horn sounded and referee Herb Dean said he had not stopped the fight. Bisping was able to come out for the fourth round and managed to find a way to recover and capture the win. Bisping dominated the second round and knocked Silva down at one point, but Silva came back strong. As he usually does, Silva was very playful and in the end it may have cost him. He came forward several times with a lot of ferocity, but it wasn’t enough in the end in the judges’ eyes.

UFC Fight Night: Silva vs. Bisping prelims

Makwan Amirkhani defeats Mike Wilkinson

In an absolutely suffocating grappling attack, Makwan Amirkhani was able to neutralize Mike Wilkinson’s superior striking game and work his high level wrestling to pull off a unanimous decision win (29-28, 29-28, 29-28). Amirkhani landed four of his six takedown attempts and survived two tight submission attempts from Wilkinson in the bout. Amirkhani improves to 3-0 in the UFC.





They said it:

Makwan Amirkhani: “We put on a good show, that’s for sure. In the end, me and Mike, we both knew that we would hug each other. Because in the end, we were there for those people watching. The one thing that was in my mind was to put on a good performance and when the referee came between us at the end, I knew that we had accomplished what we came to do, so I was really happy with the performance.""

Mike Wilkinson: “Im obviously gutted that I didn’t get the win but, you know me, there’s just no ‘give up’ in me and that’s all for the fans. You can elbow me all you want and I’ll just punch you back until the bells goes, so it was one of those kind of fights. Obviously I’m upset but, it’s back to the gym on Monday, crack on and onto the next one.""

Davey Grant defeats Marlon Vera

Davey Grant returned from a two-year absence with a dominant unanimous decision win (30-26, 30-26, 30-26) against Marlon Vera. Vera had a point deducted when he grabbed Grant on the inside of his glove for a third time after two warnings from the referee. Grant out-struck Vera, 120-42 overall and landed the only takedown of the fight.



They said it:

Davey Grant: “I’m over the moon. It was a hard fight but just so worth it to get the win. I feel like I’m a better fighter now. It’s been two years of learning. It was brilliant walking out there, honestly, I felt so relaxed and it was just one of the best experiences of my life. I felt nice and comfortable in the Octagon and I look forward to the next one.""

Marlon Vera: “I’m really disappointed to get the loss. I was trying to finish the fight every second. Now I just have to keep training and start from the bottom again. I was trying to make a good fight, and finish it. This is the fight life though - sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. I’m really mad at myself.”

Scott Askham defeats Chris Dempsey

After a few straight decisions, Scott Askham brought the whole O2 to its feet with a highlight reel head kick KO against Chris Dempsey at 4:45 of the first round. Askham landed a straight left that rocked Dempsey, and as he stumbled for a moment he hunched over, leaving an opening for Askham to land the finishing kick.





They said it:

Scott Askham: “This is just a fantastic event, and to have that home crowd and that home support is amazing. Then, when I got the finish, the whole arena erupted and that’s something I will never, ever forget. Other than getting taken down early on, I’m happy with my performance. This is just a moment I’ll never forget.""

Chris Dempsey: “I am obviously disappointed. I was winning the fight before that happened, so it’s really disappointing to have it end that way. We knew what I was going to do out there, and we knew exactly what he was going to do. Now, I just have to wait and see if the UFC keeps me.""

Arnold Allen defeats Yaotzin Meza

Arnold Allen almost pulled off a last second TKO finish against Yaotzin Meza, but his huge blow landed to drop Meza just as the final horn sounded. Allen won by unanimous decision (30-27, 30-27, 30-27). The young British prospect Allen was game to wrestle a former high school state champion in Meza who trains at the MMA Lab in Arizona. Allen landed three takedowns to zero for Meza, and showcased some elite level takedown defense to earn the W.





They said it:

Arnold Allen: “I’ve been training hard for this fight and being out in Tristar has just allowed me to improve so much. I think the UFC are going to be coming to the UK more often. There is just so much talent here, so many talented UK fighters, and it’s great to be a part of that.""

Krzysztof Jotko defeats Bradley Scott



Krzysztof Jotko utilized a balanced striking attack to earn a unanimous decision win (29-28, 30-27, 29-28) over Bradley Scott. Jotko moves side to side at a furious pace and stays light on his feet so as to keep his opponent at the end of his reach. He showcased some great head movement and attacked in a calculating manner to pick up the win.



They said it:

Krzysztof Jotko: “I feel good, really good. The fight went the way I wanted it to go. I felt as though I slept a bit in the first round but in the second and third rounds I came out stronger, and I felt like I won those rounds. That’s how I won the fight, and I’m very happy with that.""

Bradley Scott: “I thought I won. I genuinely thought I won that fight. I know I lost the last round but I felt like I was putting on more pressure. I think he may have landed more punches, but I felt like I was landing better punches. He did catch me with that elbow shot, though. I had trained for that move too, I knew that move was coming but he still landed it, so good on him.""

Rustam Khabilov defeats Norman Parke

Khabilov gets the unanimous decision victory after 15 minutes of action (29-28, 29-28, 29-28)





They said it:

Rustam Khabilov: “I feel really good. He was a tough opponent. I feel like he was slick and slippery, as though he had put some gel on, or something, and so I couldn’t grab hold of him as much as I wanted to. But he is not an easy fighter, he is a tough fighter, so I am glad to win.”

Norman Parke: “I’m obviously disappointed but the better man won on the night. He is a very strong fighter and the plan was to come out and dictate the pace and keep him guessing. But he was always in and out, and he had me thinking a lot of the time, so I kind of froze in the moment in the first round. In the second round I pushed the pace a little bit. I know he got the take down but I thought it could have been one round each, going into the third round. I got the takedown but he was coming in hard – probably one of the strongest guys I’ve ever fought. But when I got the takedown I thought, that’s my chance. But he was doing the right thing, he was staying low, defending the neck. I knew whenever I was going for the choke, he was just slipping out. I take my hat off to him. He finished off strong in that third round and that won the fight, I thought.”

Luckily for Daniel Omielanczuk he was ahead on the judges’ scorecards when an inadvertent low blow ended the fight in the third round when Jarjis Danho was unable to continue. Omielanczuk took what was a less than stellar bout by technical decision (29-29, 29-28, 29-28)



They said it:

Daniel Omielanczuk: “I feel really good although I didn’t expect the fight to finish in that way. I felt like my opponent was afraid to fight and I wasn’t able to do everything I wanted, so I’m a little bit upset about that. But today I won, and that’s the most important part.""

Jarjis Danho: “I am just obviously really disappointed. It didn’t go the way I wanted. I got kneed, - so much happened out there. It just wasn’t the result we wanted at all.”

Silva has been out of action for the past year, but he's got a renewed sense of purpose with his body healthy and his mind focused on regaining the title that he held for 10 successful defenses over seven years. If he wants to take one step closer to a potential shot at the belt, Silva is going to have to get through a very determined Bisping, who would like nothing more than to add a future Hall of Famer to his resume and possibly get in line for a title shot of his own.

Also on the card, perennial contender Gegard Mousasi will try to bounce back from a recent loss as he takes on Brazilian middleweight Thales Leites. Both fighters have suffered setbacks in their previous contests, so this will be a proving ground to find out which one of them is still in the race for a spot in the top 10, and which one might be on the outside looking in when the night is over.

In today's fantasy preview, we're going to examine some of the key matchups on the card to find out who has the advantage as we look ahead to UFC Fight Night: Silva vs. Bisping.

SPLIT DECISION

These are the fights that are just too close to call, but a few minor differences between favorite and underdog could lead one fighter to victory and the other to defeat.

Anderson Silva (-320 favorite) vs. Michael Bisping (+250 underdog)

It's awfully hard to pick against Anderson Silva, even if recent performances and age say that he's slightly past his prime. Silva was arguably the most dominant fighter the sport has even known during his first eight years with the UFC, including the longest title reign in promotional history. Still, Silva did suffer through a broken leg in his second fight with Chris Weidman, not to mention his last performance against Nick Diaz, which showed him to be a far cry from the most terrifying fighter the middleweight division has ever faced.

Bisping knows this is his chance to win the big one. He's been asking to face Silva for several years, but never got his wish until now. Bisping has fallen short against the top fighters at middleweight that he's faced throughout his career and that fact doesn't get missed by the former Ultimate Fighter winner. Bisping says he's been better than ever in training for this fight and he knows a win will catapult him into title contention, so he's putting everything on the line.

But does he have a great shot at getting it done?

Well, Bisping is a real offensive machine on the feet. He actually has better output on the feet than Silva, landing over a strike more per minute over the course of a fight. His defense is slightly better as well, and Silva will often invite his opponents to attack him just so he can counter with his devastating punches and kicks. Bisping also has an underrated wrestling game that could play a real factor in this fight if he chooses to employ a few takedowns to keep Silva guessing while also potentially taking away his kicks, which are definitely one of his best weapons.

All that being said, Silva is still the choice here because he has a body of work that trumps virtually every fighter at 185 pounds and even on his mediocre days, he's better than probably 95 percent of the competitors in his division. Silva is a force of nature who lands with surgical precision in the cage – an incredible 64 percent accuracy to be exact – and he doesn't need to even land with what looks like a tremendous shot to put an opponent away. Ask Forrest Griffin about that one.

It's impossible to know if Silva is back to his old form or not, or if he ever will be again, but he's still one of the best fighters of all time, and if he fights to his best abilities, he should get a win on Saturday in London.

Prediction: Anderson Silva by TKO, Round 3

Gegard Mousasi (-300 favorite) vs. Thales Leites (+240 underdog)

Following a disappointing outing in his last fight, Gegard Mousasi returns to action this weekend against fellow middleweight Thales Leites, with both fighters in need of a big win to stave off an exit from the rankings.

Mousasi has always been one of the toughest competitors in the middleweight division, with a strong striking style that mixes in a technical boxing game as well as plenty of kicks to batter his opponents. Mousasi is definitely capable of throwing in a few takedowns as well to keep Leites off balance, but considering the Brazilian is a noted submission specialist, he might avoid that tactic this weekend.

Since returning to the UFC, Leites has looked like a completely different fighter than in his previous tenure with the promotion. While his ground game is still world class, Leites has worked tirelessly on improving his kickboxing and it has showed in many of his biggest wins over the last couple of years. Leites came up just short of picking up a signature win over Bisping in his last fight, but he was likely one round away from coming away the victor.

Because Leites has shown off real confidence in his striking lately, it could bait him into a stand-up fight with Mousasi, which is exactly what the former Strikeforce champion will want. Mousasi may not have the fastest hands in the world, but he's very consistent with his output and he won't have to worry about the flashy moves that cost him a loss in his last fight. So long as Mousasi doesn't over extend and get put on his back from an aggressive takedown courtesy of Leites, he should rack up enough points to get the win.

Prediction: Gegard Mousasi by unanimous decision

Francisco Rivera (-235 favorite) vs. Brad Pickett (+195 underdog)

If the main event doesn't get the early lead for Fight of the Night, then this bantamweight battle certainly gets the nod. Rivera and Pickett are both well known for having some of the most exciting fights in the division, and this matchup promises to be a crowd pleasing affair.

Rivera is looking to get back on track after suffering a loss in his last fight to John Lineker, and he's looking to take out his frustration on Pickett this weekend. Rivera has some of the heaviest hands in the entire division, with massive one punch knockout power in both hands – and his feet as well. Rivera is best when he's backing his opponents up against the cage and unloading a heavy barrage of shots. His mistake in the last fight with Lineker was simply standing in front of the Brazilian and trading punches until one of them fell over.

Rivera has to be careful against somebody like Pickett, because he can do the same exact thing. Pickett loves a good brawl and he's more than happy to throw hands with anybody in the division while also showing off some very underrated wrestling.

That being said, Rivera's power is a game changer in a fight like this. He only needs one big shot to slip through and Pickett could be in big trouble. There's no doubt that Pickett is one of the toughest fighters in the world, so putting him away won't be easy, but Rivera should be able to either land a couple of hard knockdowns or potentially get the knockout blow to earn the victory.

Prediction: Francisco Rivera by TKO, Round 3

KNOCKOUT PICKS

These are the fights that appear to be a little more one-sided, but remember that this is MMA, where anything can – and usually does – happen.

Tom Breese (-1000 favorite) vs. Keita Nakamura (+650 underdog)

It's probably fair to say that Tom Breese might be the best prospect out of England since Bisping first arrived on the scene.

Breese is an absolute beast in every way when he steps inside the Octagon, with huge power in his hands and a devastating ground game to compliment his striking. Breese has never gone to a decision during his career because he not only goes out to win fights, but he wants to punish his opponents into submission. More recently, Breese began traveling to Montreal to do his training camps at the Tristar gym under coach Firas Zahabi while working with fighters such as Rory MacDonald and Georges St-Pierre.

As for Nakamura, he's no slouch by any means, with more than four times the professional experience of his opponent in this fight. Nakamura has taken on a laundry list of top fighters over the years while continuing to grow and evolve his overall MMA game. Nakamura is a submission specialist with a wide variety of finishes to his credit, but going into a fight like this, he's going to struggle to even get Breese to the ground before he's eating a barrage of shots.

Breese is a brute inside the Octagon, pushing his opponents around like they are from a weight class below and then absolutely pouring on the punishment second after second, minute after minute until the fight is over. The best way to describe Breese is relentless, and if he performs up to his ability on Saturday, Nakamura is going to have a tough time surviving the first round, much less walking out with a victory.

Prediction: Tom Breese by TKO, Round 1

Makwan Amirkhani vs. Mike Wilkinson

Another top prospect to watch this weekend is ""Mr. Finland,"" Makwan Amirkhani, who has been ultra impressive since debuting in the UFC, and this could be another showcase for him against Mike Wilkinson.

Wilkinson won't just roll over and play dead for Amirkhani, especially with his heavy-handed approach and knockout power. But Wilkinson has been out of action for well over a year and he's got a very tough test ahead of him this weekend.

Amirkhani is an accomplished wrestler with great submission skills, and to add on to his game ahead of this fight, he traveled to Ireland, where he worked with coach John Kavanagh as well as featherweight champ Conor McGregor and noted grappler Gunnar Nelson. Amirkhani was already a fighter on the rise to watch in 2016, but with even more support from one of the top teams in Europe, the sky is the limit for this 27-year-old.

Amirkhani will surely run into some stiff competition once he begins knocking on the door of the top 15, but this Saturday should give him the chance to put on another great performance.

Prediction: Makwan Amirkhani by submission, Round 2

Scott Askham vs. Chris Dempsey

Scott Askham has come up short in a couple close fights since joining the UFC roster, but he has some serious punching power and that could give Chris Dempsey some trouble, especially with his move back down to middleweight for this bout.

FREE CONTENT: Anderson Silva vs. Rich Franklin | Michael Bisping vs. Yoshihiro Akiyama | Silva vs. Stephen Bonnar | Submission of the Week: Thales Leites vs. Tim Boetsch | KO of the Week: Silva vs. Vitor Belfort | Submission of the Week: Silva vs. Dan Henderson

Dempsey has put on some very uneven performances since joining the UFC roster, going 1-2 with two knockout losses, and his lone victory was an ultra close and somewhat controversial decision over former Ultimate Fighter winner Eddie Gordon. Dempsey has enough wrestling that he could potentially look to grind Askham into the mat and keep this fight on the ground, but even there he could be in danger because the Brit is more than capable of pulling off a submission.

On the feet, Askham is a very solid striker with good power and a lot of pop behind his punches, while also staying accurate with more than 55-percent of his shots hitting the target. While his takedown defense has been somewhat suspect, Askham should be able to stave off Dempsey's attacks and put together a combination that will stagger the American before getting the finish.

Prediction: Scott Askham by TKO, Round 3

UPSET SPECIAL

Norman Parke (+215 underdog) vs. Rustam Khabilov (-255 favorite)

It won't be easy for Norman Parke to pull off the upset in this lightweight matchup against Rustam Khabilov, but he's got the skills to get the job done, as long as he fights smart and doesn't get caught in a grappling match with the Dagestani veteran.

The biggest fight card in the history of UFC FIGHT PASS is Feb. 27. Don't miss it - join now!

Parke has shown off some tremendous boxing throughout his UFC career, but his biggest issue has been the inability to really put his opponents away. Parke is very adept at landing solid combinations and getting the better of exchanges, but he rarely goes for the kill and it's harmed him in the eyes of the judges several times recently. In this particular fight, however, Parke keeping the score close against Khabilov could pay off in the end.

Khabilov is a physically intimidating Sambo specialist with tremendous power in his takedowns and some very unorthodox throws. Unfortunately, Khabilov has also dealt with some serious time off, with this fight taking place a year after his last trip to the Octagon. In that bout, Khabilov struggled to deal with the striking of Brazilian fighter Adriano Martins, and while Parke certainly doesn't have the same approach, he could learn something from that performance.

Parke just needs to keep Khabilov on the end of his punches while avoiding the clinch, and if he does that, the former Ultimate Fighter winner could squeak by with a decision on Saturday night.

Prediction: Norman Parke by split decision","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9917673468589783}",neutral,0.9917673468589783,0

Both spacecraft were in the process of assembly, integration and testing, collectively known in the industry as AIT. The most important trials for both spacecraft would be electro-magnetic compatibility tests for onboard electronics, mechanical vibration tests on a special shaker and thermal tests in a vacuum chamber. Engineers were also racing to complete the software for the mission. The testing of the orbiter prototype started in January, as did the trials of the lander prototype at the end of the following month. Engineers also tested the deployment of a large antenna dish and of a pair of solar panels on the orbiter. The project's mission control center in Darmstadt, Germany, was also preparing for the mission. In particular, controllers tested space-to-ground communications between the spacecraft and mission control, including the capability to send crucial maneuvering commands to the spacecraft. One potential spoiler for the schedule popped up in the spring, when bad weather damaged a balloon which was to be used for drop tests of the parachute system for the Schiaparelli lander. Concerned that the next available test window from September to December was too late for launch in January, ESA urgently arranged testing of the parachute inside a wind tunnel at NASA's Ames research center in California. At the end of July, the parachute went through the tests with flying colors and balloon drop tests were then cancelled. Engineers were also able to take Schiaparelli's critical landing radar, known as Radar Doppler Altimeter, RDA, on a helicopter ride near Rome, Italy, for a series of tests. Helicopter flights followed tests of the same radar suspended from a crane. The lander's touchdown engines were also test-fired. Also, Moscow-based GKNPTs Khrunichev, the developer of the Proton rocket, which would be used to launch ExoMars missions, sent an adapter to test interfaces between the spacecraft and the Briz-M upper stage. The structure was also used to conduct a separation test on May 25 to measure the shock, which would be experienced by the spacecraft during the split from its space tug more than 5,000 kilometers away from Earth. During the first quarter of the year, electromagnetic tests were completed on the flight version of the TGO orbiter after which it was integrated with the Schiaparelli lander for the first time for vibration and acoustic testing in April. However due to delays during the final assembly, the vacuum testing of the flight-worthy orbiter started on August 9 instead of the planned date of June 10, ultimately leaving its team only three days in reserve by the end of the summer. On August 26, European and Russian officials began the so-called Qualification and Acceptance Review, QAR, which had to confirm that all the hardware was ready for launch before it was to be shipped to Baikonur then planned for October 21. At the time, the dual spacecraft was undergoing its final tests in Cannes. ESA was also able to strike a deal with NASA to get support from the US agency's deep-space communications antennas and one of its orbiters near Mars during the risky descent of the Schiaparelli lander onto the surface of the Red Planet. In addition, a Russian ground station with a 64-meter deep-space antenna was also being upgraded to include it into the European space tracking network, ESTRACK, so it could receive scientific data from the TGO orbiter. As a test, the antenna was used to communicate with ESA's Mars Express orbiter currently operating around the Red Planet. Problems with payloads All four scientific instruments to be installed on the TGO spacecraft gave last-minute stress to their engineers, who had to postpone their delivery for installation on the orbiter. During the final mechanical testing of the TGO only the Russian-built FREND neutron detector was present on the spacecraft in its flight configuration, while the other three instruments were represented by test versions. But even FREND was not trouble free. It arrived at Cannes from Moscow in February, and within a month, it was integrated with the orbiter. However during tests, one of four neutron detectors within the instrument began showing noise in its signal. Moreover, tests at the Space Research Institute, IKI, in Moscow discovered that other detectors of this type also misbehaved in a similar way. Engineers took the faulty detector offline during vacuum tests, hoping that the problem would not spread. Back in Moscow, IKI scientists rushed to complete a backup model, so it could be ready to fly instead of the original if necessary. CaSSIS problems In the end, three out of four flight instruments for the orbiter were in place for its crucial vacuum tests in Cannes. The missing one was the high-resolution camera, known as CaSSIS, which stands for Colour and Stereo Surface Imaging System. Because it was the last component of the ExoMars-2016 project to receive funding, the development of the complex camera was lagging behind the work on all other instruments. To save time, plans were made to ship the flight version of the CaSSIS from the University of Bern, Switzerland, directly to Baikonur for the final assembly on the spacecraft at the launch site. For the trip to Kazakhstan, the TGO spacecraft was equipped with a prototype model of CaSSIS, while the three other instruments -- NOMAD, ACS and FREND -- were in place. Obviously, assembly outside of the spacecraft's main development home in Cannes, France, could jeopardize the hyper-sensitive device. Still, mission managers were ready to take this risk, but by August, a new issue arose that wiped out all the time reserve and put the launch in question. HEPA filter problem In the second quarter of 2015, engineers rolled the Schiaparelli lander into a vacuum chamber. According to ESA, during these tests the outer shell of Schiaparelli would reach temperatures ranging between -100 degrees to +30 degrees in vacuum conditions to ensure the spacecraft could survive in space and on Mars. In addition, the test was to verify the thermal model of the lander. However as engineers began pumping out air out of the vacuum chamber with the Schiaparelli lander inside, it was discovered that the so-called high-efficiency particulate air filter, HEPA, installed on the spacecraft was not allowing air to go through fast enough. The test had to be halted and the chamber reopened. To complete the tests, a prototype of the filter was installed on the module. Still, further testing revealed that the flight model would have to be redesigned. As with other late items, engineer could re-install the device at the last minute in Baikonur to make up the schedule. However yet another problem came up. Pressure sensor problem Sometimes in 2015, the Netherlands-based developer MOOG-Bradford discovered that the new welding equipment that the company had started using in 2012 was leaving cracks in seal welds. The company was manufacturing pressure sensors, known as ""transducers,"" which were installed in propulsion systems on various European spacecraft including the Schiaparelli lander. According to ESA, the sensors were not part of the control loop necessary for landing, but would rather have gathered ancillary data for monitoring the system. In any case, all sensors of this type fell under suspicion including a pair installed on the lander. Potentially, a high-pressure leak in a sensor could lead to a catastrophic failure. ExoMars engineers faced the difficult choice of replacing the transducer with a different one, trying to repair it in place, removing the sensor altogether or taking a considerable risk and flying without any repairs. The problem was exacerbated by the fact that there was no way to check the welds on the already assembled spacecraft. It was ultimately decided to cut off the suspected components and replace them. However, as a result, the planned delivery of the ExoMars hardware to Baikonur on October 21 or its launch during the first 21-day window opening on January 7, 2016, would no longer be possible. Fortunately, the ExoMars-2016 mission still had the second and final launch window available in 2016, which would be open from March 14 to March 25. On September 18, ESA announced the delay of the mission and the schedule change was officially endorsed at the September 24 meeting of the joint steering board of ESA and the Russian space agency, Roskosmos. Inevitably, the price tag for the overall mission had increased somewhat. Traveling to Baikonur After a series of joint functional and acoustic tests, the Schiaparelli lander and the TGO orbiter were split again and between December 11 and December 17 packed into separate transport containers at Cannes, France, for departure to the Turin-Caselle airport, Italy, from where they would make the flight to Baikonur via Moscow. The Schiaparelli and the TGO were loaded on a pair of An-124 Ruslan aircraft, which delivered them to Baikonur's Yubileiny airport, on December 22 and December 23 local time, respectively. The third An-124 flight was used to deliver various clean-room equipment for the spacecraft processing.

Land 400 Phase 2 downselect imminent - Australian Defence Magazine,"Fri, 19 Feb 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1c3RyYWxpYW5kZWZlbmNlLmNvbS5hdS9uZXdzL2xhbmQtNDAwLXBoYXNlLTItZG93bnNlbGVjdC1pbW1pbmVudNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"At last week's ADM Congress Chief of Army Lieutenant General Angus Campbell said that a downselect for Land 400 Phase 2 (Army's Mounted Combat Reconnaissance Vehicle) was expected in a matter of weeks.

Source indicate that date is likely to be 21 March, around the same time as the Defence White Paper is expected. A downselect to three, perhaps even two is also anticipated.

The four contenders are stating their readiness for selection and the ensuing Risk Mitigation Activity (RMA) trials. BAE Systems Australia, which has partnered with Finnish Patria and is supported by Saab to produce the AMV35, has been one of the few to make a public statement, with most keeping their ""powder dry"" until the RMA commences.

“Our three test vehicles are built and ready to go for the Army’s 12 months of rigorous testing in the Risk Mitigation Activity stage of the tender evaluation later this year,"" BAE Systems Australia CEO Glynn Philips said.

""We believe the AMV35 is technically superior to its rivals and is a value-for-money solution for the Australian Defence Force (ADF) which benefits the Australian economy through our commitment to manufacture in Australia.""

General Dynamics Land Systems Australia with Thales Australia are expected to supply a version of the Canadian LAV 6.0 with the Kongsberg MCT-30 remote 30 millimetre turret.

Defence Business: HATS on for the ADF - Australian Defence Magazine,"Mon, 01 Feb 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1c3RyYWxpYW5kZWZlbmNlLmNvbS5hdS9uZXdzL2RlZmVuY2UtYnVzaW5lc3MtaGF0cy1vbi1mb3ItdGhlLWFkZtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"With the advent of the Australian Defence Force’s combined Helicopter Aircrew Training System (HATS), procured under Air 9000 Phase 7, military primary helicopter training in Australia could almost be said to be going “back to the future”.

Philip Smart | Oakey

Back, because the single combined Nowra based school will in some ways replicate the combined military helicopter training school raised at RAAF Base Fairbairn in the 1990s, when Army and RAN trainees were all instructed on the Squirrel helicopter.

And to the future, because the training system and equipment new recruits encounter with HATS will reflect the digital age in which today’s defence forces operate, including a much greater role for synthetic teaching systems in both the training program and a trainee’s personal journey.

Provided and managed by prime contractor Boeing Defence Australia, the training assets will include 15 Airbus Helicopters EC135 T2 helicopters and three Thales EC135 Reality H Full Flight Simulators (FFS). All will be equipped with the common Thales Meghas cockpit avionics suite, also in service with the US Army’s UH-72 Lakota (Airbus Helicopters EC145) utility and training helicopter.

The EC135 is larger, at least 50 per cent heavier and faster than either training helicopter it will replace. Its integrated avionics suite includes electronic flight and navigation systems and an autopilot, ensuring pilots will be comfortable with managing a high level of automation before moving on to their more complex operational types.

And twin engines add a statistical safety margin, create a reserve of power that will give students a better feel for the high-powered helicopters they will fly in service, and, as a side benefit, will eliminate parts of the training previously required just to ensure safe flying in the current single-engine training helicopters, now the only single-engine helicopters in ADF service.

""The EC135 is larger, at least 50 per cent heavier and faster than either training helicopter it will replace.""

Lieutenant Colonel Karl Hamlyn commands the Army Helicopter School, which provides current basic helicopter training for Army pilots at Oakey, in Queensland. The school will retire its 19 Bell B206 Kiowa trainers once the new HATS system is operational, just as the Navy will retire its 14 Airbus Helicopters AS350 Squirrels.

Although LTCOL Hamlyn feels a natural affection for the 1960s era Kiowa, he believes the highly automated architecture of modern helicopters such as the MH60R Seahawk Romeo, MRH-90 Taipan and ARH Tiger have simply outpaced the ability of the Kiowa and its ilk to provide an effective stepping stone.

“The Kiowa is a great platform for what it was, a simple single-engine helicopter, very few systems in it, no autopilot, so it’s all very hands on,” he said to ADM. “So a pilot comes out of here with pretty good hands and feet skills but no exposure to the sort of systems that they’re going to encounter in MRH and ARH.

“With HATS we’ll have a twin-engine helicopter with a lot more of the systems that they’d expect to encounter on these platforms, fully capable of operating in IF (instrument flight) conditions. Plus we’ll have the full suite of simulators and computer based training.

“The main thing with HATS will be that it really will give us a trainer that much better prepares people for getting in to the MRH and ARH. And that translates in to less time spent on learning to fly and operate those aircraft and more time actually out doing their jobs for real in the units.”

Part of the time saving will stem from the modern helicopter’s twin engines, modern stability augmentation systems, digital engine control and automation, negating some of the manual skills pilots needed to learn in the past.

“There had to be a great focus on practise engine failure,” LTCOL Hamlyn said. “In the old days of helicopter training you’d go out there and just get flogged on autorotation emergencies by your instructor.

“There’s a different focus now. With the HATS environment they’ll start off initially doing a pretty heavy computer based training phase. So they’ll do a number of sorties in the simulator before they get in the aircraft. And when you do fly the helicopter, it’s actually a lot more stable than something like the Kiowa, so you’re going to spend less time getting basic handling skills squared away. So there will be more time to focus on, okay, now you know how to fly the helicopter, let’s focus a little bit more on how to operate it and do something useful with it.”

Simulation

Boeing Defence Australia’s Senior Manager Training Systems and Services, Mark Brownsey, believes comprehensive synthetic training systems will help the ADF train helicopter pilots in an environment that lets them make initial mistakes with no safety repercussions.

“Both the army and navy’s current ab initio training is all a live training solution,” he said to ADM. “It’s class room, mass briefings and then live training. And I think to meet the needs of a modern force, with effectively all brand new platforms, you can introduce a level of synthetic training that allows you to transfer training between live and synthetic devices and do a lot of work in a much safer environment.

“It’s more about meeting the training needs than the attributes of an aircraft, because it’s just one of the training devices that you end up using.”

Technology will make a difference, not only in practical exercises, but also in how trainees receive information, maintain communication and progress through the system.

“How would you build a modern training system? Well you don’t do it on paper anymore, do you? We’ll be introducing a training management information system that introduces the ability for a new pilot to be issued a tablet. That tablet will be fed the learning that they require as they develop through the course. It’s interactive.”

The first HATS EC135 was officially accepted in 2015, and is due in Australia this year. IOC for HATS is late 2018 but the systems will begin to receive students before then, with a mature training capacity of up to 130 students a year covering pilots, aviation warfare officers, aircrewmen, sensor operators and qualified aircrew returning for instructor training.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9994757771492004}",neutral,0.9994757771492004,0
