Anglo-French project aims at using robots to fight underwater mines - New Atlas,"Mon, 06 Apr 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3YXRsYXMuY29tL3RoYWxlcy1hbnRpbWluZS1yb2JvdHMvMzY4Mzgv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"If you hunt unexploded sea mines for a living, then you might not mind losing your job to a robot. That seems to be the reasoning of the British and French governments, as they embark on a joint venture to develop a prototype autonomous system for detecting and neutralizing sea mines and UnderWater Improvised Explosive Devices (UWIED).

Mine-hunting is one of the least visible and most vital aspects of naval warfare. Underwater mines have been used in almost every major naval conflict since the Second World War, and mine hunters are a surprisingly large part of the fleets of major powers. Mines range from cheap, simple explosive devices to sophisticated computerized systems equipped with sensors and designed to wait hidden on the sea bed for years until the right target presents itself.

Meanwhile, mine-hunting methods have grown increasingly sophisticated as well, but it costs 10 times as much and it's 10 time slower to remove a mine as to lay it. In an effort to make mine-hunting operations faster, cheaper, and safer, France and Britain are looking into robotic systems that have a high degree of autonomy.

The Organisation for Joint Armaments Cooperation (OCCAR), which facilitates and manages collaborative armament programs between Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom, has awarded the Maritime Mine CounterMeasures (MMCM) contract to Thales on behalf of the French Defence Procurement Agency (DGA) and Britain's Defence Equipment and Support organization.

The MMCM contract aims at providing systems to both the French Navy and Royal Navy, along with two years of evaluation testing. It covers the design, manufacturing, and testing of future autonomous, remotely-operated mine countermeasures for the French future mine countermeasures system (SLAM-F) and the British Mine countermeasures and Hydrography Capability (MHC).

When deployed, Thales sees the mine hunters of tomorrow as a fleet of underwater robots, unmanned surface vessels, towed sonars, and remote operated vehicles connected by Iridium satellite links as well as radio, acoustic, and direct cable links that allow the command ship, robots, local operations centers, and Reach Back data centers to remain in close communications.

According to Thales, Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) would be geolocated and equipped with the latest-generation synthetic aperture sonar. The system would also use Towed Synthetic Aperture Sonar (T-SAS) with very high-resolution multiview imaging, while Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USV) with autonomous navigation and threat-avoidance sonar worked in conjunction with Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROV) capable of identifying and neutralizing mines by means of new analysis tools.

The development team is made up of personnel from Thales and BAE Systems, as well as contractors from ASV Ltd, ECA, Wood & Douglas, and SAAB. Thales will develop the Portable Operations Centre (POC), which will use command and control technology from Thales and BAE. Meanwhile, BAE will produce the Mission Management System, managing the command and information systems, the ROVs and the virtual visualization and experimentation suite.

Thales proposes weaponised Watchkeeper for Polish tactical UAV requirement - Flightglobal,"Tue, 07 Apr 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mbGlnaHRnbG9iYWwuY29tL2NpdmlsLXVhdnMvdGhhbGVzLXByb3Bvc2VzLXdlYXBvbmlzZWQtd2F0Y2hrZWVwZXItZm9yLXBvbGlzaC10YWN0aWNhbC11YXYtcmVxdWlyZW1lbnQvMTE2NDM5LmFydGljbGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales has proposed teaming with Polish industry to offer a weaponised version of the WK450 Watchkeeper unmanned air vehicle for Warsaw’s tactical UAV requirement.

Under the proposal, the British Army’s surveillance UAV would be adapted by Polish partners – potentially Polska Grupa Zbrojeniowa, the Institute of Aviation, WB Group, WZL-2 and Mesko – to integrate Thales’ free-fall lightweight multirole missile (LMM).

Matt Moore, head of Thales UK's UAS business, says that Watchkeeper would be able to carry four free-fall LMMs on two underwing hardpoints.

Poland wants to acquire 12 tactical UAVs through the “Orlik” (Eaglet) programme acquisition, with aircraft to be delivered by 2022.

Purchase of an additional batch of the selected type is planned between 2022 and 2026, while a selection decision and contract signature is expected during 2016, according to a defence ministry notice for the programme issued in January.

Polish Watchkeeper industrial activity for Thales’ proposal would include flight management; system integration; manufacture of aircraft, including composite fuselage, wings, tails and landing gear; airfield shakedown flights; and handover to customer; as well as engineering development and supply chain management.

Thales representatives say that throughout manufacture a “restricted zone” would be established so that Poland can integrate its encryption hardware and software. Poland will own the rights for all encryption modifications and modernisations developed and implemented under the development, the company notes.

Warsaw University of Technology has also been contracted to co-operate with Thales on UAV radar technologies, flight simulations, drive technologies, applications in civil services and man-machine interface.

It is understood that the integration and Polish military authority certification of LMM on Watchkeeper could be completed within 18 months once an agreement is signed. Financing will be by means of a loan guaranteed by the British government, Thales says.

The company has also proposed establishing a Watchkeeper/UAV training centre at the Polish air force academy in Deblin, Moore adds, which would offer simulated and live training.

Turkey's Gokturk-1 Reconnaissance Satellite Finally Cleared for Export - SpaceNews,"Thu, 23 Apr 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS90dXJrZXlzLWdva3R1cmstMS1yZWNvbm5haXNzYW5jZS1zYXRlbGxpdGUtZmluYWxseS1jbGVhcmVkLWZvci1leHBvcnQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"CANNES, France – Turkey’s high-resolution Gokturk-1 optical reconnaissance satellite, which was completed months ago but held up because of a dispute over the readiness of an elaborate satellite test and assembly center in Turkey, has been cleared for shipment May 7.

More than two years behind schedule, Gokturk-1 suffered the complexities of a three-nation effort ­— Turkey, France and Italy — and the strains of being the world’s first export of a satellite with a ground resolution sharper than 1 meter.

The mid-2009 contract went through months of discussions in the three nations about what protocols should attach to the contract. At one point work came to a standstill for over a year as both Turkey and its suppliers mulled throwing in the towel.

More recently, the completed satellite was put in storage at builder Thales Alenia Space’s facility here as Thales, Telespazio of Italy and the Turkish Undersecretariat for Defense Industries, SSM, debated whether the Ankara assembly, integration and test (AIT) facility was fully operational.

Construction of the AIT center is nearly as important as the satellite itself to the Gokturk contract. Now scheduled for formal inauguration in mid-May, the facility — 2,500 square meters of clean rooms, a 3-by-3-by-6-meter thermal-vacuum chamber capable of handling 5,000-kilogram telecommunications satellites, a compact antenna-test range and other features — will spearhead Turkey’s drive to satellite independence.

At an April 23 briefing here, Telespazio, Thales Alenia Space and SSM officials sought to minimize past difficulties and highlight the fact that the program now appears about to deliver on its promise.

“Of course we’re not happy with the delays,” said Celal Sami Tufekci, head of SSM’s space department. “There were lots of issues regarding export licenses. Some of these issues could have been avoided because the original contract identifies everything. But the fact is that this project was the first of its kind.”

The world of satellite Earth observation is changing fast. DigitalGlobe of the United States recently started commercializing 30-centimeter imagery with the blessing of the U.S. government. Thales Alenia Space and its rival and sometime partner, Airbus Defense and Space, have since sold submetric optical reconnaissance systems to the United Arab Emirates, Morocco and Peru, and France’s Pleiades satellites are used both for commercial sales and by French and European military forces.

Herve Hamy of Thales Alenia Space said the company has now booked orders for 13 submetric optical reconnaissance satellites starting with the French Helios military spacecraft launched starting in the mid-1990s.

Thales Alenia Space has recently built, on the Cannes site here, a satellite AIT center dedicated for optical Earth observation payloads — an indication of how promising the export market now looks.

But when the Gokturk-1 contract was signed in July 2009, it was a trailblazer. Rome-based Telespazio, a satellite services company that is part of the Thales-Finmeccanica Space Alliance that includes Thales Alenia Space, was selected as Gokturk-1 prime contractor in part to avoid French-Turkish political turbulence.

SSM and its contractors declined to disclose many details about Gokturk-1, including its precise ground resolution and details of its capacity to swivel on its axis to take photos in front of and behind the nadir track in addition to side to side.

[spacenews-ad]

The 1,000-kilogram Gokturk-1 carries rigid gallium-arsenide solar arrays and high-torque reaction wheels to facilitate swiveling. It is designed to operate for seven years in a 681-kilometer polar sun-synchronous orbit, although Thales Alenia Space officials say it is almost certain to operate much longer than that.

Vittorio Pagni, head of the Gokturk Joint Program Office at Telespazio, said a fixed image-reception facility is being built in Ankara, Turkey, with a mobile ground segment, meaning a truck-transportable station, provided by ViaSat Inc. of Carlsbad, California. Gokturk-1 imagery is sent from the satellite through an X-band link.

In addition to the AIT center in Ankara, the contract includes long-lead items for a twin Gokturk-1b satellite. SSM had required sufficient spare parts so that, in the event of a launch failure, the second satellite could be built and launched within two years.

Tufekci said SSM and the Turkish Air Force, which is Gokturk-1’s final customer, have not decided whether to proceed with completion of a second satellite following a successful launch aboard a European Vega rocket. The launch is now scheduled for late 2016.

Gokturk-1 is part of a detailed Turkish space-development program that includes a Gokturk-3 synthetic-aperture radar reconnaissance satellite now in design in Turkey, and civil-military telecommunications satellites.

Tufekci said Turkey’s goal of autonomy in satellite production can only be reached if a cadre of Turkish engineers is developed and maintained through work on export orders in addition to domestic demand.

“Without exports, this would not be sustainable,” Tufekci said. “This has to be come an industry that is maintained over time in Turkey. It is a long-term effort, we know it won’t be easy, but this is what we are doing.”

Officials said the original contract price of about 300 million euros — $323 million at current exchange rates — has not moved despite the delays and de facto work stoppage.

“It is a firm, fixed-price contract,” Tufekci said. “The delays have been a problem for us in that we wanted the satellite earlier, and a problem for the contractors because of the fixed-price aspect.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9776880145072937}",neutral,0.9776880145072937,0
Army awards $3.9 billion deal for Rifleman radios - Defense One,"Thu, 30 Apr 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VvbmUuY29tL2RlZmVuc2Utc3lzdGVtcy8yMDE1LzA0L2FybXktYXdhcmRzLTM5LWJpbGxpb24tZGVhbC1mb3ItcmlmbGVtYW4tcmFkaW9zLzE5MDU5NS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A soldier uses the Rifleman radio and Nett Warrior system last year in Afghanistan.

The Army has awarded a maximum $3.9 billion contract to two companies to trigger full-rate production of Rifleman radios, the handheld, software-defined systems that deliver tactical communications to soldiers in the field.

Thales Defense & Security and Harris will compete for orders under the 10-year indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity contract, which ultimately could deliver nearly 200,000 of the radios.

Rifleman radios are a key component in the Army’s plans to extend situational awareness to soldiers the tactical edge of the network. The lightweight, body-worn device acts as its own router, can connect to the Warfighter Information Network-Tactical, transmits voice and data via the Soldier Radio Waveform and can link to Nett Warrior, a system that uses Android smartphones for situational awareness, messaging and other applications. Rifleman radios will be included in the Handheld, Manpack, Small Form Fit program, which supports all of the military services.

The Rifleman has been in low-rate initial production, under which the Army bought 21,379 radios from a General Dynamics/Thales team. Those radios currently are supporting troops with the Capability Set 13 network package as well as other brigaded teams as part of Capability Set 14. In a solicitation issued in May 2014, the Army said it ultimately expects to field 193,276 Rifleman radios.

When it issued that solicitation, the Army said it planned to create a “radio marketplace,” with awards to multiple vendors that would compete for orders. It chose Thales and Harris after receiving three bids.

Thales and Harris also were among four companies—Exelis and Genneral Dynamics C4 Systems were the others—given a spot last year on a maximum $988 million contract for Soldier Radio Waveform Appliqué radio systems, which are single-channel systems mounted on vehicles that don’t require the two-channel Manpack systems.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999895095825195}",neutral,0.9999895095825195,0

The contract is structured as a five-year base ordering period, plus a five-year optional ordering period multiple award indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity.

Through Low Rate Initial Production, the Army has already purchased 21,379 Rifleman Radios. The Army has been authorized to purchase up to 171,933 radios through the full rate production phase of the program. The Rifleman Radio is a critical component of Lower Tactical Internet communication architecture, which is part of the Army’s capability set fielding strategy.

Under the competitive non-developmental item strategy, additional vendors will have an opportunity to compete if their technologies mature after the initial competition and operational tests. With each new generation, the Army plans to procure radios with better capabilities, including faster processors, increased power and battery life and decreased weight. Full rate production fielding is scheduled to begin in fiscal year 2017.

Each vendor will produce 50 radios, which will undergo laboratory tests to determine if threshold requirements have been met. If the vendor meets qualifications, then its radios will move to the next phase, an operational evaluation. If the vendor does not meet qualifications, then the vendor will be off-ramped. Vendors that are found to be qualified through testing will then compete to fill delivery orders as needed by the Army.

The Rifleman Radio is a lightweight, hand-held radio that transmits voice and data past terrain obstacles and beyond line of sight via the Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW). Carried by soldiers at the platoon, squad and team levels, the Rifleman Radio uses the SRW to transmit information up and down the chain of command, as well as into the network backbone provided by the Warfighter Information Network-Tactical. The Rifleman Radio also can also be linked to the Nett Warrior, using a secure Android phone-type device that enables soldiers to send messages, access mission-related applications and track one another’s locations with Global Positioning System technology.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999911904335022}",neutral,0.999911904335022,0

LinkedIn

The Sicral 2 military communications satellite was successfully launched on April 26th 2015, by Arianespace, using an Ariane 5 launcher. The launch was operated from the Guyana space center. The satellite, flying the Space Alliance's colors, was built by Thales Alenia Space and Telespazio.



About Sicral 2:

Sicral 2 is a joint program between the Ministry of Defense in Italy and DGA (Direction Générale de l’Armement), in France for the benefit of Italian and French armed forces, with respective stakes of 62% and 38%. Sicral 2 offers unprecedented flexibility and versatility. It will ensure interoperability with existing satellite systems, NATO traffic terminals and current national telecommunications networks. Sicral 2 is a technology jewel, reflecting the sum total of French and Italian expertise in military communications. It will provide strategic and tactical satellite communications services, supporting military land, sea and air platforms used by Armed Forces to garantee safety and security internal and external.



The Sicral 2 mission

The satellite weights 4360Kg with a power of 7KW. It will host the most technologically advanced equipment dedicated to an UHF and SHF payload for the Italian mission, a SHF payload for the French mission as well as a payload for remote control, Telemetry and Ranging with use of Expanded Spectrum modulations.



Thales Alenia Space's contribution

Thales Alenia Space is the main industrial partner in this program. In particular, it was responsible for the design of the entire Sicral 2 system, along with development, integration and testing (AIT) of the satellite at its satellite integration centers in Rome, Turin and Cannes. The company is also responsible for the ground segment architecture, and it designed, developed and integrated the Mission Control Centers; Thales Alenia Space France played a similar role, integrating the French Mission Control Center into the Syracuse infrastructure.



Telespazio's contribution

For the Sicral 2 ground segment, Telespazio was in charge of the design, implementation, integration and testing of the Satellite Control Center, including the main system at the Control Center in Vigna di Valle (Rome), and the backup system at the Space Center in Fucino (L’Aquila). Moreover, the company is responsible for the interconnection system between the Italian and French mission centers. It managed Sicral 2 launch service from the European Spaceport in French Guiana, including the LEOP (Launch Early Orbit Phase) and IOT (In Orbit Tests) phases. Telespazio contributed funding for the development of Sicral 1B and Sicral 2 missions, therefore entitling it to part of the transmission capacity of these satellites and provides communications services to the armed forces of NATO countries.

Macartney Connectivity For Navy Bow Sonar Systems - MarineLink,"Tue, 21 Apr 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmluZWxpbmsuY29tL25ld3MvY29ubmVjdGl2aXR5LW1hY2FydG5leTM4OTczMNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"MacArtney delivers connectivity for Thales FREMM frigate bow sonar systems

MacArtney Underwater Technology supplied SubConn underwater connectivity solutions for the bow mounted sonar systems that are essential to the impressive undersea threat detection and response capability of the advanced FREMM frigates currently operated by the French, Italian and Moroccan navies. In close cooperation with naval defense technology contractors; Thales (France) and WASS (Italy), MacArtney has designed and delivered the outboard and inboard cable and connector solutions that interface all sonar elements and connect these to the on board communications and power network.

The FREMM name represents a class of European multipurpose frigates designed by DCNS (France) and Orizzonte Sistemi Navali (Italy). The FREMM program was launched in 2005 and is run by OCCAR (European joint armaments cooperation organization) with DCNS as the prime contractor. The objective the program was to replace existing navy frigates with new 6,000-metric-ton vessels, equipped with the most modern warfare systems. The first ship of the class, the Aquitaine, was commissioned in 2012 and so far, a total of 21 ships are on order. FREMM frigates are considered to be among the most technologically advanced, adaptable and competitively priced vessels on the world market. Depending on the specific module and mission configuration, these potent warships carry weapon systems capable of dealing with almost any subsea, surface, land and air based adversary.

With a system supply spanning the Herakles multifunction radar, the Artemis infrared search and track system, various electronic warfare and communication systems along with a sonar suite, Thales has made a significant contribution to the multi-mission capabilities of FREMM frigates.

Installed onboard the vessel, the Thales sonar suite offers unparalleled performance levels including very high antisubmarine detection ranges and efficient simultaneous torpedo defense capabilities. The suite combines the UMS 4110 CL bow mounted sonar and the towed CAPTAS 4 variable depth sonar. The UMS 4110 CL is a long range system for offensive anti-submarine warfare (ASW) and self-protection. It is designed for multimode operation and can simultaneously operate two active channels (ASW transmission modes) as well as passive channels for listening only, or for the tracking of torpedoes. It also has the capability to carry out obstacle avoidance. The UMS 4110 CL draws on the very latest underwater acoustic and sonar architecture technologies, granting FREMM frigates capabilities for detection in all types of environments and in the face of increasingly diverse threats.

FREMM frigates offer a low through-life cost that is unequalled for a 6,000 t warship. Primarily, this is achieved by pervasively selecting the most reliable, high-performance and cost efficient components available and by taking into account, at conception, all system maintenance needs. It was these principles that governed the choice of a SubConn connectivity solution to interface the bow mounted sonar system.

Specifically, MacArtney supplies the ‘inboard’ lead-in cables running from the sonar dome (bulbous bow) to a central hub within the hull of the ship. Moreover, MacArtney supplied the outboard SubConn underwater connectivity harnesses providing the power and signal interface for all sonar elements within the sonar dome. Underwater connectors were needed for this job, as the dome (which is manufactured partly from reinforced rubber that is transparent to acoustic signal) is flooded with chlorinated water in order to maintain its shape. A total of 96 outboard harness cables were delivered, each featuring five power and signal outlets (two-pin SubConn connectors) for plugging into sonar elements - and one SubConn connector for interfacing with the inboard system at the opposite end. To eliminate risk of corrosion, all the SubConn connectors supplied were of the non-metallic PEEK type. While all cables were manufactured with a specially designed polyurethane jacket, the inboard cables were made from halogen free polyurethane material. All cables and connectors were tested to 4.5 kV.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999841451644897}",neutral,0.9999841451644897,0

The two companies will compete for Rifleman radio orders over the next 10 years to provide infantry soldiers with voice, text, and imagery over handheld software-defined radios.

The Rifleman software-defined radio is more like a communications computer than a traditional handheld radio. It uses software applications called waveforms to change functionality and operating bands.

Thales offers the AN/PRC-154 Rifleman radio, which delivers networked communications and situational awareness. It enables self-forming, self-healing, ad-hoc, simultaneous voice and data networks, provides software-defined capability for upgradeability and interoperability, provides low-cost Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) networking, integrates embedded encryption and GPS, and provides networked voice and data communications for foot soldiers.

The Harris Rifleman radio is the RF-330E-TR wideband team radio, which provides a long-lasting, lightweight, handheld connection to the wideband network -- including secret and below information. It provides a low-cost way for warfighters at the tactical edge to get the wideband communications capability.

The Thales AN/PRC-154 Rifleman radio is a low-cost, lightweight, body-worn radio that transmits voice and data simultaneously with the Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW). It brings secure Type 2 squad-level communications to the soldier at the tactical edge of the battlefield network.

The radio enables team leaders at the tactical level to track individual soldier position location information, providing situational awareness. It is a core component of the Army’s soldier modernization program and has been proven in Afghanistan.

The Harris RF-330E-TR radio offers share and access Type 1 secret and below, stays connected during mission while minimizing weight. Its battery life is as long as 20 hours, and it is designed to enhance situational awareness for every squad member with simultaneous voice, high-speed data, and position location information.

The Thales AN/PRC-154 Rifleman radio offers continuous transmission of position location information for situational awareness and blue-force tracking, supports hands-free display and external computer interface, has audio indicators for preset, GPS position, and battery status, participates in one voice talk call group while simultaneously monitoring other talk groups, is software programmable and upgradeable, and operates with standard USB and RS-232 devices for display use and radio control.

The Harris RF-330E-TR Rifleman radio offers dashboard display,, push-button view of battery life and network status, 30-40-second time to readiness to form or join a network and 3 minutes from cold start, and is interoperable with all Soldier Radio Waveform devices.

On this contract funding and work location will be determined with each order with an estimated completion date of April 2025.

Share this article



LinkedIn

They could well be the stars of a new science fiction film, with metallic arms like Robocop's! But in fact these are very real industrial robots, now being deployed by Thales Alenia Space. The clean rooms at the company's Cannes plant will welcome robots starting in the second half of the year.



""Tomorrow's factory"" to meet new market expectations

The space sector is undergoing deep changes. Reflecting revolutionary new projects, such as the OneWeb low orbit telecom mega-constellation, a new era in technology is also taking shape. Manufacturers are therefore rethinking their production systems, by integrating key aspects such as innovation, competitiveness, ""mass production"", and increasingly tight deadlines. In line with this trend, Thales Alenia Space recently presented one of the main aspects of its ""tomorrow's factory"" initiative, namely incorporating new technologies, especially robotics and cobotics (collaborative robotics, meaning robots working closely with humans).



About Saphir

The Saphir project, developed in collaboration with the companies AKEO+ and KUKA, will be deployed in Thales Alenia Space's clean rooms starting in the second half of 2015. This particular application is designed to automate the installation of inserts in the panels used to build telecom satellites. The system is based on a workstation with two robotic arms, one to prepare the work, the other to install the inserts. It allows a considerable reduction in the time needed to bond the 3,000 inserts per panel, while also leveraging the production expertise of the people involved. Time savings are impressive, since what took four persons three weeks now takes one person one week! In addition to improving reliability and reducing cycle time and costs, this method will also eliminate repetitive, relatively arduous manual operations.

Cobots: gentlemen robots

What's a cobot? In fact, it's a contraction of the two words, robot and collaborative. What this means in practice is industrial robots than can interact with operators in complete safety. The upshot is greater productivity and flexibility. Both intelligent and ""attentive"", they blend perfectly into the operator's work environment.

At Thales Alenia Space, this process is based on the use of a fixed cobotics arm attached to another arm mounted on an autonomous vehicle. This cobot process was conceived in partnership with the École Nationale Supérieure d’Arts et Métiers ParisTech engineering school in Lille, AKEO+ and KUKA. Fitted with sensors, the cobotics arm can detect the presence of obstacles or people, and stop moving on its own. It is fast, efficient and intuitive; for example, guided by an operator's hand, it can carry very heavy loads. The cobot is programmed to carry out various specific, often repetitive tasks. It interacts perfectly with the operator (who can start or stop a movement at will, with a simple touch of the hand), while also taking over certain arduous and time-intensive tasks.



When science fiction becomes a reality

Derived from models used in the aircraft industry, robots and cobots will help anticipate requirements from space operators, including the latest players, while also addressing their expectations in terms of competitiveness, scheduling and flexibility.

""Faster, less expensive, state-of-the-art…"". Thales Alenia Space is on track to meet the latest requirements of a Telcom market that is evolving very fast!

Shipped from Thales Alenia Space's Cannes plant, MSG-4, the fourth and last Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) weather satellite, arrived at the Guiana Space Center in Kourou, French Guiana, on April 29th. Built by Thales Alenia Space for the European Space Agency and Eumetsat, the satellite is scheduled for launch in July 2015.



About MSG-4

MSG-4 is designed to provide meteorological data and also monitor the climate across Europe. It will be placed in geostationary orbit at the 3.4° West position, 36,000 kilometers above the equator, where it will carry on the mission assigned to these second-generation satellites: provide meteorological observation capabilities for Europe until 2020.



About the second generation satellites

Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) satellites have made a strong contribution to improving our analysis of weather data. These spin-stabilized satellites (at 100 rpm) incorporate a number of technological innovations. Meteorologists benefit from higher image quality, because of a significant increase in the number of observation channels, along with better radiometric performance and shorter revisit cycles.

The nominal assigned mission is currently handled by the MSG-3 satellite, which provides an updated view of the Earth every 15 minutes. At the same time, MSG-2 provides a ""rapid scan service"", delivering a reduced, Europe-centered image every five minutes.

MSG-1, launched in August 2002 and still operational, provides backup to ensure the continuity of these two missions.



Towards increasingly accurate meteorology

European meteorology has become increasingly accurate over the years, thanks to the advanced technology of the Meteosat satellite family. With the first-generation Meteosat satellites, images were updated every 30 minutes, a figure reduced to 15 minutes on the second generation. MTG (Meteosat Third Generation) will further reduce this refresh rate to 10 minutes, making weather forecasts increasingly accurate.



Thales Alenia Space, world leader in geostationary meteorology systems

As on Europe's first two generations of meteorological satellites, Thales Alenia Space is also prime contractor for the third generation, MTG, built in partnership with the German company OHB. The MTG system comprises six satellites, four imaging models and two atmospheric sounders. Including this latest generation, Thales Alenia Space will have built a total of 17 geostationary weather satellites: seven first-generation models, four second-generation and six third-generation.

Three Thales Alenia Space-built satellites dedicated to climate change monitoring and environmental management will be launched this year: MSG-4, Jason-3 and Sentinel-3A!

For many Londoner’s the thought of being able to jump on the tube at any time 24 hours a day, is a tantalising prospect. For many years, late night revellers and night shift workers alike have been restricted as to when they can head home (or head out!) by the timetable as defined by London Underground.

Boris Johnson’s announcement of a “24 hour tube service” in September 2014, also came the realisation of a reduction in night time journeys across London by an average of 20 minutes and the support of around 2,000 permanent jobs.1

In order to achieve this ever running railway under the streets of London, there needs to be a lot of work across the network. Something that Thales has been involved with from day one.

Brian Lever, Assistant Project Manager for Thales’s transportation business, who started on the Graduate Development Programme in September 2014 around the time of the Night Tube announcement, never expected he would be involved with it during his graduate scheme.

“My involvement is project managing the delivery of Night Tube to this September 2015 deadline, in the absence of the software project manager. To successfully do that I am responsible for providing a shift by shift resource loaded plan that reduces the risks of delay. This requires booking the necessary access on the Northern and Jubilee Line to allow us to commission the software without interruption. Getting engineering time on the network is a challenge in itself, and something I had never even considered before working with Thales.”

“The re-signalling of two of London’s busiest tube routes (the Jubilee & Northern lines) was a huge project for Thales, but it set the company in good stead to work on Night Tube. There is such a wealth of experience all around me, and I get every opportunity to learn and develop my career.”

“We are working to tight deadlines, but I am confident that we will be ok. So look out for a tube running all night this September!”

London Underground’s (LU's) Highgate Control Centre has been experiencing a “constant stream” of international visitors keen to see how the Northern Line was resignalled without passenger disruption.

LU head of automatic train control Andy Bourne, who had a key role on the successful three-year project to replace the ancient old signals with the modern SelTrac TBTC (transmission-based train control) system, which finished six months early and under budget last year, told RTM that many metro systems across Europe and North America especially are considering similar upgrades.

He said: “A lot of those existing metros are coming to the point where they’re having to replace systems that they might have put in 40 years ago. So, they’re not as old as the Underground, but they are hitting for the first time that point of having to renew things on the infrastructure while keeping the railway working.

“There’s a lot of interest in how we’ve managed to do that here. London, particularly post-Olympics, has become a place that people want to come and visit.

“Highgate Control Centre has seen a pretty constant stream of people from just about everywhere, to look and see what we’ve been doing.”

LU and contractor Thales won the UK Rail Industry Award for Signalling & Telecoms in February 2015 for the Northern Line upgrade, which took the lessons from the troubled Jubilee Line upgrade and achieved something fantastic.

LU’s Stuart Harvey is now the programme director for the Sub-Surface Upgrade Programme, but before that held a number of senior Tube Lines and LU roles working on the Jubilee and Northern upgrades.

Speaking of the Northern Line success, he said: “It was the unthinkable dream, an unimaginable dream. People might think we must have set ourselves a conservative programme or conservative price, but we really didn’t.”

Thales’ programme director Andy Bell said: “We’re hugely proud to have been part of the successful Northern Line upgrade. It’s been a challenging project, but I think the results speak for themselves. The project was delivered six months early, significantly under budget, and the performance of the railway has been excellent – since it’s gone live, it’s exceeded all expectations and is top of the performance charts in terms of reliability.”

The full story of how they did it is in the April/May 2015 edition of RTM, including interviews with all the key players involved at LU and Thales.

Bourne also told us more about the work going on preparing for the next Northern Line upgrade, NLU2, which could see a complete separation of the line into two to achieve 30 or even 36 trains per hour frequencies. That long-held dream of LU, stymied before by the necessity for extensive remodelling of Camden Town, is closer than ever to coming to fruition.
