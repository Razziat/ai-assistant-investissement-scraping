"Meet Elisabetta Rugi Grond, CEO of Thales Alenia Space Switzerland - Thales","Wed, 08 Mar 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi93b3JsZHdpZGUvc3BhY2UvbmV3cy9tZWV0LWVsaXNhYmV0dGEtcnVnaS1ncm9uZC1jZW8tdGhhbGVzLWFsZW5pYS1zcGFjZS1zd2l0emVybGFuZNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"E. Rugi Grond: It’s a recent subsidiary, since it was acquired by Thales Alenia Space in November 2016. Based in Zurich, this Swiss company has 75 employees and encompasses the operations of RUAG’s former opto-electronics division. We specialize in the production of instruments for scientific satellites, as well as building optical communications terminals. Our core areas of expertise are in opto-electronics (systems combining electronics and optics, also referred to as optronics) and laser communications.

Space Q&A: People talk about your business as “high-tech jewelry”. How do you explain that?

E. Rugi Grond: Well, first I have to tell you our story. It all started in the mid-1990s. At the outset, we developed laser communications, especially for telecom constellations. This was a prosperous business up to the early 2000s. Then we got hit by the financial crisis, and we had to suspend some of our business lines. At that point, we decided to re-center our business by specializing in opto-electronic instruments. Making this kind of instrument demands unrivaled precision, but ultimately produces outstanding performance.



Space Q&A: Could you give us a few examples of your achievements?

E. Rugi Grond: There have been a number of them. Concerning the programs you’re familiar with, Thales Alenia Space Switzerland built instruments for several Sentinel families; these satellites are part of Europe’s ambitious environmental monitoring program, Copernicus. Some of our technologies were or are also used on emblematic programs such as Meteosat Third Generation (MTG), Bepi Colombo [a mission to explore the planet Mercury], the ATV resupply vessels for the International Space Station, and ESA’s IXV atmospheric reentry demonstrator. On the ATV, we built an infrared camera used to remotely manage the disintegration of these spacecraft when they burned up in the atmosphere at the end of their mission. On Europe’s IXV demonstrator, built by Thales Alenia Space, the main objective was to validate the atmospheric reentry technologies under actual flight conditions. We built an infrared camera for this mission, located near the capsule’s flaps, which operated during the atmospheric reentry and controlled landing portions of the flight.



Space Q&A: Is Switzerland also involved in the ExoMars program?

E. Rugi Grond: Of course! On the first mission, in 2016, we designed the telescope for the Color and Stereo Surface Imaging System (Cassis), installed on the Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO). On the second mission, slated for 2020, we’re making a camera that will be used to guide the drilling operations in the Martian soil, to a depth of two meters – a world first! The samples will then be analyzed by a science lab inside the rover. We’re looking for the possible existence of bacteria, or other forms of life. This data will then be transmitted via the TGO, which is already in orbit around Mars. In addition to its eponymous mission of looking for traces of gas in the Martian atmosphere, the TGO is also being used as a communications relay for NASA’s rovers and ESA’s upcoming rover.



Another one of our cameras used on the 2020 mission is a panoramic model that provides the “eyes” of the rover.



Space Q&A: What’s the best memory of your career?

E. Rugi Grond: When we managed to build the laser altimeter for the Mercury exploration satellite, Bepi Colombo. The idea for this instrument came from a professor at the University of Bern. When the concept was sufficiently mature, we worked with him right from the outset of the project. For me, it’s extraordinary that this type of instrument will be used in the exploration of Mercury, and I have an excellent memory of this effort. We also capitalized on this technology to offer similar instruments, used on subsequent exploration programs. Besides these memories, I also wanted to emphasize that we’re all very happy and proud to have joined Thales Alenia Space, because we can combine our expertise for Earth observation, science and telecom applications. In fact, opto-electronics opens the door to a very broad field of possibilities.



Space Q&A: What advice would you give to the current generation of female high-school and college students who are interested in scientific careers, especially the space sector?

E. Rugi Grond: I think that from the moment you realize that you have a passion for space, you shouldn’t ask yourself too many questions, but just plow ahead, while also making sure that you do what’s needed to meet your goals. Space is a very special field, but it’s also very exciting. You have to follow where your passion takes you if you’re looking for professional fulfillment.

Thales, a leader in critical information systems, cybersecurity and data security, announces integration of its market-leading nShield hardware security module (HSM) with Chain, provider of enterprise-grade blockchain infrastructure that enables organizations – including Nasdaq, Citi and Visa – to build breakthrough financial products and services.

Blockchain is driving transformation for businesses across multiple sectors, particularly financial services. The shared ledger model offers the financial industry a new model for transacting between organizations that is more efficient and secure than legacy systems. Cost savings, faster transactions, and improved data quality add to the many benefits of the technology. Underpinning each blockchain is robust cryptography used to protect the data from fraud perpetrated by hackers.

Security of a blockchain depends upon the security of its cryptographic keys. Every transaction executed through a blockchain process requires a new set of one-time keys. Chain uses the Thales nShield HSM to generate and secure these critical keys. With unique customer needs in mind, Chain developed the Chain Key Derivation algorithm using ThalesCodeSafe technology. This provides the unique capability to move sensitive applications within the protected perimeter of the FIPS 140-2 level 3 nShield HSM. Additionally, the solution incorporates robust cryptographic techniques, which securely and efficiently generate temporary one-time keys for each transaction.

Ryan Smith, Chief Technology Officer at Chain, says:

“As Chain takes blockchain networks to production, we’ve invested heavily in the secure generation and storage of private key material. The Thales nShield HSM offers a fast and efficient way to derive new keys. In particular, we were very impressed with the HSM’s CodeSafe feature, which allows us to run security-critical code protected within the HSM boundary. It’s a natural fit.”

Jon Geater, Chief Technology Officer at Thales e-Security, says:

“Blockchain is a game-changer in the financial services industry, with the potential to enhance security, speed and operational efficiency. Our integration with Chain provides a strong root of trust and ensures the integrity of the underlying blockchain operations that enables allows organizations to build, deploy, and operate blockchain-based transaction networks with confidence.”","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999932050704956}",positive,0.9999932050704956,1

March 23 (UPI) -- Thales, in partnership with AMST, has begun work on the construction of a High-G force Training and Test Capability facility for Britain's Royal Air Force. The centrifuge facility at RAF Cranwell in Lincolnshire will train RAF and Royal Navy pilots to counter the effects of G-forces on their bodies during combat missions. It is due to go online in October 2018. Advertisement

Thales said it will provide instructors and maintainers to run the center once the building of the facility is completed.

""AMST are the world leaders in the design, manufacture and delivery of centrifuges and Thales brings experience of working closely with the UK MOD and delivering training services to the RAF,"" Thales project manager Mike Wallace said.

The new 42-ton centrifuge will accelerate from zero to 9-g in one second, at which point it will be travelling at 58 mph and rotating 34 times a minutes.

The centrifuge will feature a virtual cockpit display so that pilots can train under realistic conditions.

""You basically sat in the old centrifuge and went for a ride, but with the new facility they will be flying a simulated cockpit,"" Wallace said. ""With this capability the pilots will better understand the processes required to deal with the accelerations while flying a combat aircraft and managing the mission systems, all at the same time.""

According to Major General Khalil Dar, the general officer commanding of Pakistan’s Army Aviation (PAA) branch, new high performance helicopters entering service will enhance the army’s ability to conduct all-weather, day and night operations in North Waziristan in the east of the country, and other remote and mountainous areas. Speaking at the recent IQPC International Military Helicopter conference in London held in early February, Gen. Dar thanked Airbus Helicopters for its fleet of H-125M Fennec armed reconnaissance helicopters, eight of which will enter service in April.

According to official specifications, these helicopters have the capability to fly in excess of 10000 feet (3166 metres) altitude, and will work with the army’s Bell AH-1Z Viper attack helicopters; twelve of which have been ordered by the PAA, the first three of which will be delivered by the end of this year. Pakistan ordered the first three helicopters in August 2015, and placed an additional order for nine helicopters in April 2016.

What's up with Stratobus? - Thales,"Fri, 17 Mar 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi93b3JsZHdpZGUvc3BhY2UvbmV3cy93aGF0cy1zdHJhdG9idXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"There’s been a lot of buzz about the Stratobusconcept, first when it was introduced during the 2014 at Thales’ Innovation Days, then on the Net and social networks before the press also made it front page news. In a few short months Stratobus became the latest favorite of geeks and early adopters. It has been compared to other concepts, from zeppelins and drones to Google’s Loon balloons. But in fact Stratobusis neither a drone nor a satellite, but a stratospheric airship that combines the best of both worlds. The program was officially launched in April 2016. We asked Jean-Philippe Chessel, Director of the Stratobusproduct line at Thales Alenia Space, to review its current status.

Space Q&A: Could you briefly explain the StratobusTM concept?

J-P Chessel: Stratobus is an autonomous, multi-mission stratospheric airship, midway between a drone and a satellite. Marking a real break with existing systems, StratobusTM is considered part of the HAPS [High Altitude Pseudo Satellite] family. It is mainly intended for local missions, and is a perfect fit with conventional satellite systems. StratobusTM operates at an altitude of 20 kilometers (above the jet stream and air traffic) and is designed for a wide range of civil or military regional applications: telecommunications, navigation, observation (especially surveillance), etc.

Space Q&A: Could you give us a few concrete examples of possible applications?

J-P Chessel: StratobusTM could be used for surveillance missions, including land, maritime, oil platforms, piracy at sea, etc. It is also highly suited to environmental monitoring missions. For observation missions, StratobusTM can carry both radar and optical imaging payloads, which gives it continuous surveillance capability, day or night and under all weather conditions. For military applications, StratobusTM can be displaced as theaters of operation move. It would also be very useful in the telecommunications market, to provide 4G and 5G connectivity in the future. Its position in the stratosphere at an attitude of 20 kilometers is an optimal position for 5G, which demands very short latency, of just a few milliseconds. Concerning navigation applications, it would strengthen the AIS [Automatic Identification System] network in heavy traffic zones, thus improving traffic control. In other words, StratobusTM is really a multidisciplinary solution for local missions out to a terrestrial horizon of up to 500 kilometers!

StratobusTM is not a toy! It will weigh nearly seven metric tons and measure 115 meters long and 34 meters in diameter at the widest point.

Space Q&A: How is the program developing today?

J-P Chessel: The program kicked off officially on April 26, 2016. Along with funding partners CGI/Bpifrance [organizations supporting French Investment in the Future programs], we have three major program milestones. The first is the SRR, or System Readiness Review, which aims to consolidate the concept’s specifications. We passed the SRR in December 2016. The next phase, the PDR [Preliminary Design Review] will take place in mid-2017, resulting in a concept that meets the defined specifications. It will be followed in 2018 by the CDR [Critical Design Review], which provides a detailed definition so we can launch the actual production.

One important point is that, following the first phase, we decided to make several changes to StratobusTM in order to consolidate the project. For instance, the internal solar concentrator as initially designed will now be placed outside, on top of the airship. Secondly, the original transparent envelope will become opaque. These two changes will help definitely eradicate the effects linked to heating, expansion, etc. By raising the technology readiness level, we increase our chances of bringing StratobusTM to market in 2020 or 2021.

Towards 2020, StratobusTM will be able to carry existing payloads that have been adapted to the platform, such as the Radar Search Master from Thales. At the same time, the program is studying the possibility of integrating payloads purpose-designed for StratobusTM, but the associated development and manufacturing cycles are longer. This second wave of development would lead to a market entry towards 2025.

Where will StratobusTM airships be manufactured?

J-P Chessel: We have our production base in Istres, southern France, which could build the Prototype Flight Model (PFM). Other production facilities could be set up near operational headquarters for customers who are interested in the development of this new technology.

What’s the latest program news?

J-P Chessel: In January 2017, we signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the MASDAR institute in the United Arab Emirates and the MINES ParisTech engineering school in France to study possible StratobusTM missions for environmental protection (CO2 rates, water cleanliness, etc.). We already have several potential customers who are keenly interested in Stratobus-based applications. They are undisclosed for the moment, because of confidentiality concerns.

What are the advantages of using StratobusTM ?

J-P Chessel: StratobusTM is a highly competitive and innovative product. Its advantages include the wide range of possible missions, its stationary positioning and the fact that it can be easily repositioned and also brought back down to earth for maintenance. Plus, you don’t have to use an expensive launch vehicle for this space-like capacity.

For military observation missions, its ability to provide continuous observation is a major advantage. The other important point is its payload capacity. In standard configuration, StratobusTM can carry 250 kilos of payload, with a power rating of 5 kW. For certain specific missions at the equator, this capacity reaches up to 450 kilos and a rating of 8 kW if we combine an optical instrument with a powerful radar, the pairing of these two instruments ensuring continuous mission capability. In the zone between the tropics, where winds blow at less than 90km/h, it could provide permanent service all year long and 24/7. [StratobusTM is designed for 5-year missions, with annual servicing.] In Europe, our competition is proposing a “solar glider”, with a payload capacity of 5 kilos and a 3-week mission duration. There is no real comparison with the formidable – and I use this word on purpose – field of possibilities offered by StratobusTM.

A little while ago, Google had developed a solar drone called SkyBender (built by Titan Aerospace, acquired by Google). But two demonstrator failures showed that the drone wasn’t able to deliver 5G because the payload was not consistent enough to carry out this mission continuously. So Google abandoned the SkyBender project to take up its Loon project with moving balloons. However, this project is very complex, because it requires a large number of balloons in motion, each carrying a payload weighing about 20 kilos. In fact, StratobusTM could very easily be integrated with the Loon project, helping to strengthen its general architecture.

What are the current trends in the HAPS market?

J-P Chessel: We estimate an accessible market for high altitude proto satellites (HAPS) of about one billion dollars a year towards 2020, and our American competitors make the same estimate. Furthermore, the targeted annual growth rate between 2020 and 2030 is 12%.

And the next steps in this program?

J-P Chessel: After the CDR in 2018, we expect to start developing the PFM (Prototype Flight Model) and fly it in late 2020 or 2021, with production kicking off in 2021-22.

How has StratobusTM changed the organization of Thales Alenia Space?

J-P Chessel: First, because this is a totally disruptive technology, Thales Alenia Space created its own product line. StratobusTM also brought with it a new operating mode. We are applying concurrent engineering along with our partners, in a single venue for a predetermined period. This type of organization, also used in Silicon Valley startups, or companies like SpaceX, generates results very quickly by applying a company-wide collaborative working method, based on open innovation. It was this approach that allowed us to pass the SRR right on schedule. Any decisions on changing the concept were made jointly with our partners, including moving the solar concentrator from the inside to the outside, making the envelope opaque and using four engines for better aerial navigation.

What’s really new in this concept is to integrate optical and radar instruments, along with telecom payloads and equipment purpose-designed for StratobusTM.

Why do you say that Stratobus complements satellite solutions?

J-P Chessel: Satellites provide global coverage, and can focus on one or more countries, or even a whole continent. StratobusTM will provide regional coverage. The two solutions are fully complementary, for both observation and telecommunications applications. For observation, StratobusTM could provide additional and/or more detailed information in relation to that provided by optical and radar observation satellites. For satcom systems, StratobusTM is an excellent solution to boost signal strength at the edges of the coverage zone. StratobusTM will surely lead to a change in the paradigm. Depending on user requests [and it’s really on a case by case basis], we could offer a comprehensive solution that includes, for example, several Earth observation satellites for global coverage, along with one or several StratobusTM airships for local surveillance, and even drones to take action if a threat is detected and confirmed.

Janice Marshall - Thales,"Sun, 05 Mar 2017 09:07:35 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi9jYXJlZXJzL2l3ZC9qYW5pY2UtbWFyc2hhbGzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"I joined Thales in September 2008 to define and lead the worldwide Supplemental Type Certification (STC) process for the Avionics Services Business, Worldwide, and to develop the STC business via worldwide bid support and execution of projects. In this role, I’m the primary interface between all Thales supporting departments (AMERICAs, EuMEA, ASIA, Central), responsible for subcontractor performance, customer satisfaction, and achievement of financial & project objectives, as well as manager of the STC Center of Excellence for ASW.



The prior experience I brought to this new position was gained outside aerospace making this quite a challenge, but it was an exciting opportunity and a great way to learn the industry and specifics of our avionics services business.



Four years later, in addition to these roles and other special projects, I accepted an ASW appointment as Technical and In Service Program Manager for Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation business aircraft, and shortly thereafter, I also took over Integrated Logistics Support for Gulfstream business aircraft programs in development. Wow! Quite a lot right? But I’m no stranger to hard work.



Before joining Thales I ran my own Project Management consultancy where I routinely “rolled up my sleeves” and joined the team to become fully invested in projects, small and large - from operations management of a small business franchise to business continuity planning and out-of-state relocation management for customer service, warehousing services, order fulfilment and specialty credential programs for the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), one of the largest professional organizations in the US.



Prior to that, graduating in Chemical Engineering, I spent 15 years at AT&T/Lucent Bell Laboratories in a series of increasingly responsible positions in R&D, Process Development, Technical Marketing, and Strategy/Business Development.



Why did you choose this career path?



I read somewhere that in a lifetime a person will have 3 careers…..



I love to learn and am not afraid of change. With an MS in Chemical Engineering I took a chance and followed a non-traditional career path. Instead of entering the Energy sector like most of my classmates, instead I chose the telecommunications sector. As a young engineer, I learned that experience and exposure gained while working for a large, well respected multinational company was incomparable. Over a 15 year time span it offered an excellent environment to learn and afforded me the opportunity to grow and be promoted from within the company.



Then, I made a major shift in my career, leaving telecommunications to pursue a career in project management. Again, this was not a traditional path for someone with my background. Change is good and ultimately it brought me to Thales! In the 8½ years I’ve been with Thales, also a large multinational company that values diverse backgrounds and invests in its people, I have again enjoyed a series of increasingly responsible and immensely rewarding positions in aerospace services .Rewarding not only for being recognized as achieving/exceeding business objectives, but also personally rewarding – to know that if I accept new challenges and believe in myself I can overcome obstacles and find success. It’s never too late to try something new!



In the end, change is certain and it’s the adaptive person who succeeds!



Looking back, what are the highlights in your career so far?



A key highlight of my career was to have successfully changed career paths, leveraging skills from one career to build momentum for the next. I have been recognized for accomplishments which led to successive promotions, and have transitioned between different positions in different industries with increasing levels of responsibilities and authority - I can tell you it’s not as easy as it may sound! I’m grateful for the good fortune I’ve had and I don’t take anything for granted.



I’ve had the distinct privilege to work with exceptionally talented individuals and high performing committed teams - another career highlight for which I’m thankful.



What are the major challenges of your job today?



It’s always a challenge to manage transverse teams for multiple different projects. But it can be more complex when the teams are located in varying countries, cultures and time zones. Thales has done a great job of building tools and creating an environment to standardize how we work. Indeed we are “One team, one Thales” and it’s a core basic premise that we follow the same “game plan”.



What’s next?



I’d like to continue in the Project Management job family evolving my role to include more responsibility for people and projects.



As an adjunct to my career and to give back to my community, I’ll engage in more mentoring of youth interested in STEM. In 2016 I was a judge in the STEM category of the New Jersey NAACP ACT-SO competition for young people 14- 17 years old, with statewide winners moving on to the national competition. It was a joy to see their creativity and hard work in action, and I was delighted to participate!



Why should people consider a career in Thales?



Thales is a large company with great people and multiple lines of businesses, job families and locations around the world. With that comes opportunity to learn, contribute and grow. Additionally, Thales values diversity – diversity of thought, diversity of experience, diversity of professional backgrounds. When I come to work every day I’m delighted to see and work with people of all ages and cultural backgrounds! As an African American woman with technical experience in large and small companies, I know it’s uncommon to see this much diversity in practice. It is of unspeakable value, and clearly part of what makes Thales a great place to work and build a career.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.925567090511322}",neutral,0.925567090511322,0
"Meet Dominique Druart, Product Line Manager at Thales Alenia Space Belgium - Thales","Tue, 07 Mar 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi93b3JsZHdpZGUvc3BhY2UvbmV3cy9tZWV0LWRvbWluaXF1ZS1kcnVhcnQtcHJvZHVjdC1saW5lLW1hbmFnZXItdGhhbGVzLWFsZW5pYS1zcGFjZS1iZWxnaXVt0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"D.D: These devices are used to distribute electricity on satellites, supplied by two energy sources (solar panels and batteries, during solar eclipse periods). They are also used to manage the storage of the surplus energy from the solar panels in the satellite’s batteries. This set of equipment is considered the “electrical core” of the satellite. Our equipment is used on a number of major satellite programs, including Iridium NEXT, the constellation of low-orbit telecom satellites.

Space Q&A: What does your job entail on a daily basis?

D.M: I manage current affairs for different programs and also coordinate multi-functional actions concerning these products: drawing up a product reference system with the price quotes unit, managing forecast requirements and investment needs, supplying industrial solutions in coordination with the production team, providing sales scenarios so we can draw up the production plan, etc. I also organize project reporting and oversee the work of project managers and their assistants.

Space Q&A: What are you most proud of in your job?

D.D. Because of the company’s business ramp-up in Belgium, I pay special attention to our new hires, by making sure we transmit our skills and expertise. Helping new employees has always been a major source of satisfaction in my work.

Space Q&A: Do you have any special career highlight that comes to mind?

D.D. One of the highlights of my career was taking over responsibility for SDIU (Satellite Distribution and Interface Unit) projects. These are large, modular units used to manage the avionics on large telecom satellites, including power distribution, control of steering motors for antennas and solar arrays, valve and nozzle control, reheater management, activation of pyrotechnic devices, batter management, telemetry and command management, etc. On a conventional satellite, there are generally two SDIUs, one for the platform, one for the payload. The next-generation SDIU, the SDIU MK2, will feature a new digital and programmable component concept, “Made in Belgium”. It will be used on Thales Alenia Space’s new communications satellites, based on Spacebus NEO platform.

At the time, I had to learn about the history of this product and ensure its continuity. This experience allowed me to hone my skills as project manager, and also to tackle other aspects, such as forecasting, reference systems and industrial solutions, all of which were very helpful once I took charge of the product line.

Space Q&A: What qualities does a product line manager at Thales Alenia Space need for this job?

DM. A team spirit, the ability to listen and share, and a rigorous approach. Personally, my previous experience as a project manager also taught me quite a bit.

"Meet Claire Parfitt, spacecraft systems engineer and project manager at Thales Alenia Space UK - Thales","Tue, 07 Mar 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi93b3JsZHdpZGUvc3BhY2UvbmV3cy9tZWV0LWNsYWlyZS1wYXJmaXR0LXNwYWNlY3JhZnQtc3lzdGVtcy1lbmdpbmVlci1hbmQtcHJvamVjdC1tYW5hZ2VyLXRoYWxlc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Claire Parfitt: My role at Thales Alenia Space UK is as a spacecraft systems engineer and project manager. This means my job is very varied and no day is the same as the last. As a systems engineer it is my job to ensure that all of the subsystems of a satellite work together coherently and in the most optimized way. This means I must know how all of these subsystems function and be able to understand how they interface with each other. Usually this involves working with a large team of specialist engineers and scientists, processing lots of different types of information and solving lots and lots of problems! I have worked on some exciting projects during my time at Thales Alenia Space, including the ExoMars Rover. I’m also the technical lead and project manager for the Thales Alenia Space UK nanosatellite program, where we are developing a highly capable and flexible platform called OmniSat, weighing less than 50 kg, and an instrument called HAPI that monitors pollution in the urban environment.

Space Q&A. What are you most proud of in your day-to-day activity?

C.P: Ever since I was a little girl I have always wanted to work in the space industry and feel like I am contributing to the exploration of our universe, the protection of our planet and the expansion of human knowledge. Belonging to this special group of people is a privilege and a pleasure that makes me proud every day.





Space Q&A. Which event in your career have you enjoyed the most?

C.P: As with many of my colleagues, I enjoy a challenge. Some of the most memorable and enjoyable events in my career have been tied to the huge sense of accomplishment I get at the completion of a long and challenging piece of work. This could be anything from solving a difficult technical problem to completing a major project milestone on schedule and to budget. However, having worked for several years as part of the ExoMars Rover team, I’m sure that seeing the rover driving around on Mars and knowing that I contributed in some small way to making that happen will be a moment to remember.





Space Q&A. In 3 words, what are the qualities required in your profession?

a. Curiosity

b. Determination

c. Integrity
