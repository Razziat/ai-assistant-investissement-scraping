The technology will be used for traceability of all parts and products that go through the complex to comply with NATO requirements and various Ministries of Defense.

The products created at the location include radio communications, aeronautics and naval equipment.

Thales first announced a blockchain solution more than two years ago, when it unveiled a traceability demonstration with Accenture at England’s Farnborough Air Show. The prototype included IoT and cryptoseals from Chronicled to ensure the Near Field Communication (NFC) chip embedded with a unique part identity can’t be tampered with.

The announcement didn’t mention any blockchain technologies. However, Thales documentation for hardware security modules that would be used for key storage supports Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric.

Since Thales’ 2018 prototype, numerous traceability solutions have been unveiled by others in both the defense and aerospace sectors. For example, the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Air Force have worked with SIMBA Chain for aircraft parts traceability.

Nine months ago, SITA, the airline industry-owned technology firm, launched the MRO Blockchain Alliance for maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO). Honeywell Aerospace launched its parts traceability almost two years ago and GE Aviation is also working on an MRO solution."

Damen signs $1.8 billion deal with Thales to power new German warship's weapons - Defense News,"Wed, 18 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZWZlbnNlbmV3cy5jb20vZ2xvYmFsL2V1cm9wZS8yMDIwLzExLzE4L2RhbWVuLXNpZ25zLTE4LWJpbGxpb24tZGVhbC13aXRoLXRoYWxlcy10by1wb3dlci1uZXctZ2VybWFuLXdhcnNoaXBzLXdlYXBvbnMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"COLOGNE, Germany — Dutch shipbuilder Damen has picked Thales to supply the combat management system for the four new German MKS 180 warships, the companies announced Wednesday.

The contract, worth an estimated €1.5 billion (U.S. $1.8 billion), includes Thales' Tacticos system, which connects all of the ship’s communications and radar systems with its guns and missiles. Also included is the Above Water Warfare System, geared at defending against swarm attacks from the sea and the air, such as unmanned systems or weapons of various sizes, according to Thales.

Damen is the main contractor for the high-profile MKS 180 program, beating out bids from ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems and German Naval Yards in early 2020. The losing competitors challenged the contract award, to no avail, as part of a campaign lamenting that a multibillion-dollar German shipbuilding program would be led by a foreign company.

Partnered with Germany’s Lürssen yard, Damen executives have said they want to build the ships in Germany to offer maximum local workshare, a pledge German lawmakers have said they will closely monitor. Following a deal that ended the legal procurement standoff with the German government, German Naval Yards is expected to get some work along with ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems as a subcontractor.

In announcing the contract signing for the MKS 180 program with Damen over the summer, the German Defence Ministry said in June that Thales was understood to be part of the team, with German sensor-maker Hensoldt supplying “the central naval and air surveillance sensor.”

According to Damen, the eventual pick of Thales, which is based in France, has to do with previous work the company did for the Royal Netherlands Navy, or RNLN.

“The RNLN has been a launching customer and innovator for various novel technologies, including the advanced sensor and radar suites developed by Thales Nederland,” the managing director of Damen Schelde Naval Shipbuilding, Hein van Ameijden, was quoted as saying in a statement.

The German Thales subsidiary, with locations in Kiel and Wilhelmshaven, will oversee 70 percent of the overall combat management system work, according to Damen.

The deal is one of the biggest orders in Thales history. “This huge contract anchors our position as global leader in high-end naval systems integration,” CEO Patrice Caine said. “The German Navy will benefit from cutting-edge technological systems thanks to the diversity of talents at Thales.”

Thales to Deliver the World's First Fully Integrated Unmanned Mine Countermeasures System for the Royal Navy and ... - Business Wire,"Thu, 26 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi2wFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc3dpcmUuY29tL25ld3MvaG9tZS8yMDIwMTEyNjAwNTc4My9lbi9UaGFsZXMtdG8tRGVsaXZlci10aGUtV29ybGQlRTIlODAlOTlzLUZpcnN0LUZ1bGx5LUludGVncmF0ZWQtVW5tYW5uZWQtTWluZS1Db3VudGVybWVhc3VyZXMtU3lzdGVtLWZvci10aGUtUm95YWwtTmF2eS1hbmQtRnJlbmNoLSVFMiU4MCU5Q01hcmluZS1OYXRpb25hbGUlRTIlODAlOUTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS LA DÉFENSE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Following the first phase of the program in which two demonstrators have successfully proven their operational performances at sea, France and the United Kingdom marked the tenth anniversary of the Lancaster House treaties by signing a joint contract for Thales to start the production phase of MMCM to deliver eight unmanned mine hunting systems (four for France and four for the United Kingdom).

With the threat of mines and improvised explosive devices present in all conflicts involving naval forces, countries need to strengthen the protection of their maritime domain, to ensure the protection of their assets and to safeguard the freedom of civil navigation. At the same time, it is essential to limit human exposure to mines. With 50 years of expertise serving navies around the world, Thales develops technologies that enable the transition from conventional solutions, such as minehunters, to unmanned solutions. The MMCM program is the first step in the renewal of the operational concept for mine warfare in France and the United Kingdom, based on the use of unmanned systems which could potentially replace traditional minehunters.

This is a step change in capability, improving performances, productivity and removing the need to place members of the armed forces in harm’s way. It strengthens the leadership of the French Navy and Royal Navy as world leaders in both mine hunting and unmanned systems in the maritime domain.

The subsystems developed for the programme by Thales and its partners include Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USV) to transport and connect solutions and a cutting-edge sonar (SAMDIS) offering unique Single Path Multi View capability to identify and classify threats. The SAMDIS sonar can be carried by Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV) or by Towed Synthetic Aperture Multiviews (TSAM) vehicle operated from the USV. The USV can also carry a Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) to neutralize the threats. The entire system is remotely supervised by operators working from a Portable Operational Centre (POC) capable of controlling up to three systems in parallel at sea.

MMCM is the only proven system to offer advanced technologies, including autonomy, to improve performance and productivity thanks to the combination of unrivalled real time user experience using big data exchanges with trusted augmented artificial intelligence (A2I) to provide huge improvement of customer trust in operation clearance and increase the security of national interests. As a result of Thales’s open-architecture approach to MMCM, these new technologies can be easily integrated into the overall system, providing the navies with the opportunity to introduce new operational capabilities, in a planned way, throughout the life of the system.

After the success of the first configuration conducted under real operational conditions with the complete system, Thales is now fully committed to deliver the first operational systems to French and British navies by 2022. This program testifies of the exemplary cooperation between the two states and industrial teams and anchors Thales’s unique expertise and World leading position in conventional MCM, supporting over half the world’s anti-mine vessels with over 300 systems in service.

“ Thales is grateful to France and the United Kingdom for trusting such an important technology transition with the Thales teams in France and the UK. To date during trials, the MMCM systems and its assets have covered the equivalent of 30.000 soccer fields at sea, sometimes with very rough sea conditions. This is indeed a step change in how Navies will be able to respond in the future to vicious threats such as mines and improvised explosive devices at sea.” Alexis Morel, VP Underwater Systems, Thales.

The FZ606 is a six-tube rocket launcher for FZ275 laser-guided rockets and the first product of its kind to offer a Lock On Before Launch capability.

The FZ606 modular launcher can deliver six type FZ275 guided rockets or a combination of guided and unguided rockets. It is the first rocket launcher with a Lock On Before Launch function, usually only available in missile systems, to offer significantly higher reliability and safety than conventional 70 mm rocket systems and deliver weapons even within the most restrictive rules of engagement. With the Lock On Before Launch function, helicopter crews can be sure that the weapon is successfully locked on to its target before it leaves the platform, reducing risks to military personnel and to the surrounding area.

Design, development and production of the new NATO-calibre system are part of a European collaborative project conducted by Thales and Rheinmetall under a partnership agreement signed by the two companies at the end of 2019.

The new rocket launcher is designed to equip latest-generation attack and fire support helicopters on new or retrofit programmes such as the German Tiger UHT upgraded to the Airbus Helicopters Tiger Mk III standard.

Thales’ 70 mm rocket systems are already in service in more than 30 countries on 25 different platform types.

Thales to Supply Key Systems for German Frigate: November 2020 - Second Line of Defense - Second Line of Defense,"Fri, 20 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vc2xkaW5mby5jb20vMjAyMC8xMS90aGFsZXMtdG8tc3VwcGx5LWtleS1zeXN0ZW1zLWZvci1nZXJtYW4tZnJpZ2F0ZS1ub3ZlbWJlci0yMDIwL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Pierre Tran

Paris. Thales signed Nov. 17 a contract worth €1.5 billion ($1.8 billion) to supply Dutch shipbuilder Damen with a radar, combat management and fire control systems for the German MKS-180 frigate, Philippe Duhamel, vice president for defense mission systems, said.

The deal with Damen was the third largest for Thales, following the sale five years ago of the Rafale fighter jet to India, and a contract 10 years ago for the FREMM multimission frigate for the French navy, he said Nov. 18 in a telephone press conference.

The budget for four MKS 180 multipurpose frigates is worth some €4.6 billion over 10 years.

Thales will supply its Tacticos combat management system, a fire control system dubbed Above Water Warfare System, and Active Phased Array Radar block 2 under the 10-year contract, the company said in a statement. There will also be service support, and test and training facilities on land.

The APAR block 2 will be a development of the block 1 version, which has been fitted on Danish, Dutch and German vessels, Duhamel said. That sensor is a naval variant of the active electronically scanned array, an airborne radar.

Development work will take some five years, followed by integration, allowing the first frigate to be operational in 2028, he said. There are options for two more units.

﻿

Some 70 percent of the work will take place in Germany, with 30 percent in the Netherlands, drawing on local subcontractors.

The German frigate deal followed Thales and Babcock winning a tender for the Royal Navy Type 31 frigate, and Thales supplying kit on the French navy FDI frigate for defense and intervention, he said.

The APAR radar differs from the Sea Fire on the French frigate, as the Dutch and German navies’ concept of operations differed from the French, he said.

“The radar reflects the concept of operations,” he said.

The AWWS fire control system seeks to handle a simultaneous and saturation attack from a broad range of new threats, such as surface drones and slow moving targets, as well as fighter jets and missiles, he said. Asked whether the system could handle hypersonic missiles, he said the first rank German navy seeks capabilities to manage future threats.

In other deals, Thales expects a Dutch competition in 2022 as Belgium and the Netherlands seek a replacement for their M frigate, he said. The Thales unit in the Netherlands developed the new fire control system.

Thales signed September 2019 a development contract for AWWS for the Belgian and Dutch navies, the company said.

Thales beat German companies for the integrated systems, said Sash Tusa, analyst with equity research firm Agency Partners.

Hensoldt will supply its TRS-4D air defense radar in a deal worth €200 million. That contract could be seen as a goodwill gesture to a national champion which essentially lost to an outsider, he said.

“The stand-out factor is the German contract shows the big orders are now in mature markets in Europe, which is rearming, whereas previous big Thales arms contracts were in Saudi Arabia, with the Crotale short-range, surface-to-air missile, and the Sawari 1 and 2 frigate deals,” he said.

The drone attacks on Saudi oil refineries in 2019 highlighted the poor performance of such short-range air defense missiles, intended to protect the installations.

Damen has partnered with Blohm+Voss to meet a requirement for a local shipbuilder to be in the MKS 180 program.

The pick by the German authorities of a Dutch company has led to a German industrial consolidation, with family-owned

Lürssen and German Naval Yards forming a joint venture, leaving ThyssenKrupp Marine System out in the cold.

Thales to Deliver SAMDIS Sonar for JMSDF's OZZ-5 UUV - Naval News,"Tue, 24 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdmFsbmV3cy5jb20vbmF2YWwtbmV3cy8yMDIwLzExL3RoYWxlcy10by1kZWxpdmVyLXNhbWRpcy1zb25hci1mb3Itam1zZGZzLW96ei01LXV1di_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales to Deliver SAMDIS Sonar for JMSDF’s OZZ-5 UUV Thales and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) signed a contract for the delivery of High Frequency Synthetic Aperture Sonar (HFSAS) SAMDIS to equip MHI’s OZZ-5 Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (UUV). Through this contract, Thales contributes to Japan’s national security by introducing combat proven technology to domestic manufacturer.

Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force relies on Thales and MHI to equip itself with the latest generation of high-resolution synthetic aperture sonar that provides a high level of classification. The choice of Thales technologies, which have been extensively proven in service with navies around the world, provides the highest levels of protection available today.

Thales press release

In a changing international context, countries are strengthening the protection of their maritime approaches. At the same time, it is essential to limit human exposure to mines. With 50 years of expertise serving navies around the world, Thales develops technologies that enable the transition from conventional solutions, such as minehunters, to UAV-based solutions (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle).

Through this agreement, HFSAS will be deployed in MHI’s OZZ-5 UUV. With the combination of the Thales HFSAS with Japanese LFSAS (Low Frequency Synthetic Aperture Sonar) technology, the sonars will allow operators to detect suspected mines regardless of the varied or unvaried condition, accommodating today’s increasing demand for MMCM (Maritime Mine Counter Measures). Thales HFSAS provides AuDC (Automatic Detection and Classification) function, which relieves operators’ load to process the collected data.

This contract agreement is the starting point of a long-term program with Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force as end-user and potentially opens the door to export markets. The continuous and successful collaboration between Thales and MHI in Japan has been, once again, strengthened by the order of SAMDIS HFSAS to equip MHI’s OZZ-5 UUV. Working together with Thales, MHI is aiming to enter new markets in Japan’s allies by offering high-end technology to the most powerful navies. Thales’ anti-submarine warfare and maritime safety & security systems are currently in service with more than 50 navies.

“Equipping the OZZ-5 underwater vehicle with our high frequency sonar evidences our strong relationship with MHI which started years ago with the development of the OZZ-X prototype. It materializes the continuation of the ongoing Japan/ France bilateral long-term cooperation. Thales is really enthusiastic to bring its field proven expertise for the benefit of national and foreign defense forces through this successful alliance with MHI.”



Cyrille Dupont, President and CEO of Thales Japan

“We are very proud to be onboard the OZZ-5 mine warfare UUV with Thales SAMDIS HFSAS and to contribute to the OZZ-5 outstanding operational performances and unique positioning on this highly competitive market segment. This contract demonstrates Thales’ capability to tailor its offerings to any type of vehicle and navy requirement and will pave the way for future achievements with our MHI partner.”

Its X-rudders placed both forward and aft provides the OZZ-5 with very good maneuverability, even at low speed. OZZ-5 will be deployed from the new 30FFM frigate acting as a mothership for the UUV.

We covered the OZZ-5 during the MAST Asia 2019 in Tokyo, with a representative of ATLA:

About SAMDIS:

SAMDIS is a multi-aspect sonar allowing to detect targets from three different angles in a single pass

SAMDIS, is Thales’ latest-generation high-resolution synthetic aperture sonar. With its multi-aspect functionality, the SAMDIS sonar views targets from three different angles. According to the French defense company, only Thales’s multi-aspect technology is capable of delivering high detection and classification performance against modern mines. The technology was successfully evaluated by the French defense procurement agency (DGA) in 2016. Thales is already using multi-aspect technology on the French-UK maritime mine countermeasures program (MMCM). This contract was awarded in 2015 to meet specific requirements set out by France and the United Kingdom. SAMDIS technology has also been selected for two export program in Asia.

We also covered the SAMDIS at Mast Asia 2019 with François Merlo and Lionel Collot from Thales:"

The French Armament General Directorate (DGA) on behalf of the three nations, has signed the contract with Indra as leader of the industrial consortium in order to incorporate the Sensors as part of the Phase 1 contractual framework. The Phase 1 A Concept Study for Sensors will last for one year, a period which may be extended by another six months.

The consortium will work on the design of the concepts required to meet the stakes of 2040 and beyond for the next generation combat system, involving a connected and distributed architecture of sensors, the design of future sensors architectures and the maturation of the associated sensors technologies.

This distributed sensor architecture will leverage the capabilities provided by the NGWS/FCAS combat cloud, with improved system situational awareness and increased platforms survivability. The sensors pillar consortium looks forward to working together with the other NGWS/FCAS pillars (Combat Cloud, Next Generation Fighter, Remote Carriers) in order to optimize the design and integration of the Sensors within the System and platforms.

The signing of this initial contract provides evidence of the excellent harmony and spirit of collaboration among FCMS, Indra and Thales. According to Manuel Rodríguez Cerezo, the Director of the NGWS/FCAS program at Indra, “the industrial cooperation and the proactivity demonstrated by the three companies have facilitated the taking of this first step to move ahead with the program”.

The development of the sensor pillar is essential to ensure consistent architectures that are perfectly integrated into the new generation fighters (NGF), unmanned systems and remote operators (RCs) and the combat cloud. The superiority of the NGWS/FCAS will largely depend on the capacity of its network of sensors to compile more and better information than the adversary.

LinkedIn

It is with a sense of emotion and great pride that Thales Alenia Space’s Belgian teams have delivered the last pieces of equipment to ArianeGroup for the Ariane 5 launch vehicle.

As one textbook launch followed another, Ariane 5 quickly became the benchmark in the commercial geostationary satellite market. We take a moment to reflect on this fantastic adventure, which we’ve been involved in for over 20 years.

In 1987, ESA’s member states agreed to develop Ariane 5 as the replacement for Ariane 4. Europe’s new heavy-lift launcher would serve two objectives. First, orbit the Hermes spaceplane with astronauts aboard; and second, offer a dual payload capability, making it more competitive on the commercial launch services market. Ariane 5 can deliver two satellites to orbit, each weighing up to 5 metric tons. Another version, dubbed ES, launched the ATV (Automated Transfer Vehicle) to deliver supplies to the International Space Station, and can orbit four Galileo navigation satellites at a time.

Recognized Belgian expertise

Drawing on its recognized expertise in launchers, built up since the early 1970s, Thales Alenia Space in Belgium once again supported the European space industry by developing and manufacturing half of the electronics for Ariane 5 at Charleroi — that’s 21 complete subassemblies and four printed circuit boards. These devices perform a variety of functions, including electrical distribution, management of the thrust vectoring nozzles that keep the launcher on course, self-destruction if it veers from its trajectory, calculating its position in space and handling separation of the launcher stages and the fairing that protects the satellites during its flight through the atmosphere.

From 1993 to 2014, about 20 of our staff were permanently based at the European Spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana, to support Ariane 5 launch operations, especially maintaining and testing command, control and IT systems. We also delivered most of the checkout systems for the Ariane family of launchers, from Ariane 1 to 5, including the crucial system that’s used for final checks and liftoff.

An upgradeable launcher

Ariane 5 was designed for upgradeability. In two decades, it has been built in five different versions to keep pace with growing satellites and evolving customer needs. The current model is the Ariane 5 ECA.

Thales Alenia Space has delivered a total of 2,436 components and subassemblies for 116 Ariane 5 launchers, not including modules for the inertial unit.

A human adventure

“Thales Alenia Space in Belgium is a major and long-standing partner of the Ariane 5 program, supplying half of the onboard electronics,” says Christian Deprez, in charge of launchers at Thales Alenia Space in Belgium’s sales department. “The Belgium Federal Science Policy Office (BELSPO) really supported us in our work. I think everyone who worked on Ariane 5 has a feeling of pride… and very poignant memories.”

The last launch is slated for 2023. By then, Ariane 6 will be fully operational and will also take over from Soyuz at Europe’s Spaceport in French Guiana.

With Ariane 6, a new chapter opens — and the Thales Alenia Space teams in Belgium and Spain are proud to be part of it!

The International Space Station, the most extensive scientific collaboration in history for peaceful purposes, is celebrating its milestone 20th anniversary. Since the launch of the first module on November 20, 1998, it has taught us that when countries work together and combine their technological excellence, they can achieve a sustained human presence in space. The first International Space Station crew took up their posts on November 2, 2000, two years after the start of construction.

© @Nasa

The three astronauts/cosmonauts, William (Bill) Sheperd (expedition commander) from the USA, Russian cosmonauts Sergei Krikalev (flight engineer) and Yuri Gidzenko (Soyuz commander), docked at 10 a.m. in the morning and began to build what would become home to an ever-changing international crew of spacefarers.

The ISS at a glance

Since November 2000, 241 individuals from 19 countries have visited the International Space Station, conducting over 2,500 medical, chemical, physical and biological experiments in microgravity. It took more than 50 missions by all kinds of launch vehicles to assemble the 100 major parts of this technological tour de force – one of the most complex and impressive structures ever built. Above all, it meant putting aside the lingering tensions of the Cold War and the space race to deliver the best technologies from across the globe into orbit. From December 1998 to March 2019, for instance, some 78,514 kilos of research equipment was lofted to the station and 23,559 kilos were sent back to Earth.

Why conduct science in space? The space station offers a great vantage point from which we can study the Earth, allows scientists to expose materials to the harsh environment of space – and especially microgravity – and lets us test technologies that could help take us further into space, including the Moon and Mars.

An astronaut’s life

When an astronaut joins the space station, it takes a few hours to get used to the “zero-g”, or weightless environment. They will have undergone countless simulations on the ground, but nothing really compares to the sensations when you reach the ISS and begin floating around. You have to move very carefully, think ahead and decide which of the many handles along the walls you want to grab. A reckless movement can become dangerous for yourself, other astronauts and the delicate instruments aboard.

Our bodies were of course designed to live in a gravity environment – back pain aside! In the almost total absence of gravity, our bodies struggle: during the first few days, the body fluids tend to rise towards the head and upper limbs, which explains why recent arrivals on the ISS often have visibly swollen faces.

Long stays in this type of environment are also detrimental to the musculoskeletal system. For every month on the ISS, an astronaut loses an estimated 2% of their bone mass. What happens is that bones become less dense because they have to support less weight, and consequently the body directs its resources and energy to other areas. This is why astronauts have to exercise for several hours a day to maintain muscle tone and strengthen their bones.

Beyond low Earth orbit, space radiation may place astronauts at significant risk for radiation sickness, and increased lifetime risk for cancer, central nervous system disorders and degenerative diseases. Thales Alenia Space has designed a simple radiation protection vest, which places radiation shielding material over sensitive body parts (e.g., bone marrow) to protect an astronaut in case of a solar particle event.

A window on the Earth

From the Cupola on the International Space Station, astronauts have taken millions of photos of the Earth. The Cupola, as its name suggests, is fully outfitted for astronauts to observe the Earth, including a variety of cameras. By design, this module always faces the Earth, allowing astronauts to observe day or night. They can also set up cameras to automatically shoot photos while they perform other tasks. Once published, these exceptional shots have burnished the Space Station's reputation as an ideal spaceborne observatory.

A dream becomes reality

Today, as we celebrate this milestone anniversary and also plan expeditions to Mars and a return to the Moon, it’s worth remembering the highly ambitious goals of this vast international undertaking. Bringing together the United States, Russia, Canada, Japan and European Space Agency countries, this program has led to the construction of the largest spacecraft ever, a permanent human outpost that occupies an area as large as a football field, with a habitable volume of more than 1,200 cubic meters, more than 40% of which is supplied by Thales Alenia Space.

Our company has provided fully half of the pressurized volume on the International Space Station, including Nodes 2 and 3, the Permanent Multipurpose Module, the Multipurpose Logistics Modules, the Cupola and the Columbus lab structure, along with cargo modules for the ATV resupply vessels and the structure for the Bishop commercial airlock from NanoRacks. We also build all pressurized cargo modules for Cygnus resupply vessels on behalf of Northrop Grumman. Twice yearly, they deliver food, water, parts, fuel and science experiments for astronauts on the ISS. Our teams are now capitalizing on their long experience with globally acclaimed exploration programs to address new Moon-related markets.

To the Moon and Beyond

We continue to push back the frontiers of space exploration. Our company was chosen by ESA to develop two key modules for the upcoming Lunar Gateway: I-HAB and the ESPRIT communications and refueling module. In addition, Northrop Grumman recently selected us to develop the pressurized module for HALO (Habitation And Logistic Outpost), one of the first sections of the lunar space station, Gateway, to be launched in 2023.

Thales Alenia Space is part of the consortium led by American company Dynetics, selected by NASA to conduct the initial design and development phase of the pressurized cabin of the Human Landing System (HLS). As the only European partner in the Dynetics consortium, we’re in charge of designing the crew module, drawing on our extensive experience with the International Space Station. The crew module will play a decisive role, since it will house the astronauts and protect them from radiation, micrometeorites and the other hazards of spaceflight. American company CommStar Space Communications is counting on us to deploy a hybrid Earth-Moon communications relay satellite by 2023, and we’ll also be supplying Earth-Moon telecom technologies for NASA’s VIPER rover, which will search for water on the surface. In addition, we’ve been chosen by Axiom Space to provide two key pressurized elements, Node1 and Habitat, which will be the first components in a future commercial space station. Axiom Space has asked French designer Philippe Starck to create interiors for the habitation module on the Axiom Space Station.

Leveraging Thales Alenia Space’s long-standing expertise in space exploration, orbital infrastructures, robotics and space transportation systems, we have become the world leader in the orbital infrastructures market. More than ever, the Moon is at our fingertips!

The next chapter in the Moon chronicles has just begun. Stay tuned for the latest news!"
Cutting-edge technology for the German Navy - Thales,"Fri, 20 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi9ncm91cC9qb3VybmFsaXN0L21hZ2F6aW5lL2N1dHRpbmctZWRnZS10ZWNobm9sb2d5LWdlcm1hbi1uYXZ50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Navies across the world are having to adapt to an ever-changing maritime environment, and to face up to threats that are constantly evolving. Within these new operational scenarios, vessels need to be able to defend both themselves and other platforms within a naval task group.

Navy ships, today, are far more than simple sea-going craft – they are veritable communication hubs, connected to multiple sources: headquarters, coalition partners, other armed forces and civil authorities, as well as to other traffic at sea, on land, in the air and in space. These connections compel navies to rely heavily on the availability and reliability of data, meaning that robust cybersecurity had now become just as important as the weapons on the foredeck.

Meeting these needs requires a trusted partner with a proven track record, and that is what the German Navy’s MKS 180 programme found in Thales.

The MKS 180 is a resilient, multi-purpose ship designed for long periods at sea, fulfilling a broad range of low-, medium- and high-intensity missions: monitoring maritime areas, reinforcing sea rescue teams and humanitarian aid efforts or supporting special forces in crisis zones. This adaptability places high demands on the ship’s mission systems in terms of performance, availability, maintainability and ease of use."

The Damen Schelde Naval Shipbuilding, as prime contractor for the German MoD’s Mehrzweckkampfschiff 180 (MKS 180) multi-purpose frigates programme, has signed with Thales a € 1.5 billion contract on 17 November in Vlissingen’s Damen site (the Netherlands), for the full integration and delivery of the ‘Mission & Combat System’ on board the new ships for the German Navy.

“The third largest contract ever awarded to Thales”, said Philippe Duhamel, executive vice-president Defence Mission Systems for Thales in a press conference call, it will see Thales taking the responsibility for combat system integration and the supply of its main elements on all four MKS 180 ships, including the various third party systems and subsystems procurement, in addition to logistics and training services, and two land-based test and training sites in Germany. The contract also includes the option for one or two additional ships.

Damen was awarded the MKS 180 multi-purpose frigates design and construction contract valued € 4.6 billion by the German’s Bundesamt fur Ausrüstung, Informationstechnik und Nutzung der Bundeswehr (BAAINBw) in June 2020. Alongside Thales, Dutch-owned Damen will deliver the MKS 180 programme in co-operation with Lürssen (the latter working in co-operation with Kiel-based German Naval Yards) and Blohm + Voss. Damen will be responsible for the MKS 180 design, but the vessels will all be built in Germany under Damen’s project management. With a displacement of around 9,000 tonnes and a length at waterline of around 155 meters , the MKS 180 platforms have been conceived as large, multi-purpose surface combatant ships able to reconfigure thanks to modular bays capable to accommodate different modules according to the missions to be accomplished.

“Thales is the combat system integrator, having the responsibility for the integration of all combat system that will equip the ships”, Duhamel said. “That will include the TACTICOS combat management system (CMS) and the AWWS (Above Water Warfare System) fire control cluster incorporating the APAR Block 2 multifunction radar, in addition to other sensors and the integrated communications – part of which we will supply – and the cyber security solution. Thales will also be responsible for the procurement of other combat system elements from various suppliers, except for the government-furnished equipment involved. Activities on the package have already started by Thales”, the group representative said.

The contract will be executed by Thales’ Naval Centre of Excellence in Hengelo (the Netherlands), Kiel and Wilhelmshaven (Germany), in cooperation with a substantial number of German subcontractors, with approximately 70% of the work to be performed in Germany.

Thales will supply the latest version of the TACTICOS CMS, which is already in service in previous iterations with the German Navy, managing all the sensors and systems provided by both Thales and third parties. The MKS 180 contract marks the first production contract for the Thales AWWS and the latest generation APAR Block 2 X-band multifunction radar. Already under development by Thales Nederland for the Netherlands/Belgium Vervanging M-fregatten (M-frigate replacement) programme, the AWWS will combine an advanced fire-control suite with the APAR Block 2 radar, which four face antennas will be distributed between the two main mast superstructures. According to Thales, the TACTICOS CMS with the full integration of the AWWS will provide the capability to defeat current and future stressing multiple simultaneous threats in complex scenarios. On board the MKS 180, the latter will provide guidance support for the Raytheon Evolved SeaSparrow Missile (ESSM) Block 2 local area anti-air missile, the prime air defence system equipping the new ships. The APAR Block 2 also supports the future Standard Missile family. Thales will also provide the Gatekeeper 360° non-rotating surveillance IR/TV suite with systems distributed between the two main mast superstructures as well as the Mirador Mk2 EO fire control system for observation and tracking in addition to components of the integrated communications suite, of which SATCOM multiple dishes satellite comms have been identified so far. Thales will also be responsible and provide the cyber security integrated into the combat system solution, complying with strict security standards and German national regulations.

The TACTICOS CMS will also manage the remaining sensors, systems and weapon package, which according to information provided by the German MoD and the video released by Thales, include the Hensoldt four fixed faces variant of the TRS-4D C-band volume and surveillance radar and the Rohde & Schwarz GEDIS Kora RESM/CESM suite, in addition to Lockheed Martin two 8-cell Mk 41 VLS launchers for ESSM Block 2 missiles, two RAM (Rolling Airframe Missile, Raytheon/RAM-System) guided missile inner-layer defence systems, Kongsberg NSM (Naval Strike Missile) anti-ship missiles (according to images a total of eight munitions) and the Leonardo 127/64 mm LightWeight (LW) Vulcano main gun, the latter capable to fire Vulcano long-range guided ammunitions. The ships will also be equipped with smaller caliber remote controlled guns as indicated by the German MoD. Images provided by Damen also feature Rheinmetall Defence MASS (Multi Ammunition Softkill System) family decoy launching systems. The new multi-purpose frigates will also be equipped an underwater warfare suite, which selection remains to be finalized.

According to German Government documentation, a total of around € 5.7 billion have been put aside in the national defence budget for the MKS 180 programme. The delivery of the four multi-purpose frigates for the German Navy will start in mid-2028 to be completed in mid-2032.

Fivecast’s customers in national security, defence and law enforcement utilise their solutions to explore masses of digital data; gaining insights into threats which are critical in protecting global communities.

Fivecast Founders

Founded by Dr. Brenton Cooper, Ross Buglak, Duane Rivett and Dave Blockow in 2017, the idea for Fivecast was spun out of the Data to Decisions Cooperative Research Centre (D2D CRC) which brought together some of the best and brightest research minds in AI and machine learning across industry, Government and Universities to tackle the big data challenges that faced Australian and global national security agencies.

“Fivecast was built from the ground up to specifically address big data challenges faced by the world’s most important organizations. We’re proud that the work initiated by the D2D CRC has been further developed by Fivecast and is now helping organizations both in Australia and the US uncover actionable insights to solve complex intelligence challenges of the utmost significance,” said Dr. Brenton Cooper, CEO of Fivecast.

Although only established formally for less than three years, in that time, Fivecast have enjoyed significant success including securing funding from the Commonwealth’s Accelerating Commercialisation grants in 2017 and in exporting their market-leading OSINT solution, Fivecast ONYX, into the international market.

“In a relatively short space of time, Fivecast has successfully established itself as a market leader in open-source intelligence in Australia and has established a presence in the US, already working with key customers in law enforcement and intelligence in that market. Our product roadmap includes new OSINT capabilities and use cases that will enable us to serve new markets and support continued growth,” mentioned Dr. Brenton Cooper.

There are two major elements of Fivecast’s key solution, Fivecast ONYX. Firstly, targeted data collection enables masses of structured and unstructured data to be gathered across open source platforms, including text, images and video. Secondly, AI-enabled analytics is applied to this data to quickly filter through the noise, identify the most risky data, uncover networks and analyse trends and changes across different risk elements.

“If a human was to analyse the data that’s collected, it would take weeks, at a minimum, to uncover the critical information. By automating the data collection process and applying AI and machine learning to risk analysis, we’re reducing the time constraints of manual data analysis, removing the potential for human error and acting as a force multiplier for analyst teams that are often under-resourced,” explained Dr. Brenton Cooper

In addition to helping overcome big data challenges, Fivecast’s AI enabled risk analytics are able to detect changes in behaviour, sentiment and emotion. This capability is of particular importance when their customers require a solution that identifies red flags in behaviours and changes in a person’s online activity.

Thales and Fivecast’s relationship started around 18 months ago with Thales Australia’s Industry Engagement Unit (IEU) actively looking for innovative SMEs that fit well with Thales’ Group product portfolio, as part of the Australian Governments Global Supply Chain (GSC) Program.

Fivecast are now embedded in Thales Australia’s own suite of digital intelligence tools which are in use by customers in Australia and overseas. “We have found that the synergy of operational activity between the Thales intelligence Analysts’ capabilities combined with the use of Fivecast platforms, provides a unique curated capability for the Defence, National Security, Critical Infrastructure and law enforcement customers both locally in Australia and globally,” said Jason Legge, Thales Australia’s Director of Digital Innovation.

MMCM Program Enters Manufacture Stage with Initial Production Contract Award - Naval News,"Thu, 26 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdmFsbmV3cy5jb20vbmF2YWwtbmV3cy8yMDIwLzExL3Vrcy1tbWNtLXByb2dyYW0tZW50ZXJzLW1hbnVmYWN0dXJlLXN0YWdlLXdpdGgtaW5pdGlhbC1wcm9kdWN0aW9uLWNvbnRyYWN0LWF3YXJkL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"MMCM Program Enters Manufacture Stage with Initial Production Contract Award The Franco-British Maritime Mine Counter Measures (MMCM) project today reached the manufacture stage, with a £184M contract awarded to Thales UK. The contract is for three sets comprising portable operation center, UUV, towed sonar & mine neutralization system.

A £184 million contract will support more than 200 jobs and give the Royal Navy increased capability to remotely detect and neutralise sea mines, the UK MoD Defence Equipment & Support agency announced on Nov. 26.

More than 200 UK jobs will be supported by a newly-signed contract to build technologically advanced autonomous systems able to defeat modern sea mine threats while reducing risks to life during Royal Navy mine hunting operations.

Following a successful demonstration phase and trials, the UK has invested £184 million in the Maritime Mine Counter Measures (MMCM) programme through a joint production contract with France.

The investment will see around 215 jobs supported in the UK at Thales sites in Templecombe (Somerset) and Plymouth as well as in the wider supply chain including L3 Harris in Portsmouth, Stonehaven in Aberdeen and Alba Ultrasound in Glasgow.

When operational, the new system will give the Royal Navy increased capability to remotely detect and neutralise sea mines. It is designed to potentially replace conventional crewed minehunting vessels, such as the Royal Navy’s Hunt and Sandown-class ships, with autonomous systems.

The UK element of the production contract was negotiated by the Mine Hunting Capability (MHC) team at DE&S.

“We are constantly working with industry to identify innovative equipment that will provide the Royal Navy with cutting-edge capability. This system is an exciting development and the collaborative working between DE&S, industry, the Royal Navy and our French colleagues is helping make it a reality”



Barry Miller, MHC team leader

The contract sees the purchase of three sets of equipment. Each set comprises a portable operation centre, an autonomous surface vessel, towed sonar and a mine neutralisation system.

Sea mines constitute a growing threat and users of this system will be able to detect and neutralise mines from miles away ensuring they can keep vital sea lanes open with much-reduced risk to ships and the lives of sailors.

DE&S CEO Sir Simon Bollom said: “This ground-breaking technology brings with it a step-change in capability for the Royal Navy which is a bold step into the digital and autonomous world. I’m incredibly proud of DE&S and the Royal Navy team who have worked tirelessly with our French colleagues to deliver on this contract.”

DE&S picture

The MMCM programme was set up to deliver cutting-edge minehunting equipment to the navies in the UK and France. The programme contract will be placed by the Organisation for Joint Armament Co-operation (OCCAR) acting as the Contracting Management Authority on behalf of both nations.

First Sea Lord Admiral Tony Radakin said: “I am enormously excited by the potential of the future mine hunting capability. This will allow us to deliver mine hunting more effectively, more efficiently and more safely, and to integrate even more closely with our French counterparts in this important area.”

The first equipment is due to be delivered in late 2022. It will commence operational evaluation prior to entering service with the Royal Navy.

Naval News comments:

The French Minister of the Armed Forces, approved last month the launch of the SLAMF (Système de lutte anti-mines futur) Future Mine Warfare System Program. The SLAM-F / MMCM mine warfare system will allow French and British sailors to operate remotely and stay out of the mine field through the use of unmanned systems. However, many questions remain regarding the exact type of UUVs and USVs France and the Royal Navy plan to procure."

A consortium formed by Thales and Nexter has been selected by the French defense procurement agency to supply their RAPIDFire CT40 gun system to equip future French Navy vessels, providing close-in defense capability against air and surface threats.

RAPIDFire offers high precision thanks to its optronic fire control system integrated onto the turret and uses the new 40 mm gun developed by CTAI, the international subsidiary of Nexter Systems and BAE Systems. This has a firing rate of up to 200 rounds per minute using airburst ammunition and an effective firing range of 4,000 meters against air targets and up to 2,500 meters against surface threats. It can fire in a fully autonomous mode and is equipped with infrared and daylight TV channels, as well as a laser range finder.

Thomas Got, Vice-President Integrated Airspace-protection Systems at Thales, said that:

“We’re delighted to be supporting the French Navy as it enhances the self-defence capabilities of its warships. With its combination of fast-into-action time and firing accuracy, RAPIDFire, developed in cooperation with Nexter, provides the best response for protecting Navy vessels against modern threats. It has the potential to become a key component of our offering of advanced force protection solutions.”.

First delivery of RAPIDFire is scheduled for 2022. Once in production Thales and Nexter expect to offer land-based version of the system, allowing joint-service use of components and ammunition.

With the efficiency of loitering munitions and drones being all too clearly demonstrated in current conflicts, it may be that the consortium find that demands for an ”off-the-shelf” solution to close range, rapid-response precision air defence issues may be quite popular."

On 13 November 2020, the French Delegation for Armaments (DGA) qualified the command post vehicle (EPC) variant of the GRIFFON vehicle. At the same time, the first examples are being submitted for acceptance by the DGA's quality department at the Roanne site. Therefore, the three first GRIFFON EPC have been delivered to the Army technical section (STAT) which will continue the operational evaluation of this equipment with its rapid deployment within the regiments in sight. The GME (temporary grouping of companies) EBMR (Engins Blindés Multi-Rôles) comprised of Nexter, Arquus and Thales is fully mobilized on the production of the first 20 series GRIFFON EPCs to be presented to verification operations by the end of 2020. Ultimately, the SCORPION program calls for the acquisition of 333 units of this variant, half of which will be delivered by 2025. As a reminder, the SCORPION program aims to modernize the Army's combat capabilities and in particular to improve command through new information resources.

The GRIFFON EPC can accommodate a pilot and a gunner in the front, and five soldiers in the rear of the vehicle. From an external point of view, the silhouette of the EPC does not differ from the VTT Félin variant (troop transport vehicle). Only the armament changes, with the integration on the roof of a new-generation T2 remotely operated turret armed with a 7.62mm caliber. Inside, on the other hand, the GRIFFON EPC is fully equipped to accommodate a command post: communication means, large screens, a board and a printer. This variant is designed to accommodate latest-generation electronic equipment for collaborative combat: the vetronics common to the SCORPION platforms, the CONTACT joint radio, the SCORPION Combat Information System (SICS), the ANTARES optronic system offering the crew a 360° vision of the environment, as well as a gunfire location detector (or SLA, for Acoustic Localization System). In addition, the air-conditioning system adapts to all environments to guarantee crew’s comfort and the proper functioning of onboard electronics.

Thanks to its level of protection and mobility, the EPC variant of the GRIFFON enables a command post to be deployed quickly at the heart of operations. The force commander can thus conduct an engagement or monitor the progress of a regimental or brigade-level action. The arrival of the GRIFFON EPC is complementary to the GRIFFON VTT Félin, with the goal of projecting a joint battle group (GTIA) into a foreign theatre of operations by 2021.

Stéphane Mayer is delighted, on behalf of the GME formed by the three companies Arquus, Thales and Nexter (of which he is Chairman and CEO), that this new milestone has been reached on time: ""this qualification marks a new stage in the modernization of the French Army's equipment"".

Brilinta Wins Indication in Recurrent Stroke Prevention - Medpage Today,"Sat, 07 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1lZHBhZ2V0b2RheS5jb20vbmV1cm9sb2d5L3N0cm9rZXMvODk1MzPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"FDA granted ticagrelor (Brilinta) an indication for secondary prevention in stroke and high-risk transient ischemic attack (TIA), AstraZeneca announced.

The P2Y12 inhibitor is to be used as part of a dual antiplatelet regimen along with a daily maintenance dose of 75-100 mg aspirin for the reduction of recurrent stroke risk.

The expanded indication was based on the THALES trial, which was published in July in the New England Journal of Medicine.

In the trial with more than 11,000 participants, minor stroke and TIA patients randomized to ticagrelor plus aspirin had lower 30-day composite stroke and death rates than those randomized to aspirin alone (5.5% vs 6.6%, HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.71-0.96).

The benefit had been driven by fewer ischemic strokes (5.0% vs 6.3%, HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.68-0.93), with no significant difference in mortality rates between groups (0.7% vs 0.5%, HR 1.33, 95% CI 0.81-2.19).

Ticagrelor did, however, lead to more severe bleeding (0.5% vs 0.1%, HR 3.99, 95% CI 1.74-9.14) and more intracranial hemorrhage (0.4% vs 0.1%, HR 3.33, 95% CI 1.34-8.28).

THALES investigators estimated a number needed to treat (NNT) of 92 to prevent one stroke or death and a number needed to harm of 263 for severe bleeding.

""One in four patients who have had a stroke will experience a second one, with the risk particularly high within the first 30 days. The approval of Brilinta in combination with aspirin is an important advancement to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke and much-awaited good news for physicians and patients,"" said THALES lead investigator S. Claiborne Johnston, MD, PhD, of the University of Texas at Austin, in a press release.

Following FDA approval of the new indication, Johnston's group released a secondary analysis of THALES, which showed ticagrelor associated with fewer disabling strokes, from either the progression of the index event or a new stroke.

Incidence of recurrent disabling stroke (with modified Rankin Scale [mRS] scores 2+) or death at 30 days reached 4.0% in the ticagrelor plus aspirin group and 4.7% of those taking aspirin alone (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.69-0.99).

The NNT was 133 to prevent one disabling stroke or death and 112 to prevent one disabling or fatal ischemic stroke, the investigators reported in JAMA Neurology in conjunction with presentation at the European Stroke Organization/World Stroke Organization virtual conference.

The reduction of disabling stroke was consistent across prespecified subgroups with the exception of people with diabetes. This finding may be due to chance or could reflect hypofibrinolysis in these individuals, Johnston and colleagues suggested.

Ticagrelor did not significantly reduce recurrent non-disabling strokes (mRS 0-1) or death at 30 days in the trial (1.3% vs 1.6%, HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.57-1.08).

Overall, treatment with ticagrelor was associated with less disability when recurrent strokes did occur. In patients with recurrent ischemic stroke, the resulting disability burden favored ticagrelor over aspirin alone (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.65-0.91).

Independent predictors of recurrent disabling stroke were baseline NIH Stroke Scale score 4 to 5, ipsilateral stenosis of at least 30%, Asian race, older age, and higher systolic blood pressure.

Johnston's team cautioned that residual confounding was possible in the secondary analysis. There was also no disability assessment at day 90, though authors argued that 30-day mRS is highly correlated with 90-day mRS scores.

Ticagrelor's new indication for stroke prevention joins its other existing indications: reduction of risk of cardiovascular death, MI, and stroke in patients with acute coronary syndrome or a history of MI; and reduction of the risk of a first MI or stroke in high-risk patients with coronary artery disease.

Notably, ticagrelor is more expensive than clopidogrel (Plavix), another P2Y12 inhibitor used in secondary stroke prevention.

Unlike ticagrelor, however, clopidogrel did not significantly reduce disabling ischemic strokes when added to aspirin in the POINT trial. It took a pooling of the CHANCE and POINT trials to suggest such a benefit, Johnston and colleagues noted.

The CHANCE-2 trial directly comparing the two P2Y12 inhibitors is ongoing.

FDA Broadens Ticagrelor Indication to Stroke Prevention - Medscape,"Fri, 06 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiK2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1lZHNjYXBlLmNvbS92aWV3YXJ0aWNsZS85NDA1NTHSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the antiplatelet agent ticagrelor (Brilinta) to reduce the risk for stroke in patients with acute ischemic stroke with a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of ≤5 or high-risk transient ischemic attack (TIA).

The new indication for stroke prevention is based on positive results from the phase 3 THALES trial, published in The New England Journal of Medicine last summer.

THALES was conducted in more than 11,000 patients who had experienced a minor acute ischemic stroke or high-risk TIA and for whom treatment was initiated within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms. The patients were randomly assigned to receive aspirin plus ticagrelor (90 mg twice daily) or aspirin alone for 30 days.

The trial demonstrated that ticagrelor plus aspirin reduced the rate of the primary composite endpoint of stroke and death by 17% (absolute risk reduction, 1.1%; hazard ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.71 – 0.96; P = .015), compared to aspirin alone.

This was a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction. The primary composite endpoint was driven by a reduction in stroke, the company said in a news release.

The risk for severe bleeding events was 0.5% among patients taking aspirin plus ticagrelor and 0.1% for those taking aspirin alone. The results are in line with the known safety profile of ticagrelor, the company notes.

""One in four patients who have had a stroke will experience a second one, with the risk particularly high within the first 30 days,"" Clay Johnston, MD, lead investigator for the THALES trial and dean of the Dell Medical School at the University of Texas in Austin, said in the company news release. ""The approval of Brilinta in combination with aspirin is an important advancement to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke and much-awaited good news for physicians and patients.""

Last spring, the FDA cleared ticagrelor for use with aspirin to cut the risk for a first myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke in high-risk patients with coronary artery disease but no history of MI or stroke.

Ticagrelor is also indicated to reduce the risk for cardiovascular death, MI, and stroke in patients with acute coronary syndrome or a history of MI.

France Launches SLAMF Mine Warfare Program But Many Questions Remain - Naval News,"Fri, 06 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdmFsbmV3cy5jb20vbmF2YWwtbmV3cy8yMDIwLzExL2ZyYW5jZS1sYXVuY2hlcy1zbGFtZi1taW5lLXdhcmZhcmUtcHJvZ3JhbS1idXQtbWFueS1xdWVzdGlvbnMtcmVtYWluL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"France Launches SLAMF Mine Warfare Program But Many Questions Remain The French Minister of the Armed Forces, approved on October 27, 2020, the launch of the SLAMF (Système de lutte anti-mines futur) Future Mine Warfare System Program.

The SLAM-F / MMCM mine warfare system will allow French and British sailors to operate remotely and stay out of the mine field through the use of unmanned systems. However, many questions remain regarding the exact type of UUVs and USVs France and the Royal Navy plan to procure.

SLAMF will eventually replace all current mine warfare means (Tripartite-class mine hunters, sonar towing vessels, EOD diver vessels) of the French Navy. What will replace the existing Royal Navy MCM vessels (Hunt-class and Sandown-class) is still an unknown.

SLAMF will contribute in particular to ensuring the freedom of maneuver of the nuclear deterrent force by securing the implementation of the nuclear strategic units of the French Navy (SSBNs, aircraft carriers). It will be used to protect access to French ports and, depending on the circumstances, to support the deployment of a naval force, to participate in crisis prevention or to intervene in contested environment.

The SLAMF program consists of four components:

8x Unmanned systems (details below) including 4 to be delivered by 2024

6x motherships for UAV/USV/UUV known as “bâtiments de guerre des mines” (BGDM)

5x EOD divers support vessels known as “bâtiments base plongeurs démineurs nouvelle generation” (BBPD NG)

1x Mine Warfare Data Operating System (SEDGM).Mine Warfare Data Operating System (SEDGM).

Each of the four “unmanned systems” mentioned above represents a mine warfare module consisting of:

1x Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV), to identify and neutralize sea mines.

3x Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV),

2x Unmanned Surface Vessel (USV),to detect, classify and locate (DCL functions) the mines.

The motherships will displace between 3,000 and 4,000 tons with a length close to 90 meters. It will take sailors “out of the mine field” in a similar fashion to the MCM replacement program of the Belgian and Dutch navies. Both programs are replacing the Tripartite-class MCM vessels. We were told in the past that the BGDM could feature a well deck to ease the launch and recovery of USVs and UUVs but it seems like this configuration has not be retained.

The initial mine warfare modules will be land based and deployed directly from the naval bases, especially in Brest which is close to the French Navy’s SSBN fleet. Initial operational capacity (IOC) of the first system is set for 2023.

Questions on the unmanned systems

As mentioned, many question marks remain regarding the exact type of UUVs and USVs France and the Royal Navy plan to procure. The systems procured so far for the program were limited to the demonstration phase:

The ROV used in this demo phase was the Multi-Shot Mine Neutralization System by Saab. The UUV/AUV was the A27 Espadon (Swordfish) by ECA Group with Thales payloads. The USV was the C-Sweep by L3Harris ASV equipped with a towed sonar (the TSAM by Thales). To learn more about each of these systems, check out our video report recorded last year.

The Royal Navy evaluated another USV in addition to the C-Sweep: the ARCIMS by Atlas Elektronik UK.

Which UUV/AUV for SLAMF / MMCM ?

The A27 UUV by ECA Group with Thales payloads onboard.

The A27 Espadon was used for the demonstration phase of SLAMF/MMCM. The exact type of AUV still needs to be formally confirmed as it was just turned down by the Royal Navy. Details of this initially surfaced in an “information report” on the ten years of the Lancaster House agreements by two French MPs:

A set comprising a surface drone and a Thales sonar should soon go into production, which of course satisfies the manufacturer and the DGA. As for the underwater drone designed to detect mines at greater depth, the ECA Group proposal has not been convincing. The DGA has suggested that the British continue to work on this second drone, with no positive response so far.

Naval News contacted both the DGA and ECA Group to shed light on the above statement. However we not yet heard from either party.

Combining information from both French and British sources, Naval News understands the issue with the A27 that was tested during the demonstration phase has to do with:

cost, weight and power issues linked to its payload: The SAMDIS synthetic aperture sonar by Thales,

footprint and weight: The Royal Navy found the A27 AUV as being too large and heavy (at 1 ton) since the early stages of the program,

the fact that the A27, designed in 2010, is one generation older compared to the newest mid-size UUVs available today.

A-18M UUV. ECA Picture.

The Royal Navy is now seeking a new UUV system. This has not been confirmed by official sources but we, at Naval News, believe that ECA Group will likely propose its newer AUV: The A18M with its own sonar payload. But other major players of the UUV industry are set to compete as well such as Bluefin Robotics, Hydroid, Teledyne Gavia, L3Harris and of course Riptide which was acquired by BAE Systems last year… In the context of the 10 years of the Lancaster House agreements and for the sake of the “entente cordiale”, it would seem logical if DE&S and the Royal Navy selected the French A18M.

It is not decided yet whether the DGA will stick to the original plans and procure the A27 for the French Navy AUV needs or seek an alternative as well. The natural choice being the A18M as it has already been selected by Belgium and the Netherlands for the rMCM program. This AUV is actually becoming a NATO mine warfare standard as it was recently selected by Latvia as well.

Which USV and ROV for SLAMF / MMCM ?

C-Sweep USV with TSAM sonar, during a demonstration in June 2019

In its press release issued 3 November, the DGA mentions the following:

The design study and the production of the prototypes of the drone system have been entrusted to Thales, of which ECA will be the main French subcontractor. The industrial organization of SLAM-F will be gradually defined during the award of the contracts relating to the various components of the program.



DGA

The above statement means that nothing is decided yet, not just regarding the UUV, but for other key elements of the mine warfare system such as the USV and the ROV. Consultations relating to the markets quoted above will probably take place in 2021. They will enable the French unmanned systems specialist ECA Group to find out which ones of the 4 + 4 drone systems it will be contracted to deliver for the French SLAMF program.

Once again, ECA Group has the full range of unmanned systems readily available and already selected by NATO navies (Inspector USV, T18M towed sonar, and KSTER for mine neutralization). For France however, the Thales USV and towed sonar previously used in the demonstration phase are likely to stay because of the investment already conceded in those two systems.

On the British side, as mentioned, the choice on the USV platform will likely be between the C-Sweep by L3Harris ASV / Thales and the Arcims by AEUK as both systems were evaluated during the demonstration phase. C-Sweep is proprietary to the Thales USV system and embodies specific autonomy algorithms developed by Thales. Arcims is already procured for Project Wilton and Sweep demonstrator.

Which MCM motherships for the Royal Navy ?

On the British side, plans for the motherships are still not clear. Several sources mentioned to Naval News plans of early retirement the existing fleet of Hunt-class and Sandown-class MCM vessels. Rumor has it the unmanned systems would (initially at least) be deployed from vessels of opportunity (OSV types) or even the future Type 26 and Type 31 frigates.

About SLAMF / MMCM Program

In 2012, UK and France initiated the Maritime Mine Counter Measures (MMCM) programme which aims at developing a prototype autonomous system for detection and neutralisation of sea mines and underwater improvised explosive devices (UWIEDs). Managed by the OCCAR European agency, the MMCM contract was awarded to Thales, in collaboration with BAE Systems and their partners in France (ECA) and in the UK (ASV, Wood & Douglas, SAAB).

MMCM is a complete mine warfare system, composed of Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) and Underwater Unmanned Vehicles (UUVs), aiming at replacing French Marine Nationale and UK Royal Navy current fleets of mine hunters. As part of the MMCM programme, Thales and BAE Systems are committed to providing systems to both the French Navy and Royal Navy for two years of evaluation testing, under the SLAMF and MHC programs respectively."

Today they provide specialist treatment and support for veterans from every service and conflict, focusing on those with complex mental health issues.

Thales understand the enormity of what we ask our Armed Forces to do on our behalf in times of conflict. We are not just a supplier of technology and military capability but are also signatories to the UK Armed Forces Covenant and have achieved Gold Award in the UK MoD’s Employer Recognition Scheme (ERS). This is because we care about the men and women who are the users of our technology and recognise our part in ensuring that they get the best possible care when they have had to experience combat on the nation’s behalf.

“Thales UK and Combat Stress have a longstanding partnership spanning many years. Our shared values, the importance of mental health at work and at home, and the understanding of the value that veterans bring to the workplace have ensured that our partnership goes from strength to strength.”

Garry Burns, Corporate Fundraising Manager, Combat Stress

At Thales UK we take the mental health of our employees very seriously because the wellbeing of our employees is fundamental to the success of our business and that is why when we look at one of our key customers in the UK, the UK Armed Forces, we have made Combat Stress one of our Corporate Sponsored Charities.

“Thales UK benefit from the large number of veterans among our workforce. We benefit from their training, knowledge and experience – sometimes an experience that was hard won. That is why as a supplier of capability to the UK Armed Forces we are also proud to help share their burden by supporting Combat Stress and our ex-services employees so that ultimately we are fully part of their success in every way possible”.

Alex Cresswell, CEO Thales UK

This Armistice, Combat Stress, the UK’s leading charity for veterans’ mental health, are launching a ground-breaking new campaign – Combat Stress 100. Combat Stress is, with SSAFA, the main Service Charity we Thales UK support as a Company.

The Combat Stress 100 campaign provides a true insight into the impact of living with military trauma. Unfiltered, unguarded and profoundly moving accounts from UK veterans highlight the agony of living with PTSD [Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder] and the toll this, and other complex mental health conditions, can have on veterans and their families.

Through the content of the project (over 70 interviews with veterans, family members and Combat Stress staff), Combat Stress are asking the nation to listen, watch and learn about the impact of military trauma on former servicemen and women.

The Combat Stress 100 project, undertaken to mark Combat Stress' centenary year, was made in partnership with reminiscence charity Age Exchange. It was made possible thanks to funding from the National Lottery Heritage Fund, and of course the veterans who so bravely shared their stories.

If you would like to hear their stories and accounts, please visit Combat Stress and follow the links to the Combat Stress 100 project. Alternatively you can follow the links below.

Trigger Warning: Please Note some of these stories and accounts are not easy to listen to and watch.

“We hope that by sharing this podcast with Thales, it will lead to better understanding of the challenges veterans face and how with the right support even the most complex issues can be overcome.”

The Future Combat Mission System (FCMS) consortium will start designing an innovative suite of connected and distributed sensors for the Future Combat Air System (FCAS).

The sensors will follow the requirements of the FCAS participating nations (France, Germany and Spain), and will contribute to the sixth-generation aircraft's situational awareness and ability to operate without being detected.

FCMS, which is a consortium formed by HENSOLDT, Diehl Defence, ESG and Rohde & Schwarz, as well as Indra of Spain and France's Thales will develop the suite of sensors.

The French Armament General Directorate (DGA) signed a contract with Indra, which leads the industrial consortium, to incorporate the sensors as part of the Phase 1 contractual framework. The Phase 1 A Concept Study for Sensors will last for one year, and could be extended by another six months.

The consortium will work on design concepts required to meet 2040 operational challenges and beyond for the next-generation combat system, which will incorporate a connected and distributed architecture of sensors, future sensor architectures and the maturation of associated sensor technologies.

The FCAS is certainly more ambitious than Britain's Team Tempest future combat aircraft, which relies on British ingenuity and innovation to deliver what appears to be a well optimised and innovative sixth-generation platform.

Where the FCAS deviates the most from the UK's efforts is its concept for a manned New Generation Fighter (NGF) accompanied by “Remote Carriers” or UAVs that are interconnected within a combat cloud. This joint effort is known as the Next Generation Weapon System (NGWS) project.

The use of a combat cloud will allow vast amounts of data to be processed and its development will be a key prerequisite for the success of the ambitious European FCAS programme. The potential rewards are high as the NGWS will also operate autonomously (independent of a manned fighter) or in a network with air, naval, land or space combat or command systems.

The distributed sensor architecture will leverage the capabilities provided by the NGWS/FCAS combat cloud, with improved system situational awareness and increased platforms survivability. The sensors pillar consortium will work together with the other NGWS/FCAS pillars (Combat Cloud, Next Generation Fighter, Remote Carriers) to optimise the design and integration of the sensors within the system and platforms.

The development of the sensor pillar is essential to ensure consistent architectures that are perfectly integrated into the new generation fighters (NGF), unmanned systems and remote operators, and the combat cloud. The superiority of the NGWS/FCAS will largely depend on the capacity of its network of sensors to compile more and better information than the adversary."
Thales and Ocius develop Blue Sentry autonomous marine system - @AuManufacturing,"Wed, 25 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1bWFudWZhY3R1cmluZy5jb20uYXUvdGhhbGVzLWFuZC1vY2l1cy1kZXZlbG9wLWJsdWUtc2VudHJ5LWF1dG9ub21vdXMtbWFyaW5lLXN5c3RlbdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales Australia has received $3.8 million from the Defence Innovation Hub to develop its Australian engineered and built Blue Sentry autonomous marine system.

Part of $28 million in defence hub grants, Blue Sentry is a group of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) equipped for anti-submarine warfare (ASW) and surveillance missions.

The system incorporates a Thales Remote Active Sonar Systems (RASS) array, consisting of towed active and passive sonar sub systems, as well data processing integrated onto Ocius Technology’s autonomous platform, the Bluebottle (main picture and below).

According to Thales R&S project lead Daniel Dent the Bluebottle is a standout USV platform for long-term maritime mission endurance.

Dent said: “The Bluebottle design has a unique combination of capabilities which keep it moving forward in all-weather while still producing enough power for the payload utilising solar cells on the sail and deck for electricity generation.

“It has been proven at sea now over many missions for several years, performing remarkably well.”

The Blue Sentry fleet of USVs with integrated sonar arrays will be capable of remaining operational for extended periods of time, autonomously patrolling large areas of ocean performing underwater ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance) missions.

“Missions that would have previously required the deployment of peopled assets for many days to complete will be able to be conducted remotely using the Blue Sentry team of Autonomous Vessels at a significantly reduced cost of coverage.”

Another advantage of the Blue Sentry system is that it is capable of being deployed both at surface and sub-surface depths enabling detection, classification and localisation of craft on the surface or below the water.

The Thales RASS element of Blue Sentry will enable covert communication to allies below the surface using long-range low frequency underwater communications.

Thales Australia and Ocius will utilise the grant funding to target engineering innovations to further develop the Bluebottle

Work will be undertaken on:

Trusted team autonomy

navigation and persistence

size and power consumption of sonar systems

communications range and content

integration of the RASS sonar system

testing and proving for ASW missions

and mission hardening of the vessel teams.

Mystery historic photos brings a family home - Thales,"Fri, 13 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi9jb3VudHJpZXMtYXNpYS9hdXN0cmFsaWEvbmV3cy9teXN0ZXJ5LWhpc3RvcmljLXBob3Rvcy1icmluZ3MtZmFtaWx5LWhvbWXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"As we round out NAIDOC Week – a week-long celebration of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures, we caught up with our Business Analyst for Explosive Ordnance (EO) Services at Orchard Hills, Joanne Gregory. Her story is an incredible one, about a series of mystery photos taken in the 1800’s and found at auction in England in 2004 – photos that have led her to identify as one of our First Nations people. Here is how it all happened.

WARNING: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander readers are advised that the following article contains images of people who have died.

In 2013, Joanne’s father received a phone call from the Grafton Gallery, a local art centre located not too far from where he was living at the time. The call was about a series of photos of local Aboriginal people taken by German photographer John William Lindt in 1873. The photos were an internationally acclaimed series of portraits; however, no names were kept of the subjects – all bar one. That name was Mary-Ann of Ulmarra.

The photos were initially discovered by Philanthropists, Sam and Janet Cullen, at an auction in the UK in 2004. Determined to return the portion of Aboriginal history to Australia, Sam and Janet purchased the photos immediately, and began a nine-year investigation working alongside local elders and historians to piece together who was in the portraits, and if they had any living ancestors.

“They dug into it and found that the tribe was from around Grafton,” Joanne says. “And they were able to trace who Mary-Ann of Ulmurra was, and as it turns out, she was an Aunty of my Grandfather. That’s how it all started for my family.”

Joanne says that throughout her life the family always suspected their First Nations heritage, but it was never spoken about.

“My Grandfather, Harold Arthur Cowan, actually took on the surname Williams when he was young,” she notes. “He had an accident when he was seven and went to stay with an Aunt whose married name was Williams. Her and her husband gave Harold the ‘Williams’ surname to keep him from being taken away in what we refer to now as ‘the stolen generation’. The Williams family never spoke about their Aboriginal heritage after that for fear of what would happen to them.

“My father never spoke about it, although I think he knew it was true. And then when the phone call came in 2013 he finally accepted his heritage. He became immensely proud of his First Nations history, and he got to meet family members we never knew we had. He passed away two years later and we’re all so happy he got to experience the joy this news brought him.”

For Joanne, the event has changed her life.

“I’m so proud of my heritage and all of the history that our people carry,” she smiles. “I went straight into my work information and marked down that I identified as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander. I’ve applied to join the Land Council and am trying to gain official government recognition as being Aboriginal. That is a long, slow process but I won’t stop until that process is completed.”

Joanne says she actively engaged in the establishment of Thales Australia’s Reconciliation Action Plan and the Cultural Awareness training run by Aboriginal owned company Mirri Mirri. For this year’s NAIDOC Week Joanne is also engaged in the online session with Thales partners The Clontarf Foundation – an organisation that exists to improve the education, discipline, life skills, self-esteem and employment prospects of young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander men.

“The Cullens, those elders and researchers, and the ABC who made a documentary about it and did a lot of the digging around, I have so much to thank them for,” Joanne says. “If it wasn’t for those photographs I would never have been on this journey, and would never have identified as Aboriginal. I’m so happy and proud now, and I can’t thank them enough.”

Vice President of Human Resources at Thales Ronan Carolan says stories like Joanne’s cements how important actions like Thales’ RAP launch and the partnership with the Clontarf Foundation are for the company’s employees.

“This is a fantastic story of a family finding their cultural heritage,” Ronan stated. “For Joanne to be able to identify as Aboriginal through Workday here at work and in the community is so important on a personal level. For Thales it is very satisfying to see we have a strong and diverse workforce, including members of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, and we will continue to engage with organisations like the Clontarf Foundation to help raise awareness for our First Nations people.”"

Dassault Rafale Jets Get Talios Laser Designation Pods; Will India Acquire The French ‘Eye In The Sky’? - EurAsian Times,"Mon, 09 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ldXJhc2lhbnRpbWVzLmNvbS9pb2Mtb2YtdGFsaW9zLWRlY2xhcmVkLW9uLXJhZmFsZS1mMy1yLXdpbGwtaW5kaWEtYWNxdWlyZS1mcmFuY2VzLWV5ZS1pbi10aGUtc2t5LXRvLW91dGZsYW5rLWNoaW5hL9IBgAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ldXJhc2lhbnRpbWVzLmNvbS9pb2Mtb2YtdGFsaW9zLWRlY2xhcmVkLW9uLXJhZmFsZS1mMy1yLXdpbGwtaW5kaWEtYWNxdWlyZS1mcmFuY2VzLWV5ZS1pbi10aGUtc2t5LXRvLW91dGZsYW5rLWNoaW5hLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The French Air and Space Force announced the initial operational capability (IOC) of the Talios laser designation pod on the Dassault Rafale F3-R multi-role fighter. The first flight of the F3R standard jet, which took place in September, saw an Indian air force (IAF) pilot operating from the rear-seat of the twin-seater jet.

The new Talios (Targeting Long-Range Identification Optronic System) targeting and laser designator pod, designed by Thales, brings full day and night surveillance and laser designation capability to the Rafale, with metric precision. It permits laser-guided weapons to be delivered at stand-off range and altitude.

The IR sensor of the Talios pod operates in the mid-wave infrared band and is coupled to a high-resolution new generation TV sensor.

The Indian Air Force (IAF), which has also acquired the multi-role Rafale fighters from France, was given the demonstration capabilities of the Talios pod in the air-to-air, air-to-ground, and air-to-sea domains, last month, according to the French Ministry of Defence.

The addition of Talios pod has enhanced the target acquisition system of the Rafales, which was earlier considered a disadvantage for the fighter.

The system is yet to be acquired by the Indian Air Force, which has been using variants of the Litening target acquisition system from Israel’s Rafael for several years now. Rafael had announced the supply of 164 Litening pods to the Indian Air Force in 2016.

Several fighter aircraft of the IAF currently employ the Litening, including the Mirage-2000, Jaguar, and Su-30MKI.

The IAF has opted for the HAMMER weapon system to be deployed on the Rafale, which originally comes with a Talios pod for firing. The Talios Pod could prove effective in delivering laser-guided bombs, especially in the Ladakh situation with China, when there is no better targeting system in existence.

Whether India agrees to acquire the Talios for its Rafale jets is unclear, and it will depend on the outcome of the Ladakh face-off. However, if deployed, the system will allow IAF to dominate all its adversaries in the optronics sector, giving the Indian pilots a unique edge while engaging this ‘eye in the sky.’

The October 29 tests, as announced by the French Ministry of Defense, conducted in an unnamed squadron manned by the Rafale, have indicated significant initial operational readiness of the system. The Talios is now believed to be capable of working in a full-fledged combat operation.

The system combines targeting and tactical recce capabilities in a single pod. It delivers unmatched image quality, including color imagery, and disruptive capabilities such as Permanent Visio and embedded artificial intelligence to provide combat aircraft pilots and ground forces with reliable situational awareness in real-time, according to Thales.

Flight-tested for the first time in 2016, Talios was successfully qualified by the French defense procurement agency in 2018 for deployment by Dassault’s Rafale Omni-role aircraft. The new-generation pod has been delivered to French forces and is now fully combat-ready.

Designed with support from the French defense procurement agency, Talios is the first and only system merging high-performance targeting and reconnaissance features in a single pod, covering the entire decision chain, from intelligence gathering through to threat neutralization.

Talios’ high-resolution sensor system can scan a wide area to search for targets in reconnaissance mode and, subsequently, moving target acquisition and tracking modes. The system generates a 3D mapping of the target area. The onboard artificial intelligence (AI) allows for automatic target recognition and target acquisition.

The pod supports deep strike with long-range bombs and missiles, air-to-air target identification, close air support (CAS), and Non-Traditional Information, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance.

What separates TALIOS from its predecessor DAMOCLES is the deployment of an advanced long-distance camera and the modernization of the IR band II (infrared) sensor. The human-system interface in Talios comes redesigned to giving the pilot all of the information required for understanding a complex tactical situation.

Damocles was also criticized for the lack of a “daytime” optical channel and other shortcomings, a feature which has been equipped in the Talios pod. The system is expected to gradually equip all Rafale squadrons of France’s Air and Space Force and will be deployed in foreign theaters of operation."

Two modular data centres delivered for Sea 1442 Phase 6 - Australian Defence Magazine,"Mon, 09 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1c3RyYWxpYW5kZWZlbmNlLmNvbS5hdS9kZWZlbmNlL3NlYS90d28tbW9kdWxhci1kYXRhLWNlbnRyZXMtZGVsaXZlcmVkLWZvci1zZWEtMTQ0Mi1waGFzZS020gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"RJE Global has delivered the first of two Modular Data Centres (MDC) as part of the Sea 1442 Phase 6 JP 9103 program, only three months after commencing construction.

The company was engaged by Thales Australia in December 2019 to complete the design, construction and installation of two state-of-the-art MDCs to support the RAN's Protected Satellite Communications (SATCOM) capability.

The construction phase of the project has taken the team only three months to complete after receiving full client approval, with the first module to be handed over from the company’s Lonsdale facility on Friday. The second module is due to be handed over before the end of the year.

RJE Global Director Dean Cook said the MDCs are a pioneering concept, allowing them to be delivered to the Department of Defence as a plug-and-play facility with single modules.

“Each module exceeds 30 meters in length, 7 meters in width and 4.5 meters in height and are able to be placed side by side,” Cook said. “The facilities can be designed to achieve security ratings stipulated in ASIO Tech Notes and the Defence Security Principals Framework, while achieving acoustic ratings of Dw50 radio frequency shielding, fire rating, ballasting rating, blast rating and suitable for cyclonic conditions.”

RJE Global’s Lonsdale facility has provided a manufacturing base for the company since its purchase in 2009, allowing the team to enhance their inhouse capabilities for the manufacture and assembly of transportable switchrooms.

“We use an innovative system of glass reinforced concrete (GRC) that comprise glass fibres embedded in a concrete medium which is utilised in a custom design system to clad transportable secure facilities” Cook said. “This unique cladding system provides advantages for clients who require a high-quality transportable building. A strong, ductile, non-corrosive smooth concrete finish to a transportable building such as this is unique and has distinct benefits for these particular applications.

“The GRC cladding system also protects sensitive equipment within the building from potential harsh external environmental considerations including fire.”

Cook said providing turn key solutions into fast growing Defence market has allowed RJE Global to draw upon its in house design capability and maintain 15 full time positions through one of the most difficult periods the company has faced since it was established in 1996.

“It is fantastic that a highly regarded international company such as Thales has placed their trust in our privately owned SA company to build and deliver such a critical piece of Defence infrastructure, which has injected around $1.2 million in wages into the state,” he said.

“We are able to self-deliver all aspects of the design, construction and transport in house, allowing us to reduce risk and fast track these state-of-the-art secure facilities for our valued customers.”"
