Thales has launched TrustNest R-Suite to enable French administrations, government agencies and industries (defence, aerospace, energy, critical national infrastructure and essential service providers, etc.) to communicate, design and innovate more efficiently on projects involving sensitive information classified at Restricted Distribution (RD) level ( Diffusion Restreinte – DR, classifié de niveau Défense ) in the French official classification system.

TrustNest R-Suite, the first RD-certified suite of as-a-service applications, is now available to French software editors, providing unprecedented capabilities at this level of security and compliance. It brings to its final users the benefits of the cloud and access to a set of high-performance professional applications.

TrustNest R-Suite is hosted by TrustNest R-Cloud, the first RD-certified cloud. Operated by Thales, TrustNest R-Cloud provides a shared infrastructure for customers, while guaranteeing sovereignty and a high level of security.

Due to a lack of suitable tools, French administrations, government agencies and strategic industries encounter major difficulties in collaborating effectively on projects involving sensitive data classified as Restricted Distribution (DR, classifié de niveau Défense). They also face the need for increasing investment to maintain an adequate level of service and security on local on-premise infrastructure.

With the launch of TrustNest R-Suite, the first RD-certified as-a-service application suite, Thales brings the cloud revolution to companies and public authorities working with sensitive data, enabling them to collaborate, communicate, develop and innovate more effectively and securely on sensitive projects, both internally and with outside partners, all at the same time.

For the first time, applicationdevelopers have access to a platform where they can immediately publish their applications with a high level of security and make them available ""as-a-service"" to address the market for highly secure collaborative applications.

TrustNest R-Suite offers a selection of existing collaborative business software applications and will be expanded to include new solutions from third-party developers and start-ups. It also incorporates the Cybels HubDR collaborative solution, including the Citadel and Cryptobox messaging and document management and sharing tools, and the Thales Headlight military support application suite.

“Thales is proud to offer the only cloud solution with Restricted Distribution certification, not only for the players in France’s defence and space industrial and technological base, but also for all critical national infrastructure (CNI) providers and government ministries. It also includes a marketplace for the most innovative applications to drive even more effective collaboration,” said Jean-Michel Craste, Vice President, Thales Services Numériques.

“TrustNest R-Cloud and TrustNest R-Suite are helping to drive the digital transformation of high-tech industries, administrations and government agencies with an unmatched level of security. With these solutions, all these players and the broader developer community have access to high-performance services, additional capacity for innovation, new sources of revenue and significant productivity gains, thanks to the benefits of the cloud,” added Raphaël de Cormis, Vice President, Thales Digital Factory.

TrustNest R-Cloud is the first cloud solution with Restricted Distribution certification. It is operated and managed by Thales in France and meets the requirements of Ministerial Instruction II9011 on the protection of systems handling Restricted level information. It improves collaboration by making it possible to use SaaS software across the networks of multiple partners. In addition, it offers state-of-the-art secure software application development and deployment tools, enabling organisations to benefit from all the advantages of a cloud infrastructure: elasticity, scalability and updatability.

As a trusted partner, Thales offers users of public, private, defence and restricted clouds highly secure, easy-to-deploy solutions that are tailored to the nature of the organisations involved, the level of protection required and their specific service needs.

A key player in communication systems

Thales recognises the potential of AeroComms’ product range, which has secured positions with major OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers) and aftermarket opportunities.

The acquisition aligns with Thales’ long-term strategy of fortifying its Avionics division. By adding AeroComms’ communications capabilities, Thales will enhance its existing offerings and unlock new avenues for growth.

This partnership will enable Thales to provide cyber-secured, real-time connectivity between aircraft cockpits and air traffic control, resulting in optimized flight trajectories, reduced fuel consumption, and lower CO2 emissions within the next few years.

Yannick Assouad, Thales Executive Vice-President Avionics, expressed enthusiasm about the acquisition, stating, “With the acquisition of Cobham Aerospace Communications and its highly skilled team of aerospace communications experts, and combined with our own critical avionics experts, Thales will establish a game changer in the very attractive and fast-growing communications and connectivity market to the benefit of a more sustainable aerospace future.”

Nicolas Bonleux, CEO of Cobham Aerospace Communications, echoed the sentiment, “Our combined offering with Thales Avionics will enable us to further accelerate our contribution to safer, greener, more comfortable, and more efficient air travel.”

Enhancing Thales’s role in the communications and connectivity market

Airbus have Cobham Aerospace Communications’ Radio Management System as a standard fit on their H145M multi-role rotary aircraft, and Cobham also supports the UK Military Beechcraft T-6 Aircraft as some examples of aircraft that Cobham Aerospace Communications has supported.

AeroComms specializes in designing, producing, and supporting solutions. Their portfolio includes advanced L-Band Satcom systems, digital audio and radio management solutions, and passive antenna systems that facilitate connectivity, communications, and navigation.

AeroComms’ recent innovations, such as Aviator-S in Satcom and DRAIMS in digital Audio/Radio, position the company for future revenue growth.

Integrating AeroComms’ communication systems will push Thales towards addressing the industry’s trend of connected cockpits. By the end of the decade, Thales will be equipped to provide permanent connectivity solutions tailored to the aeronautical market’s evolving needs.

Daniel Jones, Head of R&A for the aerospace, defence, & security team at GlobalData, claimed: “Demand for connectivity is expected to rise substantially with the next-gen of single-aisle planes ramping up production, combined with a good sale price.”

Last month, Thales led the European EPIIC Research Project to design technologies for future military cockpits to rethink human-machine interaction by using technologies to create an immersive environment where the machine supports the pilot. The fighter pilot will be able to supervise and operate a set of platforms, with or without crew, in a highly complex and evolving environment.

Augmenting Thales’s growth and profitability

This offering will contribute to safer flights, increased operational efficiency, improved assistance, and reduced installation burdens for OEMs.

Adding AeroComms will augment Thales Avionics’ sales growth and EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes) margin profile. The transaction will generate significant synergies, including pre-tax net cost synergies of approximately $10m per annum and revenue synergies of roughly $40m per annum.

These synergies will result from consolidation efforts, R&D alignment, purchasing optimization, expanded go-to-market strategies, and increased aftermarket upselling opportunities.

Thales plans to finance this acquisition using its available cash resources. The transaction is subject to customary merger control and regulatory approvals, with the closing expected to occur during the first half of 2024. Thales and Cobham Aerospace Communications will engage with their respective employee representative bodies to ensure a smooth transition and integration process.

As Thales expands its portfolio and improves its position in the communications and connectivity market, Thales sets the stage for a more sustainable and efficient future."
Thales Inks $1.1B Deal to Buy Cobham Aerospace Communications - WashingtonExec,"Mon, 17 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd2FzaGluZ3RvbmV4ZWMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDcvdGhhbGVzLWlua3MtMS0xYi1kZWFsLXRvLWJ1eS1jb2JoYW0tYWVyb3NwYWNlLWNvbW11bmljYXRpb25zL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales, a French defense and technology group, is in negotiations to buy Cobham Aerospace Communications for $1.1 billion, strengthening its avionics portfolio and expanding its geographical footprint.

“With the acquisition of Cobham Aerospace Communications and its highly skilled team of aerospace communications experts, and combined with our own critical avionics experts, Thales will establish a game changer in the very attractive and fast-growing communications and connectivity market to the benefit of a more sustainable aerospace future,” said ​Yannick Assouad, Thales executive vice president of Avionics.

Cobham Aerospace Communications provides advanced safety cockpit communication systems. It has 690 employees including 190 engineers, and operates in France, South Africa, the U.S., Canada and Denmark.

The company is expected to generate $200 million in revenue in 2023.

“By guaranteeing a cyber-secured, live connection between the cockpit and air traffic control, aircraft will be able to fly optimized trajectories in real time, significantly reducing fuel consumption and, consequently, CO2 emissions in the next two to three years,” Assouad added.

The acquisition will improve Thales’ global position in safety cockpit communications and incorporate newly developed cutting-edge products into its portfolio. It’s expected to generate medium-term double-digit growth per annum.

“This acquisition reflects the successful transformation of Cobham Aerospace Communications in recent years under Advent’s ownership. Our sizeable investment in R&D over the last years has further consolidated our position as a leading player in our markets, with a series of new contracts won already this year,” said ​Nicolas Bonleux, Cobham Aerospace Communications CEO.

By integrating Cobham Aerospace Communications’ safety cockpit communication systems portfolio, Thales can make the shift toward connected cockpits in hopes of addressing the aeronautical market’s secured connectivity needs by the end of the decade.

Thales will be able to provide safer, more affordable and sustainable solutions with real-time and cyber-secured air-to-ground services; increased operations’ efficiency; better pilot assistance; and reduced original equipment manufacturers’ installation burdens.

Plus, Thales said the acquisition will improve its Avionics’ sales growth and EBIT margin profile. The transaction is expected to close during the first half of 2024.

​”We are proud to join Thales, which will provide Cobham Aerospace Communications with a platform to build on recent success, continue the development of several cutting-edge avionics products, and ensure the business’ future growth,” Bonleux added.

“The aircraft connectivity and communication markets will undergo a true revolution in the coming years, which will unlock potential for unique avionics products like ours. Our combined offering with Thales Avionics will enable us to further accelerate our contribution to safer, greener, more comfortable and more efficient air travel.”"

Thales and Imperva will combine their respective strengths. Increased capabilities are notably expected in the fields of protecting data at rest and data in use, complementing Thales’ know-how in data in motion.

Imperva and Thales will also benefit from their strong complementarity and cultural fit in terms of clients and addressable markets. The combination is expected to yield significant commercial opportunities within the existing client base as well as revenue synergies in the years ahead.

Thales estimates that the combination will generate c.$110 million of pre-tax run-rate synergies, including $50 million of cost synergies and $60 million linked to revenue synergies.

Thales’ step-change in cybersecurity

Cybersecurity represents a priority market for Thales. It is both a critical enabler for its other activities and a long-term fast-growing and technology-driven market where Thales can bring unique know-how.

As a global leader in cybersecurity, Thales is involved at every level of the cyber value chain: Identity, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover.

Thales’ offer is focused on three families of cybersecurity products and services:

Global security products around the CipherTrust Data Security Platform, the SafeNet Trusted Access Identity & Access Management as a service solution, and the broader cloud protection & licensing offerings. Imperva will be part of this business. Sovereign protection products including encryptors and sensors to protect governmental, and institutional critical information systems. A complete suite of cybersecurity services around Cybels solutions portfolio, including threat and risk evaluation, training and simulation, detection and response, and integration projects.

As part of its strategy, Thales has significantly increased its focus on cybersecurity over the past years, expanding its footprint and offering in order to achieve critical mass. After the recent Group offer for Tesserent and the completed acquisitions of S21sec & Excellium and OneWelcome, this new acquisition, subject to regulatory approvals, takes Thales’ cybersecurity business to the next level.

New enhanced profile for DIS

In this growth context and subject to forthcoming social processes, Thales plans to regroup as of January 1st 2024 all its civil cyber activities (currently split between its Digital Identity & Security (DIS) and Defense & Security operating segments) within DIS. This will further strengthen DIS’ position as a go-to player for civil cybersecurity products and solutions, and facilitate the capture of synergies within the full portfolio.

Pro forma, following the acquisitions of Imperva and Tesserent, global cybersecurity products,and services will hence represent 44% of Thales Digital Identity & Security segment sales in 2024, addressing a $36 Bn Total Adressable Market, representing a 60% increase compared to the previous situation.

This acquisition allows the Group to set new financial targets for DIS. Over the 2024-2027 period, DIS sales are now expected to grow annually by 6-7% on an organic basis, to reach a level of sales that will be between €5.4 to €5.5 Bn5 in 2027. Its EBIT margin should reach 16.5%5 by the same horizon.

Value creative transaction for shareholders

Given Imperva’s very attractive business model, the transaction will be immediately accretive to Thales’ growth and margin profile.

The acquisition price represents a 6.1x 2024 EV / revenue multiple, in line with precedent transactions and trading multiples of cybersecurity peers with similar profitable financial profile. It corresponds to an implied 17x 2024 EBIT multiple post run-rate synergies and a 13x 2027 EBIT multiple post run-rate synergies.

Following the transaction, Thales expects to maintain its solid investment grade profile, with a pro forma 2024 leverage ratio of ~0.7x6, in line with the Group’s disciplined capital deployment strategy.

Thales confirms its attractive capital allocation policy with a target dividend pay-out ratio of 40%, in line with previous years, and the continuation of its ongoing share buy-back program.

Next steps

The closing of the transaction is expected by the beginning of 2024, subject to the completion of customary anti-trust and regulatory approvals.

Note on methodology

“Organic change” measures the movement in monetary indicators excluding the effects of changes in exchange rates and scope of consolidation. It is obtained by calculating the difference between the indicator for the previous year discounted at the exchange rates applicable for the current year for entities whose reporting currency is not the euro, less the contribution of entities divested during the current year, and the value of the indicator for the current year, less the contribution of entities acquired during the current year.

Definitions of non-GAAP financial indicators

In order to facilitate the monitoring and benchmarking of its financial and operating performance, the Group presents three key non-GAAP indicators, which exclude non-operating and/or non-recurring items. They are determined as follows:

EBIT , an adjusted operating indicator, corresponds to income from operations plus the share in the net income of equity-accounted companies, before the impact of entries recorded as part of business combinations (amortization of assets valued when determining the purchase price allocation, other expenses directly related to acquisitions).

, an adjusted operating indicator, corresponds to income from operations plus the share in the net income of equity-accounted companies, before the impact of entries recorded as part of business combinations (amortization of assets valued when determining the purchase price allocation, other expenses directly related to acquisitions). EBITDA, corresponds to EBIT, plus depreciations and amortizations excluding PPA.

corresponds to EBIT, plus depreciations and amortizations excluding PPA. Adjusted net income corresponds to net income, excluding the following items and net of the corresponding tax effects: Amortization of assets valued when determining the purchase price allocation (business combinations); Expenses recognized in income from operations or in finance costs that are directly related to business combinations; Gains and losses on disposals of assets, changes in scope and other; Impairment of non-current assets; Changes in the fair value of derivative foreign exchange instruments (recognized under “Other financial income and expenses” in the consolidated financial statements); Actuarial gains (losses) on long-term benefits (recognized under “Finance costs on pensions and other long-term employee benefits” in the consolidated financial statements).

corresponds to net income, excluding the following items and net of the corresponding tax effects: Free operating cash flow corresponds to the net cash flow from operating activities before contributions to reduce the pension deficit in the United Kingdom, and after deducting net operating investments.

Defining EBIT and adjusted net income involves defining other aggregates in the adjusted income statement: adjusted cost of sales, adjusted gross margin (corresponding to the difference between sales and the adjusted cost of sales), adjusted indirect costs, other adjusted financial income and expenses, adjusted financial income on pensions and long-term employee benefits, adjusted income tax, and adjusted net income, Group share, per share (adjusted EPS).

Net cash (debt) corresponds to the difference between the sum of the “cash and cash equivalents” and “current financial assets” items and short- and long-term borrowings, after deduction of interest rate hedging derivatives. From January 1, 2019, it incorporates the lease liability recorded in the balance sheet pursuant to IFRS 16. Its calculation appears in Note 6.2 to the consolidated financial statements.

Transaction adjusted ROCE corresponds, for a given acquisition, to the ratio between:

At the numerator: EBITDA of the acquisition, plus impact of phased synergies, including implementation costs; less capital expenditures: less change in net working capital: less income taxes incurred on EBIT including phased synergies and implementation costs;

At the denominator, the net enterprise value of the acquired asset.

Please note that only the consolidated financial statements as at December 31, 2022 are audited by the statutory auditors, including EBIT, the calculation of which is outlined in Note 2 “Segment Information”, net cash (debt), the definition and calculation of which appear in Note 6.2 “Net cash (debt)”, and free operating cash flow, the definition and calculation of which are specified in Note 7 “Changes in net cash”. Adjusted financial information other than that provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements is subject to the verification procedures applicable to all information included in this press release.

"Thales: For Data Breaches, Cloud Assets are Biggest Cybersecurity Headache - TechRepublic","Wed, 05 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hyZXB1YmxpYy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS90aGFsZXMtMjAyMy1jbG91ZC1zZWN1cml0eS1yZXBvcnQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"While Thales, in its 2023 Cloud Security Study, found that well over a third (39%) of businesses experienced a data breach in their cloud environment last year versus 34% in 2021, organizations are increasingly caching sensitive data in multiple cloud environments.

In the report, based on a survey of 3,000 IT and security teams across 18 countries in EMEA, the Americas and Asia Pacific:

Seventy-five percent of IT executives classified as sensitive more than 40% of their data stored in the cloud, compared to 49% this time last year.

Thirty-eight percent of respondents said software as a service applications are the main target for hackers, followed by cloud-based storage (36%).

Multicloud causing operational complexity

The study shows how more companies are using more cloud service providers, tracking with the 35% growth in the number of reported providers in the market. The study authors noted that the average number of cloud infrastructure providers is now 2.3, and that more than three-quarters (79%) of this year’s respondents have more than one cloud provider (Figure A).

Figure A

“With a larger number of platforms to secure, the opportunity for operational errors grows, increasing the attack surface with each error. Organizations either have to dedicate separate teams to specialize in each platform or expect their security teams to become well-versed in multiple platforms at the same time,” according to the study.

More sensitive data being stored in the cloud

The study reported that organizations are lifting more workloads and data into the cloud: The number of organizations that reported that 60% or more of their workloads are in the cloud increased from 23% to 27% year over year.

SEE: Read how IBM is boosting cloud data practice (TechRepublic)

The report polled respondents two ways about sensitive data in the cloud to determine how they are deploying their data and saw increases in both directions. The survey asked about:

The percentage of an organization’s total sensitive data that is stored in the cloud.

The percentage of all of the data an organization stores in the cloud that is sensitive.

It found that:

In last year’s study, 52% of respondents said that more than 40% of their sensitive data was in the cloud. This year, that amount increased to 64%.

The number of respondents who said that 40% or more of their data stored in the cloud is sensitive data, increased from 49% in last year’s study, to 75% this year.

Encryption is increasing, but slowly

In this year’s study, 22% of respondents said that over 60% of their sensitive data in the cloud is encrypted and 40% said over half of that cloud-based sensitive data is encrypted. Those numbers constitute an improvement from last year’s study, which reported that only 17% of respondents had said over half of their sensitive data in the cloud was encrypted. That said, only 2% said 100% of their sensitive data in the cloud is encrypted (Figure B).

Figure B

Additionally, 62% of IT executives who responded to the survey said they have five or more key management systems, which Thales said constitutes increased complexity for securing sensitive data.

Software-as-a-service creating security challenges

Not only do most companies report having multiple cloud service providers, the rise in the use of SaaS apps is expanding the threat surface for data exfiltration:

In the 2022 study, 16% of respondents reported their enterprises deployed 51-100 different SaaS applications.

In this year’s study, that proportion grew to 22% of respondents, and 55% (versus 46% in the prior year) noted that managing data in the cloud is more complex than in on-premise environments.

Additionally, 83% expressed concerns over data sovereignty, with 55% of respondents asserting that data privacy and compliance in the cloud has become more difficult.

The study included a ranking question on which attack targets are most likely to be attacked. SaaS was mentioned first by 38% of respondents, followed by cloud storage at 36% of those polled. Additionally, the study’s authors said the number of survey respondents reporting a data breach during the study period was up 4% from last year’s report — 35% to 39%.

Data breaches and human error

Over half (55%) of respondents to the survey said human error triggered cloud data breaches at their organizations, but only 41% of organizations have implemented zero-trust controls in their cloud infrastructure — only 38% use zero-trust protocols in their cloud networks. However, more companies are adopting authentication protocols for employees: 65% of respondents to Thales’ survey said they now deploy multifactor authentication.

SEE: Palo Alto Networks on differently about cloud security (TechRepublic)

“Organizations are operating in a dynamic multi-cloud landscape, demanding seamless and efficient security measures,” said Sebastien Cano, senior vice president for cloud protection and licensing activities at Thales.

“To overcome challenges arising from human error and misconfiguration, it is imperative that data protections in the cloud are simplified and easily manageable.” He said that the key to enhancing cloud security lies in treating cloud environments as an extension of existing infrastructure. “By adopting this approach, organizations can effectively bolster security and ensure comprehensive protection across the entire digital ecosystem.”"
Thales to Provide New-Generation Sonar Suite for France's SSBNs - Naval News,"Tue, 11 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdmFsbmV3cy5jb20vbmF2YWwtbmV3cy8yMDIzLzA3L3RoYWxlcy10by1wcm92aWRlLW5ldy1nZW5lcmF0aW9uLXNvbmFyLXN1aXRlLWZvci1mcmFuY2VzLXNzYm5zL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales to Provide New-Generation Sonar Suite for France’s SSBNs Thales has been awarded a contract by the French defence procurement agency (DGA) to develop a new sonar suite for France’s third-generation nuclear-powered ballistic-missile submarines (SNLE 3G) and the programme to modernise its second-generation submarines (SNLE 2G).

Thales press release

The French Ministry of the Armed Forces has once again placed its trust in Thales to maintain the French Navy’s operational superiority in underwater detection capabilities. The sonar suite developed by Thales will detect, locate and classify all types of threats at short, medium and long range and provide an unprecedented level of underwater situational awareness.

As naval forces contend with a growing array of threats and challenges, submarines remain one of their most strategically important assets. The four SSBNs in the French Navy’s Strategic Oceanic Force (Force Océanique Stratégique, FOST) are deployed to provide a permanent nuclear deterrent.

The DGA contract covers the design and development of the sonar suite for the third-generation SSBNs and the detailed design and deployment of the sonar suite for the second-generation vessels.

A set of disruptive technologies developed by Thales will ensure the acoustic superiority of France’s submarines in the years ahead. New large-format arrays housing multiple sensors will provide unparalleled levels of precision in their threat detection capabilities

The new sensors will generate significantly larger volumes of data than earlier systems. The ALICIA data processing system (Analyse, Localisation, Identification, Classification Intégrées et Alertes) will use advanced Big Data algorithms, with intuitive user interfaces to optimise operator workload and provide decision support.

“This new contract reflects the DGA’s continuing trust in Thales to support its highly strategic nuclear deterrence-related operations. The latest innovations developed by dedicated Thales engineers for the current and future generations of SSBNs will provide the French Navy with a comprehensive acoustic picture of the underwater environment to counter current and future threats, helping to consolidate its position as one of the world’s leading naval forces.”

Gwendoline Blandin-Roger, Vice President, Underwater Systems, Thales

SNLE 3G scale model during a tank test at DGA Techniques Hydrodynamiques

Naval News comments:

Thales’ ALICIA will combine a wide range of sensors into the SYCOBS 3.0 data processing system. These include large new flank array sonars, a new bow sonar and new towed sonar array known as ALRO (antenne linéaire remorquée à technologie optique). ALRO will use optical technology. The exact technology in the bow sonar has not been reported but Naval News believes that it will have moved beyond traditional cylindrical arrays. In a phone briefing held on July 10th, Gwendoline Blandin-Roger, Vice President, Underwater Systems at Thales, said the ALRO will be tested at sea in 2023 and 2024. She declined to comment on the technical details of the flank array and bow sonar. However the Thales executive added that the sonar suite will also include a new generation Mine & Obstacle Avoidance Sonar (MOAS).

ALICIA will be capable of Ultra-Low Frequency (ULF) detection meaning that even the quietest adversaries may be tracked and identified. “The challenge will be processing the massive amounts of data gathered by the new sensors. The data is expected to be an order of magnitude more than on current boats” the SNLE-3G Program Officer told Naval News in a February 2021 interview. However artificial intelligence will help the crew identify contacts, greatly aiding their work. This will help with both technical and tactical classification. The latter can be based on intelligence which usually leads to a decision from the submarine commander.

According to Thales, discussion on this program started back in 2017. The value of the contract will be between 300 million and 500 million Euros depending on final technical choices made by the DGA. The first ALICIA system (along with its associated new generation sonar arrays) is set to be fitted on a in-service Le Tromphant-class submarine (SNLE 2G) by the 2030ies.

The SNLE 3G program was officially launched on 19 February 2021. It covers the development studies until the end of 2025, the realization of the first elements of the hull and the boiler room of the first SNLE 3G, as well as the adaptation of the industrial manufacturing means of Naval Group for this program. The 2019-2025 Military Plan Law calls for the replacement of the four Le Triomphant-class SSBNs with four third generation SSBNs (SNLE 3G) beginning in 2035."
"Thales' new QLED-based IFE system wows, needs content to match - Runway Girl Network","Fri, 28 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMjMvMDcvdGhhbGVzLXFsZWQtaWZlLXN5c3RlbS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"French multinational company Thales last month brought its new ‘AVANT Up’ inflight entertainment system to the Aircraft Interiors Expo (AIX) in Hamburg, showcasing the system’s dynamic power management, 3D audio, and QLED screen, the latter based on Samsung technology.

Seen only in renderings by RGN before AIX, but already boasting a customer in the form of American Airlines, the quality of the technology and its ability to elevate the passenger experience was evident.

It starts with the screen, called Optiq, which uses QLED technology to display 4K high dynamic range (HDR) media on monitors ranging in size from 11” to 20”, depending on customer specification.

Developed in partnership with HARMAN, a Samsung company, Optiq’s proprietary QLED technology means higher brightness and a wider range of colour saturation, said Thales Avionics program director, development Gabriel de la Rivière, explaining: “that is why we can get HDR quality.”

Your author was very impressed by the screen, with cinematic releases like Batman showing in clear quality, with a high contrast ratio between darker and lighter shades. The QLED technology demonstrated depth and vividness in landscape scenes without excessive brightness, and HDR content was a joy to behold.

Of course, if airlines want to maximize the QLED experience, they will need to load media that will be able to utilize this capability. A common complaint about industry’s pivot to 4K for IFE screens is that there is still not enough 4K content being delivered to the airline market. But one thing is clear: embedded IFE stakeholders will be ready when that day arrives.

Each AVANT Up IFE system can connect two Bluetooth devices at once, which Thales believes will be used by passengers to connect both headsets and gaming controllers so that video games can be played in-flight. I made the most of the opportunity to take a gaming break, and used the Xbox controller to play a racing game via the system. The connection was flawless, and the screen was rich and fluid with no FPS (frames per second) loss. But the game itself was an arcade style racer with low-rent graphics that would not trouble an iPad to run.

De la Rivière explained:

Today, the [inflight] games are fairly simple, but the idea is to enable the airlines to work with gaming companies to provide better and better games.

Thales estimates that the processing power is equivalent to a modern-day tablet device.

For those wanting to use their own devices, the AVANT Up system boasts USB-C and USB-A ports, allowing up to 60 W of power. And it uses the firm’s Crystal Cabin Award-winning Pulse power management to dynamically support power consumption across a row without the need for bulky equipment under the seat.

Pulse is billed as being “highly efficient while being compact in size, providing a 30% weight reduction, lower heat dissipation and the ability to install Pulse between the seat beams”.

What was perhaps more surprising was the audio development that Thales presented alongside the screen. “To go with the improved picture quality, we want to offer the full cinematic experience,” said de la Rivière, noting that 3D audio is now compatible with AVANT Up. The system works with the sort of noise cancelling headsets you may expect in business class, as well as disposable earbuds.

In general, the 3D audio system provided a much richer sound depth, but also allowed for the movement of audio through a soundscape, somewhat akin to a multiplex cinema. Whilst the fidelity of the sound will still be somewhat dependent on the quality of the headphones, 3D audio ensures the best output.

The new AVANT Up system demonstrates a significant improvement over legacy IFE. Its sharp screen, fast device charging, and improved audio are a welcome addition.

The ability to use gaming controllers with the screen is novel, but the people likely to use this tech (gamers who will have a controller in their bag) are exactly the kind of people who will not tolerate outdated games on board.

The full benefits of AVANT Up, and indeed other new 4K IFE systems, will be realized when airlines can and do load more cinematic quality releases and modern games.

Thales enters app security market with $3.6B Imperva acquisition - TechCrunch,"Tue, 25 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaGNydW5jaC5jb20vMjAyMy8wNy8yNS90aGFsZXMtZW50ZXJzLWFwcC1zZWN1cml0eS1tYXJrZXQtd2l0aC0zLTZiLWltcGVydmEtYWNxdWlzaXRpb24v0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly90ZWNoY3J1bmNoLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA3LzI1L3RoYWxlcy1lbnRlcnMtYXBwLXNlY3VyaXR5LW1hcmtldC13aXRoLTMtNmItaW1wZXJ2YS1hY3F1aXNpdGlvbi9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"French aerospace and defense group Thales is procuring cybersecurity company Imperva from Thoma Bravo in a deal worth $3.6 billion.

The news comes four years after private equity giant Thoma Bravo acquired Imperva for $2.1 billion, taking the San Mateo-based company private eight years after it had gone public on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).

Founded in 2002, Imperva is a data and application security company with services spanning web application firewalls (WAFs), API security, DDoS protection, account takeover (ATO) protection, data activity monitoring (DAM) and more.

Thales has expended considerable resources in recent years bolstering its cybersecurity offerings through acquisitions. This includes a $5.5 billion deal in 2017 to procure Gemalto, a company offering digital identification and data protection for industries such as banking. And more recently it acquired both Excellium and and S21SEC, deals which closed last year. Thales is also in the process of acquiring Australian cybersecurity startup Tesserent, in a deal worth $176 million (AUD).

With Imperva under its wing, this signals Thales’ entry to the application security market specifically, while it’s also now expanding its existing footprint in the data security sphere.

“With this acquisition, we are seizing a unique opportunity to accelerate our cybersecurity capabilities and are taking an important step towards our ambition to build a world-class global cybersecurity integrated player, providing a comprehensive portfolio of products and services,” Thales CEO Patrice Caine said in a press release.

Thales said that with Imperva on board, its total cybersecurity business will generate north of €2.4 billion ($2.65 billion) in revenues, with Imperva contributing some $500 million itself.

Thales says it expects to close the deal by early 2024."
Thoma Bravo sells Imperva to Thales Group for $3.6B - TechTarget,"Tue, 25 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2h0YXJnZXQuY29tL3NlYXJjaHNlY3VyaXR5L25ld3MvMzY2NTQ1NjE2L1Rob21hLUJyYXZvLXNlbGxzLUltcGVydmEtdG8tVGhhbGVzLUdyb3VwLWZvci0zNkLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales Group has agreed to acquire Imperva Inc. from private equity firm Thoma Bravo for $3.6 billion with the goal of expanding its data and application security offerings.

The acquisition was announced Tuesday, four years after Thoma Bravo completed the purchase of Imperva for $2.1 billion. Thales will integrate Imperva's data and application security products that focus on DDoS and API defense into its current offerings to expand its role in the Digital Identity and Security (DIS) business.

The French technology conglomerate, which serves customers in more than 50 countries, said the Imperva acquisition will add around $500 million of revenue. Thales also said the acquisition will create a global cybersecurity portfolio that focuses on identity, data security and application security.

""In this growth context and subject to forthcoming social processes, Thales plans to regroup as of January 1, 2024 all its civil cyber activities (currently split between its Digital Identity and Security and Defense and Security operating segments) within DIS,"" Thales wrote in its press release.

With Imperva, Thales expects its DIS sales to grow organically between 6%-7% for the next four years, reaching approximately $6 billion by 2027. In addition to DIS, Thales is in several other markets, including defense and security, aerospace, space and transportation.

In the press release, Thales emphasized Imperva's focus on protecting critical applications, APIs, and data -- areas that have been under heightened scrutiny recently. For example, ransomware groups have been increasingly focusing on data exfiltration rather than encryption to pressure victim organizations into paying. Extortion threats are becoming more aggressive as those groups leak sensitive data, such as photos and videos, through public data leak sites. The shift in ransomware tactics is affecting enterprises as well as cyber insurance coverage.

Massive DDoS attacks, which is a core focus for Imperva's Web Application Firewall (WAF), are also on the rise. When Microsoft suffered layer 7 DDoS attack last month that caused significant disruptions across cloud services and applications, implementing Azure WAF was strongly recommended.

Sebastian Cano, senior vice president of cloud protection and licensing at Thales, said the company has observed an exponential growth of attacks happening at the API level. Another challenge for Thales, he said, involved customer data. While the Thales platform can encrypt customer data, the company didn't have visibility of that data.

""Very often customers come to us and say, 'I want you to protect this amount of data.' The usual follow up question for us is 'how much other data do you have that needs to be encrypted today?' Most of the time the answer we get is, 'We don't know.' Now with this capability from Imperva [Data Security platform], we have a constant view of all the data,"" Cano said. ""The more data we encrypt, the more money we make as a company.""

John Grady, an analyst with TechTarget's Enterprise Security Group, said the acquisition is an interesting move for Thales as Imperva is more widely known for its web and API security capabilities.

""That's going to be new to Thales versus data security, where they're obviously a big player. There may be some synergies with what Thales does around customer identity and Imperva's bot protection relative to account takeover and fraud. But I think the buyers for data security and app security have traditionally been different. A lot of Imperva's customer base bought one or the other, so there's some work to do to bring out any go-to-market synergies and get additional value,"" Grady said in an email to TechTarget Editorial.

As for Thoma Bravo, Grady said the sale is typical for the private equity firm. On the cybersecurity side, he's observed that Thoma Bravo tends to hold onto companies for 3 to 4 years before selling off. ""I don't think the sale is indicative of anything specific. They have been pretty acquisitive lately, so this obviously represents a good return and cash infusion to show their investors,"" he said.

Heidi Shey, principal analyst at Forrester, agreed that the biggest change for Thales focuses on application security since they were already a significant player in data security. The Imperva acquisition is Thales way of buying into applications security market, but Shey said integrating those products will take work.

""Imperva was also already working its way through bringing its other acquisitions in and had aggressive plans with its own products in application security and data security,"" Shey said in an email to TechTarget Editorial. ""They will need to stay focused to deliver on those plans for existing customers.""

The acquisition is expected to close at the beginning of 2024.

Thales today announced the release of the 2023 Thales Cloud Security Study, its annual assessment on the latest cloud security threats, trends and emerging risks based on a survey of nearly 3,000 IT and security professionals across 18 countries.

This year’s study found that more than a third (39%) of businesses have experienced a data breach in their cloud environment last year, an increase on the 35% reported in 2022. In addition, human error was reported as the leading cause of cloud data breaches by over half (55%) of those surveyed.

This comes as businesses reported a dramatic increase in the level of sensitive data stored in the cloud. Three quarters (75%) of businesses said that more than 40% of data stored in the cloud is classified as sensitive, compared to 49% of businesses this time last year.

More than a third (38%) ranked Software as a Service (SaaS) applications as the leading target for hackers, closely followed by cloud-based storage (36%). ​

Lack of Encryption and Key Control Causes Cloud Data Concerns

Despite the reported increase in sensitive data in the cloud, the study found low levels of encryption being used. Only a fifth (22%) of IT professionals reported that more than 60% of their sensitive data in the cloud is encrypted. According to the findings, on average, only 45% of cloud data is currently encrypted.

The study also found a lack of control over encryption keys by businesses, with only 14% of those surveyed stating that they controlled all of the keys to their encrypted data in their cloud environments. In addition, almost two thirds (62%) say they have five or more key management systems – creating increased complexity when securing sensitive data.

Multicloud Causing Operational Complexity

The adoption of multicloud continues to surge, with more than three quarters (79%) of organisations having more than one cloud provider.

Notably, it's not just infrastructure that is experiencing this growth. The use of SaaS apps is also on the rise significantly. In 2021, 16% of respondents reported their enterprises utilising 51-100 different SaaS applications, while in 2023 this percentage increased to 22%.

Despite the expansion of cloud usage, a significant challenge remains. More than half (55%) expressed that managing data in the cloud is more complex than in on-premises environments – up from 46% compared to the previous year. Digital sovereignty is also front of mind for respondents. Eighty three percent expressed concerns over data sovereignty, and 55% agreed that data privacy and compliance in the cloud has become more difficult.

Pathways to Better Cloud Security

Identity and access management (IAM) is a crucial measure in mitigating data breaches, emphasising the significance of strong security practices. Encouragingly, the adoption of robust multi-factor authentication (MFA) has risen to 65%, indicating progress in fortifying access controls.

Surprisingly, only 41% of organisations have implemented zero trust controls in their cloud infrastructure, and an even smaller percentage (38%) utilises such controls within their cloud networks. These statistics highlight the need for greater emphasis on adopting comprehensive security measures to effectively safeguard sensitive data and enhance overall cybersecurity resilience.

""The study shows that organisations are operating in a dynamic multicloud landscape, demanding seamless and efficient access to on-demand IT infrastructure and services,"" stated Sebastien Cano, Senior Vice President for Cloud Protection and Licensing activities at Thales.

“Treating cloud environments as an extension of existing infrastructure while maintaining exclusive control and security of data, especially sensitive data, is key to cloud security. Customer control of encryption keys is essential as it allows organisations to leverage the scalability, cost efficiency, and accessibility benefits of the cloud while ensuring the utmost integrity and confidentiality of their valuable information.”

Thales has been notified by the European Space Agency (ESA), on behalf of the European Union Agency for the Space Programme (EUSPA) and the European Union represented by the European Commission, of two major contracts for cybersecurity of Galileo Second Generation (G2G) programme.

Together, these contracts represent a total value of over 60 million euros (excluding options) and confirm the Group's key role in the cybersecurity of the second generation of the Galileo programme as Thales will be in charge of all elements of the security and resilience of G2G.

On 17 May 2023, Thales was awarded the contract for security monitoring on the G2G system infrastructure.

This award follows the cybersecurity specification and design contract for the Galileo Second Generation system, which was confirmed on 17 April 2023. It will significantly improve the performance of the second-generation Galileo system, with the introduction of new services, stronger resilience functionality, and future additional features for the PRS 1 navigation service for government users.

As a major partner of the EU Space Programme to ensure the security of the Galileo system, Thales, as a European leader in cybersecurity, has been working with the Agency for over 20 years to contribute to the security of the Galileo programme, Europe's largest satellite programme, providing sovereign and critical positioning, navigation, and timing services.

Europe’s largest satellite system security monitoring programme

As part of G2G IOV SECMON, Thales is leading the consortium, including the Italian group Leonardo, to expand the scope of security monitoring and include the new assets in the G2G system. It will also introduce automated incident response and network traffic monitoring. In addition, the solution will be capable of storing significant amounts of incident response data. To meet this challenge, Thales will deliver a solution built on a scalable, flexible architecture derived from its Cybels range of security supervision products and incorporating big data capabilities.

A cybersecurity contract for better protection from quantum threats

New threats from quantum computers capable of breaking existing cryptographic algorithms have the potential to compromise long-term data security. Thales has been tasked by ESA within the consortium it leads to draw on its world-renowned cryptography expertise.

Under the “G2G System Engineering and Technical Assistance for security and PRS” contract, Thales will specify and verify the new cybersecurity for the G2G system – taking into account new threats to space systems, security maintenance requirements, improvements to the PRS service for government users– and prepare for system certification. One of the major challenges is to ensure a smooth transition from G1G to G2G while maintaining the level of security and performance offered by the G1G system for member states.

“Thales thanks ESA, EUSPA and the European Commission for its continued confidence in the Group’s expertise in space systems and cybersecurity for critical systems. These security contracts for Galileo Second Generation will bring Europe a more robust system with better protection from quantum threats – a major challenge for the space industry in the decades ahead – and will draw on the Group’s unparalleled big data expertise to provide more effective security monitoring of the world’s leading satellite positioning system,” said Pierre-Yves Jolivet, VP Cyber Solutions, Thales.

The cybersecurity of satellite systems has become a growing concern for satellite operators and space agencies, particularly against a backdrop of geopolitical tensions. Today, thousands of satellites are in orbit, and it is estimated that 10,000 more will be added over the next 10 years, due to the multiplication of uses, from everyday life with the Internet of Things to defense applications.

Through the signing of these two contracts, Thales's expertise in scalable and flexible architecture and security equipment and protection against cyberattacks will enable the G2G program to strengthen its ability to detect and respond to new cyberthreats. The end-to-end solution proposed by Thales experts will contribute to the development of greater security and resilience of satellites.

In parallel, Thales Alenia Space has been notified of major contracts to design and build with its European consortium the G2G Ground Mission Segment and execute System Engineering Activities. The company will also provide 6 of the 12 satellites of the constellation.

Their mission: to inspire children to learn more about space travel and life on the red planet.

The workshop’s hands-on approach showed students just how exciting and diverse a career in science, technology, and engineering can be, as they worked collaboratively and engaged in scientific thinking to design experiments to be flown on the high-altitude MARSBalloon. Experiments that tested the students’ ideas for technologies that could one day be destined for Mars.

Andy Green, the school’s Head Teacher, said,

“The very nature of space means there’s so many wonderful big questions and children are naturally curious, so when we engage our young children with scientific subjects we’re almost future-proofing them. This will be one of the days that, when they’re older, they’ll look back on with big smiles”.

At the end of June, Thales Alenia Space launched over 200 experiments to 30km above sea level – more than twice the cruising height of commercial airliners – where they experienced conditions very similar to Mars’ surface including -50°C temperatures, pressures 1/100 less than on Earth, and double our planet’s ultraviolet radiation. The balloon then burst, and after descending to Earth via parachute, the experiments were collected and will be returned to schools for students to analyse the results.

Under the “G2G System Engineering and Technical Assistance for security and PRS” contract, Thales will specify and verify the new cybersecurity for the G2G system – taking into account new threats to space systems, security maintenance requirements, improvements to the PRS service for government users– and prepare for system certification. One of the major challenges is to ensure a smooth transition from G1G to G2G while maintaining the level of security and performance offered by the G1G system for member states.

The cybersecurity of satellite systems has become a growing concern for satellite operators and space agencies, particularly against a backdrop of geopolitical tensions. Today, thousands of satellites are on-orbit, and it is estimated that 10,000 more will be added over the next 10 years, due to the multiplication of uses, from everyday life with the Internet of Things (IoT) to defense applications.

Through the signing of these two contracts, Thales’s expertise in scalable and flexible architecture and security equipment and protection against cyberattacks will enable the G2G program to strengthen its ability to detect and respond to new cyberthreats. The end-to-end solution proposed by Thales experts will contribute to the development of greater security and resilience of satellites.

In parallel, Thales Alenia Space has been notified of major contracts to design and build with its European consortium the G2G Ground Mission Segment and execute System Engineering Activities. The company will also provide 6 of the 12 satellites of the constellation.

Thales is involved at every level of the cyber value chain, offering solutions ranging from risk assessment to protection of critical infrastructure, supported by comprehensive threat detection and response capabilities. Its offer is built around three families of cybersecurity products and services, which generated sales of 1.5 billion euros in 2022:

Global security products around the CipherTrust Data Security Platform the SafeNet Trusted Access Identity & Access Management as a service solution, and the broader cloud protection & licensing offerings

Sovereign protection products including encryptors and sensors to protect critical information systems

Cybels solutions portfolio, a complete suite of cybersecurity services including risk assessment, training and simulation, and cyberattack detection and response

Drawing on more than 40 years of experience in cybersecurity and space activities, Thales applies the principles of “cybersecurity by design” to the products it develops for satellite operators and space agencies. With more than 4,000 cybersecurity specialists, Thales helps to ensure the security of satellite systems for national and European space programs – in particular Europe’s Galileo satellite navigation program – and at the international level.

With its combined expertise in cutting-edge satellite systems and cybersecurity solutions relying on the latest military technologies, Thales offers governments, institutions and enterprise customers a comprehensive range of cybersecurity solutions to guarantee robust protection of all the elements of a space system. In April 2023, Thales demonstrated its expertise in offensive security at CYSAT, managing to take remote control of an ESA demonstration satellite, in order to anticipate and respond to current and future threats.

“Thales thanks ESA, EUSPA and the European Commission for its continued confidence in the Group’s expertise in space systems and cybersecurity for critical systems. These security contracts for Galileo Second Generation will bring Europe a more robust system with better protection from quantum threats – a major challenge for the space industry in the decades ahead – and will draw on the Group’s unparalleled big data expertise to provide more effective security monitoring of the world’s leading satellite positioning system.” — Pierre-Yves Jolivet, VP Cyber Solutions, Thales."

MARSBalloon reaches new heights - Thales,"Thu, 27 Jul 2023 12:54:32 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi9tYXJzYmFsbG9vbi1yZWFjaGVzLW5ldy1oZWlnaHRz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Project receives record number of student-designed experiments that could one day be destined for Mars

MARSBalloon, run by Thales Alenia Space, aims to spark students’ curiosity to learn more about the world around them and beyond. Celebrating its tenth launch, 2023 MARSBalloon flew over 200 student-designed experiments from 81 schools across the UK – the highest number ever received.

Earlier in the year, school-aged children from primary schools, secondary schools, and youth groups, were invited to send their experiments, fitted inside a small egg shaped capsule, to Thales Alenia Space to test technologies that future Martian explorers might one day need on the Red Planet.

At the end of June, Thales Alenia Space engineers took these experiments to the Mendip Hills, ready for flight on MARSBalloon, a high altitude balloon that travelled to 30km, more than twice the height of commercial airliners. Along the way, the experiments experienced conditions similar to the surface of Mars with temperatures of -50°C and pressures 1/100 to that on Earth – inspiring students to think about what tools and technologies might be needed for life off Earth on a future Martian base.

The flight, which lasted over two hours before the balloon burst and returned to Earth, was carefully tracked the Thales Alenia Space’ MarsBalloon team who safely recovered the experiments on landing to return to the students for analysis.

MARSBalloon Project Manager, Drashti Shah, said of the launch

“The launch went perfectly – launching on time with a record number of experiments, and the balloon landed safely with all the experiments surviving their trip to the stratosphere.”

“Space engineering is a thriving sector in the UK, and we’re always on the lookout for new talented engineers to join our growing company. Yet, nationally, we are facing a shortage of engineers to employ.”

“Thales Alenia Space is committed to encouraging young people to continue studying STEM subjects. Programmes like MARSBalloon are so important in that endeavour, as it helps bring real world science into the classroom.”

Some of the experiments flown included LEDs (light emitting diode) attached to batteries to test how they responded to Martian conditions, and bubble-wrap, to see if it would be effective at protecting instruments in the different pressures.

The project is open to any school or youth group in the UK. There is no cost to take part in the project other than that of the experiment materials and postage.

Drashti Shah added, “We certainly took advantage of the wealth of talent within Thales Alenia Space to find a small window to launch MARSBalloon, dealing with particularly challenging weather conditions for this time of year.”

The experiments have been sent back to schools to complete their analysis. Thales Alenia Space will also be picking some standout experiments across various categories – including engineer’s choice awards and best decorated. Winners will be announced in the coming weeks.

They found their solution from Thales in Paris.

Thales will provide their third-generation IESI Airbus' H135, H145, H160 dual and H175 helicopter. Progressive entry into service will begin in 2026.

On a helicopter, the IESI must be able to withstand high levels of vibration and electromagnetic interference as well as offer the pilot optimal readability in all circumstances, especially when using night vision goggles. In a single piece of equipment, the IESI incorporates pressure probes and sensors, accelerometers and gyrometers, which form an artificial horizon, as well as an LCD display, and provides the pilot with the vital speed, altitude and attitude information needed for safe flying. The third-generation IESI from Thales also offers enhanced reliability and a smaller environmental footprint, thanks to 25% lower weight and 33% lower power consumption compared to the first generation.

The first IESI will enter service in 2027 on the Guépard joint light helicopter, the military version of the H160; it will follow the entry into service of the IESI on the Airbus H135, H145, H160 civil and H175 helicopters, scheduled for early 2026.

“The Thales teams are delighted to have been selected by Airbus Helicopters. Tens of thousands of pilots around the world rely every day and in all circumstances on this safety-critical equipment, which our engineers were first to invent and which has again today demonstrated its importance,” Jean-Paul Ebanga, Vice President, flight avionics, Thales, says."

In 2022, Paris-based Thales acquired two European cybersecurity companies, S21sec and Excellium, for €120 million (about $130 million), from Sonae Investment Management. In a deal that closed in 2019, Thales acquired digital security company Gemalto for about $5.5 billion.

Imperva, headquartered in San Mateo, California, has about 1,400 employees worldwide and had revenues of $500 million in 2022, according to the news release. It was founded in Israel in 2002, went public on the New York Stock Exchange in 2011, and was acquired by Thoma Bravo in 2019 for $2.1 billion.

Thales said that after adding Imperva, its cybersecurity portfolio will emphasize three areas: identity management, data security and application security.

The Imperva acquisition is one of the larger cyber-oriented deals this year.

Private equity firm TPG announced earlier this month that it was acquiring the government services unit of cybersecurity company Forcepoint for about $2.4 billion.

Vista Equity Partners, another investment firm, completed a deal for security and training company KnowBe4 in February."

“FMV has chosen the long-range SMART-L MM/F radar as a major component of the sensor chain program, and with this contract, Thales will play an important role in contributing to Sweden’s national airspace sovereignty.”

The SMART-L Multi-Mission (MM/F) radar is equipped with advanced high-end techniques, resulting in long-range performance of up to 2000 km. It’s digital architecture and AESA antenna enable easy upgradability and ensure readiness for future enhancements throughout its lifespan.

This radar system will provide Sweden with robust surveillance capabilities, enabling the country to address emerging challenges in the evolving air and space domains.

The agreement between FMV and Thales marks a step forward in strengthening Sweden’s defence capabilities. The SMART-L MM/F radars will play a role in maintaining airspace sovereignty, ensuring a comprehensive RAP, and enhancing the overall security and situational awareness of the Swedish Armed Forces.

Tristan Sauer, an aerospace, defence, and security analyst at GlobalData, provided his commentary on the deal: “The purchase of Thales’ SMART-L radars by the FMV reflects the nation’s commitment to contributing to the NATO air and missile defence network upon eventual accession.

The growing belligerence of the Russian state and the uniquely indiscriminate nature of their strategic bombing campaign in Ukraine has raised concerns about air defence capabilities within the Swedish government.”

Thales recorded a 9.4% growth in sales in Q1 2023. The French-based defence and security company attributed this growth to strong dynamics and mature markets in different regions, especially Europe and North America."

The CNRS International – NTU – Thales Research Alliance (CINTRA) laboratory is renewed for its fourth tenure, entering its 15th year of strong partnership between CNRS, NTU and Thales since its inception in 2009.



The lab works on research in the field of carbon-based materials, nanostructures and nano-photonics, leveraging the strengths of each partner to develop solutions from Singapore, serving the needs of the scientific and technical communities.



The extension of the lab is testament to Thales’ commitment to continuous upstream Research & Development (R&D) beyond its headquarters, driven by Singapore’s strategic importance for the Thales Group.

With one of the highest R&D expenditures in the region, Singapore is a leading regional hub for upstream research. Thales has long aligned with that ambition, with one of five R&D centres for the Group located in the country, testament to the Group’s strong commitment to research and technology.

The CINTRA lab was established in October 2009, with the three parties (NTU, CNRS and Thales) inaugurating the lab in the presence of Singapore’s then Minister of Education and Second Minister for Defence Dr Ng Eng Hen (currently Singapore’s Defence Minister) and France’s then Minister for Higher Education and Research, Mrs Valerie Pécresse.

The partnership began through mutual interests in fundamental sciences, including in modelling and simulation; materials synthesis and characterisation and domain knowledge. Over the years the lab rides on the crest of new waves of materials discoveries and has metamorphosed towards a strong fundamental understanding and application-based research of 2D materials and metamaterials, as well as Artificial Intelligence (AI) for materials design. Physically situated at the NTU campus, this fourth tenure of the lab highlights the strategic importance of Singapore for upstream research for the Thales Group.

In this renewed partnership, Thales will be focusing on strengthening capabilities through four main application areas on how research outcomes can be used for energy, sensors, acoustic and microwave devices and nano-photonic circuits.

To develop the Smart materials required in this disruptive age of technology, Thales relies heavily on cooperation between research teams and the academic world. The continued partnership with NTU and CNRS offers a platform for innovation and knowledge sharing and attracting talented science graduates to build on acquired expertise. The diversity in research teams have brought to this partnership well-rounded and unbiased research studies while cross-disciplinary pollination has also sprung forward new discoveries.

“The CINTRA lab is one of our early examples of upstream research collaboration in Singapore, back when the country was enhancing its reputation as a leading R&D hub in the region. I am proud that this spirit of co-designing and prototyping continues with the extended tenure of the lab, working together with our esteemed partners CNRS and NTU. The established credentials of CINTRA demonstrate Thales’ influence within the scientific and technical communities, and is especially significant as Thales celebrates its 50th year of presence in Singapore this year.”

Pam Murphy, CEO, Imperva (Image: Imperva)

Thales has agreed to purchase Imperva for $3.6 billion to enter the application and API security market and expand its footprint in data security.

See Also: Forrester Consulting Study: The Total Economic Impact™ Of Guardicore, An Akamai Technologies Company

The Paris-based conglomerate said its proposed acquisition of Silicon Valley-based Imperva will round out Thales' security portfolio by adding a robust web application firewall along with capabilities in API protection, data discovery and classification, data security governance and data access monitoring. The deal will create a $2.66 billion cyber behemoth as well as $110 million in cost and revenue synergies (see: Imperva CEO on Maximizing Visibility Into Unstructured Data).

""The acquisition of Imperva marks a major milestone in Thales' cybersecurity strategy,"" Thales Chairman and CEO Patrice Caine said in a statement. ""With this acquisition, we are seizing a unique opportunity to accelerate our cybersecurity capabilities and are taking an important step towards our ambition to build a world-class global cybersecurity integrated player, providing a comprehensive portfolio of products.""

The transaction is expected to close in early 2024 and will add nearly $500 million of security revenue to Thales' line card. Thales' stock was down $2.10 - or 1.44% - to $144.28 in trading Tuesday. The acquisition is expected to generate $50 million of cost synergies and $60 million of revenue synergies and will drive organic sales growth of 6% to 7% and a 16.5% EBIT margin in Thales' digital identity and security practice.

What Thales and Imperva Bring to the Table

Thoma Bravo took Imperva private for $2.1 billion in January 2019 following more than eight years as a publicly traded company and named longtime Infor COO Pam Murphy as its next CEO in January 2020. Imperva has been acquisitive under Thoma Bravo's ownership, buying API security vendor CloudVector in 2021, database security startup JSonar in 2020 and bot management vendor Distil Networks in 2019 (see: APIs Are the New Battleground in Cybersecurity).

""Over the course of our more than four years of partnership, Imperva further differentiated itself in the competitive cybersecurity market,"" said Thoma Bravo Managing Partner Seth Boro. ""We are proud of what we built through our partnership with Pam Murphy and the Imperva team, and look forward to watching the company's continued success as part of Thales' innovative and diverse security portfolio.""

The joint security portfolio will unite Thales' strength in identity, Imperva's strength around application security and capabilities from both companies in data security, where Thales focuses on data in motion and Imperva protects data at rest and in use. Imperva will be part of Thales' security products business, which today includes data security, identity and access management, and cloud defense and licensing.

Gartner named Imperva a leader in cloud web application and API protection in August 2022 alongside Akamai and Cloudflare and praised the company for its product maturity, event analytics, account takeover detection and application security portfolio. In April, Forrester named Imperva a strong performer and Thales a contender in data security, praising Imperva's progress and Thales' focus on encryption.

""Today's announcement represents an exciting new chapter for Imperva, one that will further our mission to help organizations protect data and all paths to it,"" said Imperva CEO Pam Murphy. ""We admire Thales' vision and culture, and believe that, together, we can deliver greater product innovation and efficiency through disruptive solutions, while helping to simplify the greatest security challenges.""

How Thales Built a Cybersecurity Behemoth

Thales significantly expanded its presence in the cybersecurity, IoT and payments markets through its $5.63 billion acquisition of Gemalto in April 2019. In 2022, it purchased CIAM provider OneWelcome for $101.6 million and also bought European cyber services vendors S21sec and Excellium. The company last month agreed to buy Tesserent for $119.1 million to expand its cyber services capabilities in Oceania (see: Thales to Buy Tesserent for $119.1M to Aid Australian Growth).

Reuters and Bloomberg reported in February 2022 that Thales was putting together a plan to buy Atos' $1.41 billion cybersecurity business in a deal that would have had private equity firms such as Bain Capital picking up the parts of the beleaguered IT services giant that Thales wasn't interested in owning. But no deal was ever consummated.

""We are seizing a unique opportunity to accelerate our cybersecurity capabilities.""

– Patrice Caine, Chairman and CEO, Thales

Application security contributed just over 60% to Imperva's 2022 topline revenue of $496 million, and data security made up the remaining 39%. Nearly 60% of the company's 2022 revenue came from the Americas, and APAC and EMEA contributed 22% and 20%, respectively. Imperva employs 1,400 people and serves 35% of the Fortune 100; it has strength across financial services, telecom, energy and health.

In 2024, Thales' digital identity and security business will generate two-thirds of its revenue from data security, application security and identity and access management products, including the Imperva portfolio. Remaining sales will come from services in areas such as training and simulation and threat and risk evaluation as well as defense tools such as high-grade encryption and unidirectional security gateways.

Cybersecurity products and services will represent 44% of Thales' digital identity and security sales next year. Twenty-seven percent of revenue will come from banking and payments, 16% will come from biometrics and 13% will come from mobile connectivity. The combined cybersecurity business will have 11 Security Operations Centers on four continents as well as 8,000 employees, of which 5,800 are cybersecurity experts.

Thales expects to achieve $50 million of annualized cost synergies from the proposed Imperva deal by reducing its real estate needs, cutting procurement costs and slashing sales, general and administrative spending. The firm expects to spend $30 million on the Imperva integration between 2024 and 2026."

AeroComms is “a leading supplier of airborne avionics systems in the areas of satellite communications, audio/radio management, antennas, lights, clocks and human-machine interfaces,” according to Thales.

With approximately 690 employees, the company has established its presence internationally, operating in France, South Africa, the United States, Canada, and Denmark. AeroComms is expected to generate approximately $200 million in revenue in 2023.

Through this acquisition, Thales aims to complement its avionics offerings and add cockpit security communication solutions to its portfolio.

“This acquisition will bring together the expertise of Cobham Aerospace Communications’ aerospace communication experts with our own avionics experts,” said Yannick Assouad, Deputy CEO of Avionics Activities at Thales. “Thales will be positioned at the heart of the technological revolution in the aviation market, ensuring a more sustainable future for the industry.”

Thales plans to strategically position itself and capitalize on the market shift towards connected cockpits by incorporating AeroComms’ range of cockpit safety communication systems into its portfolio.

In May 2022, Airbus selected Thales to equip its commercial airliners a new flight management system or FMS based on its PureFlyt product. PureFlyt offers a direct link to air traffic systems and cloud-based connectivity. Additionally, it utilizes an algorithm that consistently proposes the most advantageous alterations to the flight path for pilots by conducting searches on air traffic, weather conditions, and other relevant flight environment data through its built-in connection to external systems.

In June 2022, Thales was selected by the European Commission to serve as the coordinator for the EPIIC project (Enhanced Pilot Interfaces & Interactions for Fighters Cockpit). In this three-year study funded with €75 million from the European Defence Fund, the focus is set on developing technological solutions that will enhance the situational awareness of strategic pilots. The ultimate goal is to enable rapid decision-making even in the most intricate and challenging situations they may encounter.

“The need to accelerate the OODA loop – Observe, Orient, Decide, Act – and to act with complete discretion, will lead the pilot to become a true strategist, capable of managing the resources at their disposal and of replanning the phases of their mission in flight to ensure its success,” Thales explained at the time.

Thales is also participating in two pillars of the Future Combat Air System or FCAS program, which regroups companies from France, Germany, and Spain: the Combat Cloud (CC) and the Sensors subprograms.

The development of collaborative combat involving a tandem of manned and unmanned aircraft is a key aspect of future aerial warfare, with the sixth generation of fighter jets being built within a “system of systems.”

As the integration of unmanned aircraft and other platforms expands, pilots will need to efficiently allocate and utilize resources to ensure optimal mission performance. In this context, effective resource management will become increasingly vital for pilots."

The deal is “an important step towards our ambition to build a world-class global cybersecurity integrated player”, said Thales CEO Patrice Caine.

Imperva, with 1,400 employees and ~$500 million in annual revenues, is what Gartner describes as a “cloud web application and API protection platform (WAAP).” Despite being a category leader, it has – the most recent Magic Quadrant reflects – suffered from executive churn in recent years that has caused some “adverse impact on Imperva’s roadmap execution.”

It has also underwhelmed versus competitors vis-a-vis its modest distributed infrastructure and faced criticism over its “late support for TLS 1.3 and lack of SSO for back-end applications, and… certificate management,"" as the 2022 WAAP Magic Quadrant puts it.

Both employees and customers will be looking for investment and consistency from its deep-pocketed new owners to resolve such criticisms.

The deal meanwhile represents a healthy exit for private equity behemoth Thoma Bravo, which bought Imperva for $2.1 billion cash in 2018.

It is also the latest indicator that consolidation opportunities are emerging in the crowded cybersecurity space as valuations begin to fall after years of froth. (Other recent deals include HPE’s move for Axis Security; Mastercard’s acquisition of Baffin Bay; and Cisco’s bid for Lightspin Technologies – all blue chips moving for cloud security specialists.)

Thales said it sees $110 million of synergies and the significant growth of its “addressable market in an already fast-growing sector” from the deal.

Thales on July 21 reported first half sales of €8.7 billion, up 5.6% year-on-year. Its digital identity and security segment includes Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) for financial services; cryptographic key management for cloud services run as a managed service, and more.

The three industry partners in the EBMR temporary consortium are meeting their contractual targets on the programme, which involves the delivery of a total of 1,872 Griffons and 300 Jaguars.

Manufactured and assembled by Nexter

Nexter, a KNDS company, is building the armoured aluminium body, outfitting the vehicle’s interior and manufacturing the turret for the Jaguar at the Roanne site. Its high-precision machining and robotic welding processes ensure that the welded aluminium structure of both the Griffon and the Jaguar provide the best possible level of protection for military personnel. Nexter is also manufacturing the Jaguar’s 40 mm cannon and its telescoped munitions at its Bourges and La Chapelle Saint-Ursin facilities.

Other Nexter sites and subsidiaries are supplying vehicle equipment including CBRN protection systems made by NBC-Sys at Saint-Chamond, onboard electronics and computers manufactured in Toulouse, and vision systems produced by OPT-Sys in Saint-Etienne. Nexter also has responsibility for final assembly and integration of all these components, and those provided by Arquus and Thales, into the vehicles.

Ground mobility expertise from Arquus

Arquus is responsible for the design and manufacture of the complete powertrains for the Griffon and Jaguar vehicles, including the engine, the gearbox, the running gear and all the other parts and components that ensure the mobility of the vehicles.

These mobility kits are manufactured at the Arquus site in Limoges, the company’s centre of excellence for new vehicle production, and then shipped to Nexter in Roanne for integration into the vehicles.

The engines for the vehicles are built at the Arquus site in Marolles-en-Hurepoix, the company’s centre of excellence for engine militarisation. A team of some twenty specialists from Arquus are working alongside their partners in Roanne on a permanent basis to provide technical expertise and quality assurance for all powertrain parts and components.

Also at its Marolles-en-Hurepoix site, Arquus is manufacturing the T1, T2 and T3 remotely operated turrets, which are common components of the Scorpion programme and equip both the Griffon and the Jaguar, but also the Serval (VBMR-L) light multi-role armoured vehicle.

Vehicle interconnection by Thales

Thales is providing the vehicle vetronics and data systems required to deploy the vehicles as a network and conduct collaborative engagements. This includes the common Scorpion vetronics, onboard sensors, secure communication systems and self-protection systems incorporating collaborative combat algorithms.

Thales is also responsible for the radars and sensor payload for the artillery observation vehicle (VOA).

This onboard computing architecture interconnects all the navigation, protection, observation and communication systems to give deployed units a decisive advantage in the theatre of operations by expanding their intelligence and response capabilities.

France's Thales to buy Imperva in $3.6 billion cybersecurity deal - Yahoo Singapore News,"Tue, 25 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vc2cubmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vZnJlbmNoLWNvbXBhbnktdGhhbGVzLWJ1eS11cy0wNTE4MjA4MTkuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Visit at the Thales radar factory in Limours

By Tim Hepher and Mathieu Rosemain

PARIS (Reuters) - France's Thales said on Tuesday it would buy U.S. cybersecurity company Imperva in a deal worth $3.6 billion as it steps up expansion outside its historic defence business in the war against bots and hackers.

Thales' move signals the group is ready to spend large sums to beef up its digital identity and security (DIS) division and take market share in the United States, where Imperva serves some of the biggest companies.

Thales said the price of the acquisition from buyout firm Thoma Bravo implied an enterprise value of 17 times 2024 operating earnings forecasts.

""It's a significant amount,"" said Nicolas Arpagian, vice-president at cyberconsulting firm HeadMind Partners, adding it was unusual to see a large French corporation buy such an asset from a private equity firm.

""Now, there's the whole question of integration: software is a living product, you need well-trained people to steer it, drive it and constantly adapt it.""

Shares in Europe's largest defence electronics provider, which also makes civil aircraft parts and digital security systems, fell almost 2% in early trading and were down by 0.4% at 1035 GMT.

Thales said buying Imperva would generate around $110 million of pretax synergies, including $50 million of cost savings and $60 million linked to revenue opportunities.

The combined business would have proforma revenues of 4.5 billion euros in 2024, rising to 5.4-5.5 billion in 2027.

Thales defended the purchase price, saying it was paying 6.1 times sales for a business that Thoma Bravo had bought at a multiple of five times while in the meantime making it profitable.

Those valuations had more recently been closer to 7-8 times sales after soaring as high as 18-20 times during a market bubble at the end of last decade.

""We are very comfortable with the level of valuation that we put on the table,"" CEO Patrice Caine told reporters.

Story continues

""This really changes our scale in civil cybersecurity,"" he told analysts.

Cyberattacks have become the top worry for global corporate executives, according to a recent survey by PwC. France last year opened a dedicated campus outside Paris to tackle hacking.

Thales said the deal would deliver a medium-term boost to its earnings per share and add close to $500 million in revenue.

Talks with Thoma Bravo, which has built a large portfolio of cybersecurity assets, started in the first quarter and accelerated over the last three months, two sources close to the matter said.

The acquisition is Thales' biggest since it bought digital identity company Gemalto in 2019 for $5.6 billion.

Thales said the deal would close in 2024 subject to approvals, and did not anticipate significant hurdles.

Morgan Stanley and Centerview Partners acted as financial advisers to Thales.

A European project to use clean solar power from space to meet energy requirements down on Earth - Space Ref,"Mon, 24 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3NwYWNlcmVmLmNvbS9uZXdzcGFjZS1hbmQtdGVjaC9hLWV1cm9wZWFuLXByb2plY3QtdG8tdXNlLWNsZWFuLXNvbGFyLXBvd2VyLWZyb20tc3BhY2UtdG8tbWVldC1lbmVyZ3ktcmVxdWlyZW1lbnRzLWRvd24tb24tZWFydGgv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Space Based Solar Power Thales

Thales Alenia Space, the joint company between Thales (67%) and Leonardo (33%), has been chosen by the European Space Agency (ESA) to conduct a feasibility study for the SOLARIS initiative, which will determine the viability of a project to provide clean energy from spaceborne solar power plants to meet requirements down on Earth.

Europe is targeting net zero emissions from greenhouse gases by 2050. To achieve this ambitious goal, Europe’s energy industry has to call on renewable, controllable and affordable energy sources, available worldwide. Solar energy from space is a promising solution to meet this need.

Thales Alenia Space is leading a consortium to come up with an ambitious solution for Europe: “harvesting” solar energy in orbit, where it’s available without having to worry about the weather or nighttime, then send it back down to Earth. The SOLARIS studies should allow Europe to make an informed decision by 2025 on whether or not to embark on a development program for the commercialization of space-based solar energy, with an initial objective of designing a small-scale in-orbit demonstrator.

SOLARIS was supported at ESA’s Ministerial Council in November 2022, with the aim of making Europe a key player, and possibly a leader, in the international race to develop clean and sustainable energy solutions to attenuate human-caused global warming. Thales Alenia Space will lead this feasibility study, which aims to develop new concepts for a system to provide solar energy from space, with enabling technologies including high-efficiency space solar panels, wireless power transmission and robotized assembly in orbit. These studies will guide the follow-on research & development activities.

The space solar power concept complements renewable energy sources on Earth, rather than competing with them, because solar power from space is available 24/7, thus ensuring electrical supply continuity without the need for significant storage systems.

The European consortium handling these studies offers a wide array of complementary areas of expertise, spanning orbital systems (Thales Alenia Space), aviation (Dassault Aviation), strategic consulting (Arthur D. Little) and above all energy (Engie, ENEL, Air Liquide), clearly illustrating the project’s strong potential for the global energy industry.

Thales to provide new-generation sonar suite for France’s nuclear-powered ballistic-missile submarines (SSBNs) - EDR Magazine,"Tue, 11 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lZHJtYWdhemluZS5ldS90aGFsZXMtdG8tcHJvdmlkZS1uZXctZ2VuZXJhdGlvbi1zb25hci1zdWl0ZS1mb3ItZnJhbmNlcy1udWNsZWFyLXBvd2VyZWQtYmFsbGlzdGljLW1pc3NpbGUtc3VibWFyaW5lcy1zc2Juc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales has been awarded a contract by the French defence procurement agency (DGA) to develop a new sonar suite for France’s third-generation nuclear-powered ballistic-missile submarines (SNLE 3G) and the programme to modernise its second-generation submarines (SNLE 2G).

This new-generation sonar suite will feature a range of disruptive technologies, with large arrays housing a multitude of high-performance sensors supported by powerful Big Data algorithms. The new sonar suite will provide a comprehensive picture of the underwater acoustic environment to thwart increasingly silent threats for decades to come.

Thales is a world leader in the underwater systems market, equipping more than 50 submarines of various types — SSBNs, SSNs and conventionally powered attack submarines — in service today.

The French Ministry of the Armed Forces has once again placed its trust in Thales to maintain the French Navy’s operational superiority in underwater detection capabilities. The sonar suite developed by Thales will detect, locate and classify all types of threats at short, medium and long range and provide an unprecedented level of underwater situational awareness.

As naval forces contend with a growing array of threats and challenges, submarines remain one of their most strategically important assets. The four SSBNs in the French Navy’s Strategic Oceanic Force (Force Océanique Stratégique, FOST) are deployed to provide a permanent nuclear deterrent.

The DGA contract covers the design and development of the sonar suite for the third-generation SSBNs and the detailed design and deployment of the sonar suite for the second-generation vessels.

A set of disruptive technologies developed by Thales will ensure the acoustic superiority of France’s submarines in the years ahead. New large-format arrays housing multiple sensors will provide unparalleled levels of precision in their threat detection capabilities.

The new sensors will generate significantly larger volumes of data than earlier systems. The ALICIA data processing system (Analyse, Localisation, Identification, Classification Intégrées et Alertes) will use advanced Big Data algorithms, with intuitive user interfaces to optimise operator workload and provide decision support.

“This new contract reflects the DGA’s continuing trust in Thales to support its highly strategic nuclear deterrence-related operations. The latest innovations developed by dedicated Thales engineers for the current and future generations of SSBNs will provide the French Navy with a comprehensive acoustic picture of the underwater environment to counter current and future threats, helping to consolidate its position as one of the world’s leading naval forces.” Gwendoline Blandin-Roger, Vice President, Underwater Systems, Thales.

Sweden partners with Thales for a special SMART-L long-range radar - Defense Brief,"Fri, 07 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vZGVmYnJpZWYuY29tLzIwMjMvMDcvMDcvc3dlZGVuLXBhcnRuZXJzLXdpdGgtdGhhbGVzLWZvci1hLXNwZWNpYWwtc21hcnQtbC1sb25nLXJhbmdlLXJhZGFyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Swedish Defense Materiel Administration (FMV) announced their partnership with Thales for land-based SMART-L Multi-Mission Fixed (MM/F) long-range radars, to become part of the Swedish integrated air and missile defense.

Specifically, extensive radar systems are employed to encompass expansive regions. The substantial coverage capacity enables the system to enhance the overall understanding of the aerial conditions. The approximate investment that Sweden will make for this system is $91.5 million.

Referred to as SMART – L, this ground-based system possesses the capability to detect ballistic missiles and provide valuable insights into the space situation picture, stated Swedish MoD.

“Measuring ballistic missiles is a new, long-awaited capability, which will now become part of the Swedish integrated air and missile defense. The ballistic missile function will also help send data to the Patriot system, to improve its ability to combat such threats,” says Mattias Alfredsson, FMV New Sensor Systems project manager.

Sweden aims to improve its capability to detect ballistic missiles and potentially adopt the SMART-L radar system, similar to the Netherlands.

This involves, among other things, information exchange and exploring opportunities to harmonize technical requirements and contractual terms for future procurements, opportunities to harmonize maintenance agreements and system development, and opportunities to coordinate and optimize industrial cooperation between two countries.

The SMART-L MM/F radar, already in use on land and sea, offers long-range detection with a range of up to 2,000km.

Thales is scheduled to deliver the first system to the FMV in 2025, followed by deployment to the Swedish Armed Forces in 2026. Later on, there will be continuous delivery to the Armed Forces until 2028."

French naval plans

The four SSBNs in the French Navy’s Strategic Oceanic Force are deployed to provide a permanent nuclear deterrent.

GlobalData intelligence tells us that the Paris-based shipbuilding company, Naval Group, manufactured all 12 of France’s submarines in active service. The country’s four Triomphant-class SSBNs – two 3G and two 2G units – were procured between 1997 and 2010, which explains the need for new regenerative upgrades with the latest disruptive technologies.

It is notable that the DGA contracted Thales for its advanced sonar suite, the contractor is a change from its reliance on Naval Group. While Thales is a French defence company with its support for the French Armed Forces in the past, the company has extended its European consuemr base as countries across the continent are rushing to mobilise in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and the US-China rivalry in the Indo-Pacific.

Italy’s navy has provided an “integrated services centre” for Thales to manufacture sonar technologies for submarines in its La Speiza naval base on the Ligurian Sea. Specifically, this centre provides maintenance of sonars installed on minesweepers and frigates. The minehunters, operating out of La Speiza, forms the core of the navy’s current domestic mine countermeasures activities.

France is famously guarded when it comes to interoperability and information-sharing. Although Italy is a very close EU and Nato ally, it still remains uncharacteristic.

However, as the Nato Vilnius summit begins on 11 July, this announcement of information-sharing comes at an opportune time for France, as we can expect the summit to increase this interoperability and common military information and technologies."
A Server in the Sky - Examining Thales Onboard Data Center - Economy Class & Beyond - Kevin Marshall,"Mon, 03 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vZWNvbm9teWNsYXNzYW5kYmV5b25kLmJvYXJkaW5nYXJlYS5jb20vMjAyMy8wNy8wMy9hLXNlcnZlci1pbi10aGUtc2t5LWV4YW1pbmluZy10aGFsZXMtb25ib2FyZC1kYXRhLWNlbnRlci_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales won a Crystal Cabin Award for its Onboard Data Center. However, it is of interest, and if you’ve worked in the server space, you might be recognising some of the concepts that Thales is showing off.

Especially if you’ve played with a Blade Server or two.

First concepts – what is a Blade Server?

Put simply, a blade server is a server computer with a modular design optimized to minimize the use of physical space and energy. It is made of an enclosure (or a Blade Enclosure), with Blades with differing abilities on them (be they compute, networking, storage and so on).

The idea behind it is to allow for a high density of the workload whilst allowing for high availability, as well as reducing power consumption and footprint. Some of you might have seen something like this in your Server Room or a rack.

Here’s a Wikipedia article to keep you entertained.

Of course, there are lots of steps to take to certify a Blade Server to be aerospace ready – with a lot more certifications, standards and safety criteria to achieve, compared to your run-of-the-mill blade server by SuperMicro, Dell or HP Enterprise (to name a few).

Let us take a look at a Blade Server for Aviation.

So why a Blade in Aviation?

Let’s be honest – the last thing you want is a hardware failure when in the air – thus having a service that can provide a High Availability possibility becomes important to process information – in this case, serving the IFE system.

It uses a hyper-converged architecture built around individual blades that support multiple functions. These blades share storage and compute capabilities, resulting in an aggregated storage space 10 times higher than the average IFE server.

The server features six patented technologies, which have been integrated into this solution.

It also introduces a chance to replace or upgrade the onboard infrastructure, simply by replacing or upgrading a blade depending on need (eg, more compute required, faster networking or a larger storage pool.

So what does that enable? Pooling, resourcing and of course, virtualisation.

High Avalibity means if a blade goes down, it can be fixed or a replacement blade can be deployed between flights.

Thales is to offer options allowing for real-time health monitoring, and virtualization of the software stack – allowing for reduced licencing costs as well as well better utilisation of the onboard equipment.

Add in-flight connectivity and it also allows the deployment of content in real-time as needed – be it on the ground or in the air.

As to what this enables – well, if you’re an airline, you’ll be looking at how this could generate revenue. And there are options by the bucket load.

The promise of high availability has to be matched by software

Those of you who have played in the world of servers, blade servers and high availability will know that these promises are wonderful – but they have to be matched with the software support to enable this transformation.

For a lot of us, that means a way to orchestrate the solution, as well as manage it when it goes wrong.

According to Thales, their software is smartly distributed and redounded across blades to optimize onboard resources in real time. In the event of one or two blades shutting down, the service remains up and running without any impact on the passenger experience.

More importantly, Thales quotes that The Onboard Data Center’s availability reaches 99.99%. For those who don’t do system management for a living – that means a downtime of 50 minutes per year.

That’s an impressive number. It’ll be interesting to see how this does in the field and if it can keep the promise of high availability.

And the winner is — Human error top reason for cloud breaches for 2023 - Silverlinings,"Thu, 06 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpbHZlcmxpbmluZ3NpbmZvLmNvbS9zZWN1cml0eS9hbmQtd2lubmVyLWh1bWFuLWVycm9yLXRvcC1yZWFzb24tY2xvdWQtYnJlYWNoZXMtMjAyM9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Organizations are running headlong into multi-cloud infrastructure deployments. But with more platforms to secure, the room for operational error has grown, according to a new Thales Global Cloud Security Study. The report identified human error as the leading cause of cloud data breaches this year.

Organizations are recognizing the complexities that come with the modern cloud — over half (55%) of respondents admitted managing data in the cloud is more challenging compared to an on-premise environment, a figure up 9% from 2022, according to the study.

Plus, the average number of cloud infrastructure providers — Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS) — has also increased by 35% for organizations to average 2.26 providers, according to the cloud security report. Now equipped with multiple eggs in multiple baskets, organizations must think of the new security controls and data protection models necessary for each cloud provider when expanding its multi-cloud environment.

The cause for concern around multi-cloud stems from the give and take relationship organizations have when expanding their cloud environment. While enterprises would love for it to be as simple as adding a new tool here, or tightening a protocol there, sadly it’s not that simple.

More than a third (39%) of businesses experienced a data breach in their cloud environment last year, an increase from the 35% reported in 2022, according to Thales.

“As attackers target cloud-based resources, there’s a greater need for organizations to improve their security posture. As the data indicates, that task is all the more difficult when there are more cloud providers to secure, which could be contributing to the reported increase in successful attacks,"" the report stated.

Out with the old: from on-prem to cloud

As orgs shift to the cloud, they’re replacing traditional on-premise functionality with software as a service (SaaS) applications — a five star treat for a community of attackers increasing its skill level in those environments.

The mean number of SaaS applications grew 41% between 2021 to 2023, according to Thales. But more than a third of organizations ranked SaaS apps as the top target for cyberattacks, hinting that current strategies for platform management is not enough to keep up with a growing threat landscape.

Organizations should dedicate “separate teams to specialize in each platform” or “expect security teams to become well-versed in multiple platforms at the same time,” according to Thales.

This strategy can alleviate security teams’ challenges in a “hostile” cloud environment — while lowering the chance of human error.

What can be done?

To combat the aforementioned challenges, a large number of respondents (65%) have adopted multi-factor authentication (MFA), suggesting that “identity and access management (IAM) has been identified as a top mitigating control for data breaches.” But this is “still not good enough,” according to Thales. Only 41% reported to have implemented zero-trust strategies, which is an area where organizations will need to have better footing to improve operational security.

A greater use of data encryption and gaining control over encryption keys is currently “underutilized in security, more so than in other technological disciplines, and is another tool to reduce the risk of human error alongside the efficiency gains it provides,” according to the study.

With more workloads and data residing in the cloud, it’s becoming harder for organizations to keep up with the security challenges in an expanded cloud environment. Organizations will need manageable data protection practices in the cloud to overcome human error-caused cloud data breaches and to prepare for a multi-cloud's growing threat plane.

Achieving security and optimizing performance are among the top skills needed for managing a multi-cloud environment, according to VMware Senior Director of Product Marketing Mark Leake, and Premkumar Balasubramanian, SVP and CTO for Digital Solutions at Hitachi Vantara.

“Once an organization crosses into two or more cloud environments, it will need to eliminate redundant processes while maintaining a baseline defense strategy that holistically protects its data through a common framework,” according to Leake and Balasubramanian. “No two clouds are the same as no two organizations are the same. It’s critical for an enterprise to optimize the cloud environments it has across the entire organization to find the best option for each use case.”"

The California-based company is being sold by its private equity owner, Thoma Bravo.

Thales said that it will add about US$500 million in revenue and “significantly expand its data and application security offering.”

The acquisition is expected to close “by the beginning of 2024,” Thales said.

A longtime player in application security categories such as web application firewall and DDoS protection, Imperva has expanded in recent years into emerging segments of the market, such as API security, while also bringing a growing focus on other related categories such as data security.

Many customers are now looking to Imperva channel partners to deliver services around the vendor’s offerings, including in areas such as API security and data security that require a high degree of expertise, Micheal McCollough, global vice president of strategic growth and channel at Imperva, said in a recent interview with CRN.

In June, the company unveiled the Imperva Accelerate Partner Program with a major focus on offering partners more flexibility around choosing a go-to-market strategy with the vendor, as well as on delivering improved predictability around profits.

“What we built is a program that lets the partner choose [what] they want to focus on,” McCollough told CRN.

“And we’ve made sure we have the right requirements — and the right incentives and rewards — to support those motions.”"
Thales expands avionics line by acquiring Cobham radio and satcom arm - Flightglobal,"Tue, 11 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYWVyb3NwYWNlL3RoYWxlcy1leHBhbmRzLWF2aW9uaWNzLWxpbmUtYnktYWNxdWlyaW5nLWNvYmhhbS1yYWRpby1hbmQtc2F0Y29tLWFybS8xNTQwNzguYXJ0aWNsZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"French aerospace firm Thales has entered exclusive negotiations to acquire cockpit radio and satcom specialist Cobham Aerospace Communications for around $1.1 billion.

Cobham Aerospace Communications – also known as AeroComms – is based in Paris, and has 690 personnel with annual revenues of $200 million.

Thales says it aims to acquire the company to “strengthen its avionics portfolio”.

Cobham Aerospace Communications supplies both the civil and military aircraft markets, with such products as digital audio-radio management systems and satcom, as well as antennas, lighting and clocks.

It has sealed recent agreements with several Chinese carriers, as well as European operators ITA Airways and Transavia, for Airbus A320neo-family jets. The company also provides equipment for the Boeing 737 Max, the Embraer C-390, and several other major aircraft and helicopter programmes.

Thales executive vice-president for avionics Yannick Assouad says the acquisition will “establish a game-changer” in the communications and connectivity market.

He highlights the capability to offer secure trajectory downlink for optimised flightpaths, with the benefit of reduced emissions.

Cobham Aerospace Communications chief Nicolas Bonleux says the Thales agreement illustrates the company’s “successful transformation” under the ownership of Advent, a US private equity firm which took over UK-based Cobham Group in 2020.

The aircraft connectivity and communication markets will undergo a true revolution in the coming years, which will unlock potential for unique avionics products like ours,” he adds.

“Our combined offering with Thales Avionics will enable us to further accelerate our contribution to safer, greener, more comfortable and more efficient air travel.”

Thales says employee representatives of both companies will be consulted as part of the acquisition plan, and it expects the transaction to close in the first half of next year."

~

Press Release, Paris, 12 July 2023: Thales enters into exclusive negotiation to acquire, for USD 1.1bn, Cobham Aerospace Communications (AeroComms), a leading supplier of advanced, ultra-reliable innovative safety cockpit communication systems.

With ~690 employees, of which ~190 engineers, the company operates across a well-invested footprint in France, South Africa, USA / Canada and Denmark. It is expected to generate ~US$200m revenues in 2023.

With this acquisition, Thales aims to pursue its strategy to strengthen its Avionics portfolio:

Adding global leading position in safety cockpit communications, complementing Thales Avionics strong offering

Incorporating recently developed cutting edge products benefiting from solid positions with major OEMs and strong aftermarket/retrofit opportunities

“With the acquisition of Cobham Aerospace Communications and its highly skilled team of aerospace communications experts, and combined with our own critical avionics experts, Thales will establish a game changer in the very attractive and fast-growing communications and connectivity market to the benefit of a more sustainable aerospace future. By guaranteeing a cyber-secured, live connection between the cockpit and air traffic control, aircraft will be able to fly optimised trajectories in real time, significantly reducing fuel consumption and, consequently, CO2 emissions in the next two to three years.” Yannick Assouad, Thales Executive Vice-President Avionics

“This acquisition reflects the successful transformation of Cobham Aerospace Communications in recent years under Advent’s ownership. Our sizeable investment in R&D over the last years has further consolidated our position as a leading player in our markets, with a series of new contracts won already this year. We are proud to join Thales, which will provide Cobham Aerospace Communications with a platform to build on recent success, continue the development of several cutting-edge avionics products, and ensure the business’ future growth. The aircraft connectivity and communication markets will undergo a true revolution in the coming years, which will unlock potential for unique avionics products like ours. Our combined offering with Thales Avionics will enable us to further accelerate our contribution to safer, greener, more comfortable and more efficient air travel.” Nicolas Bonleux, Cobham Aerospace Communications Chief Executive Officer

AeroComms – a safety cockpit communication leader: AeroComms designs, produces and supports a rich portfolio of avionics solutions focused on cockpit communications. Its product range notably includes full L-Band Satcom systems (antennas and transceivers), complete digital audio and radio management solutions and passive antenna systems enabling connectivity, communications & navigation.

AeroComms is strongly positioned to benefit from the OEMs ramp up and wave of operating fleet retrofit opportunities. As part of its ongoing product development, AeroComms has recently developed game-changing products that will support future revenue growth: Aviator-S in Satcom and DRAIMS in digital Audio/Radio. The company benefits from a diversified revenue exposure with Defence customers representing ~30% of FY23E revenue.

Strengthening Thales Avionics portfolio to address the major trend towards connected cockpits: By integrating AeroComms’ unique leading safety cockpit communication systems portfolio, Thales will be ideally positioned to seize the opportunity of the shift towards connected cockpits. By the end of the decade, Thales will hence be able to fully address the permanent and secured connectivity needs of the aeronautical market.

This enhanced offering will put Thales in a highly differentiated position to provide its customers with safer, affordable and sustainable solutions through:

Real time and cyber-secured air-to-ground services

Increased operations’ efficiency (enabling eco-friendly/green flight, full spectrum cockpit connectivity…)

Better pilot assistance, paving the way to future autonomy solutions

Reduced OEMs installation burden with integrated offers and reduced aircraft weight and drag (smart antenna)

Next steps: Employee representative bodies of both Thales and Cobham Aerospace Communications will be consulted as part of the project. The closing of the transaction is expected during the first half of 2024 upon customary merger control and regulatory approvals completions.

French Thales reorganize West Africa operations - Military Africa,"Mon, 10 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pbGl0YXJ5LmFmcmljYS8yMDIzLzA3L2ZyZW5jaC10aGFsZXMtcmVvcmdhbml6ZS13ZXN0LWFmcmljYS1vcGVyYXRpb25zL9IBWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pbGl0YXJ5LmFmcmljYS8yMDIzLzA3L2ZyZW5jaC10aGFsZXMtcmVvcmdhbml6ZS13ZXN0LWFmcmljYS1vcGVyYXRpb25zLz9hbXA9MQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"French defence and aerospace giant Thales is reorganizing its West Africa operations, Africa Intelligence has learned. The group is merging its Ivory Coast and Senegal subsidiaries into a single entity, Thales West Africa, which will be headed by Jean-Baptiste Bertrand. Bertrand is currently the managing director of Thales Ivory Coast.

The reorganization is part of Thales’s broader strategy to consolidate its operations in Africa. The group has also recently merged its operations in Morocco and Tunisia into a single entity, Thales North Africa.

Thales’s West Africa operations are focused on providing security and defence solutions to governments and businesses in the region. The group has a strong presence in Ivory Coast, Senegal and Nigeria, where it has won a number of major contracts in recent years.

The reorganization of Thales’s West Africa operations comes at a time when the group is facing a number of challenges in the region. One of the biggest challenges is the ongoing political instability in Mali, which has led to the cancellation of a number of Thales contracts.

Another challenge is the fraud and corruption trial of South Africa’s former president Jacob Zuma and Thales. Thales is suspected of having paid Zuma bribes in relation to an arms deal in the 1990s with its local branch, Thint.

Thales has a number of other offices in West Africa, including in Abidjan, Dakar, and Lagos.

Thales has closed its office in the Nigerian capital, Abuja. The office was managed by Yannick Lefebvre, who left the group in May to join Safran in Dubai as senior sales director for the Middle East and Dubai.

The closure of the Abuja office is part of a broader reorganization of Thales’s West Africa operations. The company is merging its Ivory Coast and Senegal subsidiaries into a single entity, Thales West Africa, which will be headed by Jean-Baptiste Bertrand. Bertrand is currently the managing director of Thales Ivory Coast.

The Abuja office was opened in 2008.

Despite these challenges, Thales remains committed to its operations in West Africa. The group believes that the region has a lot of potential for growth and that it can play a key role in Thales’s global strategy.

The reorganization of Thales’s West Africa operations is a sign of the company’s commitment to the region. Thales believes that West Africa has a lot of potential for growth and that it can play a key role in the company’s global strategy.

However, the closure of the Abuja office is also a sign of the challenges that Thales is facing in Nigeria. The country’s economy is struggling and there is a lot of political instability. This has made it difficult for Thales to win contracts in Nigeria.

Thales provides a wide range of products and services to governments and businesses in West Africa, including security and defence solutions, telecommunications systems, and transportation systems.

The reorganization of Thales’s West Africa operations is expected to be completed by the end of 2023.

Nevertheless, on a positive note for the French arms maker, this 2023, Thales plans to hire more than 12,000 new employees to support its strong growth trajectory in its three core markets: Aerospace, Defence and Security, and Digital Identity and Security. The Group will be hiring all over the world, and expects to take on 5,500 new employees in France, 1,050 in the United Kingdom, 600 in Australia, 550 in India and 540 in the United States."

By employing high-precision machining and robotic welding processes, Nexter ensures optimal protection for military personnel within the welded aluminium structure of both vehicles. In addition, Nexter is responsible for manufacturing Jaguar’s 40 mm cannon and its telescoped munitions at its Bourges and La Chapelle Saint-Ursin facilities.

Nexter’s contributions extend beyond the physical construction of the vehicles. Various Nexter sites and subsidiaries supply components and equipment for the Griffon and Jaguar. This includes CBRN protection systems by NBC-Sys, onboard electronics and computers produced in Toulouse, and vision systems manufactured by OPT-Sys.

Nexter takes on the important task of final assembly and integration of all these components, along with those provided by Arquus and Thales, resulting in fully functional vehicles ready for deployment.

Tristan Sauer, aerospace, defence, and security reporter at GlobalData, outlined the benefits of collaboration in armoured vehicle programmes in an analyst briefing titled “The success of the French Army’s SCORPION is a testament to the benefits of defence consortiums“.

“The EBRC Jaguar and indeed the French Army’s entire SCORPION modernization program exemplifies the numerous benefits afforded by defence consortiums and enhancing engagement from the end-user throughout the development cycle.”

Arquus and Thales’s role for AVs

Arquus assumes responsibility for designing and manufacturing the complete powertrains for the Griffon and Jaguar. This includes the engines, gearboxes, running gear, and other parts that ensure vehicle mobility.

Arquus’ production centre of excellence in Limoges plays a role in manufacturing the mobility kits, which are then integrated into the vehicles at Nexter’s Roanne facility. The engines for the Griffon and Jaguar are built at Arquus’ Marolles-en-Hurepoix site, where a dedicated team of specialists provides quality assurance for all powertrain components.

Thales, a provider of advanced technological solutions, contributes to vehicle interconnection to the Scorpion programme. Thales provides the necessary vetronics and data systems, enabling the vehicles to function as a network and conduct collaborative engagements.

This encompasses the common Scorpion vetronics, onboard sensors, secure communication systems, and self-protection systems with collaborative combat algorithms. Furthermore, Thales is entrusted with producing radars and sensor payload for the artillery observation vehicle (VOA).

The onboard computing architecture developed by Thales interconnects various systems, including navigation, protection, observation, and communication, equipping deployed units with enhanced intelligence and response capabilities in a theatre of operations.

According to GlobalData’s “The Global Military Land Vehicles Market 2023-2033” report, France is anticipated to account for the fourth-largest market share in the European market. The Scorpion program mainly drives the country’s spending.

The successful delivery of the 500th Griffon and 50th Jaguar represents an accomplishment for Nexter, Thales, and Arquus on the AV programme."
NCC Bank of Bangladesh Ensures Secure and Seamless Real-Time Binimoy Transactions with Thales Luna HSMs - Business Wire,"Wed, 19 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc3dpcmUuY29tL25ld3MvaG9tZS8yMDIzMDcxODk1OTM0MC9lbi9OQ0MtQmFuay1vZi1CYW5nbGFkZXNoLUVuc3VyZXMtU2VjdXJlLWFuZC1TZWFtbGVzcy1SZWFsLVRpbWUtQmluaW1veS1UcmFuc2FjdGlvbnMtd2l0aC1UaGFsZXMtTHVuYS1IU01z0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS LA DÉFENSE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--National Credit and Commerce Bank (NCC) of Bangladesh has rolled-out Thales Luna Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) across its existing infrastructure to meet the complex security requirements of the recently launched Interoperable Digital Transaction Platform (IDTP), also known as “Binimoy.” The tamper-resistant hardware is the ‘root of trust’ for NCC Bank’s real-time transactions, providing customers with a seamless yet highly secure user experience.

In November 2022, the Bangladesh Government launched the Interoperable Digital Transaction Platform (IDTP), allowing entities to move funds between bank accounts, mobile financial services, and payment system providers in real-time and at a lower cost. The platform connects customers, merchants, payment processors, e-wallets, banks, and more, supporting the Government’s goal of a cashless society.

The IDTP relies on crypto operations to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of all transactions. NCC Bank selected Thales Luna HSMs as its hardware-based root of trust for its cryptographic operations. Deployed for crypto operations and secure key generation and storage, Luna HSMs are FIPS 140-2 Level 3 certified and offer a secure communication channel between HSM and application nodes. The deployment enables NCC Bank to trust payment transactions in real-time, ensuring an unhindered experience for the user while providing the highest level of security.

Thales Luna HSMs have been the Bangladesh Government’s security platform of choice since 2010, when they were first rolled out at the inception of the Bangladesh Automated Clearing House (BACH). Over the last several years, the hardware has also been selected to secure the Government-owned Bangladesh Bank’s Nikash Application, developed to replace its existing Electronic Funds Transfer Network (EFTN). Once again in 2022, when the Government launched the IDTP, Thales Luna HSMs became the de-facto choice amongst participating banks, including NCC Bank, for their trusted security and capability to support multiple applications and use cases.

Anisur Rahman, Chief Information Officer, Information Technology Division at NCC Bank, said, “NCC Bank has a long-standing reputation for sincere personalised service and quality technology. We knew we had to rise to the challenge of the IDTP, ensuring our products and services across Bangladesh were interoperable, secure, and seamless for the customer. We selected Thales through comprehensive evaluation due to their reputation as the market leader in the security industry. Adding Luna HSMs to our existing infrastructure was smooth and seamless thanks to its efficient setup and administration.”

Thales Luna HSMs allow the control and management of cryptographic keys across physical, cloud and hybrid IT infrastructures, including NCC Bank’s 125 branches. The overall security architecture supports the stringent security requirements of the IDTP, including multi-factor authentication and easy reporting for audits.

As Bangladesh’s financial sector continues its digital transformation, NCC Bank will benefit from Luna HSMs’ scalable, flexible, and agile offering that can handle multiple applications with different crypto requirements.

Rana Gupta, APAC Vice President, Data Security Products at Thales, commented, “Banks around the world entrust Thales to ensure the privacy of their customers. We are proud to assist NCC Bank's transition to digital technologies that benefit millions. Our Luna HSMs are designed to balance security and high-performance requirements for traditional and new technologies. For financial institutions like NCC Bank of Bangladesh, this means ensuring that digital currency has the highest level of security for its customers.”

In 2022 alone, Scottish aerospace, defence, security, and space companies generated an impressive £7.3bn in turnover, contributing £3.2bn to the country’s economy. These sectors employ over 33,500 people in Scotland, including 1,500 apprentices.

The role of Scotland’s defence industry

Scottish Secretary Alister Jack emphasised the vital role of Scottish skills, expertise, and innovation in the UK’s defence industry: “It’s clear that Scottish skills, expertise and innovation make an enormous contribution to the UK’s defence industry, with massive benefits for our national security and economy.

“I’m looking forward to hosting ADS, its members, the Armed Forces and UK Government departments at this new forum. The UK Government is committed to growing our economy, including by working with the defence industry to support its success in the UK and in exporting overseas.”

The roundtable brought together major players in the Scottish defence industry, including Babcock, BAE, Castle Precision, Glenalmond, Leonardo, QinetiQ, Raytheon, Spirit Aerosystems, Thales, and representatives from the Armed Forces and the Ministry of Defence were also present, ensuring a discussion on sector priorities, challenges, and upcoming milestones.

As the UK remains the second-largest global defence exporter after the US, Mark Goldsack, director of Defence Security Exports at the Department for Business and Trade, will present an agenda item supporting Scottish exports.

With the UK’s Continuous at Sea Deterrent playing a role in NATO’s collective defence, the new Dreadnought-class submarines, currently under construction in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, will ensure the UK’s nuclear deterrent remains operational as necessary. The first Dreadnought-class submarine is expected to enter UK service in the early 2030s.

Weighing over 17,000 tonnes and spanning a length equivalent to three Olympic swimming pools, the Dreadnought submarines will accommodate a crew of 130. The optronics mast developed by Thales Glasgow represents an advancement in visual capabilities, offering enhanced electronic, stabilized visuals that provide improved safety and enable quicker detection of enemy activity.

Thales in the UK naval manufacturing industry

Scotland’s defence capabilities extend beyond the nuclear deterrent, with crucial assets such as the Quick Reaction Alert based at RAF Lossiemouth and ongoing construction of Type 26 and Type 31 frigates in Scottish shipyards. Thales has also been contracted to work on the Type 31 frigate, providing £70m combat systems for the UK MoD.

The roundtable marks a step in strengthening the Scottish defence sector’s position, ensuring continued economic growth, and reinforcing the UK’s commitment to national security.

Thales recorded a 9.4% increase in sales in Q1 of FY23. The company attributed this growth to strong dynamics and mature markets in different regions, especially Europe and North America."
European firm to study plans to 'harvest' solar energy from space - TNW,"Tue, 25 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlbmV4dHdlYi5jb20vbmV3cy9ldXJvcGVhbi1hZXJvc3BhY2UtZ2lhbnQtdG8tc3R1ZHktcGxhbnMtdG8taGFydmVzdC1zb2xhci1lbmVyZ3ktaW4tb3JiaXTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales Alenia Space will fine-tune plans to “harvest” solar energy in orbit, the European firm announced on Monday.

Named Solaris, the project aims to provide Earth with energy from space-borne solar power plants.

The idea emerged amid an EU push to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Solar energy from space could provide a clean alternative. It would also be available 24/7, ensuring electrical supply continuity without needing significant storage systems.

The European Space Agency, which is leading Solaris, enlisted Thales Alenia Space (TAS) to conduct a feasibility study for the initiative.

The study seeks to create new concepts for the system, using tech including high-efficiency space solar panels, wireless power transmission, and robotised assembly in orbit. These results will guide follow-on research and development activities.

TAS, a joint venture between France’s Thales Group (67%) and Italy’s conglomerate Leonardo, joins a range of European tech firms on the project.

Among the other members is Switzerland’s Astrostrom, which has proposed using a butterfly-inspired solar power satellite. Located at an Earth-Moon Lagrange point around 61,350 km from the lunar surface, the satellite would deliver 23MW of energy continuously.

The TAS study will determine the viability of all Solaris plans. By 2025, the project team wants to decide whether to commercialise space-based solar energy. Their initial objective will be creating a small-scale in-orbit demonstrator.

In the long run, they hope to make Europe a key player in the race to develop clean and sustainable energy solutions."
Human Error the Leading Cause of Cloud Data Breaches - Infosecurity Magazine,"Thu, 06 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZm9zZWN1cml0eS1tYWdhemluZS5jb20vbmV3cy9odW1hbi1lcnJvci1jbG91ZC1kYXRhLWJyZWFjaGVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Around two in five (39%) businesses experienced a data breach in their cloud environment in 2022, a rise of 4% compared with 2021, a new report has found.

The 2023 Thales Global Cloud Security Study, which surveyed nearly 3000 IT and security professionals across 18 countries, also revealed a dramatic increase in sensitive data stored in the cloud in 2022 compared to the previous year. Three-quarters (75%) of respondents said that more than 40% of data stored in their organizations’ cloud environments was ‘sensitive.’ This compared to 39% of businesses in 2021.

Targeting the Human Factor

The leading cause of cloud data breaches was human error, at 55%, according to the report. This was significantly above the next highest factor identified by respondents (21%), which was exploitation of vulnerabilities.

The targeting of users to infiltrate cloud networks is also a trend being observed by cybersecurity company Proofpoint. Matt Cooke, Cybersecurity Strategist at Proofpoint told Infosecurity: “Attackers realize that people and their accounts are still the vulnerability. And it actually doesn’t matter now where that person is because everyone’s pretty much using the same tools. For example, everyone’s got a Microsoft 365 account.”

Proofpoint’s 2023 Human Factor report found that 94% of monitored cloud tenants were targeted by either precision or brute-force attacks in any given month. Of these tenants, 62% were successfully attacked.

“From an attacker’s perspective, if you’ve got a list of usernames and passwords and you think they might belong to a particular company, why would you not try them against those accounts? We see that going on quite significantly,” commented Cooke.

App-Based Threats

The Thales report highlighted a 41% rise in SaaS usage from 2021 to 2023, with these applications increasingly replacing on-premises application functionality. Over half of cyber professionals (55%) said this expansion has made it more complex to secure data in the cloud.

Additionally, the respondents ranked SaaS apps as the most targeted area for attacks (38%) in 2022, followed by cloud storage (36%).

Proofpoint’s Cooke also highlighted apps as a key area in cloud security. He outlined a growing trend of malicious third-party applications being connected to organizations’ cloud accounts. Here, attackers trick users into granting permissions to malicious OAuth apps, giving them access to the user’s legitimate cloud services."
Thales extends long-held R&D partnership with NTU - Channel Asia Singapore,"Thu, 20 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoYW5uZWxhc2lhLnRlY2gvYXJ0aWNsZS8xMjkyNzQ3L3RoYWxlcy1leHRlbmRzLWxvbmctaGVsZC1yZC1wYXJ0bmVyc2hpcC13aXRoLW50dS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales has renewed its partnership with Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) for a fourth tenure in running the CNRS International NTU Thales Research Alliance (CINTRA) laboratory.

Entering the fifteenth year since it was established in 2009, the CINTRA lab is focused on upstream research and development in the field of carbon-based materials, nanostructures and nano-photonics.

In this renewed partnership, Thales will focus on strengthening capabilities through four main application areas on how research outcomes can be used for energy, sensors, acoustic and microwave devices and nano-photonic circuits – areas relevant for the development of materials for Thales’ solutions.

Over the years, the lab has progressed to focusing on the understanding and application-based research of 2D materials and metamaterials, as well as on artificial intelligence (AI) for materials design.

Physically situated at the NTU campus, the extension of the lab highlights Singapore’s strategic importance for research and technology for Thales.

“The CINTRA lab is one of our early examples of upstream research collaboration in Singapore, back when the country was enhancing its reputation as a leading R&D [research and development] hub in the region,” said Emily Tan, CEO and country director of Thales in Singapore.

“I am proud that this spirit of co-designing and prototyping continues with the extended tenure of the lab, working together with our esteemed partners CNRS and NTU. The established credentials of CINTRA demonstrate Thales’ influence within the scientific and technical communities and is especially significant as Thales celebrates its fiftieth year in Singapore this year.”

Thales continues to remain committed to working with institutions in Singapore. Last year, the vendor was part of a trial by the National University of Singapore (NUS) to launch the National Quantum-Safe Network for government agencies and private enterprises.

The initiative, called the Quantum Engineering Program, was expected to cost about S$8.5million over three years and involve over 15 private and government collaborators, including Thales and Amazon Web Services (AWS)."

OCCAR (Organisation for Joint Armament Cooperation) has awarded Naviris and eurosam a contract for the Mid-Life Upgrade (MLU) of the French and Italian Horizon frigates. The two co-contractors, Naviris and eurosam, will work in close relationship with their shareholders, Fincantieri and Naval Group for the frigate, MBDA Italia, MBDA France and Thales for the new generation of Principal Anti-Air Missile System & Long-Range Radar (PAAMS & LRR).

The value of the contract for Naviris and eurosam is euro 1.5 billion. More in detail, in the coming days Naviris will finalize subcontracts, including the one with Fincantieri, which will have a value of 211 million euros and constitutes a major related party transaction defined in compliance with the relevant applicable regulations.

With this upgrade, Horizon class frigates will receive a state-of-the-art modernization of the entire vessel and the enhancement of their anti-warfare capabilities. New weapon systems and associated Command and Control, and electronic warfare suites will provide highest capabilities and performances against the most modern threats. Regarding anti-air warfare, the new generation of PAAMS & LRR is a very significant upgrade and the system will be able to defeat the threats of the decade to come as missiles (hypersonic, ballistic, supersonic sea-skimmer, high velocity cruise), UAVs and highly maneuvering aircrafts, in a saturation attack scenario.

Damien Raby, Naviris’ CEO and Enrico Bonetti, Naviris’ COO declared: “We are very proud of today’s achievement; the contract signed today is the result of a route, jointly walked with our partner eurosam and our Customers: OCCAR, which we sincerely thank for the excellent work done, Directorate of Naval Armaments of the Secretariat General of Defence / National Armaments Directorate and French Armament General Directorate (DGA), started with the award of the feasibility studies which will make even more solid the execution of the programme. This contract is a fundamental step for Naviris in demonstrating its capability to execute a multinational programme and it further reinforces the role of the joint venture as center of gravity in the cooperation among Fincantieri and Naval Group, also with the partnership of Leonardo and SIGEN (ELT and Thales)”.

Eva Bruxmeier, Managing Director of eurosam stated: “PAAMS & LRR, unique System deployed on the four French and Italian frigates, has been successfully engaged all over the world for more than 15 years in synergies with PAAMS & LRR - UK variant deployed on the six Type-45 destroyers. This new generation of PAAMS & LRR for the frigates, developed and produced by eurosam through MBDA Italia, MBDA France and Thales and integrated jointly with Naviris on the frigates, relies on an enhanced missile (ASTER Block 1 NT), an upgraded launcher, two new AESA radars (Kronos Grand Naval from Leonardo and SMART-L MM/N from Thales) and a new open software architecture command and control system”.

The Horizon frigates were originally built between 2000 and 2010 as part of a joint programme between Fincantieri and Naval Group, providing the Italian and French navies with innovative frigates with anti-air capabilities. The PAAMS & LRR system was originally developed and produced, under eurosam responsibility, for the four Horizon class frigates.

Main characteristics of the four Horizon frigates

Length / beam overall: ​ 153 m / 20.3 m

Displacement / full load: ​ 6,500 tons / 7,300 tons

Accommodation: ​ 210 (complement of 190 + 20 passengers)

Range: ​ ​ ​ 7,000 nm at 18 knots

Maximum speed: ​ 29 knots

The type is designed for a range of missions, including high-intensity operations, all with reduced crewing. Horizon frigates are front-line fighting ships with one highly specialized mission: anti-air warfare, also known as Air Defense. The ships’ chief capabilities are thus airspace control over areas of operations, Air Defense command and control and anti-air cover for carrier groups and convoys. Horizon frigates provide protection against high-intensity threats and attacks by anti-ship missiles. They also contribute to air/sea control during military operations by providing air Defense command and control for allied forces. They can also participate in public service missions. ​ ​ ​

Announcing a New Book: Founders of Western Philosophy - New Ideal,"Wed, 05 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3aWRlYWwuYXlucmFuZC5vcmcvYW5ub3VuY2luZy1hLW5ldy1ib29rLWZvdW5kZXJzLW9mLXdlc3Rlcm4tcGhpbG9zb3BoeS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"“There is only one power that determines the course of history,” said Ayn Rand, “just as it determines the course of every individual life: the power of man’s rational faculty — the power of ideas.” To understand history, then, we need to study the fundamental philosophical ideas that move the world. And the best way to do that is with the guidance of a great teacher who can untangle, analyze and explain the intricacies of philosophers’ claims, theories and arguments.

The Ayn Rand Institute Press is happy to announce the release of a new book: Founders of Western Philosophy: Thales to Hume. Carefully edited by Michael S. Berliner, this volume is drawn from Leonard Peikoff’s 1972 lecture course of the same name, covering the history of Western philosophy from ancient Greece through medieval and early modern philosophy.

This book preserves the informal, engaging style of Dr. Peikoff’s lectures, making the process of understanding and digesting difficult issues and conceptions enjoyable and immediately rewarding — I experienced reading six hundred pages as if it were a hundred. Fans of Ayn Rand’s philosophy will also appreciate how Dr. Peikoff, while presenting various philosophical figures objectively and accurately, is able to relate their views and arguments to Objectivism.

Founders of Western Philosophy offers great value not only to philosophy students but to everyone interested in the subject, regardless of prior knowledge or expertise. It’s best to read the whole book, as it is a brilliant example of intellectual integration, but some readers might find it useful to read selected passages or chapters about particular philosophers or theories they are currently interested in.

On the occasion of this book’s release, we are glad to publish in New Ideal the foreword by Robert Mayhew as well as Dr. Berliner’s preface.

Founders of Western Philosophy is available for purchase on Amazon, in paperback and Kindle editions.

From Robert Mayhew’s Foreword to

Founders of Western Philosophy: Thales to Hume

In the early 1980s, while I was an undergraduate, I was torn between going to graduate school or to law school. It was at that time that I first listened to Leonard Peikoff’s lectures on the history of Western philosophy, from Thales to Hume. It was a tour de force, covering the essential ideas of the most significant and influential philosophers, from the dawn of philosophy in ancient Greece up to the eighteenth century, and it influenced my decision the following year to pursue in graduate school the serious study of the history of ideas. This history in the hands of Dr. Peikoff did not consist of discrete and disconnected episodes or units; rather, it was an integrated presentation of the unfolding of the history of philosophy, with the major figures of each period responding to those who came before them and influencing those who came after. Moreover, Dr. Peikoff throughout tied the abstract ideas in this history to the “real world,” acting as a “philosophical psychotherapist” (in his apt description) diagnosing Western civilization.

I eventually received my PhD in philosophy, with a specialization in ancient Greek philosophy and especially Aristotle. Over the past three decades, as a historian of philosophy, I have devoted most of my research to individual trees (and, so to speak, to their roots, branches, and leaves); but I have never lost sight of the forest, in large part owing to my introduction to the subject.

“Philosophy is not a bauble of the intellect,” as Dr. Peikoff would later begin his magnum opus, Objectivism: The Philosophy of Ayn Rand, “but a power from which no man can abstain.” Anyone interested in a history of this crucially important subject is fortunate to have available this course in book form and can do no better than to begin here.

From Michael S. Berliner’s Editor’s Preface to

Founders of Western Philosophy: Thales to Hume

The lectures present the ideas of the philosophers who shaped Western civilization, the meaning and practical consequences of these ideas, their unidentified influence on the minds of modern men — and a critical analysis, which will provide a defense against many of today’s prevalent intellectual fallacies. The course concludes with a lecture on the Objectivist answer to selected philosophic problems.

So reads the announcement in the August 14, 1972, issue of The Ayn Rand Letter for Leonard Peikoff’s course Founders of Western Philosophy: Thales to Hume. The twelve-lecture course, beginning on September 14, 1972, took place at the Hilton Hotel, 6th Ave. and 53rd St., in New York City and was immediately offered worldwide on tape to groups of ten or more on a rental basis.

Because the course was presented orally, a significant amount of editing was required to make the book more amenable to the reading audience. I hasten to add, however, that I did not edit for philosophic or historical content, nor did I rewrite on the premise of “This is what I think Dr. Peikoff meant to say.” I did eliminate repetition and a number of colloquial and conversational expressions, and I made some grammatical changes. I also moved some questions and answers so that they follow the lectures that contain those topics, and I retained some answers that repeated material in the lectures, on the premise that Dr. Peikoff thought that material important enough to warrant repetition. I also added the footnotes, including citations for quotations from secondary sources. I did not cite quoted material from the philosophers discussed by Dr. Peikoff: Not only are there multiple translations of the non-British philosophers, but web searches make it easy to find and compare different versions. Bracketed material was added by me, except where noted as asides from Dr. Peikoff during the lectures. All punctuation is mine, because Dr. Peikoff did not see either the original transcription or the edited version, and I had access only to the recordings of the live lectures, not to any of Dr. Peikoff’s notes or manuscripts. A word-for-word transcript of the tape recording of the course resides in the Ayn Rand Archives, and audio recordings of all sessions are available free of charge on the Ayn Rand Institute’s website under the course title History of Philosophy.

I would like to thank Donna Montrezza, my longtime colleague, for her diligent and thoughtful proofreading and copyediting and her helpful comments in the difficult task of turning oral material into written. Thanks also to Simon Federman for his skillful production work and to Ziemowit Gowin for creating the highly valuable index.

This upgrade will see the implementation of revolutionary technology, including large sensor arrays backed by robust Big Data algorithms. These enhancements aim to provide an extensive understanding of the underwater acoustic environment to counter ever-evolving covert threats for future generations.

The contract underlines the continued faith the French Ministry of the Armed Forces places in Thales in preserving the French Navy's underwater detection supremacy.

The improved sonar suite from Thales will have the capability to detect, pinpoint, and categorize threats across a wide range, facilitating unprecedented underwater situational awareness.

Submarines, which form a crucial strategic component of naval forces faced with an increasing variety of threats, will greatly benefit from this upgrade. The French Navy's Strategic Oceanic Force (FOST) currently employs four such SSBNs as a consistent nuclear deterrent.

The DGA contract encompasses the conceptualization and creation of the sonar suite for third-generation SSBNs, and the precise design and implementation for second-generation vessels.

The innovative technologies from Thales will affirm the acoustic dominance of France's submarines in the future. Large-scale arrays comprising multiple sensors will offer an unparalleled level of threat detection accuracy.

Moreover, the advanced sensors will produce significantly more data compared to previous systems. The ALICIA data processing system will utilize state-of-the-art Big Data algorithms, with user-friendly interfaces designed to lessen operator workload and assist in decision-making. This reflects the increasing application of sophisticated data analytics and machine learning algorithms in contemporary defence strategies.

SNLE 3G

With a displacement of 15,000 tons when submerged and a length of about 150 m (490 ft), the new class of submarines stands ready to replace the Triomphant class around 2035.

The SNLE 3G showcases power with a 220 MW (300,000 hp) installation, and its propulsion system is centered around a K22 pressurized water reactor. This allows the SNLE 3G an unlimited distance range, and it is designed to run for 20–25 years without needing refuelling. The vessel could serve until 2090.

The submarine's armament is as imposing as her size. Nuclear-armed, it houses 16 M51 missiles each carrying six to ten TNO 100kt thermonuclear warheads. Furthermore, she accommodates 533 mm (21 in) torpedo tubes compatible with F21 torpedoes and anti-ship missiles."

Telit Cinterion sells €24.5m automotive IoT unit to IoT-hungry German outfit Kontron - RCR Wireless News,"Mon, 17 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yY3J3aXJlbGVzcy5jb20vMjAyMzA3MTcvaW50ZXJuZXQtb2YtdGhpbmdzL3RlbGl0LWNpbnRlcmlvbi1zZWxscy1hdXRvbW90aXZlLWlvdC11bml0LXRvLWlvdC1odW5ncnktZ2VybWFuLW91dGZpdC1rb250cm9uLWZvci1lMjQtNW3SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Bit late, but important to report: US-headquartered IoT module maker Telit Cinterion announced at the start of the month (July 3) that it has agreed to sell its cellular IoT automotive business to German IoT and IT electronics manufacturer Kontron for €24.5 million. The deal covers Telit Cinterion’s complete portfolio of 4G/LTE and 5G automotive modules, and further “sharpens” its own focus, it said, on pure-play industrial and commercial IoT.

The deal follows Telit’s acquisition of the cellular IoT unit of French aerospace and security company Thales last summer (closed at the start of 2023) in return for a quarter-share of its expanded industrial IoT business. The deal saw Thales take a 25 percent stake in the expanded Telit business, rebranded as Telit Cinterion. Telit’s automotive IoT division was not included in the transaction, and spun-off from Telit Cinterion ahead of its sale.

Kontron, headquartered in Augsburg, has around 4,500 staff in 21 countries. It posted sales of €1.342 billion in 2022. Telit Cinterion’s automotive division posted revenue of €100 million in 2022. The agreement, subject to approval from respective workers’ councils, as well as from regulatory bodies, marks a “significant strategic move” to enhance its IoT portfolio, it said. The deal is expected to close in August; the business will be integrated into Kontron Europe.

The acquisition will go some way to replace revenues from its IT services business, which it sold to France-based construction and engineering company VINCI Energies for €392.3 million in December; the business included operations in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, Croatia, Serbia, Albania, Montenegro, Northern Macedonia, Germany, and Switzerland. Kontron suggested it will make further “strategic IoT acquisitions”.

Hannes Niederhauser, chief executive at Kontron, said: “[This] marks another milestone in Kontron’s journey towards becoming a global leader in IoT… This strategic move solidifies our commitment to delivering exceptional IoT solutions to our customers and propels us towards the forefront of innovation. With our expanded portfolio, we will drive transformative change, leverage emerging technologies, and create a seamless IoT ecosystem that empowers industries worldwide.”"
Telesat still backing Lightspeed - Advanced Television,"Tue, 25 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vYWR2YW5jZWQtdGVsZXZpc2lvbi5jb20vMjAyMy8wNy8yNS90ZWxlc2F0LXN0aWxsLWJhY2tpbmctbGlnaHRzcGVlZC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Comments from satellite builder Thales Group’s chief Executive Patrice Caine suggests that Canada-based Telesat’s potential contract for its $5 billion (€4.5bn) order for a fleet of 198 low Earth orbiting satellites is still very much active.

The comments come because Telesat has been slow to confirm any sort of order and has taken some considerable time to secure adequate funding over and above its own resources to commit to the project.

Thales was confirmed as the project’s Prime Contractor back in February 2021 and even that confirmation was slow to come because of Covid problems affecting the satellite industry. However, reportedly Thales has now removed Lightspeed on its list of likely orders.

On July 18th, Telesat confirmed that its LEO-3 test satellite was working in orbit and starting to transmit in Ka and V-band.

An investor discussion on Thales Q2 results heard Caine say it was his company’s clear impression that Telesat is continuing to work on its debt-financing issues for the project.

“If and when they announce the closing for the [financing for the] project, then we will be ready for that, of course. And we would not make any commitment that could not be backed by our supply chain, of course. There is no additional risk. The ball is really in their court, not in ours,” said Caine."

The contract entails the construction of the integrated optronic combat system mast, which will serve as the above water 'eyes' for the Royal Navy's forthcoming nuclear deterrent submarine, the Dreadnought class.

Thales has a longstanding history of supplying periscopes and optronics masts for Royal Navy submarines, with every submarine in service since 1917 being equipped with their technology.

The continuation of this partnership with the Dreadnought version not only upholds tradition but also supports over 150 jobs at Thales. Furthermore, the entire Dreadnought program, encompassing design and construction, is expected to contribute to the growth of the UK economy by providing around 30,000 jobs across the country.

The optronic combat system mast represents an innovative advancement over traditional periscopes. It offers improved electronic stabilization and delivers high-quality visuals, enhancing the safety of the crew by providing clearer images and enabling faster detection of enemy activities.

Optronic mast

Photonics masts, also known as optronics masts, are advanced sensors used on submarines as an alternative to traditional periscopes. These innovative devices eliminate the need for a periscope tube, freeing up design space during construction and reducing the risk of water leakage in the event of damage.

Unlike periscopes, photonics masts do not have to be located directly above the user. They require only a small penetration in the pressure hull for cabling, allowing them to be fully integrated within the submarine's sail. This design flexibility also enables greater freedom in placing the control room, which no longer needs to be positioned directly below the sail.

Operating like telescoping antennas, photonics masts rise above the water surface to provide a wide range of sensory information. Equipped with an array of sensors, including high-definition low-light and thermographic cameras, they offer advanced imaging capabilities. The captured images and data can be displayed on panels within the submarine's control room for analysis and decision-making.

In addition to visual information, photonics masts can fulfill various other functions traditionally performed by optical-periscope masts. These include supporting navigation, electronic warfare, and communications systems.

Overall, photonics masts represent a significant technological advancement in submarine sensor systems. By employing digital equipment and innovative design, they offer improved performance, greater flexibility, and enhanced safety compared to conventional periscopes."

Dutch MoD press release – Translated by Naval News

The Dutch Defense Ministry (MoD) has ordered four new anti-submarine warfare (ASW) frigates, two for the Netherlands and two for Belgium. These ships will be armed with 76mm Sovraponte naval gun systems. The MoD signed a procurement contract with Italian defense company Leonardo on 20 July 2023.

In addition to standard ammunition, the guns can fire guided ammunition, which are controlled by an illumination radar. This feature enables the frigate to better defend itself against modern threats. These guns are capable of engaging land, surface, and air targets.

Spare gun

Leonardo will also provide a spare system. This gun will be fitted accordingly as a replacement for the systems undergoing major maintenance. This way the battle power of the ship remains unchanged.

Sovraponte for LPDs and Supply Ship

In addition, the contract includes an option for the delivery of 3 more Sovraponte naval gun systems. These are for HNLMS Karel Doorman and HNLMS John de Witt, respectively. These guns will be used to replace the current Goalkeeper close-in weapon systems. The third gun will be used aboard the new supply ship HNLMS Den Helder, which will be launched in 2025. The gun will be mounted later.

The ASW frigates’ guns are set to be delivered in early 2027.

This is an important development for Leonardo as it marks the first export customers for the new naval gun system, in a single deal: Belgium and the Netherlands (two European and NATO countries).

Leonardo is expecting two more deals for the same frigate class:

Artist impressions of the ASWF show MARLIN 40mm guns fitted as secondary artillery. A deal for this system is yet to be announced.

In addition, the Italian company announced last year that the Netherlands have chosen the “LIONFISH® Top” variant 12.7mm RWS to equip most of its fleet: Holland-class patrol vessels, LPD (Landing Platform Dock) and JSS (Joint Support Ship) units, Johan de Witt and Karel Doorman classes, and Den Helder-class Combat Support Ship. It would appear logical that the LIONFISH RWS is also selected to equip the ASWF. However the Italian company is facing competition from Beligum’s FN Herstal who is supplying its Sea deFNder 12.7mm RWS for the rMCM program."
Thales expands presence in Saudi Arabia through focus on defense and civil aviation sectors - Arab News,"Sat, 01 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFyYWJuZXdzLmNvbS9ub2RlLzIzMzExMDYvYnVzaW5lc3MtZWNvbm9tedIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Saudi Arabia’s tech landscape flourishes with innovative initiatives

RIYADH: Saudi Arabia’s strategic location, thriving economy, and strong government support have attracted a diverse range of funding partners keen on assisting startups and entrepreneurs.

The Kingdom, according to Houssem Jemili, partner at management consulting firm Bain and Co., has one of the highest technology spends in the Middle East and North Africa, approximately 2.5 times that of the next country, and is growing year-on-year.

Speaking to Arab News, Jemili said: “Saudi Arabia has a mature and diverse set of funding partners — government entities and programs (e.g., Monsha’at), large investment funds, and venture capitalists that provide access to both direct and indirect funding to startups and entrepreneurs.”

Highlighting the Kingdom’s emergence as a dynamic tech hub in the region, he added: “KSA has a large domestic captive audience (the largest in MENA) that demands technology products and services.”

Talat Zaki Hafiz, a Saudi-based economist, told Arab News that the Kingdom’s rise as a tech hub in MENA was greatly influenced by its status as the largest economy in the region, accounting for over 30 percent of the its gross domestic product, and ranking 16th among the G20 countries.

“The technology strategy of Saudi Arabia includes ambitious targets and action plans based on attracting leading international companies mainly specialized in advanced and emerging technologies to enable the Kingdom to develop mega tech projects,” he said.

Global Innovation Index

Saudi Arabia’s strides in technological innovation are underscored by its position on the Global Innovation Index 2023, where it ranks 48th among 132 featured economies.

“It (Saudi Arabia) has certainly made improvements, from 51st and 66th (position) in 2022 and 2021 respectively,” Jemili explained.

He went on to say that the Kingdom recognizes that innovation is a “key driver of economic development,” and efforts will result in significant improvements across innovation input sub-indices like human capital and infrastructure, as well as output sub-indices such as knowledge and technology outputs, and creative outputs of the Global Innovation Index.

Within the high-income group economies, Saudi Arabia ranks 41st, further solidifying its status as a burgeoning tech hub in the region.

Moreover, the Kingdom’s ranking fifth among the 18 economies in North Africa and West Asia highlights its growing influence as a beacon of innovation in the Middle East.

Hafiz believes that since the launch of Vision 2030 in 2016, Saudi Arabia has been focusing on tech-related industries in general and the digital economy in particular.

“Since the digital economy is becoming the new trend in the 21st century, especially in Saudi Arabia, where over 60 percent of its citizens are youth less than 35 years old, they heavily use the internet to purchase goods and services,” he said.

The economist explained that statistics revealed the Kingdom is witnessing a significant increase in the size of e-commerce, with expectations to reach $15 billion in 2025 and online sales projected to reach 66 percent.

Saudi Arabia’s increasing prominence in technological advancement and innovation localization was showcased at the LEAP conference held in Riyadh. The event, which concluded in early March with great success, included agreements worth over $12 billion.

“LEAP has made a tremendous effort to act as a node of the technology and innovation ecosystem in KSA — a node that connects the ecosystem and brings all the players together, through building a community,” Jemili said.

Strategic investments

Saudi Arabia’s emergence as a digital powerhouse can be attributed to its strategic investments in research and development, supportive policies, and a thriving startup ecosystem.

With initiatives such as Vision 2030 and the establishment of the Digital Government Authority, the Kingdom is laying the groundwork for a technologically advanced future.

According to Jemili, the presence of global technology giants in Saudi Arabia is a testimony to the growth of the technology and innovation landscape in the Kingdom.

“Such players provide the necessary minimum infrastructure that startups and entrepreneurs need to succeed,” he added.

Jemili further elaborated: “They provide a world-class physical and digital infrastructure, like software labs and production studios, and even cloud credits to enable innovation at scale. Such advanced offering helps startups accelerate their ideas from early-stage to large-scale commercialization.”

Global tech giants are investing billions in Saudi Arabia, highlighting its attractiveness as an investment destination, with Microsoft investing $2.1 billion in a global super-scaler cloud and Oracle committing $1.5 billion to build a new cloud region in Riyadh, as earlier revealed by Minister of Communication and Information Technology Abdullah Al-Swaha.

Hafiz emphasized that the integration of technology in the Saudi traditional economy “is going so well.”

“The Kingdom’s Vision 2030 is built on making significant changes in the Saudi economy not only to diversify its sector base but also to push for transformation to technology,” he added.

Regulatory framework

Saudi Arabia’s efforts to foster innovation extend to the regulatory realm, where the government has introduced initiatives such as regulatory sandboxes and fintech hubs.

These initiatives provide a platform for startups and tech companies to test innovative products and services in a controlled environment, thereby facilitating compliance with regulatory requirements while fostering innovation.

“Flow of and access to incentives is a big dimension that has helped Saudi Arabia drive its innovation landscape,” according to Jemili.

He highlighted that the Kingdom has a rapidly evolving business environment that requires a structured regulatory system that is mature, growth-driven, and easy to navigate.

“In addition, it is critical to enact clear and predictable regulations that enhance innovation, bring ease of doing business, and continue to build the trust of both the business community and investors,” he added.

Jemili emphasized the importance of having a “phygital center of gravity” for the startup community, highlighting its critical role in providing firsthand ecosystem orientation and guidance to new entrepreneurs and foreign startups in the Kingdom.

Phygital refers to a combined physical and digital center that serves as a pivotal hub for the startup community, offering both in-person and online resources, guidance, and orientation to new entrepreneurs and foreign startups.

With a diverse pool of founders and over 1,600 startups supported by a network of venture capital firms, Saudi Arabia is poised to become a global leader in technological innovation.

Hafiz continued, emphasizing, “It is important to note that Saudi Arabia is the third worldwide and very advanced in digital industries, leader and ranked the first regionally according to the data of GOVTECH Maturity Index for 2022 issued by the World Bank Group.”

He noted the government’s backing of advanced technologies in Saudi Arabia, which has driven significant progress toward Vision 2030’s goals by delivering high-quality digital services that bolster the national economy.

Startup ecosystem

Within the vibrant startup scene in Saudi Arabia, several companies have emerged as pioneers in innovation.

Notable among them are startups enrolled in the Saudi Unicorns Program, exemplifying the Kingdom’s commitment to nurturing homegrown talent and fostering entrepreneurship.

“Saudi Unicorns Program is a one-stop-shop solution to support and enable high-growth technology companies to reach the unicorn stage by providing an integrated set of services and offerings,” Jemili noted.

The program provides unparalleled solutions to start-ups and entrepreneurs by providing access to connect with different stakeholders — international customers, talent, investors, and private sector, and experts for mentorship and guidance.

He added that the objective of the program is in line with the overall Vision 2030, as it strives to increase the number of unicorns and create both direct and indirect impacts on the local GDP.

“A differentiating aspect of Saudi Unicorns Program is its differentiated offerings based on the degree of readiness of the startups,” Jemili explained.

Lean Tech, Mrsool, Quant, and Mozn are just a few examples of startups making waves in Saudi Arabia’s tech ecosystem.

These companies represent the Kingdom’s vibrant culture of innovation and entrepreneurship, actively shaping its dynamic business landscape.

With strategic investments, supportive policies, and a thriving startup ecosystem, the Kingdom is poised to lead the charge toward a digitally empowered future.

By fostering collaboration, nurturing homegrown talent, and embracing emerging technologies, Saudi Arabia’s current momentum is promising for technology and innovation.

Jemili cited the Magnitt report, stating that the Kingdom has emerged as the leading market for venture capital funding in the MENA region, attracting over $1.38 billion in investments in 2023.

“This was the second year in a row that KSA has recorded a billion-dollar-plus figure in VC funding,” he said.

Jemili gave examples of mega-rounds witnessed by Saudi-based platforms like Tabby and Tamara, which helped both companies secure unicorn status. “With continued efforts to improve livability aspects, improvements in ease of doing business, and continued growth and maturity of the funding institutions, KSA is on track for continued success.”

As more of these elements come to life, the maturity of the ecosystems in cities like Riyadh and Jeddah can move from an early activation stage to a globalized stage.

Hafiz concluded: “I don’t believe that the Kingdom is facing any pressing economic challenges to establish a tech ecosystem, simply because it is blessed with encouraging leadership.”

He emphasized the encouragement to use technology at a large scale, which he believes has helped to “create an excellent ecosystem, especially when considering that more than 60 percent of the Saudi population are young, below 35 years old, and we are among the highest users of the internet in the Arab world and globally.”"

This latest selection further consolidates Thales’s global positioning in critical avionics.

Thales’s new-generation IESI provides pilots with vital data for flight safety, even if other cockpit equipment fails.

This third-generation instrument offers enhanced reliability and a smaller environmental footprint, thanks to 25% lower weight and 33% lower power consumption compared to the first generation.

Thales is the creator of the first IESI, which entered service in 1999.

Thales, a pioneer of Integrated Electronic Standby Instruments, has been selected by Airbus Helicopters to provide the third-generation IESI for its new civil and military helicopters: the H135, H145, H160 dual and H175. This new-generation IESI is specifically designed to meet the requirements of helicopter operations, and its environmental footprint is significantly smaller. Progressive entry into service will begin in 2026.

On a helicopter, the IESI must be able to withstand high levels of vibration and electromagnetic interference as well as offer the pilot optimal readability in all circumstances, especially when using night vision goggles. In a single piece of equipment, the IESI incorporates pressure probes and sensors, accelerometers and gyrometers, which form an artificial horizon, as well as an LCD display, and provides the pilot with the vital speed, altitude and attitude information needed for safe flying.

Perfectly optimised to the specific constraints of helicopters, the third-generation IESI from Thales also offers enhanced reliability and a smaller environmental footprint, thanks to 25% lower weight and 33% lower power consumption compared to the first generation

The first IESI will enter service in 2027 on the Guépard joint light helicopter, the military version of the H160; it will follow the entry into service of the IESI on the Airbus H135, H145, H160 civil and H175 helicopters, scheduled for early 2026.

“The Thales teams are delighted to have been selected by Airbus Helicopters. Tens of thousands of pilots around the world rely every day and in all circumstances on this safety-critical equipment, which our engineers were first to invent and which has again today demonstrated its importance.” Jean-Paul Ebanga, Vice President, Flight Avionics, Thales.

This latest service entry will be another step in an industry adventure with its roots in France for 30 years. Thales’s Vendôme facility, which has been producing artificial horizons since 1993, became the centre for IESI design, assembly and testing when the Group launched production in the late 1990s. Since then, 30,000 aircraft and helicopters around the world have been equipped with Thales IESI instruments. Three other Thales sites in France are also gearing up for the production and repair of subassemblies for this equipment: Châtellerault, which designs and produces inertial systems, Moirans, which provides the LCD display, and Valence, where the pressure sensors are made."

“It was an honour and a privilege to represent Thales in the Newcastle Leg of the Legacy Centenary Torch Relay. Legacy is very close to my heart, being an Ex-Defence Force Member of over 30 years. I was always involved in supporting Legacy throughout my career.""

The Legacy Centenary Torch Relay, began in Pozieres, France on 23 April 2023 and, after stopping in Belgium and London, is now making its way to all Legacy clubs in Australia. This commemorative journey represents Legacy’s ‘Promise’ made in 1923, to help veterans’ families carry on with their lives after the loss or injury of their loved on.

In addition to personal significance, the torch relay serves as a reminder for unity to support veterans, both within Thales and throughout Australia. Sharen's involvement in this historic event ignited a sense of pride and camaraderie among the local community, including her co-workers.

The Torch will now make its way to Sydney, travelling throughout NSW. For more information on the relay, visit the Legacy Centenary Torch Relay site here."
Coming Soon: “More Secure Driver Licenses and ID Cards for District Residents” - PoPville,"Thu, 06 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvcHZpbGxlLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA3L2RjLW5ldy1kcml2ZXJzLWxpY2Vuc2VzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"From the DMV:

“The DC Department of Motor Vehicles (DC DMV) is bridging technology, exceptional security and an unparalleled design that is uniquely DC with the release of DC’s newly designed driver licenses and identification cards. Created in partnership with Thales Group, this new design will help protect DC residents from identity theft.

“The Bowser Administration continues to work on protecting DC residents in myriad ways, with this being one of them,” said Director Gabriel Robinson. “We wanted to ensure that our DC credentials are one of the most secure in the nation. The new design features vibrant colors, cherry blossoms, the Wood Thrush bird and the Frederick Douglass Memorial Bridge. Even while expanding design options, we are strengthening security.”

DC DMV issues more than 623,000 driver licenses and identification credentials annually to District residents and joins an increasing number of jurisdictions in North America that are switching to Thales’ Group 100% Polycarbonate cards – resulting in more sustainable and secure cards. This new Multiple Laser Image (MLI) feature will bring superior security that will be difficult for counterfeiters to replicate.

“I would like to thank my DC DMV colleagues for working extremely hard for the release of our new credential to help better secure the safety of District residents,” said Director Robinson. “I also would like to thank Thales Group for their partnership.”

Beginning Monday, July 17, Washingtonians who are obtaining or renewing their driver license or identification card in-person will receive their newly designed, updated security credential within 10-15 business days to the mailing address DC DMV has on file. For customers who currently have the previous version of the DC credential, their license or ID card will remain valid until expiration. Eligible customers who are not REAL ID compliant should proceed to a DC DMV Service Center, with all required documents, to be issued a REAL ID credential.”"

The DGA contract covers design and development of the sonar suite for third-generation, sub-surface ballistic nuclear submarines, as well as the detailed design and deployment of the sonar suite for the second-generation vessels.

The French Navy’s Strategic Oceanic Force already operates four Le Triomphant Class strategic missile submarines for permanent nuclear deterrent (SNLE 2G). The next SNLE 3G program is already underway to build the French Navy’s third-generation, nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines for delivery by 2035.

============== ==============

Thales’ new-generation sonar suite, fitted to both generations, will reportedly feature disruptive technologies and large arrays housing a multitude of high-performance sensors supported by powerful big data algorithms to provide a comprehensive picture of the underwater acoustic environment.

The acoustic sensors for the sonar suite are manufactured by Thales in their site in Rydalmere, Australia.

Gwendoline Blandin-Roger, Thales underwater systems vice-president, said the sonar suite will detect, locate, and classify all types of threats at short, medium and long range and provide an unprecedented level of underwater situational awareness.

“This new contract reflects the DGA’s continuing trust in Thales to support its highly strategic nuclear deterrence-related operations,” she said.

“The latest innovations developed by dedicated Thales engineers for the current and future generations of SSBNs will provide the French Navy with a comprehensive acoustic picture of the underwater environment to counter current and future threats, helping to consolidate its position as one of the world’s leading naval forces.”

New sensors will generate significantly larger volumes of data than earlier systems, she said.

The ALICIA data processing system (Analyse, Localisation, Identification, Classification Intégrées et Alertes) will use advanced big data algorithms with intuitive user interfaces to optimise operator workload and provide decision support."

Imperva was founded by Shlomo Kramer, Mickey Boodaei and Amichai Shulman, who are no longer active in the company. Imperva moved its headquarters to the US in 2012 after its Nasdaq IPO, although it was delisted by Thoma Bravo. Today the company has 1,400 employees worldwide including 500 in its Tel Aviv development center.

Most of the company's product development staff are in Israel headed by Imperva Israel general manager Moshe Lipsker, who along with dozens of other senior and veteran employees are expected to exercise options worth millions of dollars.

The Israeli Tax Authority will also profit from the deal through capital gains tax on the options of employees and managers, as well as if Thales requests to transfer to France, or any other country, some of Imperva's intellectual property that is still in Israel. Imperva has over 100 patents, some of which, according to estimates, are still registered in Israel.

Imperva's products protect critical applications, APIs and data anywhere at scale. With an integrated approach combining edge, application security and data security, Imperva protects companies through all stages of their digital journey.

The company's Israeli founders, who no longer even have any shares in Imperva, have all gone on to found startups in more innovative areas of cybersecurity. Kramer founded Cato Networks, which is engaged in network communictions security in the cloud. Boodaei founded Transmit Security, a unicorn which raised over $500 million for managing identity through biometrics, and Shulman founded Nokod several months ago, which is developing cloud applications built in artificial intelligence-based development processes.

The announcement of this initiative was made in 2021, and in April, the Indonesian Parliament officially accepted the donation of fifteen Bushmaster PMVs. Shortly thereafter, TNI soldiers arrived in Darwin to commence a comprehensive training course on these patrol vehicles. The training, facilitated by Thales Digital Systems, encompassed fundamental operations, challenging 4x4 maneuvers, vehicle maintenance, and the use of communication equipment.

Major Matt Breckenridge, who was assigned to the TNI Peacekeeping Centre, oversaw the Bushmaster training in Darwin. The training program began with students familiarizing themselves with the vehicle simulator, where they acquired essential knowledge about PMV operation before progressing to practical exercises in the actual vehicles. The soldiers then ventured into the training area, where they tackled complex terrains and water crossings.

Additionally, the TNI soldiers received instruction on the maintenance and basic servicing of the Bushmaster. Interpreters were present to provide translations, as the selection criteria for TNI students were based on their mechanical proficiency rather than their English language skills. This approach allowed for more in-depth training on maintenance techniques and advanced problem-solving.

""The objective was to equip these soldiers with the necessary skills to operate and maintain the vehicles and associated communication equipment in challenging environments,"" explained Major Breckenridge. ""The Bushmaster is particularly well-suited for missions that involve a heightened risk of ambush, mines, or improvised explosive devices, which are commonly encountered during TNI peacekeeping operations.""

Major Breckenridge highlighted that the TNI ranked as the seventh largest contributor to global peacekeeping operations in terms of personnel and equipment, with over 2500 members deployed at any given time.

During the training, two of the PMVs were already adorned with the internationally recognizable United Nations livery, serving as a meaningful reminder of the important work being undertaken. ""We take great pride in supporting the TNI in developing their peacekeeping capabilities,"" Major Breckenridge expressed.

The training also emphasized the significance of fostering integration and Indo-Pacific partnerships, aligning with the priorities outlined in the Defence Strategic Review. The TNI soldiers had the opportunity to experience the Top End region while building relationships with their hosts at 5RAR.
