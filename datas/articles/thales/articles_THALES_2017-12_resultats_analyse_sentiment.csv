Thales Alenia working with three companies on Deep Space Gateway concepts - SpaceNews,"Fri, 15 Dec 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS90aGFsZXMtYWxlbmlhLXdvcmtpbmctd2l0aC10aHJlZS1jb21wYW5pZXMtb24tZGVlcC1zcGFjZS1nYXRld2F5LWNvbmNlcHRzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"WASHINGTON — Thales Alenia Space is partnering with three U.S. companies that are working on NASA studies of concepts for the proposed Deep Space Gateway, leveraging its expertise in space station and cargo module development.

Thales announced Dec. 14 that Boeing was the latest company it was working with as part of NASA’s Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships (NextSTEP) 2 effort. Thales has previously also been working with Lockheed Martin and Orbital ATK. Thales did not disclose the value of the individual contracts with the three companies.

For all three companies, Thales is providing expertise in areas such as structures, environmental controls and thermal controls, said Walter Cugno, vice president of Thales Alenia Space’s exploration and sciences domain, in a call with reporters. The company’s contributions are currently limited to studies, he said, and does not include hardware at this time.

Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Orbital ATK are three of the six companies that received NextSTEP-2 awards from NASA in 2016. The other awardees are Bigelow Aerospace, NanoRacks and Sierra Nevada Corporation. The awards are structured as public private partnerships, with companies contributing their own funds in addition to NASA funding, which has a combined value of $65 million.

Most of the companies with NextSTEP-2 awards are working on concepts for habitation modules that could be used on missions beyond Earth orbit, such as the agency’s proposed Deep Space Gateway in cislunar space. The awards cover technology development as well as construction of groundbased prototypes.

The NanoRacks award, part of a consortium that includes Space Systems Loral and United Launch Alliance, was focused on a short-term study examining the feasibility of converting an Atlas 5 upper stage into a habitation module that could be attached to the International Space Station or commercial station. The company said that study, recently completed, confirmed that approach was viable.

Thales Alenia Space is taking different approaches with the three NextSTEP-2 companies it is working with. The work with Orbital ATK, Cugno said, is focused on adapting the Cygnus spacecraft for deep space applications. Thales Alenia provides the pressurized cargo module for Cygnus cargo missions to the space station.

The work with Boeing and Lockheed Martin, he said, is based on those companies’ own, separate concepts for habitation modules. “We use our knowledge on thermal, mechanical and environmental designs and system architecture, but implementing that in slightly different applications,” he said.

That work, he added, is informed by the experience Thales has from developing modules for the ISS. “We try to fit that into a very different environment,” he said. The work is expected to take place through 2018 and into 2019.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999961853027344}",neutral,0.9999961853027344,0
Thales agrees to buy Gemalto in digital security deal worth ~$5.43BN - TechCrunch,"Sun, 17 Dec 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaGNydW5jaC5jb20vMjAxNy8xMi8xNy90aGFsZXMtYWdyZWVzLXRvLWJ1eS1nZW1hbHRvLWluLWRpZ2l0YWwtc2VjdXJpdHktZGVhbC13b3J0aC01LTQzYm4v0gFpaHR0cHM6Ly90ZWNoY3J1bmNoLmNvbS8yMDE3LzEyLzE3L3RoYWxlcy1hZ3JlZXMtdG8tYnV5LWdlbWFsdG8taW4tZGlnaXRhbC1zZWN1cml0eS1kZWFsLXdvcnRoLTUtNDNibi9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Digital security solutions provider Gemalto has agreed to a €51 per share acquisition offer from French aerospace and defense group Thales — in a deal worth around $5.43BN.

The unanimously board approved all-cash offer represents a premium of 57% over the closing price of Gemalto stock as of 8 December 2017.

In a statement today recommending Thales’ offer, CEO Philippe Vallée said: “I am convinced that the combination with Thales is the best and the most promising option for Gemalto and the most positive outcome for our company, employees, clients, shareholders and other stakeholders,” adding that it would enable Gemalto to “accelerate its development and deliver its digital security vision”.

Last week the Gemalto board rejected a €46 per share offer from French IT services company Atos, saying it significantly undervalued the company.

Gemalto is a major producer of SIM cards and NFC for mobile phones but also provides secure transaction solutions to banks, including EMV chip cards, payment terminals and user authentication systems for online banking, such as one-time token generating hardware devices for 2FA. It also sells identity and access control solutions to the public sector, including biometric authentication technologies for government-issued ID documents such as passports.

Another branch of its business is in enterprise security, including encryption and cloud security services. It also plays in the Internet of Things space — offering connectivity, security and monetization services.

The Thales Group, which focuses on aerospace, defense, space and transportation, also operates a security division offering solutions in areas such as critical information system operations, airport security systems and cryptology and security architectures for big data. This is where it’s intending Gemalto to slot in.

Patrice Caine, Thales’s chairman and CEO, said the pair’s aim is to create a global leader in digital security.

“The acquisition of Gemalto marks a key milestone in the implementation of Thales’s strategy,” he said in a statement. “Together with Gemalto’s management, we have big ambitions based on a shared vision of the digital transformation of our industries and customers. Our project will be beneficial to innovation and employment, whilst respecting sovereign strategic technologies.”

Over the past three years, Thales says it has ramped up its focus on digital technologies — noting it has invested more than €1BN in connectivity, cybersecurity, data analytics and artificial intelligence (including acquiring Sysgo, Vormetric and Guavus).

It adds that the integration of Gemalto “strongly accelerates” this strategy, reinforcing its digital offering across its five vertical markets.

Specifically it’s eyeing adding Gemalto’s more than €3BN of revenue to its digital business sales and bagging a set of relevant “technologies and competencies” for the vertical markets where it plays.

Thales intends to combine its digital businesses into Gemalto which will continue to operate under its own brand, with Vallée leading the combined unit — and as one of the seven Thales global business units.

The combined Group will have more than 28,000 engineers, 3,000 researchers, and will invest more than €1BN in self-funded R&D, it said.

Thales added that it does not anticipate any reduction in Gemalto’s workforce as a consequence of the transaction.

The transaction is dependent on shareholder and regulatory approvals and clearances — with closure slated for the second half of 2018.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9959740042686462}",positive,0.9959740042686462,1
"Thales Acquires Gemalto for $5.6B, Creating Digital Security Giant - eWeek","Mon, 18 Dec 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV3ZWVrLmNvbS9zZWN1cml0eS90aGFsZXMtYWNxdWlyZXMtZ2VtYWx0by1mb3ItNS42Yi10by1jcmVhdGUtZ2xvYmFsLXNlY3VyaXR5LWdpYW50L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales announced on Dec. 17 that it will acquire digital security vendor Gemalto in a deal valued at 4.8 billion euros, or $5.6 billion.

Gemalto was pursued by French firm Atos, which announced its intention to acquire Gemalto on Dec. 13. Atos offered 46 euros per Gemalto share, while Thales is offering 51 euros per Gemalto share. While the Atos offer was rejected, Gemalto’s board of directors unanimously approved Thales’ offer.

“Over the past 12 months we have been investigating internally the merits of the combination with Gemalto, recently reaching the conclusion that there was a real opportunity to build a combination that would be attractive for both stakeholders,” Patrice Caine, chairman and CEO of Thales, said in a conference call with financial analysts and the press.

Thales’ bid is a friendly offer, with the goal of further developing Gemalto within Thales, Caine said. Gemalto helps to enable trust in the digital world and is a global specialist in authentication systems and data protection, he added.

“From our point of view, Gemalto serves two broad applications, the security of identities and the security of connected data and objects,” Caine said.

Gemalto’s product offerings include smart card and EMV payment cards, and the company also has expertise in government e-documents security as well as biometrics. Plus, the Gemalto portfolio is also attractive to Thales in the area of connected data and objects, according to Caine.

“Gemalto is ideally positioned to address the security of the industrial internet of things, thanks to the combination of its unique expertise in mobile embedded software and enterprise security,” he said.

In terms of market opportunity, EMV card adoption is not universal around the world, with significant opportunity for growth in the years ahead, Caine said. He also sees a large opportunity for growth in IoT and enterprise security.

According to Caine, Thales is active in five key areas: aeronautics, space, ground transportation, defense and security. Thales has been actively investing in recent years to grow its technology base and market reach, specifically in the areas of data analytics and security. In October 2015, Thales acquired data encryption vendor Vormetric for $400 million. In April 2017, Thales acquired machine learning vendor Guavus for $215 million.

Caine said Gemalto is a complementary fit for Thales that will help the company address and secure all steps of the digital decision chain, from data generation to real-time decision making.

“Gemalto brings expertise in endpoint security, while Thales has cloud and data protection,” he said.

According to Caine, the combination of Thales and Gemalto will create a world leader in security that is second behind only Symantec in terms of revenue. The combined company will have a portfolio of over 20,000 patents and will invest 1 billion euros a year on research and development efforts.

“Gemalto will become our global security business unit, representing about 20 percent of Thales group revenue,” he said. “In parallel with its crucial mass of 16,000 employees, this new GBU [global business unit] will become a powerful driver of digital transformation across all our vertical markets.”

Thales won a bidding war against Atos to take over the French chipmaker.

Acquisitions continue to occur in the cybersecurity industry, this time with aerospace and defense group Thales purchasing Gemalto, a chipmaker, for $5.6 billion dollars. This comes on the heels of two cybersecurity titans, Symantec and Comodo, selling the majority shares of their CAs.

Thales bid trumped another French firm, Atos, who was also attempting to take over Gemalto.

Gemalto was attempting to switch from phone SIM cards to security services like encryption and biometric passports, but had suffered through a difficult year in which profit warnings diminished its share prices.

Thales came in and offered 51 euros per share, Atos offered 46, Thales came away the winner. Atos has said it will not pursue its bid, but will be available should the deal with Thales fall through.

“This is a terrific project,” Thales CEO Patrice Caine told Reuters on Sunday. “In digital, Gemalto and Thales are like twins.”

The agreement will merge Thales’ digital activities with Gemalto to create a top-three global player in the security industry.

The deal is expected to close in the latter half of 2018. Thales does not expect job losses from the takeover, it’s pledged to maintain current jobs levels until at least the end of 2019. That doesn’t refer to Gemalto’s struggling SIM chip business. A union leader at Gemalto has said he plans to call on the chipmaker to drop a plan that would cut 288 jobs.

Part of what helped facilitate this deal is that both Gemalto and Thales are largely backed by French government entities. Thales’ main stakeholder is the French government itself while Gemalto’s primary backing comes from Bpifrance, a state-owned bank.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9995813965797424}",neutral,0.9995813965797424,0

PARIS (Reuters) - Shares in defense group Thales rose on Monday after chipmaker Gemalto accepted the French company's 4.8 billion euro ($5.66 billion) takeover bid to create a leader in digital security.

Thales' chief executive Patrice Caine made his move just days after Gemalto had knocked back a 4.3 billion euro offer from French rival Atos .

Thales shares surged 7.81 percent to 93 euros at 0952 GMT, while Amsterdam-listed Gemalto's shares were up 5.47 percent at 49.38 euros, just below Thales' 51 euro per share basic offer.

The planned merger highlights the increasingly blurred lines between industrial and software companies as they try to grab a share of the fast-growing digital security market.

""In terms of DNA, the two companies look much more alike,"" said Richard-Maxime Beaudoux, an analyst at Bryan, Garnier & Co.

""It's not a financial deal, which was the case for Atos. They gave it a try, it was opportunistic.""

The takeover ends a difficult year for Gemalto, which has made a series of profit warnings that hurt its shares and overshadowed its attempt to shift from a slowing market for phone SIM cards toward security services such as data encryption and biometric passports.

""Our intention is to keep all of the assets in Gemalto's portfolio,"" Caine said in a call with analysts, suggesting that SIM card operations remained core alongside Gemalto's growing focus on cybersecurity.

Thales forecast that Gemalto's revenues would grow 5 percent annually and said it expected Gemalto's EBIT margin to exceed its own within two or three years of the merger.

Under the deal, unanimously recommended by the boards of both companies, Thales will merge its digital assets with Gemalto to create a business headed by Gemalto CEO Philippe Vallee.

Vallee on Monday said he would stick to a plan to cut 288 jobs in its struggling SIM card business in France.

""This plan is maintained,"" he told BFM business radio, adding that he would try to redeploy staff internally where possible.

Caine later told a news conference that Gemalto's staff would have the opportunity to get jobs at Naval Group, part of Thales.

That doesn’t seem to be the case as Gemalto execs gasp in amazement as Thales flops out its throbbing bid, reports Telecoms.com (Banking Technology‘s sister publication).

Thales has stepped into the game with a bid of €51 per share, roughly a 6% premium on the closing price prior to the weekend, totalling €4.76 billion. Gemalto executives have told local press the pair have been in discussions for months, though the somewhat-surprising entry of Thales has beat back suitor Atos.

“The acquisition of Gemalto marks a key milestone in the implementation of Thales’s strategy,” says Patrice Caine, Thales’s CEO. “Together with Gemalto’s management, we have big ambitions based on a shared vision of the digital transformation of our industries and customers.”

Bringing Gemalto into the Thales business will support the lumbering titan’s slow stagger into the digital world. Gemalto certainly adds to the digital product portfolio, as well as €3 billion in annual sales, as the team sets its sights on security in the internet of things (IoT), mobile and cloud world.

Last week, Atos made a €4.3 billion bid for Gemalto, a 42% premium on the Gemalto share price immediately before the bid, though a lukewarm reception cast doubts over a deal. Reasons cited were exactly as you would expect; potential growth meant this bid shouldn’t be taken seriously, however, Thales’ giant wad seemed to have caused a few blushes around the boardroom.

“The board of directors, after full and careful review, together with its financial and legal advisors, of the various options available to the company, has established unanimously that the Thales offer is in the best interests of Gemalto and all its stakeholders,” says Alex Mandl, chairman of Gemalto’s board of directors.

Of course, this is about more than money though; a tie up with Thales will offer greater opportunities for the Gemalto business.

“As a result, the Gemalto board of directors unanimously recommends the Thales offer to its shareholders,” adds Mandl, before retiring in a flurry of giggles and blushes to the safety of the boardroom.

While this will not comfort those with smaller wallets, just remember, you have a nice personality which is more than enough (apparently).","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999839067459106}",neutral,0.9999839067459106,0

PARIS (Reuters) - Shares in French defence electronics maker Thales (TCFP.PA) jumped more than 8 percent on Monday after chipmaker Gemalto (GTO.AS) accepted its 4.8 billion euro ($5.7 bln) takeover bid to create a leader in digital security.

Thales Chief Executive Patrice Caine, who made his move just days after Gemalto had knocked back a 4.3 billion-euro (£3.78 billion) offer from French rival Atos (ATOS.PA), said on Sunday that Gemalto had agreed to the takeover.

Atos said it would not engage in a bidding war but would be open to further discussions with Gemalto should the Thales deal collapse.

Thales shares closed up 8.25 percent at 93.40 euros, while Amsterdam-listed Gemalto's shares ended 5.6 percent higher at 49.47 euros, just below Thales' 51 euro per share basic offer.

The planned merger highlights the increasingly blurred lines between industrial and software companies which are both vying for a share of the fast-growing digital security market as companies seek more online security.

""In terms of DNA, the two companies look much more alike,"" said Richard-Maxime Beaudoux, an analyst at Bryan, Garnier & Co.

""It's not a financial deal, which was the case for Atos. They gave it a try; it was opportunistic.""

The French state is the largest shareholder in Thales, while state-owned bank Bpifrance is Gemalto's second-biggest shareholder. A French government source said Thales had told the Gemalto board that it was the better fit.

Under the deal, unanimously recommended by the boards of both companies, Thales will merge its digital assets with Gemalto to create a unit headed by Gemalto CEO Philippe Vallee.

TOUGH YEAR

Thales's proposed takeover ends a difficult year for Gemalto, which has made a series of profit warnings that hurt its shares and overshadowed its attempt to shift away from a slowing market for phone SIM cards towards security services such as data encryption and biometric passports.

""Our intention is to keep all of the assets in Gemalto's portfolio,"" Caine told analysts, suggesting that SIM card operations remained core alongside Gemalto's growing focus on cybersecurity.

He said he had been in talks with Gemalto for several months.

Thales forecast that Gemalto's revenues would grow 5 percent annually and said it expected Gemalto's EBIT margin to exceed its own within two or three years of the merger.

Thales and Gemalto said on Sunday that the digital security entity would generate sales of 3.5 billion euros - one fifth of Thales' total revenues - and pre-tax cost synergies of between 100 million and 150 million euros by 2021.

Vallee on Monday said he would stick to a plan to cut 288 jobs in Gemalto's struggling SIM card business in France.

""This plan is maintained,"" he told BFM business radio, adding that he would try to redeploy staff internally.

Iridium and SpaceX rose to the occasion, since they reused the first stage of the rocket that had already launched the second batch of Iridium NEXT satellites into orbit on June 25, 2017 – making Iridium the first company to reuse a SpaceX rocket stage within the same program. The Iridium® NEXT satellites that will be launched during the fifth and sixth launches are already available and are scheduled to launch out of Vandenberg Air Force Base in the first half of 2018.





Global coverage

The Iridium NEXT constellation, built by Thales Alenia Space as prime contractor for Iridium, offers global connectivity via 66 interconnected satellites at an altitude of 780 kilometers. An additional nine spare satellites will be launched to a parking orbit, and six more spares will remain on the ground. This global network provides unrivaled capacity for communications on the move (people, land vehicles, aircraft, ships), and operates worldwide, including over oceans and the poles. There are nearly one million Iridium subscribers worldwide.





Designed to save lives



Thanks to its global coverage and independent operation, not requiring ground infrastructure all over the world, Iridium NEXT provides vital assistance under very challenging conditions, such as in isolated areas, during natural disasters or conflicts, etc. In the autumn of 2017 the system took over significant amounts of phone traffic for the terrestrial network in Puerto Rico, when nearly all of it had been destroyed by Hurricane Maria. Its independence from ground infrastructures enables secure and reliable communications when needed most.





Thales Alenia Space’s role



As program prime contractor, Thales Alenia Space is in charge of defining, producing and testing the complete Iridium NEXT system.

A challenging program!

The challenge facing Thales Alenia Space on this program was not only to deliver the satellites, but above all, having to show that it was capable of commissioning a complete system, while ensuring its compatibility with the previous generation of satellites. The Iridium NEXT satellites in the first three launches showed that they were compatible with the system already in place, while results of the initial functional tests were in line with, and even exceeded, Iridium’s expectations.



Thales Alenia Space is a major actor in low and medium orbit constellations of communications satellites, having produced 125 satellites as prime contractor for programs including Globalstar 2 (24), O3b (20) and Iridium® NEXT (81). The company began to build up this expertise in early 1990s, when it made the payloads for 72 satellites in the first-generation Globalstar system, along with the thermo-mechanical structures in the platform, while also handling assembly, integration and testing (AIT) operations for all satellites.



The success of this fourth launch for Iridium NEXT further consolidates the company’s reputation for unexcelled expertise as prime contractor for sophisticated satcom systems.

In 2007, the British government ordered two new aircraft carriers. 10 years later the first of these, HMS Queen Elizabeth, entered service. We are now witnessing a landmark moment in the long history of the Royal Navy.At 280 metres long and with four-acre flight decks, the ships are not only the largest and most powerful warships in UK history but also rank amongst the world’s most capable aircraft carriers. And they are going to be with us for the next 50 years.In a world of intensifying global threats, we will all rely on HMS Queen Elizabeth and her sister ship, HMS Prince of Wales, to protect our national and international interests. But while we are all relying on the Royal Navy, the Royal Navy is relying on Thales. That’s nothing new. Thales has been supporting the Royal Navy for 100 years. The ever-deepening relationship can be traced right the way back to 1917, when we began equipping the navy’s submarines with periscopes.Today, almost every single submarine and surface ship in the fleet uses various combinations of our sonar, radar, communications, electro-optical systems and electronic warfare technology.

What was truly revolutionary was the sheer scale of the project, delivered through a unique partnering relationship between Thales, BAE Systems, Babcock and the UK Ministry of Defence, in an enterprise known as the Aircraft Carrier Alliance.





All hands on deck

As a founding member of the Aircraft Carrier Alliance, Thales has been deeply involved in the provision of the radar, communications, power and propulsion systems right from the start.

Competitive instincts were put aside and everyone worked in the best interests of the project; in the best interests of the Royal Navy and of the United Kingdom.



At its peak, the programme directly employed 8,000 people across six sites and a further 3,000 across the supply chain. Working together, members of the Alliance embraced a collective culture of trust, collaboration, innovation and mutual support.



Capability through collaboration

Close collaboration and a spirit of teamwork within the Aircraft Carrier Alliance created a solid foundation for equipping the new carriers with world-class capabilities. Thales and BAE Systems, for example, delivered the long-range S1850M radar, which can track up to 1,000 air targets simultaneously, at a range of around 400 kilometres.



Another radar system, is capable of detecting objects as small as a tennis ball, travelling at three times the speed of sound more than 25 Km away.



A fully integrated communications system provided by Thales is providing everything from on-board WiFi to satellite connectivity, as well as internal ship-wide communications, plus ship-to-ship, ship-to-air and ship-to-shore comms with complete security.



For power, Thales led a sub-alliance to deliver engines, generators and a distribution network which can generate 110 MW of electrical power - enough for a large town.

Both ships are driven by Rolls-Royce MT30 gas turbines, the most powerful in- service systems in the world. These drive two giant propellers, each weighing 33 tonnes, which can propel the 65,000 tonne carriers at speeds in excess of 25 knots.



The ships will also be protected by Merlin helicopters, one type fitted with the Thales Cerberus mission system and Searchwater radar for airborne early warning and the other with Thales FLASH dipping sonar for detecting enemy submarines.





Sea, air and land. Whatever it takes.

The Queen Elizabeth Class carriers will be used by all three sectors of the UK Armed Forces and are versatile enough to be used for operations ranging from deterrence and conflict, to humanitarian aid and disaster relief, to international influence and diplomacy.



Building her was an enormous achievement which epitomises an ethos of teamwork and a commitment to do ‘whatever it takes’ – a mirror to the values instilled in our armed forces.

From 21 to 24 November, a series of full-scale operational demonstrations of SYNAPS, the new generation of software-defined radios from Thales, was successfully completed in Chantilly, France. Representatives of more than 20 armed forces who are already Thales customers had a chance to witness the outstanding performance of this new-generation radio family, which was launched at the Eurosatory exhibition in June 2016.

Thales is supporting the digital transformation of the armed forces and has developed SYNAPS to provide the tactical network capability they need for real-time collaborative combat. The system provides the optimum combination of high data rates, security, integrity and confidentiality. It is the only system of its kind in the marketplace and represents a great leap forward in radio communications for the armed forces.

The SYNAPS radio is based on developments conducted for CONTACT, Europe's largest software radio programme, which was awarded to Thales in June 2012 by the French defence procurement agency (DGA) and will equip the French armed forces from 2019.



About SYNAPS

SYNAPS is built around technologies compliant with the latest NATO and international coalition standards, most notably the ESSOR (European Secure Software Defined Radio) high-data-rate standard, developed by the armed forces of six European nations (Finland, France, Italy, Poland, Spain and Sweden). ESSOR is also a candidate for the NATO specification and standard. In addition, SYNAPS radios are reprogrammable and ready to accommodate new standards in the future.

SYNAPS radio communication systems offer user services including voice, messaging, video, chat and Blue Force Tracking simultaneously and with differentiated quality of service, with the most critical data transfers being accorded priority status. SYNAPS radio communication systems provide the optimum combination of data rates, security and connectivity and adapt automatically as operational deployments are reconfigured during a mission.

SYNAPS is suitable for forces of various sizes ranging from a few dozen users to joint brigade level deployments.

SYNAPS is designed for all types of users, all platform types and all branches of the armed forces as well as joint, combined arms and allied operations.

Welcome to the carrier's tower of air power - Thales,"Wed, 06 Dec 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi91bml0ZWQta2luZ2RvbS9uZXdzL3dlbGNvbWUtY2FycmllcnMtdG93ZXItYWlyLXBvd2Vy0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Imagine the glass of a flying control tower so strong that it could withstand a strike equivalent to a direct hit from the blade tip of a Chinook helicopter... Welcome on board HMS Queen Elizabeth.

With more than 10,000 people involved in the Queen Elizabeth Class programme, the delivery of the Royal Navy’s two aircraft carriers has been an engineering challenge on an unprecedented scale right across the UK supply chain.

The Aircraft Carrier Alliance (ACA) has brought together specialist companies and experts across industry to provide the most innovative solutions. And one of the most distinguishing features of the ship – her unique twin island design – incorporates supply chain partnering at its best.

As a founding member of the ACA, Thales (like its partners BAE, Babcock and the Ministry of Defence) has specific responsibilities within the alliance. One of these is the leadership of the platform design and aviation teams.

The unique twin islands means that the ship has a dedicated rear island to direct air operations, while the forward island and bridge controls the ship’s navigation. Both islands are designed to switch functionality if required, giving the carrier a key redundancy factor in an operational environment.

The glass flying control position (or FLYCO), fitted onto the rear island, is the operational centre controlling all air operations and is closely linked to the ship’s operations room, navigation bridge, flight deck and hangar operations centre.

As part of its aviation lead responsibilities, Thales led the procurement of the FLYCO from the Special Projects division of Ipswich-based key supplier Tex ATC Ltd, one of the world’s leading providers of military and civilian airfield visual control rooms.

The FLYCO position provides the operators with an unparalleled operational working space, with three metre tall specially glazed panels, giving more than 290 degrees of view over the flight deck. The multi-layered glass – designed to provide solar and noise protection – is also incredibly strong.

Thales originally approached Tex ATC as an acknowledged specialist in delivering state-of-the-art flying control solutions. The company had previously designed and built the visual control room at RAF Coningsby in preparation for the arrival of the Typhoon aircraft.

Tex ATC’s experience in specialist control environments for military applications led to their delivery of visual control rooms at RAF Linton-on-Ouse, RAF Mildenhall, RNAS Yeovilton and Camp Bastion in Afghanistan. Around 100 people in the company and its supply chain have been involved in the delivery of the FLYCO.

Stretching for 57km beneath the Alps and completed a year ahead of schedule, Switzerland’s new Gotthard base tunnel is the longest and deepest railway tunnel ever built. Thales’ cutting-edge signalling holds the key to getting the most out of this vital strategic asset.

Throughout history, the Alps have stood as a formidable natural barrier to human mobility – a rocky, beautiful and in places impenetrable mountain range, curving for more than 1,000km across the heart of Europe.

A new generation of tunnels is challenging the dominance of the Alps and redrawing the map of Europe in the process. Gotthard, the newest and longest trans-Alpine rail tunnel, is the centrepiece of an ambitious programme to boost Switzerland’s rail connectivity, cut road traffic and safeguard the Alpine environment. The tunnel was built by AlpTransit Gotthard AG, a subsidiary of Swiss Federal Railways (SBB), on behalf of the Swiss federal government.





Signal strength

Advanced rail signalling is playing a vital part in realising the dream of high-speed Alpine transport. As partner and prime contractor of theTranstec Gotthard consortium, Thales signed a CHF 2 billion contract for the installation of railway technology on 29 April 2008. Thales not only provided the general project manager of the consortium but also staffed key functions such as RAMS management (reliability, availability, maintainability and safety), finance and head of commissioning.

“Thales’ role was to supply the overall signalling system for the Gotthard tunnel,” explains Denis Laroche, vice president, business development, Thales. “This is an electronic system that controls the trains and ensures safe operations.”

The signalling deployed in Gotthard is ETCS Level 2, which uses continuous radio communications to link the train with the signalling system. This makes it possible to run trains safely at speeds of up to 250kmh. ETCS Level 2 is a service-proven solution with a long track record: Thales implemented the same system for Gotthard’s sister tunnel, the Lötschberg base tunnel, opened in 2007.

Perhaps surprisingly, there are no signals anywhere inside the Gotthard tunnel. Instead, all the information train drivers need is provided via a cab signalling display. This is essential because conventional trackside signals cannot be reliably sighted at high speeds.

“Running trains through a tunnel with significant capacity and at high speed is a very delicate thing,” says Dr Alfred Veider,Thales’ vice president of strategy and product policy for main line signalling. “A superior train control system is absolutely mandatory.”

As well as supporting faster journeys and meeting the demand for up to 300 trains per day, ETCS is designed to enable borderless journeys across Europe with no need to change locomotives to accommodate different train control systems.

“Switzerland was one of the first countries to adopt ETCS and its main line network is a reference for the world,” notes Laroche. “Gotthard is at the heart of Europe’s railway system and it is part of the transport corridor between Rotterdam and Genoa in Italy, so the project is vital not only for Switzerland but also for Europe.”

The tunnel promises faster, greener freight movements and dramatic improvements in journey times for passengers. The new high-speed link will cut the travel time from Zurich to Milan to just over three hours – slicing 40 minutes off the current fastest trip.





Starting from scratch

Bringing a modern railway tunnel to life is a complex business. In the case of Gotthard, there are two parallel tunnels – or ‘tubes’ – to handle traffic in each direction. Excavating and lining the tunnels 2,300m beneath the Gotthard massif took more than a decade. The job of transforming these bare concrete-lined tubes into a fully-functioning high speed railway with track, power and signalling was carried out by Transtec Gotthard – the consortium responsible for the delivery of the project. Thales played an active role in the management of the consortium.

In the beginning, “it was a great challenge to effectively bring together the different cultures and interests of the consortium partners for the greatest good of the project,” according to Kurt Sauerwein, managing director of Thales Rail Signalling Solutions.

To meet the challenging requirements of a three-minute signal headway in mixed traffic of up to 250 kmh,Thales developed several new functions that allow ETCS L2, one RBC (radio block centre), four interlocking systems and CTC (centralised traffic control) to interact closely.

So how do you set about turning an empty tunnel into a high- performance railway? “The first step is providing temporary installations,” explains Peter Huber, general project manager,Transtec Gotthard. “You need a 50Hz power supply, lighting, telecoms and air conditioning. We installed all of this first.”

Air conditioning may sound like a luxury in a railway tunnel. In fact, work would have been impossible without it. Heat generated by the huge overburden of rock means that the temperature inside the tunnel can reach a sweltering 46 degrees centigrade. Air conditioning and ventilation helped to get the temperature down to a more bearable 29 degrees. Track was installed first, followed by catenary – the network of overhead conductor wires that provides 15,000 volts traction power to the trains. Although many of the components are big and heavy, all were painstakingly positioned with tolerances measured in fractions of a millimetre. Signalling equipment was installed once the heavy track work was complete.





Underground movement

Working in the world’s longest rail tunnel comes with its own special challenges. Getting to work is one of them. “Logistics are extremely complex in projects such as this,” says Laroche. “It takes a long time for people to get to work in the middle of the tunnel, so transport has to be perfectly organised.”



Walking to work was out of the question (it takes more than 11 hours to get from one end of the tunnel to the other) so temporary trains were provided.

For Verena Tschirner, Thales’ deputy commissioning coordinator, a typical working day would start with a rail journey to the heart of a mountain. “We used a special train to get to the centre of the tunnel which took around 50 minutes. All of the workers went on this train and returned on it in the evening.”

With up to 780 people doing different jobs in and around the tunnel at the peak of the project, careful coordination and planning were vital. “Signalling was the last piece of the puzzle,” says Tschirner. “Before you can install it, all the other pieces have to be in place, such as the radio network and power supplies. Teamwork and good communications are essential. My job was to organise all the interactions withTranstec to make sure we could create the perfect schedule.”

The collaborative approach adopted by the consortium partners paid dividends. “In spite of the complexity of the programme, we successfully delivered the whole railway system for the tunnel, includingThales’ signalling system, one year in advance,” says Huber.

“All of this was only achievable because of a highly motivated team, adds Sauerwein. “From the very start, we worked transparently and as ‘OneThales’ with our colleagues in Germany (RBC, axle counters), Austria (ELEKTRA interlocking) and Portugal (safe signalling data network).”





Plug and play

Smooth implementation of the tunnel signalling was helped by two things. First, ETCS requires less trackside hardware than conventional systems because no signals are needed. Second, a huge amount of preparatory work was done before implementation began. “We were already six years into the project when we started work on site at the end of 2013, so we had a good head start,” says Leif Leopold, general project manager, Thales.

Lab testing was a crucial part of the job: the signalling solution brings together several different vital systems, all of which must work together perfectly. “Testing was carried out at our dedicated lab in Zurich over a period of four years,” explains Leopold. “This allowed us to simulate the operation of the new rail link while the tunnel was still being built.”

Basing the test lab in Switzerland contributed to the success of the project, says Leopold: “It builds trust and makes for a good working relationship with the customer. We also had very few changes in our core team over the eight years of the project – keeping the same expert people together is very important.”

Signalling systems such as ETCS Level 2 are designed to route and control trains, maintain safe separation and prevent conflicting movements. In very long tunnels, however, the confined environment means something extra is needed to protect passengers in the event of an emergency. In the case of Gotthard, the solution was to install an emergency tunnel automation system. If a fire is detected, for example, the system kicks in within seconds, initiating an intelligent evacuation of the tunnel that takes into account the state of the traffic and the location of the hazard. “The system’s algorithms work out the best evacuation plan far quicker than a human being,” says Leopold.

Developments of this sort underline the way that signalling is becoming a focal point for innovation. Tunnel safety is one example. Capacity enhancements are another. Integrating signalling and traffic management, for example, allows operators to predict and resolve traffic conflicts long before they cause disruption. “Traffic management makes it possible to get the best out of the network every day,” says Veider. “This is a new source of value for operators and Thales is positioned very well in this field.”





The way ahead

Future developments promise even greater efficiency gains. ETCS Level 3 – the next evolutionary leap for rail signalling – will introduce ‘moving block’ technology to main lines, allowing operators to run more trains on the same track. To do this, trains will need to be able to determine their own position without trackside infrastructure.

Thales is committed to ETCS Level 3 and is actively involved in developing the standard. The Group’s expertise in both rail signalling and aerospace is a differentiator: among the technologies being evaluated are satellite positioning and inertial navigation. A Thales TopAxyz inertial measurement unit has already been successfully used to gather positioning data inside the Gotthard tunnel.

As well as boosting capacity, the introduction of ETCS Level 3 is likely to accelerate the pace of automation. Automatic train operation (ATO), for example, has been used in metro systems for more than 30 years, but remains a rarity on main lines. That could be about to change.

“ETCS Level 3 paves the way for fly-by-wire operation for trains,” says Veider. “As soon as you have radio communications with the train, there’s much greater scope for ATO or even autonomous trains running on a radio link. And with ETCS, that radio link is already there.”

You’re a previous winner of the 2014 Young Women Engineer of the Year Awards. What did the recognition mean to you?

Female engineers are passionate problem solvers, who impact virtually all aspects of our everyday lives. Naomi Mitchison is no exception – winner of the 2014 Young Woman Engineer of the Year awards, she has now returned to the ceremonial stage; this time as a judge. Here, Naomi shares her story, along with advice for future finalists.

It was amazing to win, and to be given a platform where I could voice my opinion.

Furthermore, the extent of support within the community of engineers that were nominated was wonderful. The 2013 winner emailed me her congratulations and offered me advice and support. It felt like such a welcoming community of engineers, almost like a sisterhood. Being chosen as an ambassador for engineering, travelling all over the country to attend conferences, and attend discussions is brilliant. What you don’t realise however, is what a steep learning curve and how people-orientated the role is! I went from getting involved in talks at schools to speaking in front of politicians, and being asked to contribute to STEM policy in Scotland. Having input into such critical decisions was particularly meaningful.



Now you’re returning as a judge, what kind of things will you be looking for?

You have got to be able to bring engineering to life, regardless of who you are talking to. Being able to talk about something with such conviction that it grabs an audience and makes them investigate further, is crucial. Coming from an international background, you learn how to speak to people with different cultural backgrounds and that as a general skill does help you in engineering. Engineering is a rewarding and interesting career opportunity, being an ambassador is about showing young women what a diverse, interesting and challenging career choice it is.

What does it mean to you to come back as a judge?

Six young female engineers working on projects ranging from emerging defence technologies to new Apple products have all been shortlisted and I want all of them to win. As I’ve been in their shoes, I knew what type of person we were looking for, the type of challenges that person may face and what expectations were of the winner. Someone who is brilliant at both the technical, but also the personal, and is comfortable talking to and interpreting engineering in an interesting and captivating way.

As a judge, you have to almost climb into the psyche of the person you are interviewing, and to establish what their motivation is for winning, what their leadership skills are like, and whether they are able to create a top level overview of why engineering is critical to our workforce and economy. It's got to be fun, accessible and interesting to engage everyone from kids to politicians. It’s got to be fun for kids, explanatory for parliament and interesting for engineers. Einstein said “if you can’t explain it simply, you haven’t understood it well enough”. There’s a lot of truth in that.



What is your current role at Thales?

I'm the Deputy Electronic Engineering Manager in Glasgow, so working as both an engineer and a manager. We are currently redesigning a sighting system that is used by the military for awareness. These sighting systems work within a system of thermal imaging units and day camera, which are used to keep soldiers and civilians safe.

What has been your proudest moment at Thales?

When I first joined Thales, my colleagues and I ran a stand at The Big Bang Fair, which is the UK Young Scientist and Engineers Fair. Seeing children and teenagers together and being genuinely interested and invested in learning about STEM and engineering was really rewarding. These fun and hands-on activities give the children a sense of achievement but also reminded me how much fun it is to build things, which was one of the reasons I became an engineer in the first place. I’m passionate about others joining me in engineering and so in that moment, seeing the interest and fascination first hand was particularly special to me.

This weekend, Transport for London (TfL) engineers completed their biggest test to date of brand new signalling that will bring more frequent and reliable journeys to 40% of the Tube network.

Engineers from TfL and Thales worked around the clock, rigorously testing trains on a new computer-based signalling and control system between Hammersmith and Edgware Road, which will be the first section of the Tube to go live with the new signalling system in 2018.

Brand New Signalling System

The new Thales signalling and control system will allow trains to run closer together, meaning a more frequent service and shorter waiting times for customers. Similar technology, which means thousands more passengers can be carried each hour, is used on the Jubilee and Northern lines. Customers using the Victoria line are already experiencing the benefits of shorter waiting times following a separate upgrade of its signalling system, which finished in May.

Shaun Jones, Vice-President, Transport at Thales in the UK, said:

This is another great achievement for our teams in creating a world-class transport network for London. Together, we are making great progress with testing our state-of-the-art radio communications technology on some of the oldest parts of the underground, which will deliver better, more reliable journeys on 40% of the network for TfL customers.

Boosting Capacity and Accessibility

When the signalling upgrade is completed customers will benefit from a massive boost in capacity during the busiest times, which will allow:

17,500 more customers per hour on the Circle and Hammersmith & City lines

10,000 more customers per hour on the District line

9,000 more customers per hour on the Metropolitan line

The upgrade programme is a significant part of the record investment being made by TfL to modernise the Tube network to boost capacity and accessibility. It also represents a key part of the Mayor’s Transport Strategy, with the capacity boost allowing more journeys to be taken by public transport. This will help to reach the target set by the Mayor of 80 per cent of journeys made by public transport, cycling or walking by 2041.

Mark Wild, London Underground’s Managing Director, commented:

This is another significant moment in our vital programme to revolutionise nearly half of the Tube. Great progress is being made and, as early as next year, customers will start to see improved reliability and the most up-to-date customer information as the signalling is introduced.

First worldwide demonstration of Thales's SYNAPS | December 2017 Global Defense Security news industry | Defense ... - Army Recognition,"Mon, 04 Dec 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL2FybXlyZWNvZ25pdGlvbi5jb20vaXJhbl9pcmFuaWFuX2FybXlfaGVhdnlfYXJtb3VyZWRfbWFpbl9iYXR0bGVfdGFua191ay9pbmRleC5waHA_b3B0aW9uPWNvbV9jb250ZW50JnZpZXc9YXJ0aWNsZSZpZD0xNjU0NtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"From 21 to 24 November, a series of full-scale operational demonstrations of SYNAPS, the new generation of software-defined radios from Thales, was successfully completed in Chantilly, France. Representatives of more than 20 armed forces who are already Thales customers had a chance to witness the outstanding performance of this new-generation radio family, which was launched at the Eurosatory exhibition in June 2016.

Thales is supporting the digital transformation of the armed forces and has developed SYNAPS to provide the tactical network capability they need for real-time collaborative combat. The system provides the optimum combination of high data rates, security, integrity and confidentiality. It is the only system of its kind in the marketplace and represents a great leap forward in radio communications for the armed forces.



The SYNAPS radio is based on developments conducted for CONTACT, Europe's largest software radio programme, which was awarded to Thales in June 2012 by the French defence procurement agency (DGA) and will equip the French armed forces from 2019.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9997695088386536}",positive,0.9997695088386536,1
Thales to set up new signalling simulation facility in Singapore - TODAY,"Mon, 18 Dec 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvZGF5b25saW5lLmNvbS9zaW5nYXBvcmUvdGhhbGVzLXNldC1uZXctc2lnbmFsbGluZy1zaW11bGF0aW9uLWZhY2lsaXR5LXNpbmdhcG9yZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"SINGAPORE – Signalling system provider Thales will set up a simulation facility here by the end of next year to perform additional simulation tests for the rail network here, following the train collision at Joo Koon MRT station on Nov 15.

The facility, which will open in two phases, will strengthen testing processes for the new signalling system on the North-South and East-West Lines, by enhancing the authorities' ability to test solutions for communications-based train control (CBTC) ""in a controlled setting without affecting train services"", a Land Transport Authority (LTA) spokesperson said. ""This new facility will allow us to perform additional simulation tests which are tailored to the environmental and infrastructural conditions of the rail network in Singapore,"" the spokesperson said.

The first phase will be completed by the first half of next year to allow for off-site testing of the East-West Line's signalling system before it is introduced for passenger services. The second phase will further augment the facility's CBTC system software testing capabilities. When completed, the facility will be the first of its kind outside Paris or Toronto where Thales — a French multinational company — is based.

The initiative was announced on Monday (Dec 18) as the LTA said it has concluded its investigations into the collision which injured 38 people including two SMRT staff. LTA said it has corroborated its findings with the final investigation report submitted by Thales. Further ""extensive tests and analysis"" were also done by LTA, SMRT and Thales, including on-site re-enactments.

The detailed findings were consistent with LTA's initial findings made public on Nov 21, and confirmed that the incident occurred due to a confluence of a few ""failure conditions"". These include a ""software logic issue"" with the signalling system which was not configured to cater for the conditions that had contributed to the incident.

LTA found that the train developed an ""abnormal condition"" with its on-board signalling equipment and this prevented it from communicating with the trackside signalling equipment.

When this happens, the system would have developed a ""protective bubble"" around the affected train to ensure its safety. But the train had crossed a point on the track that has not yet been fully modified for the new signalling system. As a result, the ""protective bubble"" around the affected train was unexpectedly disabled and this led to the collision.

The East-West Line is running on two different signaling systems, with the old one in use from the Pasir Ris to Pioneer stations while the new one runs between the Pioneer and Tuas Link stations. The complications from operating two signalling systems concurrently on a single line had led to these failure conditions, the LTA spokesperson reiterated.

The CBTC signalling system allows trains to run closer together, at intervals of up to 100 seconds instead of 120 seconds during peak hours under the previous system.

In a precautionary move, train operations from the Joo Koon to Tuas Link MRT stations have been separated from the rest of the East-West Line since Nov 20. Thales has also completed its circuit modification works for the incompatible track point and is modifying the software logic of the signalling system to prevent future disabling of the protective bubble.

Stressing that the safety of the MRT system is of ""paramount importance"", the LTA spokesperson said the authority and SMRT have worked closely with Thales to ensure the safe operation and testing of the new signalling system. ""Thales has given its full assurance that the CBTC signalling system used on the NSL and TWE are safe and robust, and that CBTC works will not impact the continued operation of the legacy signalling system,"" she added.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9997428059577942}",neutral,0.9997428059577942,0
