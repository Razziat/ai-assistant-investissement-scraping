IoT module maker Telit announced the conclusion of its acquisition of the cellular IoT unit of French aerospace, defense and security company Thales, the former said in a statement.

The transaction includes Thales’s portfolio of cellular wireless communication modules, gateways, data cards ranging from 4G LTE and LPWAN to 5G, and IoT platform services.

“The transaction and integration, originally announced and begun July 29, 2022, expands the company’s presence in growing industrial IoT segments and end markets. With the integration now nearly complete, we stand ready to respond to the growing demand for cybersecure IoT solutions, modules, IoT platform services and cellular connectivity,” Telit said.

In July 2022, Telit and Thales agreed that the latter would take a 25% stake in the expanded Telit business, headquartered in California, which was rebranded as Telit Cinterion. Telit’s automotive IoT division will be spun off of the new Telit Cinterion.

The combined entity, Telit Cinterion, will be a “leading Western” power for IoT modules, the two companies had said. “Telit Cinterion will leverage Thales’ expertise in IoT security across SIM technology, modules, and connectivity,” the firms added. “The transaction establishes Telit Cinterion as a leading Western provider of IoT solutions, expanding the company’s presence in growing industrial IoT segments and end markets including payment systems, energy, e-health, and security.

Thales Alenia Space leading another ESA push to develop quantum comms - SpaceNews,"Tue, 24 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS90aGFsZXMtbGVhZGluZy1hbm90aGVyLWVzYS1wdXNoLXRvLWRldmVsb3AtcXVhbnR1bS1jb21tdW5pY2F0aW9ucy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"TAMPA, Fla. — Thales Alenia Space has signed a contract to develop quantum technologies in another push by the European Space Agency (ESA) to use the behavior of subatomic particles to make communications more secure.

The European satellite maker said Jan. 23 it is leading a consortium called TeQuantS, which aims to develop technologies needed to demonstrate quantum communication links from space in three years.

By using the entanglement properties of photons, these links are intended to be more secure than conventional networks because any attempt to intercept them would change their state.

Terrestrial quantum communication networks using fiber optic cables are limited to about 150 kilometers, according to Thales, and satellites are better suited for using these capabilities over longer distances.

According to Chinese state media, the Micius satellite China launched in 2016 was the first quantum-enabled spacecraft.

NASA and startups including Singapore’s SpeQtral are also exploring space-based quantum capabilities to protect communications from increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks, such as by quantum computers.

The overall contract ESA awarded TeQuantS is worth around 10 million euros ($11 million), said Mathias Vanden Bossche, director of research, technology and product policy at Thales Alenia Space.

That covers a first phase lasting 12 months, Bossche told SpaceNews via email, to start technology qualifications that could lead to a potential demonstration in 2026.

It is part of ESA’s multi-pronged approach to advance quantum communications technology, notably under a framework called EuroQCI (European Quantum Communication Infrastructure.)

Two groups have secured contracts under the EuroQCI framework to study quantum communication architectures: One led by Airbus and another by German telco Deutsche Telekom.

EuroQCI covers many projects ranging from ground to space segments. The main objective is to define the overall architecture of quantum-based networks and set up terrestrial test beds.

TeQuantS is focusing on technology developments for the space segment, Bossche said, and targets a wider scope than EuroQCI.

And unlike an ESA project led by satellite operator SES aiming to develop a satellite to test the distribution of quantum encryption keys for cryptography, he said TeQuantS will also study ways to connect quantum computers and quantum sensors in a multipurpose network.

While quantum key distribution (QKD) is important for security, he said generic networks will need to be able to support the many applications and greater performance promised by quantum information networking

“These generic networks are the real at-stake and challenge of quantum communications,” Bossche added.

“Overall, the Thales Alenia Space project is the first project that addresses quantum information networks in space.”

The TeQuantS consortium comprises Airbus, seven smaller firms and startups, and two research laboratories."
Thales Started Production of CAPTAS-4 Sonar for US Navy - Naval News,"Sat, 14 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdmFsbmV3cy5jb20vZXZlbnQtbmV3cy9zbmEtMjAyMy8yMDIzLzAxL3RoYWxlcy1zdGFydGVkLXByb2R1Y3Rpb24tb2YtY2FwdGFzLTQtc29uYXItZm9yLXVzLW5hdnkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales Started Production of CAPTAS-4 Sonar for US Navy Thales has confirmed that the US Navy’s FFG-62 Constellation-class frigate is to be equipped with its CAPTAS-4 low-frequency variable depth sonar (VDS).

Story by Richard Scott with additional reporting by Xavier Vavasseur

The decision to procure CAPTAS-4 – which is being supplied to shipbuilder Fincantieri Marinette Marine (FMM) through Thales-owned Advanced Acoustic Concepts – came after the US Navy decided to end development of the Raytheon AN/SQS-62 Dual-mode Array Transmitter (DART) VDS, and cancel the anti-submarine warfare (ASW) mission module originally intended to equip the Littoral Combat Ship. Cancellation of the ASW mission module was confirmed to Naval News by the Commanding Officer of LCS 23 during our recent visit to Naval Station Mayport, Florida.

DART encountered reliability and performance issues during its development, leading the navy and FMM to consider a proven alternative VDS for the FFG-62 program. The selection of CAPTAS-4 – the largest and most powerful member of the CAPTAS family of low-frequency active/passive sonars – means that the US Navy becomes the 14th customer navy for the CAPTAS line.

During a 29 August 2022 roundtable at the Pentagon to coincide with the start of fabrication on CONSTELLATION FFG 62, our colleague Chris Cavas brought up the decision to switch from the Raytheon DART sonar to the Thales CAPTAS-4 to Rear Admiral Casey Moton, NAVSEA Program Executive Officer, Unmanned and Small Combatants:

“So the plan for frigate had been to go with the DART sonar, the Raytheon product that had been selected for LCS. [Dual-mode Array Transmitter AN/SQS-62 VDS] And that was a plan that was driven by the desire for commonality between the two classes in conducting a study. [LCS and FFG].

As you know, as the work proceeded with the Raytheon sonar, there were some technical challenges that arose principally in the area of hydrodynamics in that sort of stability flowing through the water of the of the array. And also some issues with transducers, both in reliability and performance.

[…]

So eventually it just came to the point where the risk had [grown] so much. And then we had some testing in September 2021 that caused us to have increased concern that we were not going to be able to solve the issues with the Raytheon sonar. [testing was paused at that time]. So we, you know, the shipbuilder had concerns, we certainly had concerns, and we made the hard decision to stop that effort and to switch frigate to the CAPTAS. But I still certainly think that that was the right decision.

[…]

It is a sonar that’s fundamentally got the pedigree of the one that was actually I think you were referring Chris, that was in testing a few years ago on LCS. The CAPTAS is actually also fielded off of our FREMM-class frigates, and so we’re quite familiar with it as well. We looked at the integration aspects and made that decision in concert with the ship order. And I think it’s going to prove to be a good choice. And I think CAPTAS is going to have a great ASW capability to frigate when it delivers.”

Naval News understands that the first system is already in production at the Thales site in Brest, Brittany. Thales will build and integrate the first two VDS systems in France to meet in-yard delivery dates of 2023 and 2024 for the future USS Constellation. Follow-on systems will be integrated in the United States. A total of 10 VDS are set to be ordered. CAPTAS-4, which uses a four-ring active towed body, will operate in conjunction with the AN/SQQ-89(V)15 undersea warfare suite and the TB-37 Multi-Function Towed Array.

A number of CAPTAS-4 VDS under production at the Thales site in Brest, France, in October 2022. Thales picture.

CAPTAS-4 already equips the FREMM frigates operated by France, Italy, Morocco, and Egypt, while the Sonar 2087 system – which also uses the CAPTAS-4 towed body and handling system – is fitted to Type 23 frigates serving with the Royal Navy and the Chilean Navy.

The latest CAPTAS-4 Compact system – which significantly reduces the weight and footprint of the handling system – has already been selected by three navies. The FDI ships being built by Naval Group for France and Greece are to receive an independent tow variant separate active towed body and passive receive array; Spain’s new F110 frigates, being built by Navantia, will be equipped with a dependent tow version in which the receive array is attached to, and deployed with, the towed body on a single tow line.

Thales Alenia Space has signed a contract with prime contractor Appworks to provide Thailand with a complete Search And Rescue (SAR) operational system based on the COSPAS-SARSAT MEOSAR (MEdium Orbit Search And Rescue) Service.

The solution will make it possible to detect and locate distress signals from COSPAS-SARSAT beacons on land, in the air and at sea instantaneously, over a radius of 2,500 km centered around Bangkok, mainly using the Galileo satellite positioning system.

This solution also includes delivery of a Mission Control Centre (MCC) dedicated to managing and distributing alerts, and a Rescue Coordination Centre (RCC) to manage all search-and-rescue activities for armed forces, coastguards, sea rescue and other services.

Thales Alenia Space’s innovative MEOLUT Next product, which employs a phased array antenna, will give Thailand unrivaled performance. Where conventional MEOLUT systems rely on six large parabolic antennas covering an area about the size of a football field and are only capable of receiving signals from six satellites (one per antenna), the MEOLUT Next solution, with its compact antennas taking up less than 6 square meters, tracks up to 30 satellites, thus significantly enhancing distress beacon detection and expanding coverage. MEOLUT Next is capable of detecting distress signals from up to 5,000 km away.

Thales Alenia Space’s MEOLUT NEXT solution, with its two small antennas located in less than 10 square meters, tracks up to 30 satellites, thus significantly enhancing the distress beacon detection rate, while also expanding the coverage zone. Furthermore, since there are no mechanical components in these antennas, maintenance costs are the lowest on the market.

The solution is already operated by the main users of COSPAS-SARSAT (USA, Canada, France, the European Union, and Togo) and is today helping to save lives, as recently demonstrated in the Indian Ocean. On November 18, 2022, a MEOLUT Next antenna picked up a distress signal from the Asteria, a yacht skippered by Tapio Lehtinen competing in the Golden Globe race, 2,000 km southwest of La Réunion, well outside the range of VHF radio and other communications systems. The Asteria was sinking fast, and Tapio just had time to put on his survival suit and jump into his liferaft before activating his COSPAS-SARSAT distress beacon. Within only four minutes, MEOLUT Next had pinpointed the boat’s location to guide rescue crews to the scene and save the skipper.

“This is the first contract to deploy our MEOLUT Next solution in Asia, which is now present on the four continents of the Americas, Europe, Africa and Asia,” said Benoit Broudy, Vice President, Navigation at Thales Alenia Space in France. “Thales Alenia Space sees space as a new horizon, helping humankind to build a better, more sustainable life on Earth. Saving lives is something that ties in with our company’s aspirations, as demonstrated by our contribution to COSPAS-SARSAT Search and Rescue services.”

COSPAS-SARSAT is an intergovernmental organization founded by Canada, the United States, Russia and France. Operational since 1988 and deployed in more than 40 countries around the world, this satellite-based search and rescue distress alert detection and information distribution system is best known for detecting and locating emergency beacons activated by aircraft, ships and hikers in distress. Today, almost 1 million ships and 300,000 aircraft are equipped with COSPAS-SARSAT distress beacons. To date, the COSPAS-SARSAT service has saved more than 57,000 lives in more than 17,000 search and rescue events. In the last few years, Cospas-Sarsat has helped save an average of 7 lives every day.

Thales Alenia Space, the joint company between Thales (67%) and Leonardo (33%), has signed a contract worth over €100 million with the European Union Agency for the Space Programme (EUSPA) to provide maintenance and other support services for EGNOS V2 (European Geostationary Navigation Overlay System) for a period of four years.

The EGNOS system enhances the accuracy, reliability and integrity of positioning signals by improving the performance of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), such as GPS and, in the future, Galileo. EGNOS’s “Safety of Life” service is used in aviation for landings, enabling precision approaches at European airports without requiring ground guidance systems. This service has significantly improved operational safety and efficiency for the greater benefit of European operators.

Thales Alenia Space will build on its long-standing expertise in the engineering, development, testing and maintenance of the current EGNOS system, along with its development of EGNOS V2, now underway, to provide maintenance of the EGNOS V2 system for EUSPA and the European Union satellite navigation community from 2023 to 2026.

Thales Alenia Space will provide operational support and servicing in case of incidents (especially hardware and software troubleshooting and repairs) to deliver optimal 24/7 support for EGNOS. In addition, it will provide the upgraded or modified versions needed to ensure “Safety Of Life” service.

“With the growing use of EGNOS services in Europe, maintaining the System in operational conditions and adapting it to its evolving context is more than ever a fundamental activity for EUSPA. With this new contract, we secure the infrastructure capabilities over the coming years, and we are working closer to the industry to more efficiently answer EGNOS users expectations.” said Jean-Marc Piéplu, EGNOS Exploitation Programme Manager at EUSPA.

“With this latest contract, Thales Alenia Space bolsters its European and export leadership in satellite navigation and supports the success of the EGNOS system in Europe,” said Benoit Broudy, Vice-President, Navigation at Thales Alenia Space in France. “European industry has built up outstanding expertise and credentials in satellite-based augmentation systems (SBAS), underpinning the export success of this technology, which has already been deployed in South Korea, Africa and the Indian Ocean.”

About EGNOS

EGNOS, one of the European Union’s flagship programs, is a satellite navigation system designed to improve positioning signals delivered by GPS (Global Positioning System) and, in the future, Galileo. First deployed in 2005 and providing operational “open” service since 2009, the current EGNOS system was developed by Thales Alenia Space as prime contractor and is managed by the European Union Agency for the Space Programme (EUSPA).

“Safety of Life” service, an export success

The “Safety of Life” service provided by EGNOS is used in aviation for the landing phase, where it enables precision approaches to airports without requiring ground guidance systems. Building on its expertise in this sector, Thales Alenia Space was chosen by the Korean Space Agency to supply the Korean Augmentation Satellite System (KASS). The first signals from space were successfully transmitted in December 2022 and initial measurements demonstrate very good performance. Initially, Korea’s KASS regional system will be applied to aviation via the “Safety of Life” navigation service. It delivers critical help during certain flight phases, especially landings, without requiring ground infrastructure in airports.

In early 2019, ASECNA (Agency for Aerial Navigation Safety in Africa and Madagascar) chose Thales Alenia Space to carry out a Phase B project for an SBAS in sub-Saharan Africa, including delivery of a pre-operational service in 2020, to provide an optimized satellite solution that supports major traffic growth in this area. Nigerian operator NIGCOMSAT and Thales Alenia Space performed successful demonstration flights in Lomé and Douala in 2021, using the SBAS signal they have transmitted in the Africa and Indian Ocean region since September 2020 – the first SBAS service provided in this region, via the NIGCOMSAT-1R satellite. They also carried out a series of demonstrations of additional services provided by the A-SBAS system in Brazzaville, Congo. The next demonstration is scheduled for February 2023 in Abuja, Nigeria.

Thales signed a service contract with OCCAR (Organisation for Joint Armament Co-operation) on behalf of the French, Italian and UK Navies. This new substantial service contract covers a period of 3 years, with an additional optional 2 years. ​

As a trusted partner for the armed forces, Thales demonstrates the reliability and the endurance of its naval sensors such as the S1850M and its commitment to support navies.

The S1850M Long Range Air Surveillance Radar is a derivative of the SMART L radar. With 26 systems sold to leading European navies, SMART-L and S1850M have become a de facto NATO standard for naval long-range radar systems.

At Thales we know the importance of having ships and crew ready for action at a moment’s notice. That is why we work with navies around the world to ensure the crews and the technology they rely on are available when needed.

The contract, which covers a period of 3 years, with an optional additional 2 years, was signed on behalf of the three nations by OCCAR (Organisation for Joint Armament Co-operation). ​

The new service contract includes high quality support services such as desk support, an on-site technical assistance, and implementation of the Thales Customer Portal.

It includes also a yearly obsolescence scan and health check in addition to more complex tasks such as monitoring and configuration management. Thales will also annually host Customer Days, for attendance by representatives from the three Navies and OCCAR.

The S1850M radar, based on the Thales' SMART-L Volume Search Radar, is the long-range radar (LRR) of the Principal Anti Air Missile System (PAAMS) used on the Royal Navy’s Type 45 Destroyers, Queen Elisabeth class Aircraft Carriers and the French and Italian class Horizon Frigates.

The S1850M system is a 3D multibeam radar designed to provide long-range air & surface surveillance and target designation. Additional capabilities can be introduced during lifetime according to customer needs. This makes the radar future proof in case of evolving requirements. With fully automatic detection and track initiation, this radar part of the Ballistic Missile Defence System can track up to 1,000 air targets at a range of around 400 kilometres, including stealth targets in cluttered environments.

With 26 systems sold to the leading European navies, SMART-L and its derivative S1850M have become the de facto NATO standard for naval long-range radar systems."
Thales Alenia Space And Partners Sign Contract With European Space Agency For TeQuantS Quantum Satellite ... - Space Ref,"Mon, 23 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipwFodHRwczovL3NwYWNlcmVmLmNvbS9uZXdzcGFjZS1hbmQtdGVjaC90aGFsZXMtYWxlbmlhLXNwYWNlLWFuZC1wYXJ0bmVycy1zaWduLWNvbnRyYWN0LXdpdGgtZXVyb3BlYW4tc3BhY2UtYWdlbmN5LWZvci10ZXF1YW50cy1xdWFudHVtLXNhdGVsbGl0ZS1jb21tdW5pY2F0aW9ucy1wcm9qZWN0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"TeQuantS1

Thales Alenia Space, the joint venture between Thales (67%) and Leonardo (33%), has signed a contract with the European Space Agency (ESA) to lead the TeQuantS1 project aimed at developing quantum space-to-Earth communications technologies.

This contract, part of ESA’s ARTES 4.0 Core Competitiveness programme element2 , is supported by French space agency CNES (Centre National d’Etudes Spatiales) and Austrian space agency ALR.

The TeQuantS project intends to develop quantum technologies for cybersecurity applications and future quantum information networks. These technologies will enable Thales Alenia Space and its partners to build satellites and optical ground stations by the end of 2026. TeQuantS will thus help to demonstrate the performance of long-distance quantum satellite links.

Satellites are today viewed as the best bet for long-distance quantum communications, as ground-based fiber-optic links directly transmitting quantum information are limited to a range of about 150 kilometers.

The main cybersecurity challenge is to generate secure cryptographic keys using the quantum properties of light and distribute them to users anywhere in the world. This capability is a response to the threat of quantum computers potentially able to crack cryptographic keys now in daily use.

The key challenge for quantum information networks is to enable future quantum computers and sensors to talk to each other and fulfill their promised exponential gains in performance.

Quantum communications are currently the focus of major research and development programs, notably the EuroQCI project in Europe.

The TeQuantS project led by Thales Alenia Space will draw on the expertise of a consortium composed of fellow prime Airbus Defence and Space, seven smaller firms and startups (ALPAO, AUREA Technology, BERTIN Technologies, MIRATLAS, OGS Technologies, QTlabs and SIGMAWORKS), and two research laboratories (LIP6 – Sorbonne University and INPHYNI – Côte d’Azur University/CNRS). The project partners will be innovating together to advance quantum communications in pursuit of Europe’s objectives.

Since 2018, Thales Alenia Space has been rolling out its roadmap to develop mature end-to- end quantum communications, notably through projects initiated by the European Commission

(OPENQKD, QSAFE) and ESA (SAGA). With this roadmap, fully aligned with that of the TeQuantS project, Thales Alenia Space is focusing not only on satellites but also on ground stations and complete mission segments, leveraging its longstanding expertise as a telecommunications systems integrator and developer of optical terminals, and drawing on Thales’s two decades of experience in quantum communications. Javier Benedicto, Acting Director of Telecommunications and Integrated Applications at ESA, said: “Supporting European autonomy, leadership and responsibility in today’s digital world is becoming increasingly important. We are proud to be working with the consortium led by

Thales Alenia Space to ensure that European citizens will continue to benefit from space- based secure connectivity in everyday life on Earth.”

“We’re delighted to be working with our partners to develop quantum technologies that will demonstrate the ability to establish operational long-distance satellite quantum communications links and support Europe’s sovereignty in this area,” said Marc-Henri Serre, Thales Alenia Space Executive Vice President, Telecommunications. “We thank ESA, CNES and the Austrian Space Agency for their vital support on this project, which is addressing future cybersecurity and quantum information network challenges.”

CEC is the Future of Naval Warfare for Thales - Naval News,"Wed, 25 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdmFsbmV3cy5jb20vbmF2YWwtbmV3cy8yMDIzLzAxL2NlYy1pcy10aGUtZnV0dXJlLW9mLW5hdmFsLXdhcmZhcmUtZm9yLXRoYWxlcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"CEC is the Future of Naval Warfare for Thales Last week, Naval News travelled to Den Helder with Thales in order to visit one of the four De Zeven Provinciën-class frigates – HNLMS De Ruyter – having recently undergone an upgrade. Throughout the trip, which also included a visit to Thales’ Hengelo site, a sense of urgency for the development and integration of Collaborative Engagement Capabilities was deeply felt.

The North Sea is in a state of high alert, much like most of the High North. The range, speed, power and variety of threats, such as ballistic missiles, has significantly grown over the past decades, making it increasingly difficult to ensure constant protection of surface and sub-surface critical infrastructure. “It is not only a matter of capabilities and systems,” Geert van Der Molten, Vice President of Sales of Thales NL, told the media, “it is also about shortages of components, inflation and shortage of human resources adding to those threats.” As a result, it is difficult to envisage one nation alone being capable of tackling such wide variety of threats.

In such context, Collaborative Engagement Capabilities (CEC) has become a critical capability over the past few years. Central to CEC is the notion of networking different sensors and systems in order to increase situational awareness and, where necessary, extend the fire control loop to more than one unit. The crucial importance of this sensor netting was evident throughout the press trip last week, and a couple of examples demonstrated Thales’ and, more broadly, navies’ growing focus on such area.

Launch on remote

Rogier Noorland, Product Manager Integrated Air Missile Defence (IAMD), explained how the Royal Netherlands Navy (RNLN) and the US Navy (USN) used the Formidable Shield 2021 exercise to test ‘launch on remote’ capabilities. During an exercise, HNLMS De Zeven Provinciën’s new SMART-L MM (multimission) radar – which replaced the legacy SMART-L – detected a simulated ballistic missile launch. Two courses of action were possible:

Triggering the early warning capability, “which can result in either passive air defence – and alerts civil authorities of the danger – or active air defence means;”

Switching to engagement support mode with another platform. In this case, HNLMS De Zeven Provinciën data was used to launch an SM-3 (an exoatmospheric interceptor) from nearby USS Paul Ignatius, successfully destroying the ballistic missile flying 14,000km per hour through space.

“The exercise demonstrated launch on remote capabilities, that is, the Dutch frigate becomes part of the US destroyer’s fire control loop,”



Rogier Noorland, Product Manager Integrated Air Missile Defence (IAMD) at Thales

Plot Level Data Exchange and Fusion (PLDEF)

The next step for Thales, Noorland also told reporters, will be facilitating the exchange and integration of radar data. This new capability, called Plot Level Data Exchange and Fusion (PLDEF), aims to provide a more precise, near real time, continuous picture for radar operators on each ship involved in the network: if all connected radar receive the same information, there are no track drops across the force. Finally, the PLDEF could also significantly contribute to Electronic Warfare (EW) resilience. “While jamming one or two radars in a task force is standard, jamming all radar on all bands would be far more complicated”, Noorland pointed out.

While the Thales teams could not comment on the PLDEF’s technology readiness level (TRL), they did mention two key milestones:

First, initial tests have been carried out between a Dutch and a French frigates. In this instance, the two ships exchanged radar measurements through each navy’s respective battlespace labs, thus facilitating accreditation for the exchange of highly confidential data.

Second, Thales has submitted a bid for the 2021 call of the European Defence Fund (EDF) on “Naval collaborative surveillance” to support work on this new CEC capability. Bid winners should be announced mid-2023. A large share of the work that remains to be done on the PLDEF lies in the ability to exchange high volumes of data between two countries. “Effectively we are aiming to create a new exchange standard,” Noorland told Naval News.

CEC: The future of naval warfare

CEC is, undoubtedly, the future of naval warfare. By facilitating collaborative early warning and engagement across different units, it offers navies the ability to tackle increasing resource issues – human, components and funding. The four De Zeven Provinciën-class frigates are an excellent example of this trend. All four ships will be fitted with the new SMART-L MM, allowing them to perform tasks and collaborative engagement like HNLMS De Zeven Provinciën did during the Formidable Shield 2021 exercise. Not all four frigates, however, will receive the new APAR (Block II) and the new Sabre Electronic Counter Measure (ECM) due to cost concerns, as announced by an RNLN press release published in May 2022.

Two of the four frigates are now back to being operational – HNLMS De Zeven Provinciën, which participated in Formidable Shield 2021 and HNLMS Tromp, which will participate in Formidable Shield 2024. HNLMS De Ruyter, which the media visited last week, will see her maintenance period end in March 2023, marking a longer refit period than usual due to the many upgrades the ship received. The work-up will start soon after, but it will be interrupted midway to allow for crew training and will resume only in the spring of 2024 in time for meeting the scheduled return to operations in the summer of 2024.

HNLMS Evertsen is still undergoing maintenance and will be the first of the four frigates to receive the new 127mm Leonardo naval gun system – which will significantly alter the forward part of the ship, beyond the VLS.

Welmer Veenstra, De Ruyter’s Commanding Officer, told the media that the frigates would continue receiving upgrades until the new Anti-Submarine Warfare Frigates (ASWF) are operational. According to Marco Strijker, Marketing Manager at Thales Netherlands, the contract should be awarded this year, for a first ship to be operational by 2028."

Paris, 31 January 2023 - SWISSto12, Switzerland’s fastest-growing aerospace company and a leading manufacturer of advanced satellite payloads and systems, today announced the signing of its first contract with Thales, the global high technology leader. Thales will develop and supply the Ka-band Solid-State Power Amplifiers (SSPAs) that will be a key component of the antenna link between Earth and SWISSto12’s HummingSat range of next generation, small-sized geostationary telecommunications satellites.



​ ©Thales and SWISSto12

This first contract with a New Space player is a further illustration of Thales's ability to adapt to the needs of a sector that has been profoundly impacted by demand from geostationary telecom satellite operators for more flexible coverage, and by the expanding role of satellite constellations. The agreement further consolidates Thales’s position as a full-range supplier of amplification solutions, from conventional travelling wave tubes (TWTs) to compact, lightweight dual-TWT and SSPA products.

The SSPA amplifiers from Thales will be part of the array antenna of the HummingSat payload. More compact, less expensive, optimised for size and weight and with highly integrated electronics, these innovative amplifiers are perfectly tailored to the needs of new small-sized GEO satellites like HummingSat.

These advanced technologies are the result of successful collaboration within the Thales organisation. The Group has set up a dedicated team to develop SSPA products that meet the time-to-market and design-to-cost requirements of customers. Thales expects to achieve qualification of its SSPA product line in 2024.

“We are delighted to be pursuing this collaboration with Thales, a world leader in satellite power amplification. The cutting-edge technology from Thales has been developed in close connection with our antenna solutions and is a strong match for the telecommunications infrastructure offered by the HummingSat product line. Our platform is a showcase for the disruptive technologies emerging in Europe’s space landscape and offers the capacity, performance and flexibility that satellite operators need to address previously under-served markets ”, said Dr. Emile de Rijk, founder and CEO of SWISSto12."

High-tech company Thales opened a new office in Delft on Thursday, January 19. The building is located right next to TU (Technical University) Delft, with which Thales regularly collaborates in the field of research and engineering assignments. Thales Netherlands hires hundreds of people every year, and this year the expectation is to welcome around 450 new employees. The new building in Delft is designed to accommodate this growth.

Delft is the 'research branch' of Thales Netherlands. In addition to this office, the Dutch branch of the French multinational also has locations in Huizen, Eindhoven and the head office in Hengelo, among others. The engineers and researchers in Delft mainly work on R&D and solution engineering. It is an extension of the 'Naval organisation' that works from the headquarters of Thales Netherlands on major assignments for navies all over the world.

In that 'Naval organisation' it is currently all hands on deck. Thales Netherlands is working on two of the largest projects ever for the Thales Group. The organisation supplies all kinds of sensors and software for new frigates of the German and British navies. Partly due to the sizeable projects that Thales has been commissioned with in recent years, its workforce is growing steadily. It therefore adapts its branches accordingly. Location manager Michel Varkevisser: ""The new building in Delft now has a professional appearance that fits the new way of working and the international community that works there.""

Besides the job that you have, the tools at your disposal as well as the place where you work are extremely important. Everything seems exactly right in this new building, and we have enough space for all current and future colleagues! - Gerben Edelijn, CEO Thales Nederland

This annual event sees Governments and industry from all over the world come together to test Digital ID Wallet and ID Verifier solutions in line with the global ISO standard 18013-5:2021, and to work together on new standards to meet the digital identity needs of the future.

Hosted by TMR, the event was a key milestone in the Queensland Digital Licence project, providing an opportunity to demonstrate the Queensland Digital Licence Application (DLA).This technology will enable Queenslanders to have their driver licences, photo ID's and more, recognised and digitally verified around the world - the first jurisdiction to do so in Australia and New Zealand. This year the event attracted over 150 people, and double the number of regulatory attendees.

The Thales participation in the test event was led by Kamil Parizek, Technical Authority in Digital ID at Thales ANZ, and also included the software development and Digital ID teams from Perth and Sydney. A key achievement of the summit was to confirm that Queensland Digital Licence users will be able to use their Mobile Driver Licence both within Australia, and also internationally in jurisdictions that recognise the ISO standard. The results of the testing delighted our customer and partner, Queensland Department of Transport & Main Roads, further cementing the positive customer-supplier relationship.

“Thales, alongside our Brisbane based SME partners, Code Heroes and Aliva, are proud to be partnering with Transport and Main Roads to help deliver Australia’s first globally interoperable Digital Licence to Queenslanders,” said Thea Dedden, Director of Digital Identity, Thales ANZ.

TMR Deputy Director-General Customer Services, Safety and Regulation Geoffrey Magoffin said he couldn't be happier with how the event went.

“We were able to successfully test the Queensland digital licence against vendors from across the globe. There were over 150 attendees over the six days of the summit, with most travelling from overseas. This demonstrates the enormous global commitment to ensuring mDL interoperability, which Queensland and Thales are a part of"" TMR Deputy Director-General Customer Services, Safety and Regulation Geoffrey Magoffin

Thales recently became the first vendor in the world to be formally certified against the ISO 18013-5:2021 Mobile Driving Licence Applications standard, a huge achievement that solidifies our position as a world leader in Digital ID solutions.

The newly upgraded Queensland DLA, using this same certified technology, is due to be released to an extended pilot population in Townsville shortly, followed by state-wide release to all eligible Queensland residents in 2023. Collaboration between local SME’s, the Thales project team in Australia, our global Digital ID experts and Queensland Transport and Main Roads, has been key to the project’s successes to date, with customer and supplier teams working hand-in-hand.

Watch out for announcements from Premier Palaszczuk in early 2023 for updates on the extended Townsville pilot and state-wide release.

During the exercise, Thales’ MiMap and M-Cube solutions were deployed to perform a mine-warfare scenario alongside the French Navy’s explosive ordnance disposal divers and RTSys-built diver-held sonar and navigation system, called Sonadive.

The scenario, which involved deployment of uncrewed systems on an 8km² mined area, was managed by Allied Maritime Command and Allied Command Transformation.

According to Thales, the test concluded that both its C2 MCM systems are eligible to be equipped with various platforms operating under Nato Additive Military Layer standards.

The test involved integration of M-Cube MCM mission management system with MiMap mission analysis tool that further allowed to combine the gathered and processed data with the Nato’s network C3MRE/CATL.

The C3MRE/CATL network interfaced different industrial solutions, including Sonadive, with NATO navies.

The drills also allowed Thales to demonstrate the capability of its MCM systems to read the foreign sonar data emitted from participating autonomous platforms.

MiMap can be used for analysing sonar data in both real-time and recorded formats, while M-Cube is deployed with autonomous and conventional MCM vessels.

Once integrated, the two can minimise cognitive load of commanders and operators by facilitating effective decision-making to counter adversaries."

Arizona MVD and Thales will collaborate on card design elements that bring superior security and are very difficult for counterfeiters to replicate – namely Multiple Laser Image (MLI) with alternately visible data elements and two unique Thales features, Dynaprint and Edge Sealer.

Dynaprint uses multiple high-resolution images and fine line printing for an image flipping effect, while Edge Sealer laser-engraves specific data on the card’s edge to form an additional bond which is extremely difficult to reproduce.

Along with the new design, Arizona will join several other Thales partner jurisdictions in North America that have switched to cards made from 100% polycarbonate, a more durable material extending their usage lifecycle. Cards made of polycarbonate cannot be altered without visibly damaging the card, which is key to detecting counterfeited documents.

Thales offers tailored solutions that help jurisdictions better serve their citizens. In addition, Thales has Central Issuance capabilities in North America to securely manage the citizens’ personal data when personalizing the driver’s license.

Thales Alenia Space to lead space-to-Earth quantum comms technologies project - The Engineer,"Thu, 26 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWVuZ2luZWVyLmNvLnVrL2NvbnRlbnQvbmV3cy90aGFsZXMtYWxlbmlhLXNwYWNlLXRvLWxlYWQtc3BhY2UtdG8tZWFydGgtcXVhbnR1bS1jb21tcy10ZWNobm9sb2dpZXMtcHJvamVjdC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales Alenia Space has signed a contract with the European Space Agency (ESA) to lead TeQuantS1, a project to develop quantum space-to-Earth communications technologies.

This contract is part of ESA’s ARTES 4.0 Core Competitiveness programme element2 and supported by the space agencies of France and Austria.

The TeQuantS project intends to develop quantum technologies for cybersecurity applications and future quantum information networks that will enable Thales Alenia Space and its partners to build satellites and optical ground stations by the end of 2026.

According to ESA, the quantum computers that are currently being developed will eventually be able to crack the cryptographic systems used by today’s classical computers, which requires Europe to develop a cryptography capability based on the quantum properties of light.

MORE FROM COMMUNICATIONS

Ground-based fibre-optic links transmitting quantum information are limited to a range of about 150km, which makes satellites the best solution for long-distance quantum communications.

The main cybersecurity challenge is to generate secure cryptographic keys (strings of data used to lock or unlock cryptographic functions, including authentication, authorization and encryption) using the quantum properties of light and distribute them to users anywhere globally.

Thales Alenia Space said the key challenge for quantum information networks is to enable future quantum computers and sensors to communicate with each other and fulfil their promised exponential gains in performance.

The TeQuantS project will draw on the expertise of a consortium composed of fellow prime Airbus Defence and Space, seven smaller firms and start-ups (ALPAO, AUREA Technology, BERTIN Technologies, MIRATLAS, OGS Technologies, QTlabs and SIGMAWORKS), plus the LIP6 and INPHYNI research labs at Sorbonne University and Côte d’Azur University/CNRS respectively.

Since 2018, Thales Alenia Space has been rolling out its roadmap to develop mature end-to-end quantum communications, notably through projects initiated by the European Commission (OPENQKD, QSAFE) and ESA (SAGA). With this roadmap, fully aligned with that of the TeQuantS project, Thales Alenia Space is focusing on satellites along with ground stations and complete mission segments.

In a statement, Javier Benedicto, acting director of Telecommunications and Integrated Applications at ESA, said: “Supporting European autonomy, leadership and responsibility in today’s digital world is becoming increasingly important. We are proud to be working with the consortium led by Thales Alenia Space to ensure that European citizens will continue to benefit from space-based secure connectivity in everyday life on Earth.”"

Credit: Thales.

France-based Thales has secured two contracts for the delivery and maintenance of the operation control centre (OCC) for the new Line 7 of the Santiago metro in Chile.

Under the first contract, the company will design, deploy, test and commission the OCC for the new Line 7, which will link the city from west to east.

The OCC is said to command and supervise energy equipment and auxiliary systems, including elevators, escalators, lighting and ventilation equipment, at the new line’s 19 stations.

Its other crucial functions comprise energising the line through the traction logic subsystem and managing the access and intrusion control subsystems.

The subsystems will help monitor the flow of authorised personnel in the line’s stations and workshops.

Expected to be operational by 2027, the line will cater to people residing in the districts of Renca, Cerro Navia, Quinta Normal, Santiago, Providencia, Las Condes and Vitacura.

"New Sonar For Navy Frigates Could Turn Any Ship into Submarine Hunter, Maker Says - Defense One","Fri, 13 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VvbmUuY29tL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvMjAyMy8wMS9uZXctc29uYXItbmF2eS1mcmlnYXRlcy1jb3VsZC10dXJuLWFueS1zaGlwLXN1Ym1hcmluZS1odW50ZXItbWFrZXItc2F5cy8zODE4MzQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A sonar system being installed on new U.S. Navy Constellation-class frigates could also protect merchant ships during a conflict and give them the ability to search for submarines, according to the company that manufactures the technology.

The towed-sensor system is already being used by U.S. allies and could be quickly installed on non-military ships.

“It's a modular system that can be placed on vessels of opportunity,” said Mark Bock, vice president for strategy and business development at Thales’ Advanced Acoustic Concepts.

At the Surface Navy Association conference in Arlington, Virginia, this week, the company showed off a video of the technology being installed on a commercial ship within 48 hours, turning the vessel into an anti-submarine “asset,” Bock said.

“We believe we can repeat that turnaround [time],” he said.

The company believes the sonar system could be loaded on a military cargo plane and quickly flown to a ship that needs it.

“This is not a concept that is new or developmental,” Bock said. “It's a concept of how to rapidly address [anti-submarine warfare] capacity from a DOD or navy perspective.”

U.S. Transportation Command boss Gen. Jacqueline Van Ovost said in October that the military would rely heavily on commercial cargo ships and aircraft to replenish troops during a war in the vast spaces of the Pacific. Van Ovost said the command is looking at placing military advisors on merchant ships along with special communications gear that gives the ships a better picture of enemy locations.

Last March, the Navy said it would install Advanced Acoustic Concepts’ CAPTAS anti-submarine sonar on its Constellation-class frigates over similar Raytheon-made technology.

The sonar system is made up of a long cable that tows a sensor in the water that pings for submarines. Unlike the Navy’s current bow-mounted sonars, the so-called variable-depth sonar can be “placed at a depth that has the highest probability of getting a target acquisition,” Bock said.

Thales acquired Advanced Acoustic Concepts, a undersea technology joint venture it previously had with Leonardo DRS, in July. The acquisition, Thales said at the time, was to “increase its engineering and industrial footprint in the U.S. defense market, with reinforced U.S.-based teams and capabilities.”

The anti-submarine technology is already used on British, French, Spanish, and Chilean ships.

“You're talking about a system that's mature, has a track record, past performance record against targets,” Bock said.

One might ask whether linking a merchant ship to a military sensor network would make it more of a target. The classification of civilian vessels into legitimate targets and illegal ones is an unsettled area of international law; much depends on circumstances. The U.S. Navy’s own guidance indicates that merchant ships “incorporated into, or assisting in any way, the intelligence system of an enemy's armed forces” may be “attacked and destroyed” by aircraft or surface warships “with or without prior warning.”

Talking credit cards help visually impaired customers - Marketplace,"Tue, 31 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmtldHBsYWNlLm9yZy8yMDIzLzAxLzMxL3RhbGtpbmctY3JlZGl0LWNhcmRzLWhlbHAtdmlzdWFsbHktaW1wYWlyZWQtcGVvcGxlLXByZXZlbnQtYWJ1c2Uv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Stephanie Khoeung’s white walking cane glides along a sidewalk as she navigates through a Paris suburb. She lost her sight when she was 12 after a series of failed operations.

Now, as an adult, everyday situations are often challenging for Khoeung. Things like buying a sandwich.

Credit cards are not easy for visually impaired people to use because they can’t always see the terminal to know where to insert their card. But the main challenge for blind people is that they can’t confirm whether the price the retailer keys in is accurate.

To alleviate that problem, French tech firm Thales has developed a credit card that talks. It was the French who invented the chip card, with its four-digit-code security system. Thales is also developing a biometric credit card that can read a user’s fingerprint.

Pierre Paladjian, the company’s banking personalization program manager, said the talking card takes this technology one step further.

“This credit card doesn’t only contain a payment chip but another piece of electronics that enables you to connect it to the user’s cellphone,” he said. “This connection enables the reception via Bluetooth of all the information that is displayed on the card payment terminal.”

The smartphone then vocalizes that transaction through a speaker or headphones in French, English or a number of other languages.

“The transaction amount is 25 euros,” the phone uttered as Khoeung completed a transaction.

“It’s useful for visually impaired people like me [to] get confirmation of the amount the cashier says we’re paying because we’re easy to fool,” Khoeung said. “They can tap in any amount, we wouldn’t know.”

Paladjian said an opinion poll carried out with visually impaired people found 9 out of 10 had been victims of shopkeeper fraud or error.

There are around 250 million visually impaired people worldwide, he said.

A bank in Turkey began offering the new card to customers this month. Others in Europe and the Americas are expected to follow soon."

LinkedIn

The talent of the future braved a wet and wintry Sussex night to learn more about the opportunities on offer through Thales in the UK apprenticeships.

Determined to play its part in closing the UK’s engineering skills gap and help the UK government achieve its ambition of becoming a ‘science and technology superpower’ by 2030, Thales hosted an Apprenticeship Insight event at the Thales Crawley site on the evening of 7 December.

The 16 January application deadline looms for programmes starting in September and this event was to encourage young talent to look at STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) as a future career option.

Despite the weather, the event sold out, with more than 150 people attending from the local community, including students, parents and teachers. They all had the opportunity to talk first hand with current apprentices and our HR team to understand the different stages of the application process and even experience our game based assessment tool to get a taste of what the process would be like.

We also had representatives from our Thales Social Value team and Early Careers Committee, who gave a glimpse in to other opportunities they could get involved with at Thales, such as volunteering.

Event organiser Ronnie Curtis is Thales’s Early Careers Talent Acquisition Coordinator. She said: “We’re delighted we had such a busy atmosphere all evening and we’ve had some great feedback, including a number of apprenticeship applications from people who attended.”

A flavour of Thales

The insight evening gave visitors a chance to see the Thales offices and meet senior leadership and current apprentices, hearing first-hand what it’s like to work at Thales, including social aspects.

Visitors also had hands-on experience with 3D headsets and saw a demonstration about the work of COREF (Connected Reconfigurable Factory), Thales’s digitally linked innovation hub based in Crawley.

Apprenticeships for all ages

At our Thales Crawley site, we have programmes ranging from Level 3 apprenticeships to Level 6 degree apprenticeships, lasting anything from 15 months to four years; they are open to people of all ages. They cover a variety of disciplines including project planning and controls, hardware and software engineering, systems engineering, data and digital, procurement and human resources.

Ronnie highlighted the benefits of apprenticeships: “Courses are fully funded, so there’s no student debt, and apprentices earn while they learn. And at the end of the scheme, they are all offered a job with us.”

Erin Beeson, recently started training as a data analyst apprentice. “I attended a similar Thales event when I was in school, and it gave me a lot of good information and advice,” she said. “It was the perfect step for me after my A-levels and offered an alternative to going to university.

“I’m being professionally trained for a job that I enjoy, but I’m also working for my qualifications at the same time and there are options to get your degree as well”.

Investing in the future

Ronnie also coordinates Early Careers events nationwide, reaching out to school leavers and university students to promote awareness and greater diversity among potential applicants.

“These events are an investment in our future, but they also let people see how exciting a career in engineering can be,” said Ronnie.

Commercial Company Utilizes Vantis to Satisfy FAA Safety Requirements for Advanced UAS Operations

﻿BISMARCK, North Dakota – Leveraging Vantis, the state’s first-of-its-kind UAS network, uAvionix, an avionics company specializing in drones, received approval by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to conduct beyond visual line-of-sight (BVLOS) small unmanned aircraft flights in North Dakota. uAvionix, with support from the Northern Plains UAS Test Site, demonstrated to the FAA that it established adequate risk mitigations to satisfy required safety standards for the specified BVLOS operation within the national airspace system.

North Dakota leads the way in bringing UAS to commercial sectors safely and economically with Vantis. This success adds to the foundation that Vantis has set for the next phase of operation this summer and the state continues to lead the way for autonomy and automation.

“This first-of-its-kind approval for our partners is a critical step that validates our state’s investment and years of work to bring UAS aircraft to commercial sectors in a safe and economic way,” said North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum. “Other states are reaching out to us as a national leader in UAS.”

“We are incredibly proud to lead the way in North Dakota with our partners from Vantis and Thales,” said Christian Ramsey, uAvionix President. “Being able to demonstrate much of our ecosystem in approved BVLOS flight is a major milestone for our company, our partners, and the broader aviation ecosystem.”

The Northern Plains UAS Test Site, administering Vantis for the state of North Dakota, partnered with Thales USA to develop and implement Vantis, a UAS system that allows UAS pilots to command and control the UAS and remain well clear of other aircraft when flying beyond visual line of sight. Vantis consists of ground-based aviation infrastructure, like that used in traditional aviation, which significantly lowers the barrier of entry to BVLOS flights for multiple users.

“Vantis was designed to serve many drone operators across multiple sectors,” said Trevor Woods, Executive Director at the Northern Plains UAS Test Site. “This first approval is an important milestone for Vantis, as a blueprint for widespread commercial BVLOS enablement.”

“We thank the Federal Aviation Administration for acknowledging that our approach to BVLOS in North Dakota maintains the same safety standards that the agency expects for all users within the national airspace,” said Frank Matus, Director of ATC and Digital Aviation Solutions for the Americas at Thales USA, the state’s infrastructure partner for the Vantis network. “We continue to collaborate with FAA as regulations evolve to ensure that Vantis meets the needs of all stakeholders.”

Thailand enhances search and rescue with space technology - Tech Wire Asia,"Thu, 19 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vdGVjaHdpcmVhc2lhLmNvbS8wMS8yMDIzL3RoYWlsYW5kLWVuaGFuY2VzLXNlYXJjaC1hbmQtcmVzY3VlLXdpdGgtc3BhY2UtdGVjaG5vbG9neS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales Alenia Space, a joint venture between Thales and Leonardo, is utilizing its expertise in space technology to revolutionize search and rescue operations.

Thales Alenia Space views space as a new frontier, working towards improving humanity’s way of life on Earth through more sustainable means.

Search and rescue (SAR) is a critical function that saves lives and protects communities from the dangers of natural and man-made disasters. The ability to quickly and accurately locate and rescue individuals in distress is essential for emergency response teams and organizations worldwide. With the rapid advancement of technology, it has become increasingly important for SAR operations to access the most advanced and reliable tools available. Thales Alenia Space, a joint venture between Thales (67%) and Leonardo (33%), is utilizing its expertise in space technology to revolutionize search and rescue operations.

One such tool provided by Thales Alenia Space is the COSPAS-SARSAT MEOSAR Service, a complete SAR operational system that allows for the instant detection and location of distress signals from COSPAS-SARSAT beacons on land, in the air, and at sea. This system utilizes the Galileo satellite positioning system, which provides accurate and reliable location data over a radius of 2,500 km centered around Bangkok. This service is vital for ensuring the safety and well-being of individuals in distress. Thales Alenia Space’s continued innovation in this area will undoubtedly save lives in the future.

In addition to the MEOSAR Service, Thales Alenia Space offers the innovative MEOLUT Next product. This uses a phased array antenna to track up to 30 satellites, significantly enhancing distress beacon detection and expanding coverage. This system can detect distress signals up to 5,000 km away, and it is a much more efficient alternative than conventional MEOLUT systems, which rely on six large parabolic antennas.

Thales Alenia Space’s advanced technology is already in operation by the main users of COSPAS-SARSAT, including the USA, Canada, France, the European Union, and Togo. It has been proven to be a reliable and effective tool for SAR operations, as demonstrated by a recent incident in the Indian Ocean. On November 18, 2022, a MEOLUT Next antenna picked up a distress signal from a yacht 2,000 km southwest of La Réunion. The MEOLUT Next system could pinpoint the boat’s location and guide rescue crews to the scene, resulting in the skipper’s rescue.

“This is the first contract to deploy our MEOLUT Next solution in Asia, which is now present on the four continents of the Americas, Europe, Africa and Asia.” said Benoit Broudy, Vice President Navigation at Thales Alenia Space in France. “Thales Alenia Space sees space as a new horizon, helping humankind to build a better, more sustainable life on Earth. Saving lives is something that ties in with our company’s aspirations, as demonstrated by our contribution to COSPAS-SARSAT Search and Rescue services.”

The potential use of Thales’s space advanced technology.

Thales Alenia Space plays a vital role in various industries and applications, including telecommunications, navigation, earth observation, and scientific research. Seeing how Thales Alenia Space’s advanced technology can be used for search and rescue operations, it is interesting to see how this technology could address landslide issues in Malaysia.

In December 2022, a tragic landslide occurred in Malaysia, claiming the lives of 21 individuals, including children, who were sleeping in tents at an unlicensed campsite. Search teams had to navigate through thick mud and fallen trees to search for survivors. The landslide happened in Selangor state, near the capital city Kuala Lumpur, and a hillside collapsing into an organic farm. According to reports, a massive amount of earth fell from approximately 30 meters (100 feet), covering an area of roughly one acre (0.4 hectares).

Regarding a landslide incident, Thales Alenia Space technology could play an essential role in monitoring the land, identifying potential hazards, and taking action to mitigate risks. Their Earth observation satellites can be used to detect and monitor changes in land and soil structure, detect movements, and provide early warning of potential landslides. This capability allows for more efficient and effective deployment of resources and aid during a disaster response.

Perhaps, Thales Alenia Space’s technology can also be used for rapid response and assessment of the damage after a landslide has occurred. They can use their high-resolution imagery and data to identify affected areas and track the progression of landslides. This will enable emergency response teams to prioritize their efforts and resources more effectively."

The FAA issued BVLOS authorization to uAvionix following its demonstration of the risk mitigation and drone detect and avoid capabilities of its avionics tech. It did so on behalf of client Northern Plains UAS Test Site (NPUASTS), which operates Vantis for North Dakota. The project’s objective is to continue developing the statewide aerial network to enable a wide range of commercial and public service UAV operation.

Vantis is one of seven sites in the US with FAA approval to test systems, operating procedures, and on-ground and aerial hardware as a means of integrating UAVs into surrounding airspace – which, in this case, is all of North Dakota.

That coverage makes Vantis the only statewide BVLOS drone network in the country, and explains why NPUASTS relies heavily on sector partners like uAvionix and air traffic control (ACT) systems provider Thales to enable safe, incident-free flights across the network.

Thales has been active in designing, installing, and testing a vast system of ground-based sensors to permit secure BVLOS drone flights throughout Vantis since its inception. The collective effort behind Vantis has now now gotten another boost toward completion with uAvionix tech receiving the FAA authorization.

“We are incredibly proud to lead the way in North Dakota with our partners from Vantis and Thales,” said Christian Ramsey, uAvionix president. “Being able to demonstrate much of our ecosystem in approved BVLOS flight is a major milestone for our company, our partners, and the broader aviation ecosystem.”

The low SWaP TSO certified and uncertified avionics that uAvionix produces for general aviation, airport surface vehicles, and UAV markets is being integrated into the ATC system that Thales has adapted for the specifics of Vantis’s BVLOS drone network, using its experience as a provider to scores of airports worldwide.

According to Frank Matus, director of ATC and digital aviation solutions for Thales USA, the FAA approval granted to uAvionix will be of great benefit to the looming push to accelerate testing of advanced drone operations across Vantis this summer.

“We thank the Federal Aviation Administration for acknowledging that our approach to BVLOS in North Dakota maintains the same safety standards that the agency expects for all users within the national airspace,” said Matus. “We continue to collaborate with FAA as regulations evolve to ensure that Vantis meets the needs of all stakeholders.”

Emirates partnership with Inmarsat evolves as it taps GX for A350s - Runway Girl Network,"Thu, 12 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMjMvMDEvZW1pcmF0ZXMtaW5tYXJzYXQtZ3gtYTM1MHMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Despite a legacy of powering cockpit and cabin connectivity for Emirates with its L-band satellite services, Inmarsat has historically not enjoyed a direct partnership with the UAE carrier. But according to the London-headquartered satellite operator, that relationship has evolved now that Emirates has selected Inmarsat’s GX Aviation-powered broadband connectivity for 50 incoming Airbus A350-900s, with deliveries beginning in 2024.

“This announcement marks the beginning of a direct partnership between Emirates and Inmarsat, and Inmarsat will continue to look for further opportunities to support Emirates in providing the best inflight connectivity service to its passengers,” Inmarsat Aviation regional vice president, Middle East, Neale Faulkner told Runway Girl Network after the announcement dropped that Emirates has selected Inmarsat “as the inflight connectivity provider” for its incoming fleet of A350s.

He demurred in disclosing whether Inmarsat will serve as aero ISP on the A350s or if Emirates’ longtime partner SITA will retain its role for these birds but assured that: “Further details will follow as the programme progresses.” SITA could not provide immediate comment.

Faulkner did confirm, however, that Emirates has chosen the ThinKom Solutions Ka2517 VICTS antenna for these installations. And ThinKom last night informed its following on LinkedIn that it is: “Happy to hear our partners Inmarsat and Safran have been selected to connect the Emirates A350 fleet.”

Safran Passenger Innovations’ GX terminal, based on the Ka2517 hardware, is being offered by Airbus as a linefit option under the airframer’s new supplier-furnished HBCplus programme, for which Inmarsat is a managed service provider (MSP). If Emirates has picked the SPI terminal under HBCplus, then it is among the launch customers for the programme, and Inmarsat will presumably serve as MSP. We await clarity, however, on whether this is the structure being pursued, or if the kit will be delivered via post-delivery retrofit.

“We are delighted that Emirates has joined the GX Aviation family. This will be the first fleet with Emirates to be equipped with our highly advanced GX Aviation solution,” said Inmarsat Aviation senior vice president of inflight connectivity William Huot-Marchand in a statement.

But while the A350s will technically be the first Emirates aircraft to take advantage of the GX satellite network, Emirates previously tapped Thales as integrator for GX connectivity on its forthcoming Boeing 777Xs as part of a deal that includes Thales in-seat IFE hardware for the twinjets (representing a departure for the long-time Panasonic IFE customer). Deliveries of the 777Xs are delayed until 2025. The A350s, meanwhile, are expected to begin arriving in 2024, and will come equipped with Thales’ nextgen IFE with 4K QLED HDR displays.

Emirates uses SITA as its aero ISP to manage IFC services across its current fleets with disparate IFC hardware. (SITA integrated a personalisation program for Emirates across principal combinations of the Airbus ALNA connectivity backbone with Inmarsat SwiftBroadband L-band satellite service; Airbus ALNA with Panasonic Avionics’ Ku-band connectivity service, and Panasonic’s Global Communicates Services platform via Ku.)

Somewhat remarkably, given the lower-bandwidth, L-band IFC solution in place on many Emirates aircraft, the airline offers complimentary Internet access through the SITA-powered ‘OnAir’ network to specific passengers — all Skywards Gold or Silver members travelling in business class, in addition to first class, and Platinum members travelling in any cabin class. “Due to limited bandwidth and satellite data cost, media streaming and some sync services are restricted. Available bandwidth is optimised to provide a better or fairer experience for everyone,” Emirates states online.

SITA also happens to be a value added reseller of Inmarsat GX so it is very familiar with the service. But Inmarsat has taken a more direct approach to the market in recent years. Another satellite operator that has gone direct in aero is Carlsbad, California-based Viasat, which intends to acquire Inmarsat, pending regulatory approval. Should Viasat complete the acquisition, it will have placement at Emirates and a raft of other Inmarsat clients, as well as a GX network that currently consists of five Ka-band satellites, with seven more payloads in the pipeline.

The University of Sydney extends partnership with Thales Australia - Honi Soit,"Tue, 10 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vaG9uaXNvaXQuY29tLzIwMjMvMDEvdGhlLXVuaXZlcnNpdHktb2Ytc3lkbmV5LWV4dGVuZHMtcGFydG5lcnNoaXAtd2l0aC10aGFsZXMtYXVzdHJhbGlhL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"On 22 December 2022, the University of Sydney announced the renewal of its partnership with French defence giant Thales.

The extension of the 2017 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the two organisations aims to focus on ‘big data, machine learning and artificial intelligence’.

The new deal was collectively signed by USyd’s Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research) Professor Emma Johnston and Thales Australia and New Zealand CEO Jeff Connolly. It aims to accelerate national security outcomes, embedding staff within each other’s organisation.

Thus far, the partnership has heavily involved the Faculty of Engineering, with Thales funding PhD projects and industry placements. It is expected that this will continue in the fields of Aerospace, Mechanical and Mechatronic engineering, as well as Electrical and Informational Engineering.

USyd Education Officers Yasmine Johnson and Ishbel Dunsmore criticised this development, saying that Australian education is “becoming increasingly geared towards Australian militarism and industry”.

“We oppose the further integration into campus life of a company responsible for weapons deployed in brutal wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the militarisation of European borders to prevent refugees from reaching safety, and the oppression of Palestinians,” they said.

The arms manufacturer is infamous for suppressing union movements, complying with the war crimes in Yemen, underpaying workers by $5.4 million and for massive job cuts in their Australian operations. They also have partnerships with Israeli organisations like Elbit Systems, manufacturer of the Watchkeeper WK450 drone that has been used to support UK’s operations in Afghanistan.

Belinda Hutchinson, USyd’s Chancellor, is also the Chairperson of Thales Australia’s board, having been appointed in 2015. Such a connection has been heavily criticised by staff and students.

A University of Sydney spokesperson mentioned that this partnership has allowed space for development and “academic freedom” for their researchers. “All research must take place in tandem with the university’s mission and core values.”

“Signed in 2017 and extended in 2022 the agreement has facilitated the hosting of at least 8 students’ semester placements (ESIPS) at Thales which has helped our students understand how realistic engineering solutions are applied in industry and assess whether their preferred future employment options lie with the company,” said a university spokesperson."

Thales will manufacture GM200 radar for Ukraine

France will allocate funds for the purchase of GM200 radar for Ukraine.

French Defense Minister Sébastien Lecornu stated that the agreement on radar will be signed with Thales on February 1.

Their transfer will allow Ukraine to strengthen the military airspace control system.

According to Lecornu, back in December he learned from the Minister of Defense of Ukraine, Oleksii Reznikov, about the need for such radars.

Funds for them will be spent from a special fund of support for Ukraine created by France.

The Minister of Defense of Ukraine is supposed to visit Thales, where he will be presented with this Ground Master 200 (GM200) radar.

It can be integrated into the SAMP/T air defense system, which is also provided to Ukraine.

The GM 200 mobile aerial target detection radar is part of the Ground Master family of radars.

The GM200 model with all its equipment is installed in a container that transports a truck with a wheel arrangement 8×8.

Ground Master GM200 multi-band radar can simultaneously observe air and surface, detect air targets within a radius of up to 250 kilometers (in combat mode – up to 100 kilometers).

GM200 has an open architecture and the ability to integrate with other Ground Master (GM 400) systems, control systems, and air defense systems. If Thales’ pricing hasn’t changed much since 2013, when the UAE purchased 17 GM200 radars for $396 million, then one radar costs around $23 million, which is probably already higher.

Dubbed the TeQuantS project, the satellite system will be employed across cyber security and future quantum information networks, enabling the partners to build satellite and optical ground stations by the close of 2026.

Satellites are viewed as a preferred option for long-distance quantum communication over ground-based fiber-optic links which are limited to a range of some 150 kilometres.

============== ==============

Quantum communications are currently the focus of major research and development programs, notably the EuroQCI project in Europe.

“Supporting European autonomy, leadership and responsibility in today’s digital world is becoming increasingly important. We are proud to be working with the consortium led by Thales Alenia Space to ensure that European citizens will continue to benefit from space-based secure connectivity in everyday life on Earth,” European Space Agency telecommunications and integrated applications acting director Javier Benedicto said.

1

Thales Alenia Space telecommunications executive vice president Marc-Henri Serre said that the project will enhance European “sovereignty”.

“We’re delighted to be working with our partners to develop quantum technologies that will demonstrate the ability to establish operational long-distance satellite quantum communications links and support Europe’s sovereignty in this area,” he said.

“We thank ESA, CNES and the Austrian Space Agency for their vital support on this project, which is addressing future cyber security and quantum information network challenges.”

A major security issue will require secure cryptographic keys to be generated and distributed, while resisting the ability for current quantum computers to crack cryptographic keys.

Another significant challenge for quantum information networks will be enabling future quantum computers and sensors to talk to each other and fulfil their promised exponential gains in performance.

Thales Alenia Space leads a consortium of firms in the TeQuantS project, these include Airbus Defence and Space, ALPAO, AUREA Technology, BERTIN Technologies, MIRATLAS, OGS Technologies, QTlabs, SIGMAWORKS and two research laboratories at Sorbonne University and Côte d’Azur University."
Thales to support Royal Navy's S1850M radar - ADS Advance,"Wed, 18 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFkc2FkdmFuY2UuY28udWsvdGhhbGVzLXRvLXN1cHBvcnQtcm95YWwtbmF2eS1zLXMxODUwbS1yYWRhci5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales to support Royal Navy's S1850M radar

The Ministry of Defence (MoD) and the French and Italian ministries of defence, represented by OCCAR, have signed a contract renewal with Thales for the maintenance and support of the S1850M volume search radars in use by their navies.

Above: S1850M.

The S1850M Long Range Air Surveillance Radar is a derivative of the SMART L radar. With 26 systems sold to leading European navies, SMART-L and S1850M have become a de facto NATO standard for naval long-range radar systems.

The new service contract, which covers a period of three years, with an optional additional two years, was signed on behalf of the three nations by OCCAR (Organisation for Joint Armament Cooperation). ​It includes high quality support services such as desk support, an onsite technical assistance, and implementation of the Thales Customer Portal.

It includes an annual obsolescence scan and health check in addition to more complex tasks such as monitoring and configuration management. Thales will also annually host Customer Days, for attendance by representatives from the three Navies and OCCAR.

The S1850M radar, based on the Thales' SMART-L Volume Search Radar, is the long-range radar (LRR) of the Principal Anti Air Missile System (PAAMS) used on the Royal Navy’s Type 45 Destroyers, Queen Elisabeth class Aircraft Carriers and the French and Italian class Horizon Frigates.

The S1850M system is a 3D multibeam radar designed to provide long-range air & surface surveillance and target designation. Additional capabilities can be introduced during lifetime according to customer needs. This makes the radar future proof in case of evolving requirements. With fully automatic detection and track initiation, this radar part of the Ballistic Missile Defence System can track up to 1,000 air targets at a range of around 400 kilometres, including stealth targets in cluttered environments.

With 26 systems sold to European navies, SMART-L and its derivative S1850M have become the de facto NATO standard for naval long-range radar systems.

“Gerben Edelijn, SVP of Above Water Systems, Thales, said: This service contract proves that Thales’ naval sensors can meet user requirements for a great many years. We are glad to keep supporting three of Europe’s leading navies in their mission to protect their nations, personnel and valuable assets. This contract demonstrates the increasing need for cooperation between defence organisations and industry in Europe. Uniformity of equipment facilitates this cooperation.”"
French Air Force CN235 avionics upgrade - Scramble (NL),"Wed, 18 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjcmFtYmxlLm5sL21pbGl0YXJ5LW5ld3MvZnJlbmNoLWFpci1mb3JjZS1jbjIzNS1hdmlvbmljcy11cGdyYWRl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"French Air Force CN235 avionics upgrade

On 20 December 2022, the Direction générale de l'Armement (DGA, French Defence Procurement Agency) has notified Sabena Technics and Thales France of a framework agreement related to a complete cockpit renovation for the Armée de l'Air et de l'Espace (AAE, French Air and Space Force) fleet of CN235M transport aircraft.

The deal, valued at € 107 million, includes the firm part of the development, qualification and certification of the avionics modification including the delivery of a prototype for each of the two versions of the aircraft, CN235-200M and CN235-300M, by the end of 2026. The modernisation of all 27 aircraft in the fleet will be done between 2026 and 2031.

The aim of this complete cockpit overhaul is to bring the aircraft into compliance with the new international air navigation standards to enable them to continue integrating into civil air traffic by increasing navigation precision and replacing obsolete equipment. The upgrade will also improve navigation performance for tactical missions.

Thales gave details on workshare between the two companies, which have formed a Temporary Company Group. Sabena Technics at Dinard (Brittany) will will carry out the mechanical and electrical modifications of the aircraft, the integration of avionic equipment, the additional type certification and military qualification of the refurbished aircraft.

Thales supplies TopStarC GPS receivers, inertial navigation systems, and the TopDeck suite that is already fitted to ATR72-600 regional transport aircraft but is specially redesigned for the CN235s. Finally, Thales will equip these devices with the latest generation of radio altimeters, immune to 5G interference. The Bordeaux, Brive, Châtellerault, Toulouse, Valence and Vendôme sites will contribute to this modernisation programme.

The new avionics will allow the CN235s to blend into traffic and the life of the fleet is expected to be extended to 2040.

The CN235 is a medium-range twin-engined transport aircraft capable to carry five tons of cargo or forty passengers. The current fleet, divided into nineteen CN235-200M and eight CN235-300M, is operated in mainland France, overseas and in the context of external operations for various missions. The oldest aircraft is already in service since 1992. The following units operate the transporter:

Quebec and Montreal to fund new metro train control system - International Railway Journal,"Thu, 26 Jan 2023 14:04:54 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJhaWxqb3VybmFsLmNvbS9zaWduYWxsaW5nL3F1ZWJlYy1hbmQtbW9udHJlYWwtdG8tZnVuZC1uZXctbWV0cm8tdHJhaW4tY29udHJvbC1zeXN0ZW0v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"THE Quebec provincial government and the city of Montreal have committed themselves to investing more than $C 565m ($US 422.2m) in a new train control system for the Montreal Transport (STM) metro.

The project will begin with implementation on the Blue Line and will be financed primarily by Quebec to the tune of $C 296.6m, with STM contributing $C 65.6m and a request for additional funding being made to the Canadian federal government.

In issuing a call for tenders for the new system, STM says it will be based “on a more efficient CBTC-type technology, used by the vast majority of metro operators around the world.”

Installation of the new train control system is expected to be completed on the existing Blue Line in 2028 and in 2029 on its 6km extension, running east from Saint-Michel to Anjou with five stations and currently under construction. It will be installed on the Green, Orange and Yellow lines at a later date which has still to be decided.

“The new train control system brings our metro network into the modern age,” says Montreal mayor, Ms Valérie Plante. “This investment demonstrates the government of Quebec’s commitment to the development of Montreal’s public transit network.”

“This project will ensure the technological viability of the metro network for decades to come, in addition to allowing more flexibility in the positioning of trains,” says STM director general, Ms Marie-Claude Léonard.

In April 2022, as part of its efforts to upgrade signalling systems on the metro network, STM exercised an option in a contract awarded to Thales in 2018 to install computer-based interlocking systems at eight metro stations.

CAAP in talks with French firm for third-party maintenance of air traffic system - GMA News Online,"Thu, 12 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5nbWFuZXR3b3JrLmNvbS9uZXdzL3RvcHN0b3JpZXMvbmF0aW9uLzg1NzIzMC9jYWFwLWluLXRhbGtzLXdpdGgtZnJlbmNoLWZpcm0tZm9yLXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LW1haW50ZW5hbmNlLW9mLWFpci10cmFmZmljLXN5c3RlbS9zdG9yeS_SAZQBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ21hbmV0d29yay5jb20vbmV3cy90b3BzdG9yaWVzL25hdGlvbi84NTcyMzAvY2FhcC1pbi10YWxrcy13aXRoLWZyZW5jaC1maXJtLWZvci10aGlyZC1wYXJ0eS1tYWludGVuYW5jZS1vZi1haXItdHJhZmZpYy1zeXN0ZW0vc3RvcnkvP2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) is currently negotiating with French firm Thales Group—one of the companies that provided the Philippines its Communication, Navigation and Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) system—to serve as the system's third-party maintenance provider.

""We have been negotiating with Thales to get them as our third-party provider as far as maintenance is concerned,"" CAAP Director General Manuel Antonio Tamayo said on Thursday.

He disclosed this during the Senate public services committee investigation into the January 1 Philippine airspace shutdown after he told the senators that the warranty for the system's maintenance expired in 2020.

""The CNS/ATM had a warranty that expired in 2020 and it is only up to that time that they [Thales and Sumitomo] are providing support as far as the CNS/ATM is concerned,"" Tamayo said.

The CNS/ATM system in the Philippines was procured through a deal with a Sumitomo-Thales joint venture.

Thales is in charge of the air traffic management system software, as explained by its country representative Harry Nuske. Meanwhile, Sumitomo is more of an ""integrator"" for the building and civil works, its resident representative Lloyd Chadwick Lim said.

Currently, Tamayo said, the ""qualified and well-trained"" CAAP technicians are maintaining the CNS/ATM.

""Our personnel, our technicians at CAAP are qualified and well-trained to maintain the system. In fact, they were trained by the Thales themselves aside from CAAP. They are well-experienced and they've been with CAAP for some time so they are the ones maintaining the [Air Traffic Management Center],"" he said.

But Poe said there should be a third-party audit on the CNS/ATM, considering reports that the uninterruptible power supply (UPS) had malfunctioned and caused the airspace shutdown.

Tamayo said the UPS was maintained by Filipino company P2RO Inc. and it was last checked two years ago.

""The last time they checked the UPS system was two years when they changed the batteries,"" the CAAP chief said.

Asked by Poe if this is normal procedure, Sumitomo's Lim said there should be a regular maintenance of this component of the CNS/ATM and it would be beneficial for the CAAP to get a third-party expert to conduct an audit.

""Ideally, there should be regular maintenance aside from battery checks but DG Tamayo is correct when he says they actually have qualified people inside the CAAP [who have] been working with CAAP for a while, who should be able to maintain by themselves, but if they prefer to have and I agree totally with you [Poe] as well: having a third-party expert such as P2RO supplier would be beneficial,"" Lim said.

Lim added that when Sumitomo was maintaining the CNS/ATM it followed the equipment, operations and maintenance manual which requires daily, weekly, and monthly periodic checks.

Tamayo said they are ""religiously following"" the maintenance checks as provided under the manual and everything was logged by their technicians, including the ""unusual parameters.""

Although CAAP is already negotiating with Thales for the CNS/ATM's maintenance, Tamayo said the French firm is requiring the Philippine government to settle almost P1 billion in claims first before entering a new contract for the third-party maintenance service.

""They [Thales] gave us an offer and with the caveat that we have to settle first,"" Tamayo said.

Transportation Undersecretary for Aviations and Airports Roberto Lim said the Thales-Sumitomo joint venture's claims involve a total amount of P986,653,157.81 which was divided into three different types of claims:

Suspension claims worth P477 million. This is a consequence of the suspension of contract due to a notice of disallowance in 2011 which was eventually lifted in 2013.

Prolongation claim worth over P387 million. This is the consequence of the delay due to the suspension of the contract and the delay of the implementation of the work instruction by the Department of Transportation.

Price escalation claim worth over P121 million, which is a consequence of the delay of the project contractors.

On the other hand, the DOTr also has P644 million in claims against the joint venture. Lim said this is for the delay in the delivery of the system.

Lim said a solution committee was organized some time in 2020 and there were presentations of the position of the parties but the panel had denied the claims of the contractors.

For their part, Thales' Nuske said the French firm's stand is that it will not push through with a new contract for the CNS/ATM until the claims are resolved.

""The outstanding claims, particularly in the case of the suspension claim, has been outstanding since 2013. So the position of Thales is that we are not willing to enter into a new contract until we have resolved the outstanding claims of the existing contract,"" Nuske said.

While they are negotiating for a new contract, Nuske clarified that Thales can only handle the maintenance of the air traffic management software and not the power supply component.

""I should also add that the support service that we are discussing with CAAP relates to the ATMS software it does not relate to, for example, a UPS support. So it's a slightly different system, different technology to what the incident occurred on the first of January,"" he said. — BM, GMA Integrated News"

It is understood that French-owned Thales group’s Australian Munitions operation at Mulwala in New South Wales will supply the gunpowder for the manufacture of the shells which will be forged in France by Nexter.

Australian Munitions is the largest supplier of explosive ordnance to the Australian Defence Force.

In 2021 Thales committed $6 million to a major reinvestment at the Mulwala plant.

The munitions could be fired from M777 howitzers previously supplied by Australia and other nations, with the new agreement part of efforts to ramp up defence production to meet the needs of the ongoing war.

Western countries have mainly supplied Ukraine from existing stocks, however additional sources of supply are now needed as the war drags on.

At their meeting attended by foreign minister Penny Wong and defence minister Richard Marles, the ministers reiterated their unequivocal condemnation of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and called once more for Russia’s immediate withdrawal.

They said in a statement: “France and Australia expressed their shared commitment to Ukraine’s security and their strong resolve to continue to support Ukraine.

“Ministers announced their intent to provide support to Ukraine including through joint supply of 155-millimetre ammunition.

“The initiative leverages the complementarities of respective defence industries and meets Ukraine’s urgent need for 155-millimetre ammunition.”

During Thursday’s hearing on the Philippine airspace shutdown on New Year’s Day, Thales country manager Harry Nuske said, “We are not willing to enter into a new contract [with the CAAP] until the existing claims are settled.” The French company was the equipment supplier of the Communications, Navigation, and Surveillance/Air Trafffic Management (CNS/ATM) in joint venture with Sumitomo Corp., under the P10-billion project funded by a loan from the Japan International Cooperation Agency.

He also clarified that they were in talks with the CAAP for “support service that relate to software, not a UPS [uninterruptible power supply] support.” In the initial hours of the system shutdown, CAAP’s engineers thought the failure was due to a blown UPS, but further investigation showed it was due to the tripping of a circuit breaker.

According to Transportation Undersecretary Robert C.O. Lim, the P987-million claims of Thales include: P477 million in suspension claims arising from the three-year suspension of the CNS/ATM project from 2010-2013; P387 million in prolongation claims due to the prolonged suspension of the work; and P121 million in escalation claims. The suspension claims came about because of the notice of disallowance issued by the Commission on Audit on the procurement of the equipment, which was only cleared in 2013 after repeated appeals made by the then Department of Transportation and Communications.

CAAP Director General Manuel Tamayo told lawmakers, “We totally agree that [that we should get an outside maintenance provider], even while our own technicians are fully qualified [to maintain the equipment].” He added, “We tried negotiating with the supplier for services, and they sent us a quotation. In fact we had a budget in 2020 specifically for that.” But the DOTr and Thales could not settle their claims and counterclaims. The DOTr had counterclaims against Thales for the delay in supplying the equipment needed for the project.

The warranty on the CNS/ATM equipment and services expired in 2020, just two years after the system was actually operated. The project had been mulled since the early 2000s, but had been delayed until an actual contract was signed in November 2010 between government and Sumitomo-Thales. The latter was contracted to build the air traffic management building, automation equipment, terminal radars and other components.

In his earlier testimony, former Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade said in Filipino, his administration didn’t pay Thales “because they didn’t submit the documents [which covered their claims].” He added his agency discussed with Thales and Sumitomo the possibility of settling the claims covered by documents, “but we will go to arbitration on the outstanding claims. Unfortunately, the discussions just hanged.”

DOTr thereafter organized a committee to look at Thales’ claims but Tugade said, “They [committee] advised me not pay the claims because the liquidated damages [owed by the French firm] because of the delay from the project were larger, so why should I pay for that? These are not debts we owe them but claims, wherein talks on their settlement should have been pursued six months ago when we left office.” He didn’t say how much DOTr was owed.

DOTr’s Lim expressed optimism the claims of both DOTr and Thales will be resolved by February this year.

South African judge on Zuma's corruption case recuses himself - Africanews English,"Tue, 31 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFmcmljYW5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjMvMDEvMzAvc291dGgtYWZyaWNhbi1qdWRnZS1vbi16dW1hcy1jb3JydXB0aW9uLWNhc2UtcmVjdXNlcy1oaW1zZWxmL9IBZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFmcmljYW5ld3MuY29tL2FtcC8yMDIzLzAxLzMwL3NvdXRoLWFmcmljYW4tanVkZ2Utb24tenVtYXMtY29ycnVwdGlvbi1jYXNlLXJlY3VzZXMtaGltc2VsZi8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The judge in the corruption trial of former South African President Jacob Zuma announced Monday (Jan. 30) at a hearing that he would recuse himself from the case, risking the case going back to court.

""I have come to the conclusion that I must recuse myself from the trial. This is what the proper administration of justice, the Constitution and my conscience dictates,"" said Judge Piet Koen in the Pietermaritzburg court (southeast) during a televised hearing.

Jacob Zuma, 80, is accused of taking bribes from the French defense group Thales in a case that dates back more than 20 years ago. He is charged with 16 counts of fraud, corruption and racketeering. Thales is also charged with corruption and money laundering.

The former head of state was not present at the technical hearing.

For months, Mr. Zuma has been lobbying for the recusal of the chief prosecutor in the trial, Billy Downer, whom he accuses of bias. Last year, Judge Koen rejected this request.

He is now concerned that this decision could lead to his own impartiality being questioned ""when the question arises as to whether Mr. Zuma received a constitutionally fair trial,"" he said.

""If Justice Koen does not continue the trial, a new judge will have to sit,"" Cathy Powell, a constitutional scholar at the University of Cape Town, told AFP. The trial would then have to ""start from the beginning"", the lawyer fears.

Zuma's corruption trial began in May 2021, with numerous postponements and delays due to a proliferation of appeals launched by the accused.

A landmark report on rampant corruption during Jacob Zuma's nine-year presidency (2009-2018), submitted last year to President Cyril Ramaphosa, highlighted the central role of the former head of state in the systematic looting of public coffers.

Jacob Zuma, who stubbornly refused to testify before an ad hoc commission of inquiry, was sentenced to 15 months in prison for contempt of court. His imprisonment in July 2021 triggered an unprecedented wave of violence and looting in South Africa in a deteriorating socio-economic context.

He was released on parole after two months on medical grounds.

The next hearing in his trial has been set for April 17."
Failed air traffic system state-of-art but needs upgrade: CAAP - PortCalls,"Fri, 13 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvcnRjYWxscy5jb20vZmFpbGVkLWFpci10cmFmZmljLXN5c3RlbS1zdGF0ZS1vZi1hcnQtYnV0LW5lZWRzLXVwZ3JhZGUtY2FhcC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The failed communications, navigation, surveillance/air traffic management system at CAAP is still a state-of-the-art air traffic control suite but requires a software and hardware upgrade

CAAP director general Manuel Antonio Tamayo took full responsibility for the New Year’s Day shutdown at NAIA and other Philippine airports which halted hundreds of flights

CAAP will conduct a feasibility study for a “second independent system” or a backup for the CNS/ATM system

The civil aviation regulator is also negotiating with Thales, a partner in the joint venture that installed the system, to provide third-party service maintenance

Transportation Secretary Jaime Bautista vowed to fast-track resolution of the dispute between DOTr and Thales-Sumitomo

The Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines’ (CAAP) communications, navigation, surveillance/air traffic management (CNS/ATM) system is still state-of-the-art but requires a software and hardware upgrade, CAAP director general Manuel Antonio Tamayo said.

Philippine airspace was shut down for a few hours on January 1 due to a power outage in the air traffic control system.

“The CNS/ATM at this point in time is still state of the art and a gold standard as far as air traffic control is concerned. It just needs [upgrading of] software and hardware,” Tamayo said during the January 12 hearing on the airspace mess called by the Senate Committee on Public Services.

Based on CAAP’s investigation, Tamayo said the outage was triggered by a faulty circuit breaker and not the system’s uninterruptable power supply (UPS) as initially reported.

He explained the UPS de-energized the CNS/ATM equipment at 9:49 am when it detected a flaw in the system – the damaged circuit breaker. The de-energizing was a security feature of the UPS to protect the equipment from further damage.

The Department of Information and Communications Technology-attached agency Cybercrime Investigation and Coordinating Center (CICC) conducted a parallel investigation of the incident on January 3 and ruled out a cyberattack.

Tamayo said CAAP still doesn’t know what caused the damage to one of the circuit breakers. He said the damaged circuit breaker and power transfer switch were turned over to the CICC for forensic investigation.

The CAAP chief took full responsibility for the New Year’s Day breakdown.

“On behalf of CAAP and DOTr [Department of Transportation], we again extend our sincerest apologies to all those who were inconvenienced and greatly affected by this circumstance, which is something we are not proud of,” Tamayo said.

“We take this as a lesson and we manifest to this honorable committee and fellow Filipinos that we take full responsibility and accountability for what happened,” he added.

“We commit to see through this ordeal and remain transparent in all our dealings and of service to the Filipinos in ensuring that our skies are safe,” Tamayo stated.

CAAP will conduct a feasibility study for a “second independent system” or a backup system for the CNS/ATM, he said. The study will cost around P200 million while the new system may cost as much as the existing CNS/ATM (about P10 billion).

Moreover, Tamayo said CAAP is negotiating with Thales, one of the joint venture partners that set up the CNS/ATM system, to provide third-party service maintenance. The maintenance warranty for the system expired in 2020. Maintenance works since then have been performed by CAAP personnel trained by the joint venture.

The French company supplied the CNS/ATM while its joint-venture partner, Sumitomo Corp. of Japan, completed the building and civil works for the project funded by loans from the Japan International Cooperation Agency.

Thales country representative Harry Nuske, however, said they are “not keen” on entering into a new contract with CAAP until existing claims are settled.

DOTr Undersecretary for Aviation and Airports Roberto Lim said Thales’ claims totalling P987 million include a suspension claim arising from the three-year pause in the CNS/ATM project from 2010-2013, a prolongation claim due to the prolonged suspension of the work, and an escalation claim.

The delays stemmed from the Commission on Audit’s disallowance of payments to the joint venture in 2011, a decision reversed in 2013.

Lim said DOTr created a claims committee in September last year to resolve the dispute and expected the first claim would be resolved this month, and the remaining claims in February.

Transportation Secretary Jaime Bautista vowed to fast-track the resolution of the dispute between DOTr and Thales-Sumitomo.

Meanwhile, to address the workforce gap for air traffic controllers, Bautista expressed support for legislation that will exempt CAAP employees from the salary standardization law to provide better benefits and salaries on par with those offered in the Middle East.

“We also support the bill that will exempt the employees of CAAP from the government salary standardization because we know that we need to retain these people, or else, they will leave the country, not because they don’t love the country, but for economic reasons. They also need to support their families and give their families a very good livelihood,” he said."
Palestine Action activists occupy arms factory in Edinburgh - Morning Star Online,"Thu, 19 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vbW9ybmluZ3N0YXJvbmxpbmUuY28udWsvYXJ0aWNsZS9iL3BhbGVzdGluZS1hY3Rpb24tYWN0aXZpc3RzLW9jY3VweS1hcm1zLWZhY3RvcnktaW4tZWRpbmJ1cmdo0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"ACTIVISTS in Scotland today occupied an arms factory in Edinburgh in protest at the firm’s “deep complicity” in the “brutalisation and murder of Palestinians.”

Four protesters, who are members of the direct action group Palestine Action Scotland, broke into the factory owned by Leonardo UK, a subsidiary of Italian arms giant Leonardo, in Edinburgh at 5am this morning.

The group said that the activists managed to break in despite tough security, including a double fence, before spraying red paint on the walls and reportedly breaking windows and equipment.

Palestine Action said that it targeted the factory because of Leonardo’s links to the Israeli military, claiming the firm supplies weapons parts and laser systems to the country.

A heavy police presence, including a force helicopter, was present at the scene, as activists let off flares on the roof of the building. Police blocked off the road.

Palestine Action activists targeted Thales’s factory in Glasgow in the summer of last year.

The action marks another expansion of the firms targeted by the group, which has largely targeted sites owned by Israel arms firm Elbit Systems.

A spokesperson from Palestine Action Scotland said: “We’ve taken on Thales, and now we’ve taken on Leonardo.

“Any company supplying Israel should be well aware by now that Scotland is not a safe place for them to conduct their deadly trade. If you assist the ethnic cleansing of Palestine, know that we'll come and shut you down.”

The Edinburgh factory produces lasers and radar technology for combat aircraft, including the US Apache attack helicopter, and the Eurofighter Typhoon, according to the Leonardo UK website."

In our first interview, we spoke to Maisie Howes from Thales.

Maisie Howes

Name: Maisie Howes | Age: 22 | Employer: Thales, Manor Royal | Role: Content & Media Architect

When did you start your apprenticeship? I started my apprenticeship at Thales in April 2020, right at the beginning of the Covid-19 lockdown. Due to isolation procedures, I completed most of my first year remotely; learning the role from my bedroom. Why did you choose Thales' apprenticeship scheme and what makes their programme so good?: I chose an apprenticeship with Thales, over other options, as they provided more incentives and had a passion to develop those wanting an apprenticeship. Some employers offered an extremely low salary, which to me, communicated that their apprentices were not that valuable to them. Whereas Thales made it clear to me in their job openings that they have a dedication to developing their employees. It was refreshing to see a company that understood that although apprentices have to study, they are ultimately working employees; they recognise that we will have a positive impact to the business within a matter of months. Since joining, I have experienced nothing but support from my colleagues and they have played a huge part in helping me achieve my current position.

How would you define what an apprentice is? Based on my experiences, an apprentice is someone, of any age over 16, who is enabled to learn their trade in a real working environment before entering a full time position. My Apprenticeship included one external study day a week, so 20% of my time was ‘theory’ and the rest of the time I was working for Thales completing business projects. During my ‘working hours’, I was mentored by knowledge experts and I shadowed their work until I was comfortable with Thales’ ways of working.

Obviously, we have The Apprentice on TV at the moment, being an actual apprentice is nothing like that is it? No it isn’t, well, they would both look great on your CV, but being a real apprentice isn’t like being on the TV programme. You should expect to see some variety in projects assigned to you by your manager or apprenticeship provider; this will give you experience and further understanding about the industry you are in, but there won’t be any crossing and changing of industries like on The Apprentice. Also, everyone loves the drama within the teams on The Apprentice, I certainly do, but actually, this is the furthest from reality and disrespecting your colleagues won’t be tolerated in a healthy working environment. Instead, it would really benefit you to develop your communication and interpersonal skills for when you do collaborate on projects.

Do you think people who do not know what being an apprentice entails get the wrong idea by watching The Apprentice? I can see how some people may get confused as to whether The Apprentice is like an actual apprenticeship, especially if they haven’t been in employment before. When I used to watch the programme, I remember it helped me to identify different roles and responsibilities within a project taskforce. Like a project manager. I was able to grasp which responsibilities would sit with who and when I started my first corporate role, (the Digital Content Producer Apprenticeship) I realised that this aspect of the programme was realistic and it helped me to understand my team and their responsibilities.

What would you say to anyone interested in becoming an apprentice and why? I would suggest to start by considering where you want to be in 5 years, this is an exercise my manager taught me and I found it really helped me to think about the long term and how the actions that I could be taking now, would help me in my apprenticeship and beyond. So, imagine where you would realistically like to be in your career in 5 years, then work backwards to find out where you need to start. After some research, this will help you to know which apprenticeships are right for you and what experiences you’ll need to gather during your employment. If you need to complete a higher apprenticeship level to achieve your goals, you can ask your employer what development programmes or commitments they have so you can ensure you choose the right apprenticeship and company that will allow you to pursue the additional education and reach your full potential. Then you start to create a mini career plan to share with your manager who will help direct you.

What is the best thing about being an apprentice? The best thing about being an apprentice, especially at Thales, is the culture and support you will experience throughout. Of-course earning a wage whilst studying is another huge positive, but being surrounded by a team of industry professionals who are willing to show you how to succeed is invaluable. Most importantly, they understand that you don’t know everything, that’s what you are there to do – to learn. So there is a lot less pressure on you to ‘get it right’ so you can experiment and grow into the role as you progress through your apprenticeship.

Thales apprentices play a key role in creating innovative solutions to meet some of the UK’s greatest challenges

What are your future ambitions in your career? I started as a Digital Content Producer Apprentice and since completing my apprenticeship, I have continued my employment to learn even more about the business. Thales have a great internal mobility programme, which allows employees as well as myself, to explore and delve into other roles. I have since been offered my current position, where I am using my apprenticeship skills to produce content directed at a variety of Thales needs, including both internal and external audiences, something I am hugely proud and appreciative of. I have created a variety of digital content from interactive eLearning modules for UK wide and global completion, to promotional material including banners and flyers for particular events and business changes, I love the variety of my work, one day I could be producing a video and the next I will be problem solving and evaluating the impact of our content. I have been trusted with my first time role of ‘Project Owner’ for creating our UK Talent communications strategy, so for now, I will be using my knowledge of digital content to help the team to decide where our efforts will have the most impact and what we need to do to maintain internal and external engagement throughout the year.

Karen Frimley, who is Early Careers Advisor at Thales Uk Ltd, explained what they are looking for in a candidate and what makes their programme so good. “We are looking for a candidate that shows potential, has a genuine interest in the roles we have available and is interested in growing and developing a career within Thales,” said Karen.

""We have a full range of apprenticeship roles. It doesn’t matter whether you are a school leaver or an experienced professional, our options span across many areas, which means there is something for everyone. All of our apprenticeships come with a permanent job at the end, lots of development opportunities and a competitive starting salary. We also give our apprentices the opportunity to give back by giving them 80 volunteering hours in each of their first two years. Thales operates to build a future we can all trust at which security is at the forefront.""

Thales also offers various apprenticeship routes. Karen said: “We offer apprenticeship levels from level 3 through to level 6 – these are the equivalent of achieving between 5 GCSE’s and a university degree. There are a huge variety of subjects including, business, corporate functions, software, cyber and engineering.”"
Marcos wants to fast-track upgrade of aviation safety system - pna.gov.ph,"Tue, 24 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiJ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBuYS5nb3YucGgvYXJ0aWNsZXMvMTE5MzQ2MdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Stranded passengers at the airport on Jan. 2, 2023. (PNA photo by Yancy Lim)

MANILA – President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. has ordered the fast-tracking of the modernization of the country’s aviation safety system to avoid glitches similar to the Jan. 1 incident at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA).

At a media briefing in Malacañang on Tuesday, Department of Transportation (DOTr) Secretary Jaime Bautista said the management agreement with Sumitomo-Thales -- the maintenance provider of the communications, navigation, and surveillance/air traffic management (CNS/ATM) system of the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) -- will also be expedited.

“[Marcos] is very much aware of what happened and he supports our recommendation to implement future requirements necessary for the upgrade or improvement of the CNS/ATM system, which includes hardware and software maintenance, hardware replacement, ultimate fallback system for software redundancy and the need for an independent CNS/ATM in a separate location,” Bautista said.

He said the government has been working with Sumitomo-Thales since September last year to help CAAP with the maintenance of the CNS/ATM system.

However, he said a maintenance agreement was not reached due to financial issues with the maintenance provider.

“Mayroon silang claim against the government, mayroon din tayong claim against them and they were just trying to settle this and hopefully by the end of this month, mayroon nang clear indication on how we will be able to settle the issue (They have a claim against the government, we also have a claim against them and they were trying to settle this and hopefully by the end of this month, we’ll have a clear indication on how we will be able to settle the issue),” he said.

He said the government is looking to enter into an agreement with Sumitomo-Thales and separate the issue of claims.

“We met with Sumitomo-Thales a few weeks ago and we suggested that we negotiate for a permanent maintenance agreement pending the settlement of the issues,” he said.

Aside from upgrading the CNS/ATM system, the government is also looking to create an offsite permanent back-up system, possibly in another airport, to keep the system redundant and further minimize the possibility of issues that could affect airport operations.

“We will need to prepare a feasibility study to do this and for us to be able to determine the cost which we will present to NEDA (National Economic and Development Authority) for approval and for funding either from ODA (official development assistance) or from GAA (General Appropriations Act),” he said.

Judge Koen recuses himself from Zuma’s arms deal trial - The Citizen,"Mon, 30 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpdGl6ZW4uY28uemEvbmV3cy9zb3V0aC1hZnJpY2EvY291cnRzL2FybXMtZGVhbC1qdWRnZS1waWV0LWtvZW4tcmVjdXNhbC1qYW51YXJ5LTIwMjMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Judge Koen recuses himself from Zuma’s arms deal trial

Judge Nkosinathi Chili was appointed as the new presiding judge.

Judge Piet Koen – the presiding judge in the arms deal corruption case against former president Jacob Zuma and French arms manufacturer Thales – has recused himself from the trial.

Judge Koen announced his decision to recuse himself from the matter on Monday morning in the KwaZulu-Natal High Court in Pietermaritzburg.

Judge Nkosinathi Chili was appointed as the new presiding judge. The trial was adjourned to 17 April 2023.

Arms deal corruption trial

When the trial adjourned last October, Koen had asked the state and the defence to make submissions on whether he should recuse himself from presiding over the matter.

This after Koen indicated that he might have to recuse himself for the “strong views” he made when he dismissed Zuma‘s bid to get arms deal lead prosecutor, advocate Billy Downer, removed from the corruption and fraud trial.

This also includes the views the judge made about the merits of Zuma’s private prosecution case against Downer and journalist Karyn Maughan for allegedly leaking the former president’s private medical records.

RELATED: Zuma lodges private prosecution proceedings against Downer and journalist

The state had called for Judge Koen to continue to preside over the trial, while Zuma’s legal team wanted the judge to recuse himself arguing that he was conflicted due to his comments.

‘Integrity of judicial processes’

Koen said he was stepping down from the trial to protect the “integrity of the judicial process against any reasonable taint of suspicion”, so that the public and litigants may have the highest confidence in the integrity and fairness of the courts.

“I’ve come to the conclusion, and it was not an easy decision, that I have to recuse myself from the trial.

“It is what the sound administration of justice, the requirements of the constitution and my conscience dictate,” he said.

Zuma and a representative of Thales were not expected in court on Monday as they were excused from the proceedings.

Question of bias

Among his reasons for recusing himself from the trial, Judge Koen said the matter was not about whether he was biased against Zuma for the views that he had expressed.

Instead, he said it was about whether a “reasonable apprehension” of bias may arise because of his previous comments.

“If such suspicion is reasonably apprehended, then that means the end of my involvement in this trial,” said Koen.

The question of whether advocate Downer should remain as a prosecutor in the arms deal trial or whether he should be removed is “inextricably linked” to the merits of Zuma’s private prosecution case against Downer and Maughan, Koen added.

Judge Koen said the 14 grounds Zuma’s legal team relied on to have Downer removed in the special plea application, might also arise in his bid to have the prosecutor withdrawn from the corruption trial.

“As regards whether Mr Zuma receives a constitutionally fair trial, as guaranteed in terms of the constitution, the factual premise underlying each of the 14 grounds of complaint previously raised by Mr Zuma when advancing his case in relation to the special plea might also reasonably arise.”

Zuma’s special plea application

In October 2021, Koen dismissed Zuma’s special plea application to have Downer removed from the arms deal trial.

The former president had argued, among other reasons, that the state prosecutor lacked the title and impartiality to prosecute the case.

Koen disagreed with the grounds Zuma’s legal team relied on to have Downer removed, finding that they were based on “inadmissible hearsay evidence and not on fact”.

Zuma’s subsequent leave to appeal applications before the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) and a reconsideration of that decision by then-SCA President Mandisa Maya were also unsuccessful. The matter is currently before the Constitutional Court.

Zuma and Thales are on trial over the controversial multibillion-rand arms deal concluded in the late 1990s.

The former president and the French arms manufacturer are facing multiple counts including fraud‚ corruption, money laundering and racketeering.

Thales signs contract to supply Operation Control Centre for Santiago Metro Line 7 - Metro Rail Today,"Tue, 10 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vbWV0cm9yYWlsdG9kYXkuY29tL25ld3MvdGhhbGVzLXNpZ25zLWNvbnRyYWN0LXRvLXN1cHBseS1vcGVyYXRpb24tY29udHJvbC1jZW50cmUtZm9yLXNhbnRpYWdvLW1ldHJvLWxpbmUtN9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"(Image Credit: ARUP)

Santiago, Chile (Metro Rail Today): Thales and the operator of the Santiago metro in Chile recently signed two contracts for the supply and maintenance of the Operation Control Centre of Line 7, which is due to enter service at the beginning of 2027. The ten-year maintenance contract will come into effect at the beginning of the services.

The new Line 7 of the Santiago metro will connect the city from west to east, serving residents of the districts of Renca, Cerro Navia, Quinta Normal, Santiago, Providencia, Las Condes and Vitacura. The project will improve the travel experience and reduce travel times by half for the capital's 1.569 million inhabitants. With the incorporation of Line 7, the operational metro network will reach a total length of 174 kilometres with 162 stations.

""We are very pleased to continue working with Santiago metro, as decades of experience have positioned us as a strategic supplier providing the command and supervision systems for all the lines currently available. We are very confident we will be deploying a high-level system,"" said Jean Phillipe Le Nagard, Thales Country Director Southern Cone (Argentina, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay).

The OCC will command and supervise energy equipment and auxiliary systems, including elevators, escalators, lighting and ventilation equipment, at the new line's 19 stations. Other key functions include energising the line through the traction logic subsystem and managing the access and intrusion control subsystems, which monitor the flow of authorised personnel in the line's stations and workshops to improve operations safety and security.

“We are proud to have been selected to help expand the metro system in Santiago de Chile. Line 7 will significantly improve passenger mobility in one of Chile's the most densely populated regions. Thales is already the supplier of the command and supervision centres on all existing lines of the Santiago metro (L1, L2, L3, L4, L4A, L5 and L6). The contract for the new line consolidates an enduring relationship with the Santiago metro that dates back for 50 years, and confirms the customer's trust in the commitment, professionalism and resilience of Thales's teams, We are delighted to bring our latest-generation OCC to Santiago. It is a major recognition of Thales capability to capture and deliver complex projects based on integrated solutions. This large-scale, strategic project further strengthens our leadership in the region,” commented Benoît Couture, Vice-President for Integrated Communications and Supervision activities, Thales

A back-up centre will ensure line supervision in the event of a failure or emergency to guarantee continuity of service."
