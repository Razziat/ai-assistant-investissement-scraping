The Cairo – Giza - Beni Suef railway line is 125 km long and consists of 17 signalling towers





Thales and Orascom Construction sign a new contract in Egypt with the Egyptian National Railways (ENR) for the modernisation of the double-track railway, linking the cities of Cairo, Giza and Beni Suef. The track is located on the east bank of the river Nile, 115 kilometres from the country's capital.

The contract has a budget of more than 300 million euros with a projected execution period of 60 months. Additionally, two years of guarantee and another five years of maintenance services will be provided for the line. The Thales-Orascom Construction consortium will be responsible for modernising the signalling and telecommunications systems, as well as to the renewal of the track within this specific section. The scope of work includes design, supply, construction, testing, and commissioning. Moreover, it includes provisions of spare parts, training, documentation, guarantee with maintenance services, tracks, and civil works.

""Our collaboration with ENR underscores our commitment to revolutionizing rail systems worldwide. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies and our extensive expertise, we aim to enhance passenger safety and reliability, while driving the advancement of transportation networks across the globe."" Dr. Yves Joannic, Vice-President Main Line Signalling Business Line, Thales

“Our continues partnership with ENR marks a significant milestone in our mission to transform Egypt's railway sector. By introducing state-of-the-art signalling systems, we are dedicated to improving the travel experience for passengers in Egypt. Through innovation and collaboration, we strive to optimize punctuality, increase profitability, and elevate the capacity of our railway networks, fostering economic growth and connectivity within the country."" Alessio Bencivenni Managing Director at Ground Transportation Systems, Thales Egypt

The state-of-the-art Thales electronic interlockings and the Centralised Traffic Control Centre, will be implemented as the main traffic control and signalling systems, similar to those recently installed in Cairo. It allows ENR to control and supervise the railway line between the capital and Alexandria.

Thales has already a good recognition in Egypt and has been working with the Egyptian railways since 2013. Thales has successfully handed over the Cairo-Alexandria line to ENR, including its extension of Cairo-Benha. Additionally, Thales assumes responsibility for the line connecting Cairo to Benha, as well as the section from Asyut to Nagh Hammadi, in Upper Egypt.

In this project, Thales will also be in charge of the line's cybersecurity, ensuring robust protection against potential cyber threats.

Modernisation of the Egyptian National Railways

The contract signed by Thales - in collaboration with the local company Orascom Construction - is part of the Railway Improvement and Safety Project for Egypt (RISE). RISE aims to improve the safety of passengers and employees of the Egyptian national railway company by introducing railway safety and traffic control systems.

Inaugurated in 1854 with a section between Alexandria and the governorate of Kafr el Sheikh, the Egyptian railway network is one of the oldest in the world, second only to the British. In the almost 170 years since then, with more than 8,000 kilometres of track and some 40 million passengers, the railway has become the backbone of the country's citizen transport, carrying almost 314 million passengers a year."
Hitachi Rail Refiles Thales Merger Notification (Updated) - RailwayAge Magazine,"Mon, 18 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJhaWx3YXlhZ2UuY29tL2NzL2hpdGFjaGktcmFpbC1yZWZpbGVzLXRoYWxlcy1tZXJnZXItYXBwbGljYXRpb24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Hitachi Rail on Sept. 18 reported refiling its merger notification with the European Commission, which it said formally restarts the merger clearance process for acquiring Thales’s Ground Transportation Systems (GTS) in the European Union.

Hitachi announced the proposed acquisition in August 2021. It said that the expansion would drive growth in its global railway signaling business, bringing an enhanced turnkey offering to new markets around the world and accelerating development of its Mobility as a Service (MaaS) offering.

Since the announcement, “Hitachi Rail and Thales have been progressing toward completing the €1,660 million deal, securing the regulatory approvals necessary for the transaction to proceed, including achieving merger clearances in 11 of the 13 required jurisdictions,” Hitachi Rail reported.

In November 2022, the company withdrew its EU filing after the Commission raised concerns over the potential impact of the merger on competition for main line signaling projects in France and Germany. According to Hitachi, it has proposed divesting portions of its own signaling business to address the EC’s concerns.

“We are delighted to be in a position to refile for clearance in the EU after working extensively with the Commission on a proposed divestment package, which we are satisfied will address their concerns,” a Hitachi Rail spokesperson said. “We look forward to continuing to progress the acquisition of Thales’s Ground Transportation Systems (GTS), which we believe will deliver value for customers in the rail signaling and mobility sectors in Europe and globally.”

The two groups are “committed to finalizing this transaction in the first half of calendar year 2024,” according to Thales.

Hitachi Rail also reported that it expects to receive a decision on the proposed transaction from the U.K. anti-trust authority, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) “shortly.”

Britain

Britain’s anti-trust authority, the CMA, has made similar observations over the delivery of ETCS for future British mainline signaling projects and initially the supply of CBTC.

Hitachi subsequently proposed a remedy package under which it would it divest all shares of Hitachi Rail STS France and the activities and backlog contracts of Hitachi Rail Deutschland. The package also includes all of Hitachi’s resources and assets relating to ETCS in Britain and the associated backlog of projects.

The proposed remedy did originally include some CBTC assets. However, this was withdrawn after the CMA’s Inquiry Group, which is scrutinising the proposed merger, updated its provisional findings and found that the acquisition would not result in a substantial reduction in competition in the supply of CBTC in Britain.

Britian’s rail regulator, the Office of Rail and Road (ORR), stated last month that the proposed package would satisfy its concerns over future mainline signaling competition in Britain. A Hitachi spokesperson also confirmed that the company is satisfied that the same remedy package will address the EC’s concerns.

The CMA’s final report on the proposed transaction is due by Oct. 6.

Remedy Package

Under the proposal, Hitachi Rail would divest all shares of Hitachi Rail STS France, transferring ownership of the ETCS wayside and digital interlocking platforms as well as its Argos wayside and interlocking platforms. It will also dispose of Hitachi Rail France’s business for ETCS and legacy onboard unit projects along with ownership or access to intellectual property rights. The remedy taker would benefit from the transfer of all existing ETCS ATP wayside, interlocking, ETCS and legacy onboard unit projects, service and maintenance agreements.

In addition, the divestment would include all of Hitachi’s resources and assets relating to digital mainline signaling, or ETCS, in Britain, and the associated backlog of projects. Hitachi proposes carving out this element of its business into a new legal entity that would be transferred to Hitachi Rail France. It will also include the activities and backlog contracts of Hitachi Rail Deutschland, including an office in Munich, which has a test laboratory for factory acceptance tests.

"French-British underwater drone proves de-mining ability, says Thales - Defense News","Wed, 13 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS9pbmR1c3RyeS90ZWNod2F0Y2gvMjAyMy8wOS8xMy9mcmVuY2gtYnJpdGlzaC11bmRlcndhdGVyLWRyb25lLXByb3Zlcy1kZS1taW5pbmctYWJpbGl0eS1zYXlzLXRoYWxlcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"STUTTGART, Germany — Recent sea trials of a remotely operated underwater vehicle proved it is capable of neutralizing naval mines, a new milestone for the Franco-British Maritime Mine Countermeasures program, French firm Thales announced Wednesday.

The program’s prime contractor and lead system integrator successfully demonstrated this final component of its system for the MMCM program, dubbed SLAM-F in France.

The sea trials took place remotely from the company’s command center in Brest, France, alongside representatives of the French Navy, the French defense procurement agency DGA, the British Royal Navy and the U.K. Defence Ministry, as well as the Organisation for Joint Armament Co-operation, according to a Thales news release. OCCAR is an international weapons management group.

The Thales operations center controlled the systems with the support of French Navy personnel.

The trials, which were “recently” held, demonstrated the ability of Thales’ M-Cube mission management system to relocate and identify mines at sea, after which the underwater drone successfully installed exercise charges on a bottom mine and a moored mine; the latter are deployed when the water is too deep for bottom mines.

France and Britain first launched the MMCM program in 2015 with a contract signing between Thales and OCCAR, intending to demonstrate and qualify a novel, fully integrated, unmanned mine countermeasures system of systems. The goal is for MMCM to replace all current mine warfare platforms, including Tripartite-class mine hunters, sonar towing vessels and diver support vessels.

Per the French Armed Forces Ministry, one MMCM system architecture comprises two surface drones — one of which is equipped with a towed sonar and the other with a remotely operated robot — and two underwater drones responsible for detecting, classifying and localizing the mines. The remotely operated robot makes it possible to identify and neutralize mines.

Thales serves as the overall project manager of the system as well as the sonar manufacturer, while ECA Group — which now operates as Exail — developed the underwater drones.

Those drones will be capable of recognizing submerged objects with very high resolution thanks to Thales’ “multi-aspect sonar,” the ministry previously said.

The sonar can take images from three different angles in one pass, allowing the operator to more easily and quickly characterize an object.

The MMCM system will also be able to detect, identify and neutralize mines up to 300 meters (984 feet) deep, compared to 120 meters (394 feet) today, the ministry has said.

The first two prototype MMCM systems were delivered to the French and British navies in 2021 and 2022, according to Thales. The two services will take delivery of the six series-produced systems in 2024 and 2025, for a total of eight systems split between the two nations.

At the 2022 Euronaval conference held outside of Paris, French military officials announced the MMCM program will align itself with a separate Belgian-Dutch de-mining program meant to deliver new mine hunter vessels and unmanned systems, dubbed the Belgian-Dutch Mine Countermeasures system.

DSEI 2023: Thales explores airborne MCM sensor - Naval News,"Fri, 22 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdmFsbmV3cy5jb20vZXZlbnQtbmV3cy9kc2VpLTIwMjMvMjAyMy8wOS9kc2VpLTIwMjMtdGhhbGVzLWV4cGxvcmVzLWFpcmJvcm5lLW1jbS1zZW5zb3Iv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"DSEI 2023: Thales explores airborne MCM sensor Thales UK has revealed that it is self-funding research and development of an electro-optical/infrared airborne mine countermeasures (MCM) sensor payload suitable for operations from light helicopters and uncrewed air vehicles (UAVs).

Leveraging core technology pulled through from the Avni airborne intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) suite previously developed by Thales Optronic Missiles Electronics in Glasgow for counter-insurgency and anti-poaching operations, the system – given the name SWEEPIR 30 – is being designed for the detection of drifting and floating mines. A prototype system is already in test.

Although Thales has already made significant investments in the development of maritime autonomous systems and sensors for MCM, it currently lacks an airborne sensor payload in its product portfolio. To fill this gap, the company is looking to repurpose technology from the Avni ISR product line to develop a wide field-of-view system detect floating and near-surface mine threats.

A SWEEPIR 30 testbed – configured with an array of ten downward-looking uncooled long waveband infrared cameras – is being used to support initial experimentation. Early trials have been flown using a commercial Bell LongRanger helicopter.

Thales is striving to minimise the SWEEPIR 30 form factor, both for the sensor cluster and the backbone processing unit. Early discussions with UAV house Schiebel have given confidence that the system’s space and weight would enable integration with Schiebel’s widely sold Camcopter S-100 UAV.

According to Thales, the final airborne MCM product solution is likely to be multi-spectral, with a combination of electro-optical, infrared and LIDAR sensors. LIDAR would offer a capability to detect mines just below the sea surface.

Thales is continuing self-funded development work, with an aspiration to have a ‘minimum viable product’ ready for market by the end of 2024."
Thales and Intel Collaborate to Enhance Trust in Confidential Computing - Business Wire,"Wed, 20 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc3dpcmUuY29tL25ld3MvaG9tZS8yMDIzMDkyMDkwMDEyMy9lbi9UaGFsZXMtYW5kLUludGVsLUNvbGxhYm9yYXRlLXRvLUVuaGFuY2UtVHJ1c3QtaW4tQ29uZmlkZW50aWFsLUNvbXB1dGluZ9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"MEUDON, France--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Thales, the leading global technology and security provider, today announced a collaboration leveraging Thales CipherTrust Data Security platform to deliver end-to-end data security using confidential computing and trusted attestation backed by Intel® Trust Authority. This collaboration enables customers in highly regulated industries to secure workloads and protect data in use on-premises and in the cloud.

A majority of the 2023 Thales Cloud Security Study respondents reported having a significant amount of sensitive data in the cloud. Consequently, safeguarding sensitive data and associated workloads in the cloud is an increasing priority, especially for compliance and data privacy. Thales' collaboration with Intel combines the industry leading CipherTrust Data Security Platform with the verifiable attestation service from Intel® Trust Authority to protect data in use and workloads while delivering seamless end-to-end data security.

Confidential computing protects data in use by performing computations in a cryptographically isolated hardware-based Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). Often, the cryptographic material verifying the TEE is managed by the cloud provider. Thales' comprehensive data security solution effectively sidesteps this security issue by implementing separation of duties and puts the customer in control of the cryptographic key material. This approach eliminates the need to place complete trust in the cloud provider.

By using trusted attestation from Intel, Thales’ CipherTrust Data Security Platform can ensure sensitive workloads are never decrypted outside of an Intel® TEE, Intel® Trust Domain Extension (TDX) or Intel® Software Guard Extension (SGX).

Todd Moore, Vice President of Data Security Products at Thales: “Thales’ collaboration with Intel enables security conscious organisations to share data safely while preserving privacy, confidentiality, and compliance with regulatory requirements such as GDPR, PCI-DSS and HIPAA, only disclosing the results of the processes performed. This is especially important for highly regulated industries where data security is paramount to safeguarding the privacy of the information.”

Anil Rao, Vice President, Systems Architecture and Engineering and Office of the CTO, Intel: “It is critical that enterprises retain control of their data protection and can confidently retain business agility while meeting compliance requirements. Together, Thales CipherTrust Data Security Platform, Intel Confidential Computing technologies and Intel® Trust Authority provide customers the tools they need to do so. We’re pleased to combine the technology leadership and innovation of Thales and Intel with this solution.”

Hitachi Offers Asset Sale to EU for Thales Acquisition Approval - PYMNTS.com,"Sun, 17 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB5bW50cy5jb20vY3BpLXBvc3RzL2hpdGFjaGlzLWV1LWFwcHJvdmFsLXBsYW4tZm9yLXRoYWxlcy1yYWlsd2F5LXNpZ25hbC1hY3F1aXNpdGlvbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Hitachi has proposed the sale of assets in France and Germany, along with its fundamental train control technology, in an effort to secure approval from the European Union (EU) regarding its 1.7 billion euro ($1.8 billion) acquisition of Thales’ railway signaling business, according to a report from Reuters.

The Japanese conglomerate submitted this proposal to the European Commission on the same day it sought EU clearance for the transaction, as revealed in an EU regulatory filing released on Friday.

These remedies closely resemble those presented to the UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) back in June. They entail the divestment of Hitachi’s mainline signaling operations in the UK, France, and Germany, as well as its core communication-based train control technology, to a competing entity. At the time, Hitachi asserted that this package constituted all the necessary components for a viable, independent business.

The EU’s competition regulatory body, which has set a deadline for its decision on November 6, has not disclosed the specifics of these remedies, consistent with its policy. It is anticipated that the EU authorities will solicit feedback from Hitachi’s customers and competitors before making a final determination on whether to accept the proposed remedies or request additional concessions.

Related: UK Watchdog Says Hitachi-Thales Rail Signal Deal Could Reduce Competition

The fact that Hitachi submitted these remedies simultaneously with its formal application for approval suggests that the company may have received positive signals indicating that these measures could be sufficient to obtain EU clearance.

Notably, Hitachi had previously sought EU approval in October of the previous year but subsequently withdrew its application a month later.

This deal highlights the ongoing consolidation in the rail industry, with smaller, independent players partnering with larger industrial groups.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) had narrowed its concerns about the deal in August, stating that it would not significantly reduce competition in the supply of communication-based train control signaling systems in the UK. A final report from the CMA is expected by October 6. Earlier, the CMA had cautioned that the merger between two prominent providers of signaling systems for both mainline and urban railway networks could potentially raise the costs associated with upgrading the UK’s rail infrastructure.

The CSO Australia event – in association with Thales and Tech Data – provided a terrific opportunity for all attendees to share experiences and insights on important cyber security challenges that organisations are facing today, with a particular focus on how maintaining and enhancing data protection processes can strengthen user privacy.

Moderated by Ed Kennedy, Editor of CSO Australia, the conversation illustrated the importance of ongoing dialogue within the Australian cyber security sector regarding the discovery, classification, and protection of data. Alongside this, other key topics discussed were regarding who should have access and control, compliance requirements, and incident response mechanisms.

For Erick Reyes, Strategic Clients Director for Thales, the dialogue surrounding the dynamics of data and risk was particularly vivid.

“This event highlighted how securing data is critical in mitigating risk and providing control to an organisation’s critical assets.”

“A particularly insightful discussion point surrounded the embedding of data security in our processes, to protect our businesses and customers from the risk of cyber breaches and meet compliance. In turn, another key takeaway from this discussion is that organisations should look to proactively pursue ways to embed cyber and data security in their business processes, and not simply do so as an afterthought”, said Mr Reyes.

“Ultimately, embedding data security in the business process will help organisations meet their regulatory compliance, their data sovereignty requirements, and mitigate the risk of data being exploited during a cyber incident. This will help organisations protect their critical assets, and – as other attendees also mentioned – protect their customers.”

Mr Reyes’ thoughts found much common ground with the post-event reflections of Richard Charlton, Business Development Manager for Tech Data.

“Tech Data was delighted to join the discussion on modern best practices for data protection with these forward-thinking organisations”, said Mr Charlton.

“The future of data security relies on scalable, swift, and data-centric approaches. Businesses must continuously adapt and respond to emerging challenges.”

“Organisations need to integrate security seamlessly into their processes to ensure asset security, compliance, customer protection, and data-driven innovation.”

This roundtable was held amidst a period of time where increasing pressure has been placed upon Australian enterprises surrounding the protection of data they hold.

Within 2022 and 2023, numerous high-profile breaches of leading Australian enterprises have occurred. Such events have led to demands that organisations be held to higher standards, and generate greater in-house awareness and capabilities to anticipate such threats.

These incidents have also driven organisations to review and refine their own cyber security practices, and to reassure their customers that every possible step is being taken to ensure the protection of the data which these entities hold.

Furthermore, the push to change the Privacy Act 1988 by the Australian government in the wake of numerous high-profile breaches to strengthen privacy laws and increase fines for data breaches, has placed additional pressure upon enterprises.

Such matters were discussed in-depth during the roundtable, and remain topics that warrant ongoing conversation in the Australian cyber security community, as noted by numerous attendees during their reflections following the event.

As one attendee shared after the roundtable, “I think an important learning I had from this event is that organisations are now much more aware of the threats occurring, or the possibility of them occurring.”

“Educating internal staff from top to bottom with onboarding and training efforts initially, and ongoing learning and awareness endeavours generally, is vital. I also think the ad-hoc simulation of a threat taking place, and aligning your necessary teams to act on that situation, is an especially good practice and awareness tool.”

“What’s more, setting up frameworks and processes like ISO27001, NIST, and PCI-DSS, are prudent in organisations. Also, instilling the DevSecOps culture and practices is imperative, and knowing where your data sits – and where and what it traverses – is important to understand for any organisation.”

Another attendee shared, “As cyber security leaders, many of us have seen the advent of many new technologies over the years. AI is the latest of these, and it has sparked a great deal of robust debate thanks to pop culture phenomena like the Terminator movies.”

“AI, like other new technologies that have come before it, has the potential to deliver both positive and negative outcomes. By collectively deciding what we want AI to be, we can avoid the mistakes of the past and ensure that we don’t find ourselves expending additional efforts in trying to impose retrospective controls down the track.”

CSO, Thales, and Tech Data, thank all who attended this roundtable."

Britain’s rail regulator, the Office of Rail and Road (ORR), says a remedy package proposed by Hitachi Rail under which it will divest certain business assets would satisfy concerns over future competition in the British main line signaling market following its proposed £1.7bn acquisition of Thales’ Ground Transportation Systems business.

The proposed remedy package comprises the disposal of Hitachi Rail STS France, which includes the manufacturing site in Riom, France, and the core site in Les Ulis, France, which has research and development, engineering and project delivery and design capabilities.

In its response to a notice of possible remedies, Hitachi Rail states that it has serviced its British projects over the past 15 years by leveraging its French operations. Under the proposal, Hitachi Rail would divest all shares of Hitachi Rail STS France, transferring ownership of the ETCS wayside and digital interlocking platforms as well as its Argos wayside and interlocking platforms. It will also dispose of Hitachi Rail France’s business for ETCS and legacy onboard unit projects along with ownership or access to intellectual property rights. The remedy taker would benefit from the transfer of all existing ETCS ATP wayside, interlocking, ETCS and legacy onboard unit projects, service and maintenance agreements.

In addition, the divestment would include all of Hitachi’s resources and assets relating to digital main line signaling, or ETCS, in Britain, and the associated backlog of projects. Hitachi proposes carving out this element of its business into a new legal entity that would be transferred to Hitachi Rail France. It will also include the activities and backlog contracts of Hitachi Rail Deutschland, including an office in Munich, which has a test laboratory for factory acceptance tests with customers.

The ORR notes that the proposed divestment business is a standalone, viable business with an experienced management team, and “in the hands of an appropriate remedy taker would be capable of replicating the competitive constraint of Hitachi Rail in the UK.”

“The remedy taker will be acquiring a business that has been established for more than 100 years in the European signalling market, has more than 500 FTEs with substantial signaling, engineering, and manufacturing experience and capability; and crucially, to the CMA’s provisional theory of harm, a business which has experience of delivering mainline signalling projects for Network Rail,” the ORR says.

The ORR made the observations in a letter to Mr Stuart McIntosh, chair of the Competition and Markets Authority’s (CMA) Inquiry Group, which is investigating the proposed acquisition. The CMA’s provisional assessment announced in June found that the merger as it stands is likely to result in a substantial lessening of competition in the supply of “digital main line signalling” or ETCS.

CBTC

However, the Inquiry Group has now updated its provisional findings regarding the supply of CBTC in the British market, stating on August 23 that the acquisition would not result in a substantial reduction in competition in the supply of CBTC to Britain.

Hitachi welcomed this update, stating that it will continue “to work closely with the CMA to agree the best possible mitigations and appropriate way forward.” It also confirmed that a proposal to include the disposal of its core CBTC v6.6 Orion technology within the divestment package is no longer required.

The CMA’s assessment focused on the upcoming projects to resignal the Piccadilly and Bakerloo lines.

Transport for London (TfL) is the main customer for CBTC in Britain and its current suppliers are Thales and Siemens. Hitachi, which acquired Ansaldo STS in 2015, has not previously supplied signaling for the London Underground (LU).

CMA’s assessment focused on likely competition to re-signal the Bakerloo and Piccadilly lines. It states that the new evidence supports the provisional conclusion that Hitachi would not be a credible competitor to Thales or Siemens in these future tenders, leading to the provisional conclusion that Hitachi is not a credible bidder to supply CBTC to LU in the near or medium term.

The CMA adds that re-signalling of LU lines is regarded as especially complex and challenging compared with other metro systems and that most of Hitachi’s relevant CBTC projects are smaller and less complex than the upcoming Piccadilly and Bakerloo projects.

“Effective competition in the urban and digital main line signaling markets is essential for ensuring the UK’s rail transport systems are efficient and reliable for passengers who rely on these services,” McIntosh says.

“Having reviewed the additional evidence, which indicates that Hitachi is unlikely to be a credible bidder for signalling projects on the LU in the foreseeable future, we have provisionally concluded that the merger would not harm competition in the supply of these systems in the UK.

“That said, our provisional view that this merger raises concerns in the supply of digital main line signaling in Great Britain, is not affected by today’s announcement.”

The CMA is expected to issue its final report on the proposed acquisition by Oct. 6.

Hitachi announced the proposed acquisition in August 2021. It said that the expansion would drive growth in its global railway signaling business, bringing an enhanced turnkey offering to new markets around the world and accelerating development of its Mobility as a Service (MaaS) offer.

Regulatory approvals have been secured in all other relevant jurisdictions apart from the European Union (EU), where Hitachi says it is “making good progress toward securing clearance.”"

Thales press release

The FREMM through-life support contract, which came into effect in January 2023, is one of the largest support contracts awarded to Thales by Naval Group since the creation of the French Navy’s Fleet Support Service (SSF). It will guarantee the at-sea availability of the Navy’s eight multi-mission frigates based in Brest and Toulon. Thales will draw on its industrial resources and product expertise to support the warships, ensure the day-to-day availability of their on-board systems and sustain their operational capabilities over the long term.

The FREMM programme was launched in 2005 and is one of the major components of France’s anti-submarine warfare capability. Equipped with Thales sonars, radars, optronics and communication systems, the frigates are widely acclaimed for their operational range, endurance and high performance: the ships and their crews have been endorsed by the US Navy for their anti-submarine warfare capabilities, winning prestigious Hook’em Awards in 2020, 2021 and 2022.

The intensive deployment of warships and their systems puts added pressure on every component of a naval force. The operational availability of France’s multi-mission frigates is a key factor in maintaining the country’s naval capabilities and ensuring the freedom of action of the French armed forces.

To optimise the use of the French Navy’s resources over the long term, Naval Group and Thales are setting up an integrated centre of expertise drawing on the specialised know-how and capabilities of both companies. To troubleshoot and resolve technical subjects quickly and efficiently, the centre’s dedicated multi-disciplinary team will constantly monitor the technical performance of the Thales equipment and provide a rapid response capability at all times. Thales will ensure proactive component obsolescence management to further enhance the agility of the FREMM technical support teams, analysing system status on a regular basis to identify potential supply chain issues and speed problem resolution by experts from Naval Group and Thales."

Thales press release

During 2023, the LMM system was successfully fired for the first time from a new versatile drone system capable of combat missions over land, sea and air, to bring the potential of unmanned air combat a step closer to reality.

Also, in a separate trial, the Royal Navy, Thales and QinetiQ recently completed a demanding series of firing tests with the Navy’s formidable Wildcat helicopter to test LMM to its maximum capability against a range of threats, including speedboats, jet skis and airborne drones.

Weighing in at only 13Kg with a speed of Mach 1.5, LMM was designed and built in Belfast to be capable of integrated onto a variety of firing platforms, including armoured vehicles, ships, helicopters and shoulder-launched by soldiers.

In a trial sponsored by the Rapid Capabilities Office of the Royal Air Force, the LMM proved its versatility further still when it was fired from a drone for the first time in a joint collaboration with drone experts from Flyby Technology.

Flyby had designed and built a sophisticated drone with Turkish partners called JACKAL, capable of vertical take-off and landing, to carry out battlefield air interdiction, close air support, engaging helicopters in flight and taking out key land targets, to denying the use of runways and roads.

Asked to brief the RAF, the Flyby team also contacted the Thales team in Belfast. Within a demanding six week window, two operational JACKALs were built and LMMs were integrated and successfully fired from the drone in a UK-based trial.

The formidable combination of a JACKAL armed with LMM will be on display on the Thales stand at H6-310.

Meanwhile, in an extensive firing trial in Wales, the Royal Navy’s experts in tactical development put the in-service missile through a series of demanding tests and scenarios to test the limits of its versatility and effectiveness.

Known as Martlet in Royal Navy operational service, the LMM was fitted to a Wildcat helicopter flown by 825 Naval Air Squadron (NAS) with 815 and 744 Squadrons in a trial organised by the Operational Advantage Centre (Maritime Warfare).

The trial – dubbed Triton’s Arrow – tested the Martlet missile and its ability to neutralise small, fast moving craft and drones and was also the squadron’s first ever helicopter air-to-air firings which was against a Banshee aerial drone target.

LMM will be at DSEi alongside the formidable STARStreak high velocity missile, another Belfast designed and manufactured system which is capable of Mach 3 and is the fastest type of missile of its kind in the world.

“Both LMM and STARStreak are operational proven and are proving to be best-in-class which is a testament to the skills we have invested in Northern Ireland. LMM has shown in these recent ground-breaking trials that it can be adapted for emerging platforms and new scenarios and both missiles have the ability to push the boundaries of capability to provide accurate defence against ever-changing threats.”

Philip McBride, Managing Director of Thales in Northern Ireland

DSEi 2023 runs from September 12-15th and is held at the Excel Centre in London. It is a global showcase for innovation and capability for the defence and security industries."
Telesat Q&A | Getting back to Lightspeed - SpaceNews,"Mon, 11 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS90ZWxlc2F0LXFhLWdldHRpbmctYmFjay10by1saWdodHNwZWVkL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Telesat finally has funds for a low Earth orbit (LEO) broadband network after pivoting to smaller but equally capable satellites from MDA following production issues at Thales Alenia Space.

MDA announced a contract Aug. 11 to deliver 198 satellites for Telesat’s Lightspeed constellation for launches starting in mid-2026 — six years later than the Canadian operator had originally planned to expand out of geostationary orbit (GEO).

Telesat had held off picking a manufacturer until 2021 to get a better deal on parts, only for Thales Alenia Space to run into pandemic-related supply chain issues that derailed the project.

MDA’s satellites would be about 75% smaller at 750 kilograms each. Telesat has said the $3.5 billion it has already lined up in equity and Canadian federal and provincial financing is enough for 156 of them, enabling initial polar and global services.

Key to the cheaper satellite design is digital beam-forming array antennas that Telesat had initially deemed too immature for the constellation, which would also at least be partially deployed by Blue Origin and Relativity Space rockets that are still under development.

As OneWeb and SpaceX’s Starlink seek to densify already operational LEO networks, and while Amazon prepares to begin deploying Project Kuiper around the same time as Lightspeed, Telesat CEO Dan Goldberg talks to SpaceNews about the 50-year-old company’s attitude to risk as it races to get its LEO plans back on track.

What are the next steps now you have the funding for a LEO constellation after all these years?

We’re working intensively with MDA to launch the program and finalizing contracts with other vendors. We’ll make additional announcements around launch providers, ground segment providers, and things like that soon.

We’re hiring a ton across the company and now have something much more concrete to speak with the customer community about. So it’s finally all about execution across all those different fronts.

Does the plan call for more prototypes, or will the next launch for Lightspeed be full-scale satellites?

The first launch will be the actual satellites, although maybe we’ll launch just a couple of them and do a bunch of in-orbit testing and whatnot before getting on a very active launch cadence to populate the constellation.

When does MDA expect to kickstart mass production? They plan to be capable of producing two satellites a day, although it’s just one daily in your agreement.

My expectation is mass production will probably be in the middle of the second half of 2025.

You have previously talked about launch agreements with Blue Origin and Relativity Space. Is that still the plan?

We have those arrangements in place, and we’ve got another announcement that’ll be coming as well [Telesat announced a contract with SpaceX Sep. 11 for 14 Falcon 9 launches, enough for deploying the entire constellation].

Rockets from the two you’ve announced [before SpaceX] are still in development. What are you hearing from them and others about whether the launch capacity will be there for Lightspeed?

I’d say Blue Origin is the more meaningful of the two we’ve announced so far, and based on everything we’re seeing from them, I think New Glenn will be totally available for us when we start launching mid-2026.

They have a different approach than some others out there, potentially, just in terms of how they move forward with their development, but they’re good. They’re doing all the right things, have very capable people, are well-financed, and their facilities are very advanced.

To get up to speed, can MDA take advantage of any of the early work Thales might have done while you were waiting to close the financing — where were they with the project?

We had done a lot of work with Thales, and they were trying to build prototypes and things. The reality, though, is not really.

First off, MDA was always building the antenna, even when we were on the Thales path. The antenna they’re going to be building now is a digital beam-forming antenna. The one they were going to build before was analog. In addition to building the antenna, they’re also building the bus and the onboard processor, which will be their own design. So it’s not leveraging anything that Thales did.

There was other work that Thales was doing on the original path, mostly around software development that’s customer-facing and software that relates to the operation of the system. I think we’ll certainly be able to leverage some of those things.

COVID-19 didn’t help supply chains and production, but why was it so difficult to close the financing for the constellation on the Thales path?

You’re right; COVID was a real kick in the teeth. It did two things: It adversely impacted schedule because of all the supply chain issues, and it adversely impacted the cost that we thought we were going to incur on the Thales path, just because of all the inflation that also came in the wake of COVID.

It was less than two years ago that Thales informed us that the schedule and the [$5 billion] program cost that we had been talking about was something they were no longer going to be able to support.

It then took six, seven months just to get an updated proposal. They had to go all the way back out to their supply chain, and it was tricky to get suppliers to hold up their hand and get firm, fixed prices because we were in this inflationary environment. We looked at different funding sources to fill that gap, including talking to some equity investors.

In any event, I think we would have gotten there. We were making progress, but we were also in parallel exploring whether there was a more cost-effective way to move forward with the constellation, which was when we hit upon a really compelling alternative with MDA. That took sometime. We had to get our heads around whether the digital beam-forming antenna was ready for primetime. Telesat is pretty methodical and maybe not the most risk-embracing organization on the face of the Earth.

We started late last year to really start to explore this MDA path, and it was eight months later that we announced something. So, maybe not light speed, but there was a lot of careful engineering work and review that we needed to do.

Pandemics are tricky to predict but would you have done anything differently in hindsight?

I don’t know. It’s always easy to look back and say, maybe we should have pivoted earlier. I’m not somebody who spends any time in my professional or personal life looking back with regrets. I’m just not wired that way.

To be honest with you, I give us reasonably high marks for being resilient, innovative, and open to exploring alternative paths.

We’re big believers in this enterprise, global broadband market that we seek to address with Lightspeed. In the industry, we were reasonably early in believing that LEO is the right solution. We attempted doing it with Thales — we have a high regard for them, and I think they were the right company at the time to partner up with to do it.

For sure, we did not foresee a pandemic. But I also believe that life almost always works out the way it should, and things work out for the best, and I think that’s what happened here. By getting delayed, it allowed this other technology to develop to a point where it was, from our perspective, viable and the right path to get on.

And it’s a much more cost-efficient path. I mean, it’s always the case if you wait, there’s going to be more advanced, more capable, maybe more affordable technology that’s out there to leverage. But we’re saving so much money here, and the business case as a result, is so much more compelling.

Smaller satellites from MDA have shaved $2 billion off what you thought the constellation would cost, but the delay has affected your early LEO start. Is it now going to be harder to compete?

I never thought that we were going to be a first mover. SpaceX and OneWeb were ahead of us. There’s that old line about how you can tell who the pioneers were. They’re the ones with the arrows in their backs.

There are some risks to going first. If we had pulled the trigger and stayed on our original path, we would have come to market two years early or something like that, but in retrospect, with a solution that would have been less cost-efficient.

Some other things have improved. User terminals, in particular flat panel, electronically steered user terminals, which are a key enabler to the [non-geo- stationary satellite] market, are more advanced.

Hats off to SpaceX and how fast they’re moving. They’ve done a great job of demonstrating how transformative LEO satellite constellations can be. We haven’t seen exactly what Amazon’s constellation is capable of, but they’re pulling the curtain back more on it, and it looks like it will also be a really powerful solution.

Both have fundamentally designed their constellations in the first order to serve the consumer market. They’re certainly also focused on the enterprise market, but they are different markets. The government and enterprise markets demand CIRs [committed information rate agreements], service level agreements (SLAs)… I think the customer community appreciates our heritage of being a business-to-business, enterprise-focused service provider.

So we believe there’s going to be a big addressable market for us when we come to market in 2027. We only need a small share of it to be successful in terms of meeting our business plan objectives.

Do I wish I could bring this capability to market next year? Yeah, we’d love that, but I still think we’re going to be very effective and the customer communities will embrace the solutions we’re bringing.

Having an existing GEO fleet was going to be a differentiator. However, OneWeb looks set to merge with Eutelsat around the end of September also to offer multi-orbit services — how has that changed the competitive landscape?

First off, the OneWeb-Eutelsat combination was not a surprise. We’ve both been big proponents of moving to LEO.

I don’t think it changes the competitive landscape so much. Again, I think this is going to be a very big market. We can all be successful, just like we’ve all been successfully serving the GEO market over the last four or five decades.

It’s been a highly competitive market, and the customers have benefited from that. Still, I think all the operators have been able to achieve attractive returns on their investment, create equity value for their shareholders, and do a good job serving the customers.

You also need to get deployment deadline extensions from regulators to keep hold of your priority spectrum licenses. Where are you in that process?

It’s at two levels. There’s the International Telecommunication Union level where we have a number of regulatory filings, and we’ve taken steps to try to preserve rights here. We just launched our LEO-3 satellite, which will support customer demonstrations as a primary mission but will also preserve some of our spectrum rights at the ITU level.

And then there’s the market access that you need from each country that you’re trying to serve. We have authorizations from Canada, the U.S., and some other countries. Certainly, they have milestones associated with them, and we’ve been engaging with regulators to make sure that we can leverage our constellation when it’s available.

I don’t expect anything on the regulatory side, either on the ITU or the more domestic market access level, that will prejudice our ability to meet our business plan.

There will be some countries like there have always been where full, unfettered market access will be difficult. We’ve taken that into account when we put our financial projections together. I think the regulators are delighted to see Lightspeed moving forward. The regulators tend to want more entrants and competition to benefit their domestic users. So I think we will be in really good shape on that.

Telesat is also an operator that’s well known to regulators all over the world. We’ve always done a good job of being a responsible operator of providing mission-critical services in all these different jurisdictions.

MDA’s plans for the constellation hinge on digital beam-forming technology that Telesat previously considered but deemed too immature. What has changed?

The biggest thing has been improvements in semiconductors that will underpin not only this digital beam-former but the onboard processor that’s integrated in.

When we first considered the digital beam-former years ago, the chips were more power-consumptive and generated more heat, leading to thermal issues. The engineers felt it was stressing the spacecraft’s power and thermal budgets.

So we dealt with that by moving to an analog beam-forming antenna, and by having two pairs of those antennas on each satellite, we could meet our coverage and capacity allocation objectives.

What’s changed is now there’s a new generation of chips that generate less heat and consume less power. It means instead of needing two pairs of antennas — two to transmit and another two to receive, we only need one pair and will still have three times as many beams as we did on the older design.

Lightspeed is using a new software-defined, configurable satellite design from MDA, and it’s going to at least be partly deployed using as-yet unproven rockets. It’s a comparatively risky venture for a company that has historically been pretty conservative. Is this just a symptom of all the transformation in the industry?

I don’t think so. I’ll have to challenge your premise a little bit. Maybe it’s why things have taken us longer than they would take a company that is more willing to embrace unproven technologies. We’ve been all over every system, every subsystem, and on the payload on the bus of these new satellites.

Not that it’s risk-free. We’ve never launched a satellite that’s been risk-free, but we think the risk that we’re taking on here is not disproportionate to the risks we’ve taken on some of our other programs.

You really need to get deep in the weeds on the processor, the digital beam-forming antenna, the optical inter-satellite links, and on the different components of the bus. When you break it down like that, and you can break it down much more, we think this is not an extraordinary risk that we’re taking here.

I’d say the same with the launch vehicles. By the time we launch on the New Glenn rocket, it will have flown.

But I would say that if we’re going to be able to effectively meet the requirements of our customers and deliver an advanced, capable broadband experience, you need to go LEO.

It’s very comfortable to stay in GEO, but we don’t believe that we can deliver a modern, high-quality enterprise broadband experience from there.

We think you need to get close to the Earth and have a latency that’s sub 50 milliseconds. That pushes you to LEO and to a more distributed architecture.

It also pushes you toward embracing beam-forming antennas, regenerative process payloads, and optical inter-satellite links so you have a highly capable, flexible, resilient, and efficient space-based network.

We’ve been innovating throughout our 50 years. We started in C-band, went to Ku-band, and then went to Ka-band. I think we were the first to launch a multi-spot beam, Ka-band geostationary satellite.

If we didn’t do this, we think that would be the risky thing for Telesat’s future. We wouldn’t be relevant to the kind of communications infrastructure that our customers are demanding nowadays. You have funding commitments for a 156-satellite constellation, enough for initial polar and global services to generate sufficient revenues to fund another 42 proposed satellites.

How much do you need to generate to fund these extra satellites, and when do you expect to hit that goal?

It’s about $800 million to fund the incremental satellites, launch vehicles, [and] we’d probably roll out some additional ground infrastructure at the same time, too. We’re going into service in 2027, and generating the cash flows we need won’t take long.

It might be the case we secure some incremental funding between now and the time we even launch our first satellite, and we just pull the trigger and go directly to the 198.

How would 198 satellites improve services versus 156?

The initial 156 will give us a hugely capable, multi-terabit constellation, but getting up to 198 will give us some incremental capacity and densify the network.

How has the split between the company’s broadcast and connectivity revenues changed over the years, and how do you see that evolving as Lightspeed comes online?

Right now, about 50% of the revenues are from our principally DTH video business — that’s really mostly [from customers in] Canada and then Dish Network in the U.S.

The other 50% are what we call enterprise services, but that’s really broadband connectivity for rural broadband, aero and maritime services, for the energy market, government customers, and those kinds of things.

When I first came to Telesat [in 2006] we were probably two-thirds video and one-third broadband.

Our DTH revenues were growing really quickly back about 12-15 years ago. Not only has that leveled off, but we’ve seen declines there as we’ve gotten renewals for some of our DTH satellite contracts at less capacity or lower rates.

The video business is facing some decline because of cord-cutting, whereas the broadband business has been growing because people just want more broadband, and they want it everywhere.

Certainly, with Lightspeed we think that trend will accelerate. Lightspeed is all about broadband connectivity. Some will be for video streaming, but it’ll be just a big broadband pipe.

The rapidly transforming defence and security landscape underscores the need for industry collaboration, state-of-the-art strategies, and technological prowess. At DSEI 2023, Thales’ involvement goes beyond our exhibition stand. We're fully engaged in fostering pivotal conversations that propel us forward in the defence and security sector.

DSEI – the world's premier defence and security event – provides an unparalleled platform for networking, insights, and innovation. At Thales, we recognise the magnitude of such events not just for showcasing our latest solutions but more so for actively engaging with stakeholders, understanding shared challenges, and navigating the roadmap for the future.

Our active role in several strategic forums underpins our participation in DSEI 2023.

Firstly, the SME & Prime partnerships: export & collaboration in practice forum, which took place on 12 Sep 2023, saw our International Business Area Director, Martin Murphy, sharing the stage with other industry leaders. The core objective was to shed light on the boon of exports for UK regions and SMEs, emphasising the immense potential of collaborative partnerships.

Secondly, our deep dive into the discussion around industry and MOD collaboration for a data-driven future is a testament to our forward-thinking approach. Scheduled for 14 Sep 2023, from 14:30 - 15:20 at the Naval Forum, this session promises insightful discussions led by Thales’ Ryan England, Head of Services Transformation. The panel will include a notable line-up, including RAdm Andy Kyte from Strategic Command, Graeme Little OBE from the Royal Navy, David Buxton, CEO of DecisionLab, and Darin Tudor from Team Defence Information.

The timing couldn't be more pertinent, as the dialogue unfolds just a day after the launch of the UK Naval Enterprise Support Strategy. The central question? How to actualise pan-defence collaboration to robustly back the Royal Navy. As a bonus, the panel will delve into a quick-fire round discussing disruptive technologies poised to revolutionise the defence support landscape, from additive manufacturing and digital twins to maritime autonomy, artificial intelligence, and virtual reality.

Lastly, Thales in the UK's Managing Director, Chris Edwards, will chair the session on Enabling the Integrated Operating Concept on 14 Sep 2023, from 16:00 – 16:50. A panel brimming with big names, including our Defence Adviser, General (Retd.) Bernard Barrera, will explore how data technology and connectivity can arm the integrated force to operate across a renewed operational spectrum.

Grasping the complexities of enhancing defence capabilities, coupled with ensuring sustainable long-term support, is crucial in today's landscape. Given the emerging role of agility, big data, and innovative technologies, the pressing question arises: How can the Defence sector and the Royal Navy strategically align themselves for the future?

By engaging actively in these discussions, Thales demonstrates its commitment to not only keeping pace with the evolving defence environment but also being a strategic thought leader in its transformation.

DSEI 2023 is more than just an event for Thales – it's an opportunity. An opportunity to engage, innovate, and collaborate for a secure, technologically advanced future. Such strategic dialogues not only keep us at the forefront of industry trends but also pave the way for a safer, more secure world.

Hitachi refiles notice of Thales merger with EU - Railway Technology,"Wed, 20 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJhaWx3YXktdGVjaG5vbG9neS5jb20vbmV3cy9oaXRhY2hpLXJlZmlsZXMtdGhhbGVzLW1lcmdlci1ldS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Hitachi withdrew its initial merger notice after criticism from the European Commission. Credit: Thales Ground Transportation Systems.

Hitachi Rail is hoping to finally receive clearance for its merger with Thales GTS after refiling a notification with the European Commission.

The rail manufacturer’s €1.66bn ($1.78bn) acquisition of Thales’ Ground Transportation Systems unit was first announced in 2021 but has faced a number of concerns regarding its effect on the signalling market in Europe, leading Hitachi to withdraw its original filing and refile with a proposal to divest some of its signalling business.

A spokesperson for Hitachi said: “We are delighted to be in a position to refile for clearance in the EU after working extensively with the Commission on a proposed divestment package that we are satisfied will address their concerns.

“We look forward to continuing to progress the acquisition of Thales’s Ground Transportation Systems, which we believe will deliver value for customers in the rail signalling and mobility sectors in Europe and globally.”

Since the initial merger proposal in August 2021, Hitachi says it has secured the regulatory merger clearances needed in 11 of the 13 required jurisdictions and worked with the EU on its new deal.

One of the holdouts that Hitachi is hoping to receive approval from soon is the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), which has previously said that it thought the merger could reduce the options in the digital signalling market in the country, especially as Network Rail and Transport for London work on a number of large digital signalling projects.

During remote sea trials conducted from the command centre in Brest, France, Thales demonstrated the last component of its mine countermeasures system – the remotely operated underwater vehicle. This vehicle showcased its ability to neutralise sea mines, marking an advancement in autonomous technologies, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and uncrewed systems.

The MMCM programme, aligned with the French Navy and the Royal Navy’s operational needs, delivered two prototype systems after at-sea qualification in conditions up to sea state 41. Since the end of 2021, both navies have been evaluating operational aspects and will soon take delivery of six series-produced systems between 2024 and 2025.

These sea trials, conducted with representatives from the French Navy, the French defence procurement agency, the Royal Navy, the UK Ministry of Defense, and OCCAr, demonstrated the system’s ability to locate and identify sea mines. Furthermore, the remotely operated underwater vehicle deployed exercise charges on both bottom and moored mines, completing the neutralisation process.

Real-world testing

All these demonstrations occurred under realistic sea conditions, with Thales’s operations centre in Brest orchestrating remote control and portable operation centre functions, supported by personnel from the Marine Nationale.

This development introduces a paradigm shift in mine countermeasures operations, ensuring naval personnel remain outside the mine danger area. Advanced systems, backed by AI algorithms, enable real-time and post-mission sonar data analysis.

The integration of the first series-produced subsystems into the overall system of systems has commenced at the Brest site. These subsystems include uncrewed surface vehicles equipped with either the TSAM towed array sonar or the remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV) for mine identification and neutralisation.

Operators in the Portable Operation Centre (POC) or the Shore Operation Centre (SOC) carry out mission preparation, monitoring, control, and evaluation.

Gwendoline Blandin-Roger, Vice President of underwater Systems at Thales, expressed her commitment to this programme since its inception in 2015, stating, “Our teams and partners have been investing their skills, energy, and passion to ensure that Thales can step up to the technological challenges of this extraordinary program.

We are fully committed to providing the French Navy and the Royal Navy with the most innovative technologies in order to protect their strategic assets and keep naval personnel out of harm’s way. These latest milestones offer further proof of our unflagging determination to meet these goals.”

Artemis is based on medium-wave staring focal plane arrays and uses multiple static sensor heads rather than mechanical scanning. Herakles has a range of 250km against air targets and 80km against surface targets.

The upgradeable high-performance combat system by Naval Group and Thales is based on a high-speed data network. The combat system architecture enables the French Navy to integrate future weapon systems into the frigates.

Ensuring continued use of the systems

The intensive deployment of warships and their systems puts added pressure on every component of a naval force. The operational availability of France’s FREMM vessels is a key factor in maintaining the country’s naval capabilities.

Naval Group and Thales are also setting up an integrated centre of expertise drawing on the specialised know-how and capabilities of both companies. To troubleshoot and resolve technical subjects quickly and efficiently, the centre’s dedicated multi-disciplinary team will constantly monitor the technical performance of the Thales equipment and provide a rapid response capability at all times.

Thales will ensure proactive component obsolescence management to further enhance the agility of the FREMM technical support teams, analysing system status on a regular basis to identify potential supply chain issues and speed problem resolution by experts from Naval Group and Thales.

This surety builds on Thales’ expanding responsibility for the Italian Navy too. At Italy’s La Speiza naval base on the Ligurian Sea, the navy has established an “integrated services centre” for Thales to manufacture sonar technologies for submarines. This centre will provide maintenance of sonars installed on minesweepers and FREMM frigates – which the Italian Navy also use."

Yonhap



The French defense company Thales Group hopes to deepen cooperation with Korean partners in the fields of cybersecurity and space technologies, taking the decadeslong partnership to another level beyond the defense and other conventional sectors, its senior executive has said.



Pascale Sourisse, senior executive vice president for international development, said Korea's advancement and ambitions in digital technologies and mobile communications, make the country a ""very important"" partner and customer for Thales.



""Thales has three big branches: defense, digital identity and security, and aerospace. In all of these branches, we are having a lot of activities with Korean customers and partners,"" Sourisse said in an interview with Yonhap News Agency on Wednesday.



""It was important for me to visit Korea again, after the pandemic, because Korea is definitely a very important country for Thales,"" she said.



Dating back nearly 40 years, Thales has established an extensive presence in Korea as a major provider of equipment and technology solutions for military programs and space satellite communications.



Thales is a longtime supplier of radars, sonars and fire control systems to the Korean Navy, including the Goalkeeper close-in weapons system and the Flash dipping sonar that detects underwater targets in antisubmarine warfare.



Thales' space venture, Thales Alenia Space, has delivered communication satellites to local satellite operator KT Sat and is in the process of building the fifth one, the Koreasat 6A.



For Earth observation, Thales is working in partnership with the Korea Aerospace Industries and Hanwha Systems Co. to deliver a constellation of four high-resolution observation military radar satellites, known as the 425 project.



The majority of Korean Air's aircraft are equipped with Thales in-flight entertainment solutions.





Pascale Sourisse, senior executive vice president of Thales Group, speaks during an interview with Yonhap News Agency in Seoul, Sept. 6. Yonhap



In 2000, Thales and Samsung formed the defense joint venture, Samsung Thales Corp., now renamed Hanwha Systems. It was transferred to Hanwha Group in the 2015 ""big deal"" in which Samsung sold its petrochemical and defense businesses to Hanwha. In 2016, Thales sold its 50 percent stake to Hanwha.



During the two-day trip to Seoul this week, Sourisse said she had a string of meetings with officials from Samsung, Hanwha, LIG Nex 1 and KT Sat to discuss ongoing and potential future projects.



""We reviewed with each partner and customer the progress made in various initiatives,"" Sourisse said, without elaborating further.



""The same desire, to have a strong link, to know each other very closely so that we can have a strong relationship based on trust, in this regard, this visit has been extremely positive,"" she said.



Sourisse highlighted that Thales' push for cybersecurity offers a huge potential for an expansion of cooperation with Korea, an industry leader in mobility connectivity.



In 2019, Thales acquired Gemalto, a Netherlands-based international security company, for 4.8 billion euros ($5.1 billion), and combined it with existing digital assets under the new division of Digital Identity and Security. Most recently, Thales announced in July it would buy the U.S. cybersecurity company Imperva in a deal worth $3.6 billion.



Thales is already engaged in active cooperation with Samsung Electronics Samsung Galaxy phones are protected by its embedded secured elements, an autonomous, tamper-proof chip designed to limit access of stored information to only authorized people.



With the expansion of space telecommunication and navigation services, the importance of cybersecurity will continue to grow rapidly, and things are ""evolving extremely quickly,"" Sourisse said, adding that Thales is in the ""right position"" to support Korea in this domain.



""We see numerous opportunities to work together and expand not just in the domestic market but in the wider export market too,"" she said.

Building on existing capability demonstrator projects, and a significant science and technology (S&T) investment over the past decade, the Transition Phase roadmap envisages the fielding of both Laser DEW (LDEW) and Radio Frequency DEW (RFDEW) systems for air defence and counter-unmanned air system (C-UAS) use cases. Planning is already in hand for a possible LDEW fit on the Royal Navy’s (RN’s) new Type 26 frigates.

The MoD in 2019 established a programme to accelerate and exploit DEW capability on the front line as a complement to more conventional kinetic self-defences. A three-year analysis and maturation programme – known as the DEW Concept Phase – is due to complete at the end of the current financial year.

As part of the Concept Phase work, an industry team led by Thales was in 2021 contracted to deliver a maritime LDEW capability demonstrator under Project Tracey. Thales UK’s Belfast site is leading an industry team also including BAE Systems (combat system integration), Chess Dynamics (responsible for a custom-built ultra-high accuracy positioner that will steer and point the laser and an electro-optical targeting pod), Vision4CE (advanced tracking and image processing techniques) and IPG (fibre laser).

The maritime LDEW capability demonstrator system is planned to commence user experimentation trials in 2024. According to the MoD, these will focus on providing user experience and are designed to allow the RN to de-risk operation of high energy lasers in realistic environments.

Under separate S&T funding, a consortium led by MBDA has developed and tested the UK DragonFire LDEW demonstrator in conjunction with the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl). The DragonFire testbed has to date completed two trials campaigns, and is being prepared for new tests scheduled to start later this year.

The MoD earlier this month laid out plans for a DEW Transition Phase – funded for at least three years from financial year 2024-2025 – which will mature projects according to three key focus areas: LDEW in a ground-based air defence application; RFDEW in a C-UAS application on land; and LDEW in a maritime air defence application. The work is to be led by the DEW team within the MoD’s Defence Equipment and Support organisation.

One strand that this activity will feed into is Project MIMAS. Naval News understands that this initiative is looking at the retrofit of a 150 kW-class LDEW weapon into the Type 26 frigates from the early 2030s onwards.

Experience from Project MIMAS will inform and de-risk how LDEW effectors could figure in the RN’s projected Future Air Dominance System (FADS), currently planned to enter service around 2035. It is anticipated that LDEW systems would initially be used for C-UAS and short-range anti-air defence as part of the FADS ‘system of systems’; beyond this, there is a possibility that the further maturation of technology could in due course see LDEW systems used for longer range engagements."
"Air Canada taps Intelsat for 2Ku connectivity on MAXs, ESA on RJs - Runway Girl Network","Wed, 06 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMjMvMDkvYWlyLWNhbmFkYS10YXBzLWludGVsc2F0LWZvci0ya3UtY29ubmVjdGl2aXR5LW9uLW1heHMtZXNhLW9uLXJqcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Air Canada has contracted its stalwart inflight connectivity provider, Intelsat, to provide satellite-based onboard Internet for a further 95 aircraft in its fleet.

The carrier currently offers Intelsat inflight Internet on 240 aircraft spanning Air Canada, Rouge and Air Canada Express. Under a follow-on deal announced on 5 September, Air Canada said it will bring Intelsat’s 2Ku solution to its 40 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft and upgrade a total 55 regional jets with the firm’s new multi-orbit electronically steered antenna (ESA). The RJs, a mixture of ERJ175 and CRJ900 regional jets, are currently fitted with Intelsat’s (formerly Gogo’s) air-to-ground IFC solution.

Air Canada’s decision to adopt 2Ku for the MAX twinjets means that a Thales IFC solution — fitted to some of the birds, though not activated — will be replaced. Asked by RGN about the driver behind its decision to switch from Thales to Intelsat for IFC on the MAXs, an Air Canada spokesperson said Air Canada and Thales are focusing on “Thales’ great IFE offering on the MAX”.

It is not immediately clear if the MAX aircraft will need to be brought back to original spec or if parts of the current package, including the adapter plate, will be retained.

Thales Inflyt Experience CEO TK Kallenbach said: “We have no comments on Air Canada’s connectivity approach or digital strategy.”

The news that onboard Internet is coming to the MAXs will be welcomed by Air Canada’s passengers. Some of the MAXs are flying key routes including linking tech-heavy San Francisco with Vancouver, and San Diego-Toronto for instance. And passengers have long complained about the lack of Wi-Fi activation. As such, Air Canada is incentivized to support a fairly rapid equipage program for its -8 and -9 MAXs, one that might not necessarily be tied to C & D checks.

Intelsat senior vice president commercial Dave Bijur told Runway Girl Network that the first MAX installation is starting this week. Air Canada’s spokesperson noted that the carrier is “prioritizing MAX with a forecasted completion date of 2025”.

“The efforts and the commitment of Intelsat’s team and their service partners made the difference for us. We’re confident Intelsat provides proven technology, an extensible platform and network, and the right vision for the future of in-flight connectivity,” Air Canada executive vice president, marketing and digital Mark Nasr said in a statement.

Bijur added: “Intelsat has been delivering reliable inflight connectivity to Air Canada and its passengers for 14 years. Air Canada’s leadership will continue for decades to come thanks to this investment in 2Ku connectivity for the 737 MAX fleet and the decision to install Intelsat’s innovative multi-orbit service across their regional jet operation.”

The multi-orbit ESA solution being brought to Air Canada’s regional jets can talk to Intelsat GEO satellites and OneWeb’s Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites, as Intelsat is a distribution partner for OneWeb in the aero market and its ESA hardware has been approved by OneWeb. The terminal, which has already been selected by Alaska Airlines for its E175s, is based on Stellar Blu Solutions’ design and integration, plus Ball Aerospace’s modular scalable subarrays.

Supplemental type certifications for the requisite aircraft types are expected next year, with equipage beginning at that time. The RJ installs are expected to be completed in 2026.

Air Canada offers free inflight texting, as sponsored by its telco partner Bell. Wi-Fi passes start from $6.50.

'I went from an NHS call centre to Thales cyber director' - SC Media UK,"Wed, 13 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWdodC5zY21hZ2F6aW5ldWsuY29tL2ktd2VudC1mcm9tLWFuLW5ocy1jYWxsLWNlbnRyZS10by10aGFsZXMtY3liZXItZGlyZWN0b3LSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Kirsty Perrett never dreamed she’d end up in cybersecurity – or that she could make it in the industry. In her own words, she reveals her inspirational journey to the top...





Men still outnumber women by three to one in the cybersecurity industry. This is why it’s vital to take stock and showcase the accomplishments of women within the sector. While there has been great progress in establishing greater gender-balance across the industry, there is still much more to be done.

Kirsty Perrett, lead cyber engineer at defence and engineering firm Thales is a role model for women. Not only is she helping to diversify the cyber workforce, but she entered the industry unconventionally, having previously worked for the NHS.

In a nod to International Women in Cyber Day, SC Media asked Kirsty about her cyber journey and what she believes needs to change within the industry.

Kirsty, what did your pathway into cybersecurity look like?

I didn’t have a typical route into cybersecurity. I liked biology at school, so intended to study Biomedical Science – I dropped out after day one. I immediately knew it wasn’t for me.

You don’t necessarily need a degree to do well, and it doesn’t make you an expert – there’s a lot to be said for hands-on experience that you glean throughout the years. Most of my friends don’t work in the field that they hold a degree in.

When I was at school would I have wanted to study cyber? No. I thought it was too clever for me. I assumed you’d have to be good at maths – and that wasn’t me. But I’ve always been fascinated by computers, and I got to experience the impact of computing from the ground up during my career in the NHS.

Why is diversity so important?

Cyber impacts every single aspect of our lives. We need to raise awareness of that, and encourage people from all walks of life into the profession.

Throughout my career progression in the NHS, I got to see the real-world impact that technology and cybersecurity can have on our world. WannaCry was a prime example of that. That was my first experience of seeing just how cyber can impact critical infrastructure. I also got to witness just how much difference a good team can make in those scenarios.

Cyber is everywhere. It impacts us all, and as such there’s a variety of career paths you could get into – and that requires a diversity of talent.

How do we get more women into cyber?

The industry is very male-dominated… we still need to see a shift in attitudes. If you ever feel like you are a ‘tick’ box – just know that you are there because of your own skills and merit.

It’s easy to see how women can develop imposter syndrome in these scenarios. We need to stop gender classifying certain job roles or sectors.

I believe we need to bring a spark to STEM education. In school you’re not necessarily given the best foundation for the working world or taught real-life applications. You're taught a subject to pass an exam in that subject. It can all feel very much like a ‘tick box’ at times.

I love working with schools to bring cyber to life. It’s been a great experience to work with school children and actually translate that learning into something real and tangible. Raising future talent requires a collaborative approach from education, industry and government. It needs to be a joined-up approach.

What advice do you have for women looking to get into the industry?

To any women or girls who are passionate about a career in this sector – let that passion shine through and pursue it. Invest in yourself and seek out any training opportunities that you can. There’s also a large community of women in cyber groups where you can join, network and ask questions.

The integrated system employs the M-Cube mission management system to coordinate and control multiple uncrewed surface and underwater vehicles, all equipped with sonar technology. This initiative is aimed at offering both the UK Royal Navy and the French Navy a more automated approach to mine countermeasures.

The sea tests, observed by representatives from the French Navy, the UK Ministry of Defence, and OCCAr, showcased the system's capability to locate and identify sea mines. Additionally, the remotely operated underwater vehicle demonstrated its ability to attach exercise charges to mines, ensuring their neutralization.

The MMCM project utilizes recent advancements in artificial intelligence, autonomous technology, cybersecurity, and uncrewed systems, all designed to meet the specific requirements set out by the respective naval forces.

Post rigorous at-sea assessments, the first two prototype MMCM systems have been under operational examination by the Navies since the end of 2021. The planned rollout of the six further developed systems is scheduled for 2024 and 2025.

Having taken the lead in the system integration for the MMCM project, Thales has continued its work in the field of drone-based mine countermeasures.

The recent tests underline Thales's capacity to integrate various sub-systems into its M-Cube. This development aims to provide safer operations by keeping naval personnel away from potential mine threats. Utilizing AI-driven systems ensures the detection and neutralization of hidden mine threats with a high degree of accuracy.

The integration of the primary components, part of the broader system, has commenced in Brest. These components are expected to be delivered to the Navies by early 2024."

EUROPE: Hitachi Rail has refiled its merger notification with the European Commission, formally restarting the clearance process for its proposed acquisition of Thales’s Ground Transportation Systems business in the EU.

Regulatory approvals have been obtained in 11 of the 13 required jurisdictions since the planned €1·66bn acquisition was announced in August 2021.

In November 2022 Hitachi Rail withdrew its EU filing after the European Commission raised concerns over the potential impact of the merger on competition for main line signalling schemes in France and Germany. Hitachi has now proposed to divest portions of its own signalling business to address the Commission’s concerns.

On September 19, Thales said that following ‘constructive informal discussions’ with the EU’s Directorate-General for Competition, the two companies were ’committed to finalising this transaction in the first half of calendar year 2024’.

Hitachi also said it expects to receive a decision on the proposed transaction from the UK’s Competition & Markets Authority ‘shortly’."
Thales in the UK Shortlisted for Three DataIQ Awards - Thales,"Fri, 22 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi9jb3VudHJpZXMtZXVyb3BlL3VuaXRlZC1raW5nZG9tL25ld3MvdGhhbGVzLXVrLXNob3J0bGlzdGVkLXRocmVlLWRhdGFpcS1hd2FyZHPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales in the UK Shortlisted for Three DataIQ Awards Share this article



LinkedIn

As a company that harnesses the power of data and analytics to improve our own and our customers’ performance, we’re thrilled to be shortlisted in three different categories for the 2023 DataIQ Awards. This prestigious event, considered the flagship award ceremony in the data and analytics community, honours both companies and individuals that have demonstrated excellence in data over the past 12 months.

Key to its flagship status is the strength of the judging panel, which is made up of data leaders from internationally recognised brands. All are renowned for their outstanding achievements in previous DataIQ Awards, or for making the DataIQ 100 – a power-list of the 100 most influential data and analytics practitioners.

So while winning is a significant accolade, being shortlisted is considered a notable achievement. And this year, Thales in the UK was shortlisted in no fewer than three categories.

1. Transformation With Data

Back in 2020, Thales in the UK relied entirely on manual reporting using legacy Enterprise tools and Excel. But because manipulating and analysing data manually took so long, it quickly went out of date. In fact, our research showed employees across our nine businesses wasted over 870,000 hours a year finding, combining, and analysing data to make simple decisions.

Fast forward to 2023, and Our digital Operations team, along with other key stakeholders, is transforming the business through data. How? By working closely with nine different UK business lines to capture and centralise source data, before putting it directly into users’ hands in a way that simplifies tasks and decision-making. The results? So far, we’ve have made significant productivity gains and improved the employee experience by freeing up time for higher value tasks and personal and professional development.

2. Most Effective Stakeholder Engagement

To achieve the above data transformation quickly and effectively required extremely close collaboration and engagement with numerous stakeholders, including Executives across business and corporate roles, Heads of Functions, and over 7,000 UK employees across 21 job functions. But this task was made more complex, as each business serves different markets and operates in different ways.

Our approach was to establish a collaborative framework that enabled our Digital Operations team members to work alongside key business stakeholders and data users and set project

priorities. To capture requirements and feedback effectively and to ensure data products would be useful to colleagues across the organisation, we established User Groups, made up of people who understood the business worked.

We also set up Focus Groups, made up of senior leaders, to agree and prioritise roadmaps, understand how they supported their overall transformation plans, and develop actions to push organisational change. It’s through this kind of focused stakeholder engagement that the business was able to, for example, cut one product development cycle from nine months to 2 - 4 weeks.

3. Most Innovative Use of AI

Typically, creating a flight dynamics model of an aircraft you can use in a flight simulator, digital twin, system test and evaluation, or autopilot, requires a highly specialist team of domain experts in aerodynamics, physics and aircraft systems. The process of building these models is lengthy and expensive and needs the right experts available. Plus, generated models often don’t factor in, for example, manufacturing, performance or calibration differences – even between aircraft in the same fleet.

Thales in the UK’s solution was to develop a more automated two-stage process, which used Artificial Intelligence to input historical flight data from an aircraft and output a machine learned, high-fidelity verified aircraft model, along with learned autopilot behaviour. All created at a fraction of the time and cost, to a higher fidelity, and without needing the full involvement of the highly specialist team.

Our innovative AI technology is already transforming capabilities across the business, including in our flight simulation models for crewed and uncrewed aircraft, surface, and submersible systems. It’s also being used to detect anomalies and faults between a digital twin and a physical platform. Ultimately, this innovative and transformative AI technology decreases time and cost, while increasing accessibility and performance and creating opportunities to introduce new cost-effective services for our customers.

Showing the way forward

Being shortlisted for these three awards underpins our investment in our own digital transformation journey and business operations. It also illustrates how we’re exploiting the power and potential of data and analytics to innovate, create value for our customers, and build digital thinking into product and service design.

The DataIQ Awards take place on 27th September at the Roundhouse in London. You can find more details about the event here.

Meanwhile, good luck to those attending from Thales in the UK!"

This fleet, comprising approximately 100 vessels from 24 distinct classes, includes notable ships like the Kingston-class Maritime Coastal Defence Vessels and Orca-class training vessels, among others.

The contract, valued at $450 million CAD (around 305m€), underscores Thales' pivotal role in Canada's National Shipbuilding Strategy. This partnership builds on Thales' nearly six-decade legacy of providing ISS in Canada.

The announcement comes on the heels of Canadian Prime Minister, The Right Honourable Justin Trudeau's statement during the NATO Summit in Latvia, confirming the joint venture between Thales Canada and Thales Australia for the MWAV ISS contract.

This collaboration aims to ensure the RCN fleet's operational readiness, offering the adaptability to modify the number of vessels serviced based on the RCN's evolving operational requirements.

This includes supporting significant missions like Operation REASSURANCE, Canada's primary NATO assurance initiative in Central and Eastern Europe. The contract encompasses an initial five-year service period, with potential extensions of up to nineteen years.

Kingston class Coastal Defence vessels

The Kingston class vessels, operated by the Royal Canadian Navy, are a set of 12 coastal defence ships representing the Maritime Coastal Defence Vessel Project (MCDV).

Launched in the 1990s, they are crewed by both Naval Reserve and Regular Force personnel. Their roles range from training reservists to minesweeping, coastal patrolling, and search and rescue operations.

Stationed on Canada's east and west coasts, they've also been deployed internationally. These vessels, with a displacement of 970 tons and a speed of 15 knots, are equipped with advanced sensors and armaments, including the capability to carry the AeroVironment RQ-20 Puma UAS."
Capability Insertion Package for Sonar 2087 - Naval News,"Fri, 15 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdmFsbmV3cy5jb20vZXZlbnQtbmV3cy9kc2VpLTIwMjMvMjAyMy8wOS9jYXBhYmlsaXR5LWluc2VydGlvbi1wYWNrYWdlLWZvci1zb25hci0yMDg3L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Capability Insertion Package for Sonar 2087 The Royal Navy (RN) is starting to roll out a series of enhancements to the Thales Sonar 2087 low frequency active/passive variable depth sonar equipping its eight anti-submarine warfare (ASW)-optimised Type 23 frigates.

The phased upgrade – known as the Sonar 2087 Capability Insertion Project (CIP) – forms part of the RN’s wider ASW Spearhead programme. ASW Spearhead is a rapid capability delivery initiative to enable new software-based functionalities to transition to the frontline much faster than traditional processes allow.

Sonar 2087 system combines a low frequency active variable depth sonar (common to the proprietary Thales CAPTAS-4 low frequency active/passive sonar) with a very low frequency passive towed array and a UK-developed software suite. Achieving initial operating capability in late 2007, Sonar 2087 remains the surface fleet’s principal long range ASW sensor and is being carried forward into the RN’s new Type 26 frigates.

As the principal sensor deployed from the RN’s specialist ASW ships, 2087 is required to provide a persistent capability to deter, deny, find and fix against a broad range of nuclear-powered and conventional submarines, and uncrewed underwater vehicles. As well as providing persistent operational advantage in the North Atlantic against peer/near-peer threats, it is also required to deliver persistent ASW sensing in support of the UK’s Maritime Task Group.

The aim of the Sonar 2087 CIP is to support and facilitate rapid incorporation of new technologies and capability enabled by open architecture. Thales was awarded a £110 million Sonar 2087 Design Authority Capability Insertion Project (S2087 DA-CIP) contract in September last year under which the company is taking responsibility for procurement and installation of capability into Sonar 2087. The base contract lasts 42 months, with an option for one further year.

As part of its Sonar 2087 DA-CIP role, Thales is undertaking evaluations of candidate solutions from multiple suppliers addressing software-based enhancements addressing a number of areas. These include improved detection and tracking, enhancements to the operator human-computer interface, and new decision aids and training tools.

A first sea trial was conducted in January 2023 in support of the CIP programme. The intention is that enhancements will be installed as part of routine ship maintenance/upkeep periods."

A pioneering response to this enduring threat emerges as Thales, a French defense company, unveils an unprecedented solution to tackle the challenge head-on.

Thales introduces an autonomous boat, remotely guided by land-based operators, equipped with an Underwater Autonomous System (UAS) – a cutting-edge drone engineered to autonomously detect and neutralize submerged mines. By harnessing advanced multi-aspect sonar and artificial intelligence, the UAS identifies potential threats beneath the surface. The remote operator then confirms and safely neutralizes the mine, without human intervention in treacherous waters. The drone’s ingenious approach involves attaching a charge to the mine, accompanied by a surface tag warning, ensuring nearby vessels are alerted before detonation. This innovative technology has garnered contracts from the UK and France, with each system encompassing the drone, unmanned vessel, and sophisticated control systems, all deployable within an astonishing 24 hours.

Thales’ revolutionary solution marks a transformative stride in maritime security, enhancing the ability to counteract sea mines and safeguard crucial marine assets. As global security challenges persist, Thales’ autonomous system emerges as a beacon of hope, exemplifying the remarkable synergy of technology and safety in the realm of underwater threats."
Hitachi refiles Thales merger clearance in the EU - International Railway Journal,"Tue, 19 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJhaWxqb3VybmFsLmNvbS9maW5hbmNpYWwvaGl0YWNoaS1yZWZpbGVzLXRoYWxlcy1tZXJnZXItY2xlYXJhbmNlLWluLXRoZS1ldS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"HITACHI Rail confirmed on September 19 that it has refiled its merger notification with the European Commission (EC) and formally restarted the merger clearance process in the European Union (EU) as it finally closes in on completing the £1.7bn acquisition of Thales’ Ground Transportation Systems business.

Hitachi has secured merger clearance in 11 of the 13 required jurisdictions but has faced scrutiny over the impact of the transaction on competition in signalling markets in Britain and the EU.

Hitachi withdrew its initial filing with the EU in November 2022 after the EC raised concerns about the potential effect on the mainline signalling market in France and Germany. However, following “constructive informal discussions” with the Directorate-General for Competition at the EC, Hitachi has now refiled its notification of the transaction.

Thales says that the two companies are committed to finalising the transaction in the first half of 2024.

Britain

Britain’s anti-trust authority, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), has made similar observations over the delivery of ETCS for future British mainline signalling projects and initially the supply of CBTC.

Hitachi subsequently proposed a remedy package under which it would it divest all shares of Hitachi Rail STS France and the activities and backlog contracts of Hitachi Rail Deutschland. The package also includes all of Hitachi’s resources and assets relating to ETCS in Britain and the associated backlog of projects.

The proposed remedy did originally include some CBTC assets. However, this was withdrawn after the CMA’s Inquiry Group, which is scrutinising the proposed merger, updated its provisional findings and found that the acquisition would not result in a substantial reduction in competition in the supply of CBTC in Britain

Britian’s rail regulator, the Office of Rail and Road (ORR), stated last month stating that the proposed package would satisfy its concerns over future mainline signalling competition in Britain. A Hitachi spokesperson also confirmed that the company is satisfied that the same remedy package will address the EC’s concerns.

Hitachi added that it expects to receive a decision on the proposed transaction from the CMA “shortly.” The CMA’s final report on the proposed transaction is due by October 6.

Hitachi announced the proposed acquisition of the Thales Ground Transportation Systems business in August 2021. It said at the time that the transaction would drive growth in its global railway signalling business, bringing an enhanced turnkey offering to new markets around the world and accelerating development of its Mobility as a Service (MaaS) offer.

The remedy package

Under the proposal, Hitachi Rail would divest all shares of Hitachi Rail STS France, transferring ownership of the ETCS wayside and digital interlocking platforms as well as its Argos wayside and interlocking platforms. It will also dispose of Hitachi Rail France’s business for ETCS and legacy onboard unit projects along with ownership or access to intellectual property rights. The remedy taker would benefit from the transfer of all existing ETCS ATP wayside, interlocking, ETCS and legacy onboard unit projects, service and maintenance agreements.

In addition, the divestment would include all of Hitachi’s resources and assets relating to digital mainline signalling, or ETCS, in Britain, and the associated backlog of projects. Hitachi proposes carving out this element of its business into a new legal entity that would be transferred to Hitachi Rail France. It will also include the activities and backlog contracts of Hitachi Rail Deutschland, including an office in Munich, which has a test laboratory for factory acceptance tests."
Hitachi Rail Refiles Merger Notification for Acquisition of Thales' GTS - railway-news.com,"Tue, 19 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vcmFpbHdheS1uZXdzLmNvbS9oaXRhY2hpLXJhaWwtcmVmaWxlcy1tZXJnZXItbm90aWZpY2F0aW9uLWZvci1hY3F1aXNpdGlvbi1vZi10aGFsZXMtZ3RzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Hitachi Rail has refiled its merger notification with the European Commission in order to seek final clearance for the acquisition of Thales’ Ground Transportation Systems (GTS).

­­This move formally restarts the merger clearance process in the European Union following its withdrawal in November 2022.

Hitachi Rail initially announced its planned acquisition of Thales’ GTS in August 2021 under a 1,660 million EUR deal. It achieved merger clearances in 11 of the 13 required jurisdictions. However, the plan was met with opposition from the European Commission’s Directorate-General for Competition and the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) due to its potential to reduce competition in the supply of digital signalling.

In November 2022, Hitachi Rail withdrew its EU filing after the Commission raised concerns over this potential impact.

To overcome these concerns, Hitachi has now proposed to divest portions of its signalling business, including its Hitachi Rail STS France business and its assets in digital mainline signalling in Britain.

A Hitachi Rail spokesperson, said: “We are delighted to be in a position to refile for clearance in the EU after working extensively with the Commission on a proposed divestment package which we are satisfied will address their concerns. We look forward to continuing to progress the acquisition of Thales’ Ground Transportation Systems (GTS), which we believe will deliver value for customers in the rail signalling and mobility sectors in Europe and globally.”

In addition to refining its merger notification with the European Commission, Hitachi Rail also expects to receive a decision on the proposed transaction UK’s CMA in the near future."

Manfred Zekl, head of project management turnkey projects and transport for Thales Austria, said the company’s international effort helped build success: “Our expert team from Thailand, Austria and Bulgaria has continuously led this project to success with outstanding effort and perseverance.

“We could prove our strong commitment in supporting Thailand’s rail modernisation even under difficult circumstances. This achievement highlights Thales’ strong position in the signalling market in Thailand.”

The segment between Hua Mak and Laem Chabang was the longest to be equipped with ETCS Level 1, with 14 stations totalling 123km, allowing commuters to reach the eastern half of the Bangkok region securely and effectively.

Thales specialists from Thailand, Austria and Bulgaria designed, delivered and implemented the ETCS Level 1 trackside system in decentral mode.

The project oversees over 1,000 LEUs and over 3,000 balises, having been put across the track.

The implementation of this project follows its commencement in 2019, which as previously reported will meet “the highest safety standards for railway transportation in Thailand."
Thales partners with Intel to deliver end-to-end data security - Cyber Daily,"Thu, 21 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmN5YmVyZGFpbHkuYXUvdGVjaC85NTk0LXRoYWxlcy1wYXJ0bmVycy13aXRoLWludGVsLXRvLWRlbGl2ZXItZW5kLXRvLWVuZC1kYXRhLXNlY3VyaXR50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Leading global technology and security provider Thales has announced the delivery of complete end-to-end data security through a new collaboration with Intel.

Research revealed in the 2023 Thales Cloud Security Study found that organisations are expanding their portfolio of cloud service providers, with respondents reporting a 35 per cent increase in the last two years.

With this growth comes increased attention from threat actors, with 38 per cent of survey respondents ranking software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications, such as cloud services, as the top target for cyber attacks.

Just in the last year, several major attacks on large organisations and the government have been executed through third-party cloud providers.

============ ============

Recognising the increasing interest in storing data in the cloud and the growing risk that comes with it, Thales is bolstering its CipherTrust Data Security Platform with Intel’s Trust Authority and its verifiable attestation service.

The result is a product capable of protecting data in use and workloads while delivering seamless end-to-end data security.

“Thales’ collaboration with Intel enables security-conscious organisations to share data safely while preserving privacy, confidentiality, and compliance with regulatory requirements such as GDPR, PCI-DSS and HIPAA, only disclosing the results of the processes performed,” says vice-president of data security products at Thales, Todd Moore.

“This is especially important for highly regulated industries where data security is paramount to safeguarding the privacy of the information.”

Typically, confidential computing works to protect data in use by performing computations in a cryptographically isolated hardware-based trusted execution environment (TEE). The issue with this is that, in many cases, the cryptographic material verifying the TEE is managed by the cloud provider.

Thales new security solution patches this issue by putting the customer in control of the cryptographic key material by implementing separation of duties, meaning if the cloud provider is breached, threat actors won’t have access to the TEE this way.

“It is critical that enterprises retain control of their data protection and can confidently retain business agility while meeting compliance requirements,” said vice-president of systems architecture and engineering and office of the CTO at Intel, Anil Rao.

“Together, Thales CipherTrust Data Security Platform, Intel Confidential Computing technologies and Intel Trust Authority provide customers [with] the tools they need to do so.

“We’re pleased to combine the technology leadership and innovation of Thales and Intel with this solution.”

LinkedIn

On a sunny afternoon in August, Crawley hosted its third annual Pride Event, and Thales in the UK was thrilled to be a proud sponsor this year. We believe in creating an environment where everyone feels welcomed, valued and celebrated for who they are and our sponsorship of this event is a reflection of our commitment to breaking barriers and building a diverse, equal and inclusive workplace.

A group of Thales LGBTQ+ employees and allies took part in Crawley Pride, setting up a stand in Goff’s Park to showcase our company's LGBTQ+ network. Throughout the day, they engaged with the crowds, spreading awareness about our network and sharing their personal experiences working at Thales. They were busy all day, handing out lots of goodies, including free sunglasses, which went down a treat with the crowds in the sunny weather.

Allyson Diamond, Quality Assurance Manager and LGBTQ+ network liason for Crawley, expressed her enthusiasm about the event: “The whole event was fabulous. The atmosphere was positive and friendly throughout the day and we were well received.

She added: “It was a great opportunity to promote the inclusivity of Thales as an employer, highlighting that we do have an LGBTQ+ network for employees and sharing our personal experiences working here.

Working towards a more inclusive workplace

Thales in the UK is proud whenever our people say they feel free to be their authentic selves at work, without feeling any pressure to fit into any kind of mould.

Being able to express gender identity and sexual orientation, in a way that suits the individual and without fear of judgement, lets everyone bring their best to their work. By promoting a culture of acceptance and respect, employees are valued for who they are, what they believe, and the unique contributions they bring to the team.

Thales in the UK Volunteering programme

Getting involved in events such as Crawley Pride is just one of the ways that Thales in the UK employees can use their volunteering hours, to support worthwhile causes and build links with local communities.

Allyson added: “It’s great to work for a company that provides opportunities to volunteer, especially for events that you’re passionate about. The energy at Crawley Pride was infectious, and it was great to share it with a wonderful group of fellow Thales LGBTQ+ community members and allies.

Employees with an interest in a particular cause, community or campaign, can claim 24 hours paid leave a year to volunteer their time.

The programme has a wide reach and a range of options, from STEM education and outreach events, to fundraising and community engagement, in areas such as the environment and equality."

The deal, which would see Thales acquire all of Tesserent's shares at A$0.13 per share, was announced in June and would see Tesserent retain its brand but add ""Cyber Solutions by Thales"".

“Tesserent’s board carefully considered and weighed up the value, certainty, timing, execution, risk and competitiveness when forming its recommendation on the offer from Thales,"" said Tesserent CEO Kurt Hansen.

""We have always balanced three key priorities — the needs of our shareholders, the wellbeing and benefit of our people and the provision of reliable cyber security services to our expansive customer base.”

“This transaction will accelerate our three-year growth plan as the combination of Tesserent and Thales Australia will provide rapid scale and advanced services to address cyber security needs in Australia and New Zealand, including in the government, defence and commercial sectors.”

The next step in the process is the hearing of an application for approval of the acquisition by Tesserent in the Federal Court of Australia. If successful, the cyber security provider said it expects the implementation of the deal to commence on 4 October."

Facial recognition technology: what's new? - Airports International Magazine,"Wed, 13 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcnBvcnRzaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9mYWNpYWwtcmVjb2duaXRpb24tdGVjaG5vbG9neS13aGF0cy1uZXfSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Which airports are using facial recognition, and how? Mark Broadbent looks at the effectiveness of the technology and considers how soon we can expect a wide-scale roll-out According to the 2022 International Air Transport Association (IATA) Passenger Survey, “biometrics in travel is here to stay”. Amadeus biometrics can be found at Tokyo Narita Airport, while Thales’ Fly to Gate solution is in use at US and Asian airports, as well as European hubs, among them London/Heathrow Terminal 5. Collins Aerospace and Mitek are among other providers, the latter’s solutions in use throughout the US and Germany. US Customs and Border Protection and the Transportation Safety Agency are rolling out biometrics at checkpoints, gates, check-in and customs areas.

Airlines and airports are focused on delivering an easier, faster experience

Amadeus Amadeus biometrics at Tokyo Narita Airport

Why biometrics? Facial biometrics work by passengers using their mobile phone at home or via a kiosk at the airport to enable automatic identification in seconds. Thales’ Fly to Gate product line manager Vincent Deveze said biometrics present “huge benefits in terms of speeding up and improving processing”. Holger Mattig, senior vice president, product management, Amadeus Airport and Airline Operations, said: “With demand for travel continuing to rebound, airlines and airports are focused on delivering an easier, faster experience that reduces queues and makes international travel more automated and enjoyable.""

Amadeus Bag drop is only one of many possible uses for biometrics

Mattig continued: “Consider how often a boarding pass is removed from the traveller's pocket during an average airport experience. Paper documents must be kept to hand for at least six separate interactions. “Yet, with an end-to-end biometric deployment, it is possible for passengers to navigate the entire airport without needing to scan paper or mobile boarding passes. When approaching a check-in desk or bag drop unit, their face can become both their passport and their boarding pass, increasing speed and convenience while avoiding lengthy queues at checkpoints.” Amadeus reports passengers spending less than 20 seconds at bag drop and, Mattig said, “40-60% fewer staff required for check-in and manual document checks” as a result of biometrics solutions. He added: “Due to the integration with the departure control systems of airlines, any change to the journey, like seat or gate change, will be automatically processed and does not have to be manually handled as an exception by an agent.” Deveze said biometrics processing “lightens the load of manual checking for airport and airline staff” and “provides greater flexibility [for]the airport floor and better passenger flow management”. One size fits all Rakan Khaled, Collins Aerospace general manager for airport solutions, said: “The beauty of our product is scalability, making it sufficient for small airports as well as large Tier One facilities. We collaborate with airports and airlines to get real-time feedback as to when they were thinking of deploying this type of technology in their environment. Our solutions also assist with airports that grow larger or smaller in volume and/or number of airlines.” Amadeus’ Mattig described an end-to-end biometric process as “an ideal choice” for smaller airports, given staffing challenges and varying passenger flows, but he said: “Airports, regardless of size, can start small and scale up to new touchpoints at their own pace.”

Heathrow Ltd Biometrics were introduced at London/Heathrow Terminal 5

Describing Thales’ Fly to Gate product as “a multi-tenant cloud-based solution to gradually accompany and accommodate any airports’ capacities”, Deveze noted: “It doesn’t require airport operators and airlines to deploy a full-scale infrastructure.” He added: “Airports can start by offering biometric services at premium boarding gates, before expanding to a dedicated section within the airport and rolling out across a complete terminal. Fly to Gate can be integrated in any type of equipment (gated versus gateless), depending on airport layout and operations.” Managing change Mattig said: “It’s important to recognise biometrics represent a significant change and securing quick wins helps to build knowledge, increase familiarity among airlines, ground handlers and passengers [and] lower risk during implementation”. He continued: “Boarding tends to represent the easiest stage of the passenger experience to implement, so we recommend airports start there. It only involves the identification of a single passenger and because an airline knows who is due to board that plane, the biometric matching process is also more straightforward. Starting small and proving the value is key.” Mattig thinks airports should choose a flexible approach that minimises ongoing technical integration costs: “Ultimately, hundreds of cameras embedded at check-in, bag drop, security, the lounge and boarding will need to connect to the identity management platform [IMP] that match the passenger against their certified image.”

Protecting travellers’ data needs to be the highest priority for airports and airlines alike

Thales The Fly to Gate back end provides passenger analytics to monitor operational performance

Collins Aerospace’s Khaled highlighted “change” as “a primary challenge” with introducing biometrics. Airside security agents, for example, are now not scanning a boarding pass or verifying a passport and/or visa, so they become part of the traveller’s customer experience and assist with customer requests and other enquiries. “It’s new and a different grasp for an agent but it can be beneficial in many scenarios,” Khaled said. Chris Briggs, senior vice-president of identity at Mitek, agreed. He told Airports International: “A lot hinges on the travellers’ knowledge of using [this] technology. People who do not understand tech like e-Gates will reject the idea of it and opt to use manual passport checks. To secure full buy-in, it is also critical that airports invest more resources in explaining how everything works and assuring [travellers] regarding data privacy.” Further potential What are the next steps in developing biometrics at airports? Thales’ Deveze said: “We envision Fly to Gate to be rolled out on a global scale in the years to come, especially given the rise in air travellers necessitating further effective self-service solutions. We will soon announce projects in Asia. Fly to Gate can also integrate with immigration processes to ensure rigorous security. This will be another area we continue to expand in.” Amadeus’ Mattig said: “Many airports are looking to increase non-aeronautical revenues and place a greater focus on retail and dining experiences. Biometrics could be introduced to offer passengers a quicker and more convenient way to pay for goods and services. The technology can also be used for wayfinding purposes in flight information display systems and at information kiosks.” Collins’ Khaled said: “Biometrics not only focuses on the traveller/customer, but on the agent/ground handler working the flight from beginning to end. Biometrics is also involved while approaching the airport entrance along with being available on the entire airport property both outside and inside. From employee access control points to exit and entry, the sky is the limit.”

THAILAND: A consortium of Thales and River Engineering has completed a project to deploy ETCS Level 1 across 321 route-km and 48 stations on State Railway of Thailand’s Northern, Northeastern, Eastern and Southern lines radiating from Bangkok.

The programme began in 2019 and covered routes from Bangkok north to Lop Buri, west to Nakhon Pathom, northeast to Map Kabao and southeast from Hua Mak to Laem Chabang.

Thales staff from Thailand, Austria and Bulgaria worked with River Engineering to install over 3 000 balises and more than 1 000 lineside electronic units, which are connected directly to the signals for decentralised operation.

Thales first deployed ETCS in Thailand in 2017 as part of the double-tracking of the 104 km Chachoengsao – Klong Sip Kao – Kaeng Khoi route, then in 2018 it was awarded a contract covering the 41 km suburban Bangkok Red Line."

During a keynote speech by Dave Drewitt (Head of Sales and Business Development at Thales’ ‘Flight Avionics’) on ‘Sharing Skies – Enabling Safe & Secure Drone Operations’, activists took to the stage to highlight the hypocrisy of the talk and raise the Palestinian flag. Exposing Thales’ role in facilitating crimes against the Palestinian people by manufacturing Israeli drones, activists made clear that no apartheid-supplying business has the right to lecture on safe & secure drone operations.

Thales is one of the world’s largest arms companies, whose products include military drones, armoured vehicles, missile systems and more. They work in partnership with Israel’s biggest weapons manufacturer, Elbit Systems; the two companies jointly own UAV Tactical Systems (U-TacS). U-TacS operates a military drone factory in Leicester, which predominantly manufactures the Watchkeeper drone, modelled on Elbit’s Hermes 450 drone, which has been routinely used to massacre and surveil the Palestinian people and is marketed as “battle-tested” upon them as a result. The factory also holds several licenses to directly export military drone weaponry to the apartheid state of Israel.

Amongst representatives from the National Health Service (NHS) were senior members of weapons companies and the British Army. Craig Palmer, a senior British army officer who works with Elbit Systems and Thales on deploying the Watchkeeper programme, was also in attendance. Palestine Action occupied Thales’s roof at their Glasgow factory twice last year. More recently, their headquarters in Doncaster was targetted by a Palestine Action Underground group, and today’s disruption continues Palestine Action’s prior claims that all businesses which collaborate with or otherwise facilitate Elbit Systems’ actions will be targeted at their factories, offices, ceremonies and anywhere else.

Other attendees included Irene Ruiz-Gaberne from Airbus Military UK Ltd, Phil Hanson from Maritime and Coastguard Agency Aviation Evolution and Jeremy Hartley from the UK Civil Aviation Authority. All the organisations and companies they represent work with Israel’s Elbit."

pilot fatigue

Why this move?

In a bid to ensure the safety of its pilots, IndiGo is planning to test fatigue among its pilots using smartwatches , a report said. The pilots of the airlines can volunteer for trials that will use a fatigue management tool from Thales .Citing a memo sent this week, news agency Reuters cited Ashim Mittra , head of IndiGo's flight operations department as saying that the data collected from pilots will be analysed anonymously,""IndiGo will test Thales' fatigue management tool to assess pilot alertness levels over the next few months.Once completed, we will collectively evaluate the efficacy and accuracy of the data,"" Mittra was quoted as saying.Under the trial, pilots will volunteer to wear smartwatches that will track their heart rate, sleep patterns, and other data. The data will be analysed to assess pilot alertness levels.The memo also said that IndiGo has been collaborating with Thales on its fatigue management tool, which relies on real-time data, historical information, and predictive analysis, surpassing traditional scheduling methods.IndiGo is also planning to appoint a consultant to improve its fatigue risk management processes. The consultant will help the airline develop new ways to identify and mitigate pilot fatigue. The trial is expected to begin in the coming months.The development comes a few days after an IndiGo pilot collapsed and died before his flight, which sparked complaints from some pilots that they are being stretched to the brink by airlines, even though they comply with duty time regulations.The test will also enable the airline to devise tailored strategies for mitigating pilot fatigue. India's aviation regulator is presently conducting a review of pilot fatigue data collected through spot checks and surveillance of airlines.As per the memo's details, the trial involving smartwatches and other devices will focus on specific flight patterns at four airports, including Delhi and Mumbai. These devices will facilitate the voluntary assessment of drowsiness levels on each route and aircraft.Mittra also clarified in the memo that the trial will not replace the airline's existing fatigue risk management process, and pilots must continue to report fatigue based on self-assessment."

Of the shareholders who voted on the scheme on Monday, 68 per cent backed the plan to sell the company to Thales Australia for 13¢ a share.

A takeover offer by Thales Australia, maker of the Bushmaster, for cybersecurity firm Tesserent has been supported by most shareholders.

Thales, the defence company which makes the Bushmaster, lobbed a takeover bid in June to beef up its cybersecurity business, sending the company’s price rocketing 145 per cent.

Before receiving the offer, Tesserent’s share price had declined more than 59 per cent since the start of the year and will leave the ASX lower than its all-time high of 43¢ in January 2021.

From 2019 to March this year, Tesserent acquired 13 businesses to assemble a consulting shop that offers most of the cybersecurity services clients need under one roof. It competes against the high-profile private equity-backed CyberCX."

A Step Change in UK Shipbuilding Skills

To commemorate the start of London International Shipping Week, a number of employees from Thales in the UK attended the launch of the UK Shipbuilding Skills Taskforce report, ‘A Step Change in UK Shipbuilding Skills’, which makes a series of recommendations to address skills challenges across the shipbuilding sector.

Matthew Guy, Elizabeth Oon – Engineering Grad, Aironass Syvis – Engineering Apprentice, Julie Martin as Naval KAM, Sam McBriar as Strategic Marketing Director Naval, Justin Walker – Home Office KAM

The Taskforce has spent the last year exploring the shipbuilding skills challenges in both the immediate and long term. It also considers the impact of technological changes in the sector on skills and how to take advantage of these new and emerging technologies.

Matthew Guy, Human Resources Director Thales in the UK, has been a member of the Taskforce and played a key role in developing its recommendations. These include suggesting ways to attract a more diverse workforce, to overcome a sometimes negative public perception of the sector, by doing more to promote it as vibrant and inclusive.

‘As a HR Director with Thales, I’m proud to be part of the Taskforce and help contribute to the future of shipbuilding in the UK.’ Matthew Guy

The skills systems across the UK can be complex to navigate, particularly for small and medium enterprises, who face challenges in accessing apprenticeships and other training. The report makes suggestions on how smaller businesses can be supported to better engage with the skills system and recruit and train skilled people.

Thales is doing its bit for UK skills, last week 200 new early career starters joined us, graduates and apprentices. Their induction week focused on volunteering and giving back, and our new recruits got a chance to get their hands on some of the activities we take into schools to encourage interest in the STEM subjects from a diverse range of school students.

To thrive in a defence industry that is increasingly competitive and rapidly changing, Thales recognises the need to create ways to develop and maintain core skills, as well as learning new digital skills in order to continue to deliver products and services.

At the Thales Sonar Academy, which has some of the world’s leading experts and specialists in the field of Sonar technology, Thales is training and developing the next generation of Sonar Engineers and giving individuals a unique learning and development opportunity.

The new recruits, and the Sonar Academy, are a few examples of Thales in the UK’s long-term commitment to grow and develop people and skills. As is support to the Shipbuilding Skills Taskforce and its work in promoting shipbuilding as a vibrant and inclusive sector, ensuring shipbuilding skills are fit for the future."

Defence Minister Pat Conroy officiated and opened the new Lithgow Arms facility (pictured) which has been a centre of Australia’s defence industry since it opened in 1912.

The opening of the new facility is a milestone in the first phase in an ambitious plan to transform its Lithgow Arms site into an advanced manufacturing 4.0 and integration hub for the precision manufacture of Australian designed weapon systems.

According to the company the plant will integrate both traditional precision manufacturing and digital technologies, including 3D printing, and the installation of automated electro-plating and other metal treatment capabilities.

Vice President of Land, Thales Australia and New Zealand Julie Bown said “Thales Australia is a proud and committed steward of sovereign industrial capability in this country, and has taken this role seriously since our acquisition of ADI more than two decades ago.

“Lithgow Arms is the home of the only small arms manufacturing capability in Australia and we are proud to be a major employer in regional NSW. Our workforce is highly skilled and multi-generational.”

The new facility will house a new live firing test and evaluation capability to support systems qualification and integration, and research and technology development of digitised small-arms and weapon systems.

“The purpose-built facility will also support collaboration across research institutions, SME partners, and key industrial partners to create the soldier systems and small arms of the future, as well as train the next generation of skilled advanced manufacturing workers in the central west of New

South Wales.”

Lithgow Arms already exports its small arms to 17 countries and has been a key industrial partner to the Australian Defence Force, providing small arms and weapons systemsand end to end logistics and sustainment for more than a century.

Bown said: “Thales Australia is a proud and committed steward of sovereign industrial capability in this country, and has taken this role seriously since our acquisition of ADI (Australian Defence Industries) more than two decades ago.

The proposed €1.66 billion deal was first announced in August 2021, and Hitachi Rail has since secured regulatory approval in 11 of the 13 required jurisdictions. However, the European Commission raised concerns over the potential impact of the merger on competition for mainline signalling projects in France and Germany, and Hitachi Rail withdrew its EU filing in November 2022.

To address the Commission's concerns, Hitachi Rail has proposed to divest portions of its own signalling business. In a statement, a Hitachi Rail spokesperson said: ""We are delighted to be in a position to refile for clearance in the EU after working extensively with the Commission on a proposed divestment package which we are satisfied will address their concerns.""

Hitachi Rail also expects to receive a decision on the proposed transaction from the UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) shortly, with a decision due on October 6.

In its initial assessment in August, the CMA said that it did not believe the possible merger would have a detrimental effect on the signalling market within the UK. This was despite initial concerns that it could reduce the options within the sector..

The CMA concluded that Transport for London (TfL) who was the primary client of both Thales and Hitachi Rail would be pushing back many of its resignalling projects until at least 2030. This meant that Hitachi Rail, who have less experience in the industry would not be able to demonstrate its capabilities in highly complex projects.

If approved, the merger would create one of the world's largest rail signalling companies, with a combined turnover of over €5 billion. Hitachi Rail is a global leader in the development and manufacture of rail rolling stock, while Thales GTS is a leader in rail signalling and control systems.

"Airbus confirms hack, begins investigation into incident - Cyber Daily","Thu, 14 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmN5YmVyZGFpbHkuYXUvc2VjdXJpdHkvOTU2MS1haXJidXMtY29uZmlybXMtaGFjay1iZWdpbnMtaW52ZXN0aWdhdGlvbi1pbnRvLWluY2lkZW500gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Aerospace giant Airbus has confirmed it has been the target of a cyber attack and is actively investigating the incident.

An individual hacker with links to start-up ransomware group Ransomed posted the data on a popular hacking forum on Monday, 12 September, and an Airbus spokesperson shared an update on the incident with Cyber Security Connect on 13 September.

“Airbus has launched an investigation into a cyber event during which an IT account associated with an Airbus customer has been attacked,” the Airbus spokesperson said in a statement. “This account was used to download business documents dedicated to this customer from an Airbus web portal.”

The hacker – who goes by the online name of USDoD – shared some samples of the 3,200 lines of data they had exfiltrated. The list appears to be complete details for a number of senior-level employees of many of Airbus’ partners. Employees of Thales Aviation appear prominently in the sample set, including place of work, email addresses, and global areas of responsibility.

“Immediate remedial and follow-up measures were taken by our security teams to prevent our systems from being compromised,” Airbus said.

The company also added that it expects to be a target of such attacks.

“As a major high-tech and industrial player, Airbus is also a target for malicious actors,” the statement continued. “Airbus takes cyber security seriously and continuously monitors activities on its IT systems, has solid protection tools, skilled cyber experts and associated processes to protect the company by taking immediate and appropriate measures as and when needed.”

Airbus is continuing to monitor the incident.

In 2019, Airbus and the Thales Group signed a joint cyber security agreement to work as partners, pairing Airbus’ Orion Malware analysis platform with Thales’ CYBELS Sensor intrusion detection platform.

“This cooperation will enable the two companies to offer the best detection solution on the market, increasing the overall level of cyber defence for businesses and organisations,” the two companies said in a statement at the time."
Glasgow defence firm faces repairs after protestor damage - UK Defence Journal,"Sat, 16 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vdWtkZWZlbmNlam91cm5hbC5vcmcudWsvZ2xhc2dvdy1kZWZlbmNlLWZpcm0tZmFjZXMtcmVwYWlycy1hZnRlci1wcm90ZXN0b3ItZGFtYWdlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales Optronics’ production facility in Glasgow has filed for repair works following the significant damage caused by pro-Palestine activists last year.

As an optronics manufacturer and a division of the global defence giant, Thales Group, the Glasgow-based factory has been pivotal in designing and producing infra-red cameras, laser range-finders, and advanced reconnaissance systems.

The facility, which employs around 630 individuals, has been a cornerstone of the city’s defence industry landscape. However, its significance did not shield it from the ire of activist group PAS in July 2022.

Allegations of Thales’ involvement in the surveillance of Palestinians via drones led the group to target and extensively damage the facility. This resulted in the temporary suspension of operations and staff evacuation last year.

A planning application, dated 8th September 2023, highlights the scope of the damages and the extent of the repair work required. The document cites the need to over clad various parts of the factory, including the main roof and the large diamond north lights, as well as to install new safety measures.

This repair initiative follows two significant disruptions caused by the activists: a June incident where equipment on the factory roof was damaged, and the more widespread damage internally which occurred during the July protest."
IndiGo to use smartwatches in pilot fatigue trial - Zee Business,"Fri, 15 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnplZWJpei5jb20vY29tcGFuaWVzL25ld3MtaW5kaWdvLXRvLXVzZS1zbWFydHdhdGNoZXMtaW4tcGlsb3QtZmF0aWd1ZS10cmlhbC0yNTQwNDDSAWJodHRwczovL3d3dy56ZWViaXouY29tL2NvbXBhbmllcy9uZXdzLWluZGlnby10by11c2Utc21hcnR3YXRjaGVzLWluLXBpbG90LWZhdGlndWUtdHJpYWwtMjU0MDQwL2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"India's biggest airline IndiGo wants to test fatigue among its pilots using smartwatches and plans to appoint a consultant to improve its fatigue risk management processes, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters.

Pilots can volunteer for trials that will use a fatigue management tool from Thales, and the data collected will be analysed anonymously, said the memo sent to all pilots by Ashim Mittra, head of IndiGo's flight operations department.

""IndiGo will test Thales' fatigue management tool to assess pilot alertness levels over the next few months. Once completed, we will collectively evaluate the efficacy and accuracy of the data,"" Mittra said in the memo sent this week, and reviewed by Reuters on Thursday.

IndiGo did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The move comes days after an IndiGo pilot collapsed and died before his flight, an incident that sparked complaints from some Indian pilots that they are being stretched to the brink by airlines, even though they comply with duty time regulations.

Getting a consultant on board at IndiGo will play a vital role in implementing a robust fatigue risk management system in the coming months, Mittra said in the memo, adding it would also enable the airline to develop tailored fatigue mitigation strategies.

India's aviation regulator is conducting a review of pilot fatigue data it has collected during spot checks and surveillance of airlines to see if regulations related to flight duty times or fatigue need to be changed.

According to the memo, the trial will be on specific flight patterns using on-ground devices at four airports including Delhi and Mumbai, and voluntary use of smartwatches and cameras that will detect drowsiness level on each route and aircraft.

IndiGo has been working with Thales on its tool which uses real-time data, historic information and predictive analysis and goes beyond the traditional scheduling methods, it said.

""The trial does not replace the airline's existing fatigue risk management process. Pilots must continue to report fatigue based on self-assessment,"" Mittra said."
