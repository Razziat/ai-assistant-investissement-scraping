Thales Sonar Upgrades For Submarines - MarineLink,"Fri, 12 Feb 2010 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmluZWxpbmsuY29tL25ld3Mvc3VibWFyaW5lcy11cGdyYWRlczMzMzMzMNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales UK announced that it has been awarded a contract by BAE Systems to upgrade three Trafalgar-class and three Astute-class submarines with the Sonar 2076 Stage 5 system.



These submarines are currently fitted with the 2076 Stage 4 system. Once all the work is completed, 2076 Stage 5 will be fully deployed across the Royal Navy’s (RN’s) nuclear-powered attack (SSN) submarine fleet.



The Stage 5 Inboard Replacement (Stage 5 IR) contract is the latest in a series of developments to improve the capability, efficiency and through-life cost of the Sonar 2076.



Stage 5 IR achieves the UK Ministry of Defence’s (MoD’s) requirement for reduced through-life costs and the need for rapid capability insertions of new hardware, software functionality and new algorithms to meet the RN’s changing mission requirements.



The upgrade also delivers an open architecture that allows a high degree of commonality with the future Astute and Vanguard-class replacement (Successor) submarines, and supports the MoD’s vision for the evolution of a common sonar and combat system across the RN submarine flotilla.



S2076 Stage 5 is currently being deployed on the first-of-class platform and this is scheduled to complete by the middle of the year. Work on the Stage 5 IR contract will start immediately with equipment procurement and manufacture, with the platform upgrades planned for later this year through to late 2011.

Prosecutors to Probe Bidding for Military Communication System - 코리아타임스,"Tue, 02 Feb 2010 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtvcmVhdGltZXMuY28ua3Ivd3d3L25hdGlvbi8yMDI0LzA0LzExM182MDE4Mi5odG1s0gE-aHR0cHM6Ly9tLmtvcmVhdGltZXMuY28ua3IvcGFnZXMvYXJ0aWNsZS5hbXAuYXNwP25ld3NJZHg9NjAxODI?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Jung Sung-kiStaff ReporterThe Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA) has requested military prosecutors investigate an alleged information leakage on the selection of a company to manufacture military communication radio systems, a spokesman for the agency said Tuesday.The request comes amid a stone-throwing campaign over the selection of bidders to participate in the development of the up-to-date Tactical Information Communication Network (TICN), which will replace the existing SPIDER system.The TICN development is broken into six sectors, including a Network Management System (NMS), High Capacity Trunk Radio (HCTR), and Tactical Multi-band and Multi-role Radio (TMMR).Samsung Thales, one of the main bidders for the 3.5 trillion won TICN program, has argued that some officials from the DAPA leaked the results of the agency's evaluation committee in November to its rival, LIG Nex1.Samsung Thales said it had been about to win four of the sub-programs, including the TMMR, worth 1.3 trillion won, but the DAPA accepted complaints by LIG Nex1 to reexamine Samsung's proposal just a day before the final announcement.It alleged some DAPA officials had leaked the outcome of the evaluation to LIG Nex1.LIG Nex1 denied the allegation and said the reexamination was fair because Samsung Thales purposely submitted an expired production and service certification.Last August, the DAPA opened a bid for the full-scale development of TICN, following two years of exploratory development from 2007 to 2008.The TICN is a cutting-edge digital command-and-control and sensor-to-shooter battlefield system expected to replace the existing SPIDER communication systems run by the Army by 2020.It is designed to advance into a high-speed, large-capacity, long-distance wireless relay transmission system. SPIDER can only transmit still images and voice data, but TICN allows for the integrated transmission of video, image and voice data at more than 10 times the current speed.During the exploratory development period, Samsung Thales was in charge of the NMS development and two other subsystems, while LIG Nex1 took charge of TMMR.Samsung Thales has sought to take over the TMMR portion of the full-scale development.Sources said, the DAPA had initially been interested in Samsung Thales' offer during the first evaluation in October as the joint venture between Samsung and French defense firm Thales said it could reduce development time by a year and also cut costs to a great extent.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9997584223747253}",neutral,0.9997584223747253,0
Bushmaster Single Cab Utility Selected for Next Stage of Vehicles Program - army-guide.com,"Thu, 18 Feb 2010 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiN2h0dHA6Ly93d3cuYXJteS1ndWlkZS5jb20vZW5nL2FydGljbGUvYXJ0aWNsZV8xNTk2Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales Australia`s Bushmaster family of vehicles has received another boost, with the Single Cab Utility downselected for the Department of Defence`s LAND 121 Phase 3 program.

LAND 121 Phase 3 will replace a fleet of over 2,000 Australian Defence Force field vehicles and trailers with new vehicles procured across the program's Medium Heavy Capability component.

Thales Australia's Bushmaster Single Cab Utility has been downselected for the next stage of the tender evaluation process in the mediumweight category.

Chris Jenkins, Thales Australia's Managing Director, said the decision reflected the high level of industry capability, protected mobility vehicles expertise and customer knowledge available in Australia.

""The Bushmaster has been a very successful vehicle on operations, and we expect the Single Cab Utility to follow in this tradition. The successful development of the Single Cab Utility is a reflection on the extensive local expertise available to the ADF. We have worked closely with the customer for many years developing solutions that meet their unique operational requirements.

""This partnership has proven very successful, not only in terms of the creation of a sustainable local long-term relationship but also, most importantly, in protecting the lives of servicemen and women on operations.""

The Single Cab Utility is a cab chassis 4 x 4 protected logistics vehicle. It can carry a 5,000 kg load on its 9.4m2 tray, while providing crew with the protection, mobility and combat flexibility to fulfil their mission in the most hostile environments.

The Single Cab Utility uses the same monocoque v-shaped hull as the combat-proven Bushmaster to provide protection against mine blast and IEDs. This technology is enhanced by upgradeable ballistic protection options for the crew cabin.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999980926513672}",positive,0.9999980926513672,1

He saw it all up close and is ready for return - Graciemag,"Sun, 07 Feb 2010 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdyYWNpZW1hZy5jb20vaGUtc2F3LWl0LWFsbC11cC1jbG9zZS1hbmQtaXMtcmVhZHktZm9yLXJldHVybi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Share it

Murilo Bustamante is heading for Australia this July 8. There, he will acclimatize for his bout at Impact FC, where he will face Jesse Taylor. Without having stepped into the cage as a fighter in two years, the fighter is confident.

Murilo was a part of MMA’s evolution. In 1991, he fought at the memorable Jiu-Jitsu vs Luta Livre challenges, with neither gloves nor rules, and even head butts counted. He became champion of the UFC, already with a set of rules, and fought at Pride when it was the world’s biggest event.

Bustamente had a chat with GRACIEMAG.com. Check it out:

What does it feel like to return to fighting?

Everything’s great. The toughest part, the training, is out of the way and I’m well prepared and confident. It’s all just the way I want it. I’m stoked, really happy about this opportunity to get in the ring. I’ve wanted this for a long time and now I can make the most of the moment. There’s nothing more to say. I’m overjoyed.

Do you think the time out may hinder you?

Surely the time away does me no good and I’ll feel it. But I’m going to try and compensate for that with experience. I’m in shape, really well prepared for the fight. I managed to reach the baseline I’d hoped to. I have to fight smart and compensate with experience.

Taylor was recently submitted by Thales Leites. Could Jiu-Jitsu be the way to victory once again?

Jiu-Jitsu is always the way. If I get a chance to use it, it’s the best way, especially for those with it as their background, like me. But I trained a lot of boxing and wrestling. He fought Thales but I don’t know how he’ll come into the fight this time. He had a bad experience with Thales, made a mistake and taped. So he should be wary. I studied his game and I’m ready for any position that comes up, whether standing or on the ground. A fight’s a fight and I’m prepared.

Do you agree that the public likes knockouts and striking more? What are your thoughts on Jiu-Jitsu fighters looking to stand and trade in their fights?

I feel a good fight’s a good fight; it doesn’t matter if it’s on the ground or standing. A lively ground fight is great to watch. Some people prefer standup fighting and knockouts, but that’s a question of taste. The Japanese and Brazilian public has understood ground fighting for a long time and now the United States understands it too. As for Jiu-Jitsu fighters opting to strike, that’s not the smartest way to go. Of course MMA isn’t Jiu-Jitsu, but we have to use what we know best. But there are fighters who feel good standing, so it comes down to each individual.

You’re 43 now. How many more years do you plan to fight?

I don’t know; that’s a tough question. Back in the day, I thought I’d retire at 30. I made it to 43 and still feel like fighting. It’s a mixture of desire and my ability to keep up in training. As far as this fight goes, I hadn’t managed to train this way in two years, when the event I was supposed to fight at was cancelled. I didn’t know I could reach this level. But in the end, I’m content. It made me confident and we’ll see what happens. I’m motivated, prepared and confident. Now we just have to wait and see what happens given my lack of rhythm.

Check out the historic bout between Murilo Bustamante and Marcelo Mendes in the Jiu-Jitsu versus Luta Livre challenge of 1991.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9552578330039978}",neutral,0.9552578330039978,0
