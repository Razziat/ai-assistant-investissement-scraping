The Polish Armed Forces has selected Thales as the preferred technology provider for the future frigate Programme for the Polish Navy, MIECZNIK. This programme has strategic importance for Poland. Thales is offering an efficient low risk and comprehensive integrated combat system solution designed to meet Poland’s operational and industrial requirements. Thales will contribute to consolidate Poland’s local defence industry by working with PGZ-MIECZNIK Consortium and other Polish industry actors. ​ ​

Thales will leverage its experience of working with the Polish Navy and its 20-year relationship with its in-country partner, OBR CTM, to increase Polish industry’s contribution to its combat systems solutions both within Poland and in its global export markets.

Working together with Babcock and with the support of the UK Government, Thales will put key learnings from the Type 31 programme in the UK into good use to reduce risk and ease the path to vessel acceptance. Poland’s plans for the MIECZNIK frigates will deliver enhanced capabilities which will be of interest to other navies.

The combat management system (CMS) is the central command and decision-making element of a naval vessel combat system. Its function and performance – supporting sensor control, picture compilation, situation assessment, action support and weapon control – are critical to the operational effectiveness of a naval vessel. In service on more than 200 naval platforms, TACTICOS, has an unrivalled record of proven equipment integrations.

Thales’ CMS has an open and extensible architecture which creates a shared information environment and delivers agility in service. An enterprise development kit enables seamless integration of third party capabilities and a smooth path to future platform and system upgrades. In service with 25 navies the combat management system has highly intuitive human machine interfaces which deliver operational benefits for naval crews fighting the ship.

“We are proud to be part of this key programme for the Polish Armed Forces. Being down-selected by Polish Armed Forces recognizes the technology we can offer but also the experience we bring to integrating and delivering complex systems. This is not only a success for Thales but a significant success for Team UK. We look forward to continuing our relationship with Poland to the benefit of both nations.” Alex Cresswell, Chief Executive and Chairman, Thales in the UK

“We are proud that we have been selected for this major programme. It strengthens our relationship with the Polish Navy that dates back to the Orkan Class ships and the ORP Ślązak offshore patrol-vessel. We are looking forward to working together with Polish industry to support the Navy in its task to safeguard Polish sovereignty.” Gerben Edelijn, Vice President Above Water Systems, Thales","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9391189813613892}",neutral,0.9391189813613892,0

SES orders software-defined replacement satellite from Thales - SpaceNews,"Mon, 28 Mar 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9zZXMtb3JkZXJzLXNvZnR3YXJlLWRlZmluZWQtcmVwbGFjZW1lbnQtc2F0ZWxsaXRlLWZyb20tdGhhbGVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"TAMPA, Fla. — SES said March 28 that it ordered a software-defined geostationary satellite from Thales Alenia Space to extend content and connectivity services across Europe, Africa and Asia.

SES-26, the third satellite the Luxembourg-based fleet operator has ordered from Thales Alenia Space since November, will carry a communications payload that can be reprogrammed in orbit to adapt to changing mission needs.

SES Chief Technology Officer Ruy Pinto said the satellite is expected to launch in 2024 or 2025, although the company has not selected a launch provider.

SES-26 is the final satellite in a three-satellite contract with Thales Alenia Space for replacing spacecraft coming to the end of their operational lives. SES announced in November that it had ordered ASTRA 1P and ASTRA 1Q as part of this contract.

ASTRA 1Q is a software-defined satellite, while ASTRA 1P is a classic wide-beam spacecraft that cannot be reprogrammed in orbit. Both ASTRA satellites are slated to launch in 2024 to 19.2 degrees East to replace four spacecraft that primarily serve broadcast markets.

SES-26 will provide Ku-band and C-band frequencies with its software-defined payload from 57 degrees East, the company said, where it will replace the operator’s retiring NSS-12 satellite that was launched in 2009.

Asked whether SES envisages replacing all its fleet in geostationary orbit (GEO) with software-defined satellites, Pinto said: “Whenever the business case calls for it, yes, we be will looking into future-proofing our satellites.”

Software-defined satellites made up more than 80% of GEO high-throughput satellite orders in 2021, according to research from Euroconsult.

SES said SES-26 will be an important platform for supporting government communications solutions, and “is synergic” with the company’s recently announced acquisition of DRS GES, which provides managed satcoms services to government agencies.

Ethiopia’s free to air service Ethiosat also uses 57 degrees East to broadcast to 10 million TV households across the country.

Pinto said ASTRA 1P and ASTRA 1Q remain on track to be ready for a 2024 launch despite pandemic-related supply chain issues that have delayed multiple satellite projects.

French satellite operator Eutelsat said Feb. 17 it expects a revenue slump to stretch into 2023 as it awaits two delayed spacecraft from Thales Alenia Space.

The operator’s Konnect VHTS is now slated to enter service in the second half of 2023, instead of the first, while Eutelsat 10B is being delayed within its existing window of the first half of 2023.

Canadian satellite operator Telesat said March 18 that its Telesat Lightspeed low Earth orbit constellation is delayed by about a year after Thales Alenia Space ran into supply chain issues.

According to Pinto, SES has been able to avoid the disruption.

“We have five satellites under construction with [Thales Alenia Space] now, and they have been on track,” he said.

“In fact, SES-22, a C-band satellite intended for the U.S., is ahead of schedule and will be the first C-band satellite we are launching this summer.”

SES is counting down to launches this year that will deploy a total of 14 satellites for the company, comprising five GEO satellites for clearing C-band spectrum and nine satellites for its medium Earth orbit O3b mPower constellation.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999688863754272}",neutral,0.9999688863754272,0

Based at the company’s Global Competence Centre for Urban Rail Signalling in Toronto, De Sousa was appointed to this role in March 2021, after having served in various roles since 2018, including Vice President of Bids & Projects and General Manager for Canada and the United States.

De Sousa has been with Thales Group for more than 30 years and previously served as Managing Director of Thales in Brazil. Originally from France, he has extensive experience in managing large-scale, complex technology projects.

With a master’s degree in AI (artificial intelligence) engineering, De Sousa was Director of Defense Projects in France and Canada, all for Thales Group. For this executive profile, he spoke with Railway Age Editor-in-Chief William C. Vantuono.

RAILWAY AGE: You have quite a background. What brought you to where you are now?

ALCINO DE SOUSA: Thirty years ago, I joined Thales as a young artificial intelligence software engineer. I started in the research and technology labs we have in France, working in natural language processing. Then I moved to be a software team leader, and then, I managed several programs in the command and control program sectors. I was posted here in Canada in 1998 as director of a project, part of the digitalization program of the Canadian Land Forces. I went back to France in 2001. In 2010, I joined Thales Mexico in Mexico City, where I was program director for the Ciudad Segura project, the largest urban security project in the world. We installed more than 15,000 smart cameras in the city. We deployed five command and control centers and one central C5 (command, control, communication and citizen contact center) and two mobile command centers. Thanks to this technology, the city of Mexico reduced critical crimes by more than 50%. Our team was awarded a Striving For Excellence award in 2015 by the International Program Management Association (IPMA) in the Mega Sized Project category. After that, I went to Brazil as Country Director, representing the Thales product portfolio, from Space to Underwater.

My career has taken me across the globe in security, safety, communications and control, working with various technologies, internationally and multiculturally. I’m very happy to be here in Toronto with my family and lead a business with people from more than 40 national origins.

Alcino with the Thales Urban Rail Signalling Leadership Development Team

RA: You’ve been leading the Urban Rail Signalling business for a year. What are some of the highlights from the past year? Has anything surprised or impressed you?

DE SOUSA: The positive impact our signalling technology has on passengers’ lives every day from everywhere in the world clearly impresses me, an ongoing highlight and something I reflect on frequently. The diversity of our workforce worldwide, in particular in Toronto—strong diversity in national origin, but also in gender, with 25% female employees, which is something that is very important for us. We want to continue to grow in this area, making sure that women are given strong responsibilities in the company such as program management, design, software development and safety. And maybe more than anything, the passion of all these engineers here working every day on railway signaling technology. We are one of the only signalling companies with a major engineering centre in North America, with more than 800 engineers at our Global Competence Centre in Toronto; we have 10,000-plus years of signaling/resignalling expertise in house.

Thales’ Urban Rail Signalling Global Competence Centre in Toronto employs more than 800 engineers and features 30,000 square feet of simulation labs for system testing.

RA: Was that an eye opener for you when you came into the rail space, seeing how advanced it is, the interest there and the growth and importance of rail?

DE SOUSA: It was. I knew that there are very advanced technologies in this industry, but I was not fully aware until I came here. When we speak about autonomous trains, it’s all really impressive. It’s very interesting to see our engineers making sure that safety is first, but also improving the technology with digital tools, autonomy, etc.

New York City’s Flushing Line 7 runs on Thales’ SelTrac™ system and has also been used for a pilot program of cutting edge train control and positioning technology.

RA: How would you describe Urban Rail Signalling’s presence in North America?

DE SOUSA: In North America, we have 1,200 employees, in Toronto mostly, but also 100 people in Vancouver, several in New York, and in San Francisco, Ottawa and Montreal. We have several ongoing projects. In New York, the Line 7 Flushing CBTC technology with very good operational results. We’re also working in Montreal and Toronto doing some interlocking modernizations. But we really have projects all over the world—more than 100 metro lines that are equipped with our technology in more than 40 major cities in more than 15 countries. Three billion passengers can ride annually on the 3,500 trains from 14 different rolling stock manufacturers. We have projects in London, Paris, Hong Kong, Doha, Singapore, Dubai, Santiago, India, South Korea, Malaysia, to name a few. With all of them, we are close to our customers with signaling experts able to interact directly with them. It’s very important to have a strong local presence, with a strong bridge between our customers and the Competence Centre here in Toronto.

RA: You’ve worked almost your entire career in autonomous technologies and artificial intelligence.

DE SOUSA: It is a big area of interest, understanding the cutting edge technologies and how they will improve lives is fascinating to me. We are conducting pilot programs around the world, for example, in New York with NYCT and Toronto with GO Transit /Metrolinx, where we use cameras and sensors for train positioning. They are similar to the ones used in autonomous cars, and we adapt them for train control. With autonomy, we want to go a step further and enable the train to “think” for itself—improving safety and allowing for a quicker recovery time in case of any problem, for example, when the train needs to drive itself to the next station. Improving safety and efficiency, productivity, that’s the key.

GO Transit train in Toronto, Canada equipped with cameras and sensors as part of a Winter Autonomy pilot program where Thales partnered with Invision AI, Metrolinx, and the Ontario Government.



RA: And of course, sustainability.

DE SOUSA: Our CBTC technology is environmentally sustainable. This is a key topic as more and more cities around the world look to reduce their carbon footprint and invest in improving mass transit. Green technologies, such as the one we have, will be more in demand. At Thales, we really want to take metro automation to the next level. I strongly believe that autonomous metro will be here before autonomous cars, because rail is a controlled environment and it will thus be easier to make it happen.

RA: How would you summarize your first year leading Thales’ Urban Rail Signalling business?

DE SOUSA: Overall, we are proud of our technology and signaling expertise worldwide, delivering sustainable, innovative solutions for passengers, working with our transport operator partners. We’re passionate about our technology, our people, and our future.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999936819076538}",neutral,0.9999936819076538,0

While the figures are for the overall group, covering the multinational’s aerospace, defense and aeronautics business as well as digital identity systems, it is also announcing new partnerships and growth specifically for that division in separate developments.

Financials

Thales Group’s order intake rose 18 percent to €19.9 billion (US$22 billion), its sales were up 5.3 percent to €16.2 billion ($17.9 billion), its EBIT rose by 32.1 percent to €1.65 billion and its free operating cash flow was up to €2.52 billion (185 percent of adjusted net income, Group share).

Around €5.5 billion of free operating cash flow is now expected for 2021-2023.

“Thales concluded 2021 with an excellent fourth quarter in terms of order intake and operating free cash flow,” comments Patrice Caine, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.

“Commercially, the Group achieved the best year in its history. These successes with our clients, combined with the remarkable mobilization of our teams, have resulted in cash generation of well over 2 billion euros.”

The company’s Digital Identity & Security division improved its margin by 4 percent than in 2018 before it was integrated following the Gemalto acquisition, Caine said. He credited the division for the Group’s EBIT margin above 10 percent.

The pandemic has meant lower revenues in aeronautics, but overall the CEO remains bullish: “Thales’s business model, driven by the growing need for security and trust in an increasingly interconnected world, has remarkable potential for sustainable and profitable growth, offering solid future prospects for its employees, customers and shareholders.”

Thales Australia and New Zealand to develop Queensland mobile driver license

Thales’s operation for Australia and New Zealand has signed a deal with the Queensland Government to deliver Australia’s first digital license app. It will work with Transport and Main Roads (TMR) as well as local SMEs to create a mobile driver’s license (mDL) on international standards.

A 2020 pilot resulted in a user satisfaction rate of 94 percent. Thales is to add further functionality, increase the pilot area and then roll the app out to all 3.9 million Queenslanders.

Florida mDL to be implemented ‘by end of year’

The Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles is in the final stages of testing a Thales-developed mDL and ID app, reports WUFT News.

The biometric app, which can also be used as ID to the extent that it is called Florida Smart ID, was originally intended to become operational in 2021. It is already available to download, but the mDL part is not yet recognized by the state.

Holders can unlock the credential with fingerprint biometrics or facial recognition to generate a barcode for law enforcement to scan. iPhone users will be able to add their Florida mDL to Apple Wallet.

However, to buy alcohol and tobacco with the Florida Smart ID, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau would need to accept it as ID so that stores can. Airports in the state are expected to start accepting the app for travel this year.

Under the Tiger Mark III programme, the Tiger attack helicopter is to receive a major mid-life upgrade to extend its operational effectiveness beyond 2040.

Equipped with Thales’s leading-edge technologies, the new Mark III standard will be capable of completing the most demanding combat missions in a connected, collaborative environment, enabling the French and Spanish armed forces to achieve operational superiority in high-intensity engagements.

This major French/Spanish programme will upgrade a total of 60 Tiger helicopters – 42 deployed by French Army Light Aviation (ALAT) and 18 in service with the Spanish Army Airmobile Force (FAMET) – to the Mark III standard.



Thales on board Tiger MkIII

The Organisation for Joint Armament Cooperation (OCCAR), on behalf of the Direction générale de l'armement (DGA) for France and the Dirección General de Armamento y Material (DGAM) for Spain, has awarded Airbus Helicopters the development contract for the new Tiger attack helicopter standard. The Thales technologies on board the platform will provide French and Spanish forces with innovative, high-performance connected systems.

The Tiger attack helicopter is currently capable of carrying out reconnaissance missions, supporting ground troops and striking ground targets, both day and night, in all weather conditions. The upgrade will provide new detection, recognition and identification (DRI) functions to further boost the helicopter's offensive capabilities. It will also provide enhanced mission support and enable Tiger crews to operate in the collaborative combat environments of tomorrow. Connected to the French Army’s Scorpion system and to UAV systems, the Tiger Mark III will benefit from significantly enhanced communication, mission management and self-protection capabilities.

The upgrade builds on operational feedback from French troops deployed in Afghanistan and Libya, and against armed terrorist groups in the Sahel. The new technologies on board the Tiger will allow armed forces to stay one step ahead of the adversary, even in high-intensity conflicts, extending the helicopter's operational effectiveness beyond 2040.

Developments by Thales’s technical and industrial teams include an upgrade of the head-up display avionics. The new helmet-mounted TopOwl Digital Display incorporates more sophisticated technologies that will allow crews to cope with highly complex flight conditions while optimising the use of the helicopter's onboard sensors and weapon systems. The FlytX avionics suite will interface with a tactical battlefield data management system, significantly improving the pilot's interactions with the cockpit systems and enhancing situational awareness so that aircrews can focus on their core mission tasks. As for crew protection, it will benefit from a complete upgrade with a new self-protection system built around the Thales CATS-150.

At the weapon system level, Laser Guided Rocket System will meet the operational needs of aircombatants. During air operations, the new-generation radio communication system (CONTACT) will enable secure integration with the Army's SCORPION bubble, as well as communications with other airspace users. It will also be equipped with two Micro-TMA data link terminals: one enabling the guidance of the new MHT missiles, the other providing a video link with UAVs paving the way to the collaborative deployments that will form the cornerstone of air combat systems over the next twenty years. Finally, the Tiger Mark III will also be equipped with a dual-constellation (GPS and Galileo) satellite navigation system.

The Tiger Mark III will operate alongside mission helicopters such as the Caiman and Caracal, and the Guépard joint light helicopter scheduled for delivery from 2027 (HIL program).","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9993289709091187}",positive,0.9993289709091187,1

Acusonic gunshot detection system leaves other systems in its wake - Thales,"Thu, 03 Mar 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi91bml0ZWQta2luZ2RvbS9uZXdzL2FjdXNvbmljLWd1bnNob3QtZGV0ZWN0aW9uLXN5c3RlbS1sZWF2ZXMtb3RoZXItc3lzdGVtcy1pdHMtd2FrZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Acusonic gunshot detection system leaves other systems in its wake Share this article



LinkedIn

Thales’s Acusonic gunshot detection system overcomes an established weakness in similar systems on the market by removing its reliance on picking up muzzle blast to provide accurate bearings onto hostile firing positions.

As a result, Acusonic, whether in stand-alone or fully integrated mode, has been proven to provide accurate bearings to firing positions from moving platforms on land and at sea.

Increasing situational awareness and safety

Experience from Iraq and Afghanistan showed the difficulty faced by vehicle mounted crews in detecting incoming fire or its point of origin, due to engine noise and limited visibility.

A need was identified for an effective system that could detect hostile small-arms fire aimed at the vehicle, and the firing point, without soldiers leaving the safety of their vehicle. Acusonic, the solution from Thales, has been selected for both the British Army’s Ajax armoured fighting vehicle and Boxer mechanised infantry vehicle programs.

In common with other systems, Acusonic uses sensor arrays to capture the acoustic profile of a supersonic round. Sensors mounted on the vehicle pick up the shockwave of supersonic projectiles, from small arms to 30mm cannon shells, passing within 50m, and operators are presented with a hostile fire alert within 0.5 seconds.

Due to the conical shape of the shockwave, algorithms can calculate two possible solutions for the firing position bearing, approximately 120-140 degrees apart. If the sensors also pick up the muzzle blast of the weapon fired, algorithms can compare it with the shockwave to indicate an accurate firing position range and bearing.

While this works in perfect conditions, military platforms operate in the real world, on the move and in hostile conditions. The muzzle blast is rarely picked up due to a number of factors, including distance from the shooter, weather and, most significantly, masking by vehicle noise. The best that alternative systems can offer in these conditions is to issue a sector alert – danger from the front, rear, to the left or right.

“It’s better than nothing, but those are very big sectors and not very useful to the operator,” said Tom Kinnaird, Acusonic sales lead at Thales. “Acusonic offers a solution to this well-known Achilles heel of all acoustic gunshot detection systems, and it’s been proven in real-world conditions.”

A unique solution to the Achilles Heel of gunshot detection systems

Unlike every other acoustic based product on the market today, Acusonic does not rely on picking up the initial muzzle blast in order to provide an accurate bearing to the firing position.

Acusonic’s patented algorithm distinguishes the correct solution from the two possibilities by using a third acoustic profile of the round in flight – its wake.

“Through clever software algorithms, we can combine the round’s wake with shockwave information to distinguish and present an accurate bearing to the operator, no matter the conditions or whether they are on the move,” said Tom.

Maritime and autonomous applications

While Acusonic was initially developed for land vehicles, its’ performance in real world conditions also makes it effective in the maritime domain, particularly for special forces operating in littoral or riverine environments where hostile firing positions may be concealed. There is also a need for the remote operators of unmanned platforms, on land and at sea, to be able to detect when their platform comes under fire.

Already proven on land, in August 2019 Acusonic was fitted to BAE’s P950 Unmanned Surface Vessel for a successful live-fire proof of concept trial for the Royal Navy. As a result, Thales UK has delivered the Acusonic system to BAE on its Autonomous P24 platform which has recently undergone trials with the Royal Navy.

Simple stand-alone or integrated solutions

For new build programmes where Acusonic can be designed in from the start, Thales offers a solution which is easily integrated into a platform’s selected command and control (C2) software and Human Computer Interface (HCI), unlocking extra capability such as the slew to cue of remote weapon stations.

In addition, Acusonic’s stand-alone, plug-and-play capability is easily and quickly retro-fitted onto any platform. This approach utilises existing cabling channels and vehicle power, requiring only physical mounts for sensors, a handheld or mounted tablet device displaying output to the users and, where required, a navigation unit.

“Special and regular forces may be using a range of vehicles,” said Tom. “We can fit it onto the platform in two hours and it can be driven away with negligible downtime.”

Thales is selected by ProRail to replace the current system with a new Central Safety System (CSS) on the Dutch railway network. The contract has a maximum duration of 37 years with a value of 420 million euros with a significant part being dedicated to innovation.

The CSS is software-driven and enables us to move away from analogue and towards digital. The CSS controls the railway’s security centrally from ProRail’s Data Centres. Today this activity is still carried out via signals along the track, but moving to a digital solution will drastically improve the railway network maintainability and scalability. The system will be continuously improved during the implementation in order to continue to meet the changing market requirements and to take advantage of new possibilities.

ProRail selected Thales almost two years after the publication of the CSS tender. The CSS plays a central role in carrying out the objectives of ERTMS. Consequently, the new CSS will increase the safety and capacity of trains in order to accommodate future growth of freight and passengers transport. Travelling within Europe by train will also become a lot easier and therefore more attractive.

“Contributing to a safer world is at the heart of our business. We are therefore proud that we are achieving safer and more sustainable train transport with our Central Safety System. Being a part of Thales, we are doing similar projects across Europe and it is great to work together to build a European rail network for goods and passengers.” ​ Gerben Edelijn, CEO Thales Nederland

“We are very happy and proud to become ProRail’s long term trusted partner by supporting them in the execution of their clear vision to build an efficient and more sustainable railway network. All of that will be boosted by our advanced digital technology portfolio and highly experienced people” ​ Dr. Yves Joannic, Managing Director of Thales Main Line Signalling

Krauss-Maffei Wegmann and Thales will supply the German Armed Forces with Panoramic Above Armour Gimbal (PAAG) as part of the Joint Fire Support Team (JFST) contract. ​ ​

Four prototypes will be manufactured in 2023 to equip the BOXER armoured vehicle with a follow-on production contract anticipated in 2025.

Thales has established itself as a trusted partner in vehicle optronic solutions for all mission types with more than 50 national land forces being currently equipped throughout the world.





Thales has signed a contract with Krauss-Maffei Wegmann for the delivery of 4 PAAG to the German Armed Forces to equip the BOXER armoured vehicle.

The Stabilized Panoramic Above Armour Gimbal (PAAG), built in Thales premises in Glasgow, UK, is an electronic surveillance system that is remotely controlled from inside the BOXER and gives users a stabilized long-range ‘Detection, Recognition, Identification’ (DRI) and weapon aiming ability on the move during daylight and night conditions.

The system with thermal imaging device and high-resolution daylight color camera enables targets to be identified in the range of up to four kilometres, depending on their size. In continuous operation, the entire hemisphere around the vehicle can be covered. A laser rangefinder offers measuring distances of up to ten kilometres. It can also be raised above the vehicle roof to allow the monitoring of targets from behind a ridgeline without putting the user in a direct line of sight, which greatly reduces operational risk.

An Automatic Video Tracking (AVT) and Assisted Target Detection (ATD) is also included in the JFST PAAG system. Combined with an artillery command and control system PAAG will contribute significantly to the capability being fielded. ​

The BOXER Programme, managed by the European armament’s agency OCCAr, provides the German, Netherland, Lithuanian and the United Kingdom Armies, with a new generation of all terrain armoured utility vehicles on the basis of balanced capabilities of transport capacity, mobility, protection, survivability, growth potential and efficient life cycle costs.

The JFST programme in Germany will see the delivery of two prototype JFST-heavy vehicles based on the BOXER 8x8 Armoured Vehicle coupled with a new JFST Mission Module integrating Thales PAAG.

The BOXER is an 8x8 all-terrain heavily armoured utility vehicle with a unique modular concept of a common drive module and an exchangeable mission module, making it a flexible military vehicle, thus ensuring maximum strategic and tactical mobility in a wide range of operational scenarios.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.995987594127655}",neutral,0.995987594127655,0

The teams at Thales’s centre of excellence for dismounted soldier optronics in Saint-Héand have been using a new simulation tool since November 2019. Initially developed to simulate airborne optronic solutions, the IMAGE’INN co-design and demonstration lab has been in use at Thales’s facility in Élancourt since 2013, where it has repeatedly proven its value as a design aid.

Since 2019, it has allowed the soldier optronics teams at Saint-Héand to work more closely with operational personnel, collating the requirements and insights of end-users at every stage in the design process, from needs definition to demonstration.

The XTRAIM weapon sight was the first product to be designed at Saint-Héand using the IMAGE’INN tool since Sophie Ultima and Sophie Optima, the latest additions to Thales’s popular range of thermal imagers.

The Saint-Héand teams met regularly with end-users, using IMAGE’INN to choose the best options and produce the first virtual prototypes of the new XTRAIM weapon sight. They then built a demonstrator, which was further optimised in conjunction with users until a final design was nailed down.

IMAGE’INN relies on a database of realistic images of theatres of operations developed with the Training & Simulation teams at Thales’s Avionics business. A military advisor helps to add concealed threats to the images and develop animated scenarios of operational situations. The IMAGE’INN software then simulates a whole range of weather conditions — rain, fog and various lighting levels, from bright sunlight to near total darkness — to demonstrate different ways of revealing the concealed targets (IR, IL or IR+IL).

In dark conditions, conventional simulations usually show infrared images in black and white, but with IMAGE’INN, infrared imagery is perfectly simulated —a 100% Thales innovation.

With IMAGE’INN, the main features and interfaces of XTRAIM could be quickly prototyped, and this virtual prototype then served as the visual basis for further demonstrations and developments. One of the next major challenges with XTRAIM was to build a demonstrator from the virtual prototype in record time.

“Personnel from a range of conventional forces and special forces units worked with the demonstrator from the earliest design phase. Thales was able to capitalise on their feedback, both inside the IMAGE’INN environment itself and in highly realistic firing conditions outdoors. Once we had fully understood their requirements and constraints, we were able to offer them solution that exactly matches their actual operational needs.” Xavier Gonon – Product Design Authority

XTRAIM is a revolutionary weapon sight solution. In a single lightweight and compact package, it combines a reflex red-dot sight, a thermal night sight and a day/night target decamouflage capability, which was previously not available to assault rifle users. The new product also has an outstanding ergonomic design and is optimised for high maintainability. It is ready for collaborative combat, designed to accommodate new developments and future technologies, and is compatible with the entire range of Thales night vision goggles.

The XTRAIM development teams at Saint-Héand are proud of the new weapon sight, which was co-developed with the customer and is now ready for operational service. By augmenting the soldier's perception in the battlespace, XTRAIM enables dismounted infantry to make faster and more informed decisions and helps to keep them safe.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999333620071411}",neutral,0.9999333620071411,0

As a Propulsion Systems Engineer, I work on different aspects of the propulsion subsystem. Some of the work I am currently involved in includes: development of Cold Gas Thrusters & Gridded Ion Engines through their respective product life cycles and working on studies where I help assess different technologies and identify which would best achieve the desired results within a given schedule and budget. Additionally, I lead work developing a road map for SmallSats, mentoring a start-up and managing an outreach program, MarsBalloon, with the goal of exposing the younger generation to Space. In this role, you continuously engage with disciplines outside of your remit such as with Mechanical Architects, Product Engineers and Procurement, to name a few. A lot of my work also revolves around communicating with Customers and Suppliers which I believe is integral at any phase of a project.

What are you most proud of in your day-to-day activity?

It makes me happy to know that the work I do on a day-to-day basis contributes to making a difference. A large portion of my time at the moment is spent on product development for Space Inspire’s propulsion subsystem. Space Inspire is a software-defined and extremely flexible telecommunications solution supported by an ESA Partnership Project called Novacom II and by French space agency, CNES. It is a new product line for geostationary satellites which will facilitate instant in-orbit reconfiguration, flexibility for video broadcasting and broadband connectivity services. In the field of this program, Thales Alenia Space teams in the UK is responsible for the design of the Propulsion Subsystem. I am very much excited to work on a program which seeks to provide innovative designs and cutting-edge solutions. In 2021, Thales Alenia Space took the lead on the geostationary market, being awarded contracts to build 5 telecommunications satellites, as industrial prime contractor. One of them, SES’ ASTRA 1Q satellite will be based on our new Space INSPIRE solution.

In early 2022, Intelsat telecom operator has renewed its trust in our company, ordering 2 brand new Space INSPIRE satellites to Thales Alenia Space. I am referring to Intelsat 41 and Intelsat 44 satellites. It is also really rewarding to work for a company which strives to push boundaries, places emphasis on good communication and focuses on building strong relationships with all external stakeholders.

Which event in your career have you enjoyed the most?

Thales Alenia Space gave me my first step into the Space Industry. Within six months of my placement, I was given the opportunity to lead a breadboard test campaign which assessed a potential architecture to enable refueling in orbit. Here I had the chance to manage the Supplier, learn about how different components in a subsystem interact with each other, receive and analyze test data, identify and evaluate anomalies and report back to the Customer, ESA, on our findings. As an engineer new to working life and the industry, being given the chance to work on such an exciting project with a variety of learning opportunities was a wonderful experience for me and only further confirmed that I really wanted to work in the Space Industry.

In 3 words, what are the qualities required in your profession?

Enthusiasm, determination, and communication.

Thales has been included for the ninth time in the Top 100 Global Innovators – a list of the world's most innovative companies and research institutions published by Clarivate Analytics[1] every year. Understandably proud, Philippe Valéry, Vice President, Technical Operations at Thales's Technical Department, tells us more.

What can we learn from the Top 100 of 2022?

First of all we should remember that it's a list of the world's top innovators rather than a ranking. But one interesting development is that this year's list includes eight French companies, compared with just three last year. And of the three that made it in 2021, Thales is the only company to be listed this year too, which goes to show how resilient we are. The other seven (Airbus, Alstom, CEA, CNRS, Michelin, Safran and Valeo) made a comeback in 2022, having been on the list in previous years but not in 2021.

What about the global dimension?

Apparently Clarivate Analytics made big changes to its methodology this year, with a number of important consequences. For example, there are many fewer US-based organisations on the list – 18 instead of 40 – and the number of Japanese organisations has increased from 25 to 35.

What are the key takeaways for Thales?

As well as showing the Group's resilience, the listing highlights the number of inventors we have at Thales, with about 3,500 people filing one or more patents. Another indicator I find particularly telling is the number of digital innovations as a proportion of total patents filed. Thales scored 45% on this metric, which is a very good result. Digital technologies are easier to disseminate and have dual uses, making them more exposed. So it's especially important to protect our digital technology assets.

I also want to stress the importance of investing to extend patent protections to the geographies where our businesses are growing. This is an important factor in the Clarivate Analytics methodology – in fact it's more important than the number of patents filed.

Last but not least, the listing shows we are capable of positioning ourselves very early in emerging fields, with numerous patents filed for quantum technologies. This is clearly a good sign for the future!

I lead project teams from kickoff to product delivery. At Thales Alenia Space, I have mainly worked on radiation monitoring units for programs such as Meteosat Third Generation, Sentinel-6, MetOp Second Generation and Lunar Gateway. My project portfolio has grown quickly. This month I handed over the remaining radiation monitoring unit projects to focus on COMET Interceptor—scan mechanism electronics for a rotating mirror assembly—and will hopefully be able to work more on the COMET camera telescope, LISA Gravitational Reference Sensor Front-End Electronics, VERTIGO (very-high-throughput satellite-to-ground optical link), VARTO (variable-data-rate transmitter for LEO direct-to-Earth optical links) and Next Generation Gravity Mission Acquisition and Pointing Metrology System. Alongside my projects, I also work on bids, typically writing the implementation and management documents, and doing the costing and risk assessments in conjunction with engineering.

I follow the bids from kickoff through to submission and, if successful, to negotiations and contract award. There’s always a lot to do and I enjoy the fast pace of my job.

What are you most proud of in your day-to-day work?



Thales Alenia Space provides key space solutions for communications, Earth observation, navigation, science and space exploration, including orbital infrastructures and space transportation systems. This gives me the chance to work on interesting missions in an international environment, with very talented people. I’m also proud to work for a company that’s closely involved in environmental monitoring.

We’re working hand in hand with the European Space Agency on the European Commission’s Copernicus environmental monitoring program, which encompasses 12 Sentinel satellite families developed by Europe’s space industry for ESA.



Sentinel-1 monitors land and sea in all weather conditions, day and night, with its radar capabilities; Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 acquire optical imagery at high resolution over land and coastal waters; Sentinel-4 and Sentinel-5 are dedicated to meteorology and climatology missions; and Sentinel-6 monitors the planet’s oceans. Thales Alenia Space is prime contractor for Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-3, in charge of the Sentinel-2 image ground segment, and contribute to the imager-spectrometer on Sentinel-5P and the Poseidon-4 radar altimeter for Sentinel-6.

In 2020, we were also chosen for five of the six new Copernicus Expansion missions, three as prime contractor—CIMR, ROSE-L and CHIME—and will supply payloads for two other missions—CO2M and CRISTAL. These new satellites will measure human-induced carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere, gauge the thickness of ice fields and snow cover, support advanced new services for sustainable management of agriculture and biodiversity, observe sea-surface temperature and salinity and density of ice fields, and bolster land-monitoring and emergency management services. I am very proud to be working for a company that’s on 11 of the 12 Copernicus missions.

Meteosat Third Generation (MTG), which I mentioned earlier, is typically the kind of program that European citizens can be proud of. Meteorologists have been relying on the wealth of data from Meteosat satellites for over 45 years to generate weather forecasts. Thales Alenia Space has built all of Europe’s geostationary meteorological satellites as prime contractor. With the upcoming MTG, images will be updated every ten minutes and these satellites will also carry atmospheric sounders, making weather forecasts even more reliable. MTG includes 6 satellites: 4 imaging satellites and 2 sounding ones. The two atmospheric sounding satellites will be making a real technological leap to yield 3D maps of the atmosphere—a world first. The sounders will enable detection of severe weather events half a day ahead. By combining all these capabilities, forecasters will be able to do their job better and forecast out to eight days ahead. That will be a big step forward in giving populations early warning of severe weather events. MTG really is going to help save lives while paving the way for new kinds of services for Europe and Africa. Once the entire MTG fleet is in orbit, Eumetsat will have the best weather services in the world.

Also, our company has been a pivotal partner on the most fantastic space exploration missions across the solar system. We provided half of the International Space Station’s pressurized volume. Leveraging this unique experience, Thales Alenia Space is today the world leader in orbital infrastructures, providing in particular three key pressurized modules for Lunar Gateway.

What are the qualities required in your job?

Dedication: you have to care about the success of your projects and the company as a whole, be accountable, and work with others across projects to find solutions with the bigger picture in mind. Proactivity: the end goal is to reach the finish line (bid submission or project completion) with the expected results, so it’s important to remain flexible in how to get there while keeping to the scope, cost and schedule. Spend your time where you’re most needed, set your priorities and get things done. Help out where you see gaps and flag early when there’s a problem. Communication is key to keep the team motivated and on track, to ensure customer expectations are met and to keep internal and external stakeholders informed at the right level. Ask yourself who needs to know what and how best to present it.

SEA is committed to a process of continuous improvement and Thales is helping them on their roadmap towards smart airport operations by providing a suite of tools to integrate the information needed to manage the airport efficiently, to smooth collaboration among all stakeholders and ultimately to offer passengers a world-class experience.

To support SEA Airports in meeting this challenge, Thales has been awarded a contract for the delivery of an Airport Operations Plan solution that integrates SEA systems and data of the main processes that impact the management of the airport (airfield, terminal and accessibility).

Thales will provide SEA Airports with its AiRISE ShareView solution, a complete, scalable and innovative digital platform designed to master the complexity of centralised airport operations management.

The platform presents three main airport-oriented features:

- a user-friendly, real-time map of the airport enabling a global situational awareness of individual services, making any intervention easier and immediate;

- a customisable dashboard with key performance indicators measuring specific operations, thus monitoring objectives and ultimately performance;

- and a workflow manager to automatise Standard Operating Procedures for processes relevant to the KPIs measured.

In our connected world, with the proliferation of information sources and sensors, operators face a tremendous increase in the volume of data they have to treat and analyse. The Thales platform will gather this large amount of data from several operational systems, and by providing a broad, accurate and reliable view of the real-time situation to all stakeholders, will enable them to react more effectively to unplanned operational events.

“We are extremely pleased to have been chosen as technological partner in such a key project for SEA Airports’ digital transformation. Leveraging our airport solutions portfolio as well as the world class expertise in airport technologies implementation in complex projects, from New York JFK to Oman, Bahrain, Lyon and Geneva, we will provide SEA with a best-in-class operational solution tailored to their needs that will contribute to the operational improvement of SEA Airports.” Marco Scarpa, Secure Communications and Information Systems Director, Thales Italia

Dr Rachel Craddock

Dr Rachel Craddock is a Thales Expert with 30 years’ experience under her belt in artificial intelligence and machine learning. In 2013, when Rachel was 42 years old, she found out she was autistic, and has since led the Thales Neurodiversity Group in the UK.

Rachel joined the Thales Research, Technology and Innovation (RTI) team in 1998 as a Senior Engineer and has worked her way up to become a Thales Expert and Fellow of the Institute of Engineering and Technology (IET). The Neurodiversity Group actively work with Human Resources, Employee Relations and Managers across the business to humanise neurodiversity.

We caught up with Rachel to find out what her experience has been like and to get an insight in to the work the Neurodiversity Group are doing at Thales in the UK.

How would you describe being a neurodiverse person in a neurotypical world?

It varies from day to day. The world doesn’t work for me or make sense on some days, but then you have these wonderful days, where being neurodiverse gives many gifts, things that a neurotypical person wouldn’t experience. For example, my neurodiversity means I see things in a different way, almost a childlike way of viewing the world with a sense of wonder. It’s really quite powerful because you appreciate the world in a different way. Other days just don’t work well. It’s as if I’m a Martian on Earth and I don’t speak the language or understand the customs. Everything I do or say will feel wrong and despite everyone, including me talking English, we do not understand each other – I fail to make people understand me and I can’t understand them. It’s very frustrating and exhausting.

My neurodiversity makes my thinking very quick and this is both a gift and a curse. I struggle when people don’t keep up with me. When I had chemotherapy, it slowed down my thinking and I was like “is this how normal people think, I want my super human thinking back” – it just dulled my brain and I didn’t like it, it just wasn’t me.

What do you think are the biggest misconceptions of being neurodiverse and how can we improve this?

One misconception is that all neurodiverse people are the same, and we’re not. Just like all neurotypical people are different. Being neurodiverse in society affects each individual differently. Someone like me, can work, can drive and survive ok in society. It’s certainly not easy, but I manage through a lot of hard work and effort. However, there are people who need 24hr care and then there’s everything in between.

Another misconception is that neurodiverse people should be put under the mental health bracket. Neurodiversity is not a mental health condition. But just like neurotypical people, neurodiverse people can suffer from mental health conditions. In quite a few cases, depression and anxiety will be the result of trying to live in a society that doesn’t understand us or accommodate us well.

People also ask “can we cure it?” If you cure it, you change me. You would have rewired my brain and I won’t be me anymore. A cure is society taking the easy way out, and getting everyone to conform, rather than putting in a bit of effort to accept everyone’s differences. I like being neurodiverse and being me. I don’t like feeling excluded by society and having to put in all the work to survive in a neurotypical world.

Many of the misconceptions are old fashioned and limit the life a person can lead.

Why did you volunteer to lead and support the neurodiversity group at Thales in the UK and can you tell us about the work you do?

I didn’t know I was autistic until I was 42 years old. As soon as I found out, I wanted to make a difference. In 2019, one of my colleagues said, “we’ve had an email from our diversity lead and they’re looking for someone to be the new neurodiversity lead” and straight away, I said, “I’ll do it”.

The Neurodiversity Group is looking at awareness, accommodation, acceptance and enabling everybody to be the best they can be within Thales. We’ve done a lot of work with Human Resources and Employee Relations, as well as Managers to humanise neurodiversity.

For neurodiversity to succeed, it is important to include neurodiverse people. There’s a saying we use a lot – “Nothing about us, without us”. We also have an internal neurodiversity network, a safe place for neurodiverse people to express themselves.

Why is spreading awareness of neurodiversity important to you?

My autism gives me a strong sense of fairness. I want the world to be fair and I want our future generation to have a better experience.

I want people to know that I’m a Thales expert and make people aware that my autism hasn’t limited my career or stopped me succeeding. If anything, it’s enabled me to be good at my job.

What are your plans going forward with the neurodiversity programme at Thales in the UK?

We’ve partnered with an organisation called Genius Within, who have provided training to Human Resources, Employee Relations and a small number of line managers. Our ambition is to train more people across the business on “this is me”, irrespective of whether you are neurodiverse or neurotypical and how we can best work and support each other. I don’t want neurodiverse people to be treated as special, I want everyone to be treated as special. Inclusion means everyone.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998602867126465}",neutral,0.9998602867126465,0

0 SHARES

Thales will implement the Central Safety System in order to achieve much safer and more sustainable railway traffic network for the Netherlands.

Credit: Thales

Thales has been selected by ProRail to replace the current system with a new Central Safety System (CSS) on the Dutch railway network. The contract has a maximum duration of 37 years with a value of €420 million; with a significant part being dedicated to innovation.

The CSS is software-driven and enables the company to move away from analogue and towards digital. The CSS controls the railway’s security centrally from ProRail’s Data Centres. This activity is still carried out via signals along the track but moving to a digital solution will drastically improve the railway network maintainability and scalability. The system will be continuously improved during the implementation in order to continue to meet the changing market requirements and to take advantage of new possibilities.

ProRail selected Thales almost two years after the publication of the CSS tender. The CSS plays a central role in carrying out the objectives of ERTMS. Consequently, the new CSS will increase the safety and capacity of trains in order to accommodate future growth of freight and passenger transport. Travelling within Europe by train will also become a lot easier and therefore more attractive.

“Contributing to a safer world is at the heart of our business, we are proud that we are achieving safer and more sustainable train transport with our Central Safety System,” Gerben Edelijn, CEO for Thales Nederland, said. “Being a part of Thales, we are doing similar projects across Europe, and it is great to work together to build a European rail network for goods and passengers.”

“We are very happy and proud to become ProRail’s long term trusted partner by supporting them in the execution of their clear vision to build an efficient and more sustainable railway network,” Dr. Yves Joannic, Managing Director of Main Line Signalling for Thales, said. “All of that will be boosted by our advanced digital technology portfolio and highly experienced people.”","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9998462200164795}",positive,0.9998462200164795,1

The two companies will compete for each order of the $6.1 billion hybrid contract that will see the SINCGARS radios to align them with the National Security Agency crypto modernization requirements.

According to a US Army contract announcement, the effort is expected to be completed by March 2032.

SINCGARS has been in service for over three decades and has provided US soldiers with a secure method for voice and data communication.

The service announced the radio modernization contraction after releasing a request for information in 2020 to evaluate new radio solution or upgrades to SINCGARS. The RFI noted that upgrades to SINCGARS would have to include new frequency hopping capabilities and cryptographic enhancements for secure communications.

SINCGARS is integrated in ground and aviation platforms and the new waveform will include frequency hopping capabilities for use in mounted vehicle radios and the portable manpack radio to securely transmit data within contested environments.

The SINCGARS upgrade is part of the service’s efforts to get all of the radios within a tactical network to be “as effective as smartphones.” This is one of the Army’s six modernization priorities, along with long-range precision fires, next generation combat vehicle, future vertical lift, air and missile defense and soldier lethality.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9933207035064697}",neutral,0.9933207035064697,0

Officials of the Army Contracting Command at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Md., announced a potential total $6.1 billion contract Friday to Thales Defense and Security Inc. in Clarksburg, Md.; and to the L3Harris Technologies Inc. Integrated Communications Solutions segment in Rochester, N.Y., to modernize SINCGARS radios to align with U.S. National Security Agency crypto modernization requirements.

Thales and L3Harris will compete for orders over the next 10 years to modernize SINCGARS radios to align with the National Security Agency crypto modernization requirements.

SINCGARS is a combat networked radio for voice and data communications that comes in vehicle-mount, backpack, airborne, and handheld versions. Designed in the 1980s the radio uses rapid frequency hopping to maintain signals security.

These nearly-40-year-old military radios have grown long in the tooth, however, and military experts doubt their ability to operate effectively against powerful potential adversaries like Russia, China, and other industrialized nations without substantial upgrades.

That's where Thales and L3Harris come in. Thales and L3Harris will consider new-frequency hopping capabilities and cryptographic modernization that includes Tactical Secure Voice Cryptographic Interoperability Specification (TSVCIS) and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 256, experts say.

Of primary interest to the Army is upgrading the service’s single- and dual-mounted vehicle radios and personal radio manpack. Army leaders say they plan to use SINCGARS radios to support fires and air defense in contested environments where data capabilities are limited.

SINCGARS uses 25 kHz channels in the very high frequency (VHF) FM band, from 30 to 87.975 MHz. It offers single-frequency mode, as well as frequency hopping mode that hops 111 times a second.

By David Clarke, Sales Director, Thales in the UK

New technologies in the railway industry are directly influencing the passenger experience. In this blog, I discuss how I see railway stations adapting to provide a better, more tailored journey experience for passengers, as part of a broader shift towards the industry’s adoption of new tech.

In parts one and two of my blogs, which can be found under ‘posts’ on my LinkedIn activity, I talked about the role that information plays as part of a passenger journeys, as well as the changing behaviours that we are witnessing over recent years, in part due to the pandemic. The challenge, I feel, is how the industry can collaborate to better understand and adapt to this changing landscape. Beyond just adapting though, how can the industry get ahead of the change and establish Britain as a world leader in railways? For the purpose of this blog, I’m going to look at the challenge through the lens of stations and share some ideas for us all to consider.

Harnessing the data available

Exploring how to get the most out of the data that is available will be key to shaping the future of both railway stations and the passenger experience in my view. We’re all familiar with using apps such as Trainline to book our tickets and check the time of our train, but the potential to do more with data in such a way that can benefit both the passenger and the operator is substantial. For me, it’s about really understanding the full range of data that the industry has access to, such as the location of trains or the number of people buying tickets to travel from London to Manchester, and coming up with innovative uses for this information. I don’t think that any one organisation has all of the answers and, to this point, I think that collaboration between businesses, both small and large, has a key part to play in unlocking the advancements that are possible, at a pace that ensures any solutions are not outdated upon deployment.

Getting the right mix of people together to really understand the data is one part of the challenge, but ensuring that it is used in such a way that has a direct passenger or operator benefit is where the true value for the industry lies. The potential options for how the data could be harnessed are almost endless but I think that, ultimately, the priority almost always comes back to enhancing the passenger experience.

A more convenient passenger experience

For the past two years, we have all had excellent connectivity and been wedded to our devices due to the vast majority of us having worked from home. As much as I like the ten second commute from my bedroom to my study, I do believe that over the next two years we will see most of us go back to what we could be considered a more ‘normal’, pre-pandemic approach to working. Will we be in the office five days a week? Probably not, but I don’t think that we’ll be at home every day either.

With this in mind, we’re all going to be looking to undertake journeys that fit around our lives, whether travelling for work or leisure, and so convenience and connectivity are going to have a large roles to play in encouraging people back onto Britain’s railways.

I recently booked a train that required collecting a paper ticket from the station before my journey. That’s obviously not a deal breaker as to whether I would have taken the train that day, but it did mean allowing for an extra few minutes and it’s just one example of how technology can be making the lives of passengers more convenient. I don’t think that this means remove or switching off existing ways of doing things entirely, as people have different preferences on how they like to travel and engage with technology, but it does highlight the appeal of providing alternatives. By doing this, it embraces a level of connectivity and digital capability that we’ve all become more used to and there are many ways this approach can be applied to supporting the passenger.

Sometimes, delays to journeys happen. In instances such as this, it may be that passengers can be provided with alternative routes, but there’s also an opportunity to provide them with specific, useful and timely updates. This way, if they’re going to be stuck on a train or in a station, they know how long it will be for, when they can next expect to receive an update and can be freeing up mental space to focus on something else, rather than worrying about their journey. In my mind, this is just another example of how data and technology, used effectively, can be helping to further improve the experience of our railway stations. The data to make this happen is available but it will need the right team of people to put it to effective use.

A more tailored passenger experience

What the future of station comes down to for me, is understanding the individual passenger, as well as their habits and routines, and providing a range of options that cater to them. This way, you put the passenger in control of their journey and let them choose the experience that suits them best. You could apply this to booking different types of carriages, the types of tickets that people will be able to book going forwards and even giving them insight as to whether there’s time for them to visit their favourite café before the train departments from a particular platform. It all relies on data, understanding of the passenger and integrating solutions to better meet their needs. We can then be applying this knowhow to the passenger’s experience of passing through a station, not forgetting that this is often just part of a journey that can include multiple modes of transport.

Securing data from train to track

One final point that I want to share is the importance of safety and security when it comes travelling by rail. We can look at this in a number of ways, such as ensuring that trains don’t exceed a maximum speed or making sure that any data being transmitted by network operators can’t be tampered with. In the context of stations, you could also consider the scrum of people that are often present in some of our better-known stations at peak hours that will proceed to surge towards their specified platform when it appears on the board, before playing musical chairs when they do make it to their train. The experience can be stressful and, using existing technologies such as cctv, there are ways to manage it so that passengers can avoid this. By utilising the data and technologies that are already available, the experience of passing through a station can be improved and safety and security has to be core to this.

Hopefully this blog has given you some new ideas to consider, or at least reinforced any existing views that you may already have. As I said, I think that we need to work together to solve these challenges and would welcome conversations with anyone that feels they could add value by collaborating together. Feel free to message me on LinkedIn, otherwise the Thales team and I will also be at stand C65 at Railtex at London Olympia in May if you would like to come and say hello.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.8870841860771179}",neutral,0.8870841860771179,0

SES-26 is the third and final satellite the company has ordered from Thales Alenia based on their three-satellite contract. It will carry a reprogrammable communications payload capable of adapting to changing mission needs while in orbit. The satellite will provide Ku-band and C-band frequencies from 57 degrees East, the company said. SES-26 is set to replace the firm’s NSS-12 satellite launched in 2009.

The other two satellites under the contract are ASTRA 1Q, a software-defined satellite, and ASTRA 1P, a classic wide-beam spacecraft. Both are scheduled for launch in 2024 to 19.2 degrees East to replace four broadcast spacecraft.

SES will deploy a total of 14 satellites in the near future, of which seven already have their launch dates set. Five of these are GEO satellites in the C-band spectrum and nine are satellites for its medium Earth orbit O3b mPower constellation. SES-26 is expected to launch in 2024 or 2025.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999984502792358}",neutral,0.9999984502792358,0
MTG-I weather satellite passes tests in preparation for liftoff - Phys.org,"Wed, 23 Mar 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vcGh5cy5vcmcvbmV3cy8yMDIyLTAzLW10Zy1pLXdlYXRoZXItc2F0ZWxsaXRlLWxpZnRvZmYuaHRtbNIBQWh0dHBzOi8vcGh5cy5vcmcvbmV3cy8yMDIyLTAzLW10Zy1pLXdlYXRoZXItc2F0ZWxsaXRlLWxpZnRvZmYuYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In preparation for liftoff, the first Meteosat Third Generation Imager satellite has been put through its paces at Thales Alenia Space's facilities in Cannes, France. With over 400 accelerometer lines installed and checked out, and around two tonnes of simulated propellant loaded, the satellite was mounted onto the shaker and was shaken to 'within an inch of its life', simulating the rigours of launch.

With extreme weather events threatening to be more frequent and more severe as the climate crisis takes grip, it's never been more important to have fast and accurate forecasts. ESA and Eumetsat are working hard to ensure that there will be a constant stream of weather data from space for the next decades and that these data will arrive faster and be more accurate compared to what we have today. It is therefore fitting that on World Meteorological Day, ESA can be assured that the first of the next generation weather satellites, Meteosat Third Generation Imager, has passed a critical set of tests, paving the way for it to be launched in December.

Following on from the success of the first and second generation of Meteosat satellites, the Meteosat Third Generation (MTG) will soon take over the reins to ensure the continuity of data for weather forecasting, from geostationary orbit, for the next two decades.

This new generation of weather satellite will offer a significant enhancement of the current imager capabilities provided by the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG), a real-time lightning imaging capability and an all-new infrared sounding capability providing early detection of the development of severe storms.

The MTG mission comprises two types of satellite: four MTG-Imagers and two MTG-Sounders.

With the first MTG-I, MTG-I1, scheduled for launch at the end of the year, it's full steam ahead getting it ready for liftoff and its life in orbit 36,000 km above Earth.

Last November, the satellite was placed in the large thermal vacuum chamber at Thales Alenia Space's facilities in Cannes, France. Following initial checkout tests, it underwent a punishing five-week campaign during which, under hard vacuum conditions, it was exposed to the extreme of temperatures it will face in orbit.

MTG-I1 passed the tests with flying colors, with all modes of the satellite exercised faultlessly at both cold and hot operating plateaux. It also survived ""switch on"" from cold non-operating conditions.

Building on the long-standing partnership between ESA and Eumetsat, and the success of both the first generation of Meteosat missions and the subsequent Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) series, Meteosat Third Generation (MTG) is set to take over the reins of providing weather data from geostationary orbit. This third generation of weather satellites not only guarantees the continuity of data for weather forecasting from geostationary orbit for the next two decades, but also offers significant enhancement of the current capabilities. Credit: ESA/mlabspace

After removal from the chamber alignment tests confirmed that no detectable impact on instrument alignments had taken place and the satellite was then prepared for a suite of mechanical tests, which have now also been completed.

Paul Blythe, ESA's Meteosat Programme Manager, explained, ""With over 400 accelerometer lines installed and checked out, and around two tons of simulated propellant loaded, the satellite was mounted onto the shaker, again at the Thales' Cannes facilities, and was shaken to 'within an inch of its life' during the three-axes of Sine testing.

""Again thanks to the extensive development activities at module and equipment level, and the full qualification campaigns undertaken at unit and instrument level, there were few surprises for these tests and the satellite has completed the Sine campaign, confirming compatibility with the Ariane 5 launch environment.""

There is still another set of tests to go and these involve a ""fit and release"" check of the launcher clamp band and adapter, supported by Arianespace. Then follows acoustic testing, final alignment and reference performance test at the end of April.

The satellite will then be released for final functional checks, including the system validation testing with both ""launch and early orbit phase"" and routine mission control centers, Telespazio and Eumetsat respectively.

The final documentation set for the Qualification and Acceptance Review are under preparation. The consent to ship to Europe's Spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana, is planned for early October with launch targeted for mid-December.

Paul Blythe Programme Manager for the Meteosat Programme commented that, '""MTG has been a long and challenging development, but the success of these key environmental tests has demonstrated that the significant determination, commitment and skill at all levels of the MTG satellite consortium, which comprises over 100 subcontractors, is now converging in the world-class European product that MTG-I1 represents.""

MTG is a cooperation between ESA and Eumetsat. ESA is responsible for the definition and implementation of the MTG satellites and procurement of recurrent hardware, while Eumetsat is in charge of operating the spacecraft throughout its lifetime. The MTG satellites will replace the current Meteosat Second Generation operational system.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9991925358772278}",neutral,0.9991925358772278,0
"Europe's arms industry evades sanctions, to strengthen Russia - Robert Lansing Institute","Wed, 23 Mar 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vbGFuc2luZ2luc3RpdHV0ZS5vcmcvMjAyMi8wMy8yMy9ldXJvcGVzLWFybXMtaW5kdXN0cnktZXZhZGVzLXNhbmN0aW9ucy10by1zdHJlbmd0aGVuLXJ1c3NpYS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Some European countries circumvent the sanctions imposed on Russia, as practice shows. As a result, the sanctions do not bring the required result, with democracy losing an instrument to embarrass Moscow.

Having examined Russian military equipment destroyed in Ukraine it becomes apparent that some European countries have long ignored the sanctions on dual-use goods supplies to Russia, as they were installed on military equipment.

The Tigr armored vehicles and Pantsir missile systems had components by German Bosch. Bosch also supplied components for Russian infantry vehicles. German ZF Group, Danfoss and MANN + HUMMEL have also supplied components for Russian military equipment after 2014. With no direct supplies claimed by those companies to Russian defense industry, it is evident they made deliveries to Russia, not verifying the end user, at least.

Bosch details on Russian mil vehicles.

Experts claim, however, it is a well-organized scheme to supply dual-use goods, working around the sanctions, with intermediaries controlled by Russian military intelligence, as well as companies affiliated with State Corporation Rostec.

In 2003, for example, German 3W-Modellmotoren Weinhold GmbH supplied 3W-55i engines from a plant in Hanau, Hessen for Russian military UAV Orlan. It worked through Czech World Logistics Group, liquidated in 2018. That intermediary was headed by three Russians, associated with Russian intelligence.

France was also one of those who supplied military equipment to Russia, after the sanctions imposed in 2014. French Thales and Safran, where the state is majority shareholder, supplied thermal imaging cameras to Russia for T-90A tanks. They have also provided Russia with navigation systems for SU-30 and infrared detectors for MIG-29 fighter jets and KA-52 combat helicopters. From 2015 to 2020, direct delivery amounted to 152 million euros, not including possible delivery through intermediaries affiliated with Russian intelligence in third countries.

Russia used Cyclone-IR and Rayfast, registered in Cyprus, to buy components from European companies.

Thales alone supplied more than a thousand Catherine FC thermal imagers to Russia for Russian T-80, T-90, T-90S tanks, exported to Algeria, India, Turkmenistan and Uganda, and for BMR-3M demining armored vehicle. Fire control systems by Thompson CSF Optronique, a Thales subsidiary, also came to Russia.

The developments suggest that a “framework agreement” was probably concluded between Thales and Rosoboronexport, not specifying the quantity, with the French allowed to keep on selling systems and parts to Russia, formally complying with the sanctions ban.

NATO recognized the threat Russia poses to European security at the London summit of 2019. European defense companies, nevertheless, went on arming Moscow, disregarding their own defense. France is not ready for larger conflict, some MPs – Julien Aubert, Bernard Bouly, Claude de Hanet and Laurence Trastur-Isnard said.

The army warehouses have got munitions for just 4 days of intense fighting. The German army sees the same scenario. 3700 Strela MANPADs, to be given to Ukraine from warehouses, turned out unable to combat. In 2014, German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen admitted the German Air Force was facing serious challenges, but she did not expect an early solution to the Bundeswehr equipping issue.

She told the Bild am Sonntag that the Bundeswehr is unable to meet all NATO requirements over serious lack of equipment. Berlin did not meet its targets as for the number of aircraft, and could not provide NATO with the aircraft it promised within 180 days, in case of a crisis. As of 2014, 38 of 89 Tornado fighters and 24 of 56 Transall transport aircraft were able to accomplish combat missions.

But meanwhile, Germany actively exported dual-use goods to Russia, adding to its offensive capacity.

With risk high for military clash between Russia and NATO in the Baltic direction, the support by French and German manufacturers to Russian defense industry has already resulted in military imbalance and rose doubts whether Western Europe is able to repel an attack by Russians on any NATO member in Europe.

German and French industry, in fact, contributed to strengthening Russia’s capacity, avoiding the sanctions.

Some NATO members, as a result, made the Alliance more vulnerable by their policies, countering the sanctions, adding to Russia’s military capacity.

There are no signs today that destructive practices is grounding to a halt.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9992491602897644}",neutral,0.9992491602897644,0

LinkedIn

Thales in the UK has today announced Asthma + Lung UK, formerly known as Asthma UK and the British Lung Foundation, as its employee selected Charity of The Year with a partnership worth £200,000 over two years.

The partnership is essential in helping 12 million people in the UK who will develop a lung condition in their lifetime to improve their quality of life – funding 4,500 hours of vital research into the development of treatments for lung conditions such as Asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).

The increasing pressure on charities to implement direct care to those suffering is often met with roadblocks such as lack of funding and resources. Thales in the UK Charity of the Year partnership provides a helping hand to those who are under-funded, under-researched, and in need of support.

Thales in the UK network of charity champions will help co-ordinate fundraising across its local sites in the UK – who work at sites across England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales – and encourage employees to engage in ongoing events such as raffles, sporting activities, and quizzes. Of that raised, 60% of funds will be restricted to Asthma + Lung UK research projects and 40% will be used for other Asthma + Lung UK charity projects.

The charity will also be offering lung testing to employees at Thales in the UK sites, and hosting Lung & Learn workshops to offer regular information and health advice about various lung conditions to employees.

A decade long initiative

Thales in the UK employees have raised over £2 million in charitable partnerships through fundraising and training in life-saving skills over the last 10 years to help people with living diseases. Hundreds of charities competed to win the bid, but the personal and indirect effects of respiratory illnesses on Thales in the UK employees meant funding for Asthma + Lung UK would have a profound impact on the development and awareness of the charity.

Thales in the UK last partnership with The British Heart Foundation saw employees raise over £303,000 and help millions of people living with heart and circulatory diseases in the UK. In such unpredictable times, Thales’ charitable giving continues to fund lifesaving research and give those suffering a chance to get back on track.

Alex Cresswell, CEO of Thales in the UK, said: “Over the last decade, our employee chosen corporate charity partnership has made a real impact to research, development and lives across the UK and we are excited to start this next chapter with Asthma+Lung UK. Many of our employees have a close connection to the charity and are passionate about helping an underfunded area over the next two years. Through a series of fundraising events across our Thales sites in the UK, we will not only raise money, but also awareness of the hard work the charity does.”

Sarah Woolnough, CEO of Asthma + Lung UK, said: “We’re absolutely delighted to have been chosen as the charity of the year by everyone at the Thales Group. With their support through fundraising and donations, we will be able to kick start research funding into potentially life-saving treatments that will help people living with lung disease for generations to come. Research into lung conditions has been chronically underfunded for too long and the research funded through our partnership with Thales will help to give hope to the 1 in 5 people who will develop a lung condition in their lifetime. We’ll also be working closely with Thales’ employees over the next two years to help support them with information and advice about lung health, which will no doubt be of great direct benefit to the company’s thousands of employees and their loved ones.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9996280670166016}",neutral,0.9996280670166016,0

The contract will run for up to 37 years and is worth up to €420m. It was awarded following an open tender and is subject to a 20-day holding period during which Siemens, which was unsuccessful after progressing to the final stage of the two-year long tender process, is able to appeal the award. ProRail says Thales’ bid offered the best value for money.

The contract covers the rollout of ETCS software, which will operate alongside GSM-R, as well as the Radio Block Centre, and will be developed by Thales to meet the Eulynx specifications.

In December ProRail awarded Thales a contract to deliver the GAST-ERTMS axle counter system for around 600km of railway by 2032. The €100m contract includes 25 years’ maintenance.

Four lines in the Netherlands are already equipped with ETCS: the HSL-South high-speed line; the Betuweroute freight line between the port of Rotterdam and the German border near Emmerich; the Hanze line between Lelystad and Zwolle; and Amsterdam Bijlmer - Utrecht line which is equipped with both ETCS and the legacy Dutch signalling system.

Pod cast - Arabian Aerospace,"Mon, 07 Mar 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOGh0dHA6Ly93d3cudGltZXNhZXJvc3BhY2UuYWVyby9mZWF0dXJlcy9kZWZlbmNlL3BvZC1jYXN00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales is energetically promoting its latest Talios targeting pod, taking aim at a number of MENA air forces, though the company is coy about identifying its customers and sales prospects.

Thales and its predecessor companies (the most recent of which was Thomson-CSF, established in 1968) have produced a succession of targeting pods, including the automatic tracking and laser integration system (ATLIS) used on the Jaguar, Mirage F1 and Mirage 2000, and on some Pakistani F-16 aircraft.

ATLIS was a daylight/clear-weather system, and was replaced by the pod de désignation laser caméra thermique (PDLCT) or thermal camera laser designation pod used on the Mirage 2000D, and eventually by the Damocles pod, which introduced a forward-looking infrared (FLIR) sensor.

Thales co-developed the Damocles pod for the UAE Air Force’s Mirage 2000-9, under the name Shehab. The UAE had been asking France to fund the co-development of an upgraded targeting pod and used the threat of buying the Lockheed Martin Sniper as an incentive!

Damocles featured a long-range laser designator, an integrated navigation FLIR and had a high-resolution reconnaissance capability, transmitting imagery to ground stations in real time. It compared relatively poorly with the contemporary Rafael/Northrop Grumman Litening 3, but scored some export successes with air forces who felt unable to procure the Israeli-designed Litening.

The pod was supplied to the UAE, for carriage by the Mirage 2000-9; Malaysia, for use on the Sukhoi Su-30MKM; Morocco for the Mirage F1CM/EM-VI; and Saudi Arabia, for the Tornado and Typhoon.

After comparative trials between Damocles and the Ural Optical and Mechanical Plant (UOMZ)-produced Sapsan and Solux targeting pods, Russia decided that it would license-produce the Thales Damocles reconnaissance and target designation pod for the Sukhoi Su-24M2, Su-34, Su-27SM and Su-27SM2 attack aircraft.

Thales announced the development of a new Damocles XF variant in 2009, with a refined infrared sensor and a new daylight charge-coupled device (CCD) camera. But development of the XF was subsequently dropped in 2013, in favour of a new pod de désignation laser nouvelle génération (PDL NG) or new generation laser designation pod.

This had a much larger infrared sensor, a TV channel for daylight operation and small target identification, and improved geolocalization using GPS and the aircraft’s internal navigation system.

The PDL NG subsequently became the targeting long-range identification optronic system (Talios).

The pod was flight-tested for the first time on April 28 2016, and Talios was qualified by the French DGA defence procurement agency in 2018 for use on the Dassault Rafale and Mirage 2000D.

The pod entered service on the Aeronavale Rafale M at the beginning of 2020.

The new pod was declared operational on the Rafale F3-Rs of the Armée de l’Air on October 29 2020, and was combat-proven in the Middle East in November 2020.

Thales said that two pods at a ‘forward operating location’ have each amassed 1,000 flying hours, without requiring any maintenance.

Some 20 pods were ordered initially, of a requirement for 45, but these numbers have increased, and 60 pods are now on order, with 30 having been delivered.

Thales said that it has four customers for Talios, though not all of these have taken delivery yet. Apart from the French forces, the pod is known to be in service with Egypt, but other potential operators have selected the Lockheed Sniper, including Qatar and the UAE.

Talios combines targeting and tactical recce capabilities in a single pod. It delivers unmatched image quality, including colour imagery, and uses disruptive capabilities to provide reliable situational awareness in real time.

The pod incorporates a new multi-criteria tracker and has powerful non-traditional information, surveillance and reconnaissance (NTISR) capabilities.

The embedded TrUE AI artificial intelligence system uses a database of some two million reference images to ensure rapid target identification, and is claimed to be 300 times faster at target detection and recognition than a human operator.

A roadmap is already in place for development of Talios, with expanded reconnaissance capabilities, Permanent Vision™ and improved colour pending.

Talios promises to provide greater situational awareness on the connected battlefield, just as operating terrain gets more complex, missions become more diverse, and the quantity of information gathered increases.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999974966049194}",neutral,0.9999974966049194,0
Thales Shows Air Defence Starstreak and Tank Killer NLAW - Asian Military Review,"Thu, 31 Mar 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFzaWFubWlsaXRhcnlyZXZpZXcuY29tLzIwMjIvMDMvdGhhbGVzLXNob3dzLWFpci1kZWZlbmNlLXN0YXJzdHJlYWstYW5kLXRhbmsta2lsbGVyLW5sYXcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales came to DSA with a strong operator endorsement for its Next-generation Light Anti-tank Weapon (NLAW).

The UK government has gifted over 3,600 of them to the Ukrainian armed forces to help with the resistance against the Russian invasion. Their soldiers have destroyed multiple Russian tanks and AFVs with them.

In addition, Thales is the maker of the Starstreak air defence missile, which is also about to be deployed in Ukraine. The British Army has mounted an accelerated training programme in eastern Europe for the Ukrainian Army, which will receive a large quantity of the missile.

Both weapons are manufactured in Belfast, Northern Ireland. The shoulder-fired NLAW was designed by Saab, and licensed to Thales for production. It weighs 27.5 pounds (12.5 kilograms) and has a range of some 2,600 feet (800 metres). About 14,000 have been made for the British Army.

The Starstreak is the latest in a long line of short-range air defence (SHORAD) missiles from Belfast. Unlike most SHORADs, which employ infrared guidance that can be countered or decoyed, it is a twin laser beam-rider that closes to the target at up to Mach 3. It is aimed by an optical sight. The ‘kill’ is made by three tungsten darts or ‘hittiles’ that separate from the body of the weapon as it closes on the target. Range is over three miles and maximum height over 3,000t (914m).

The Malaysian Army was an early customer for the Starstreak, which it named locally as the Rapid Ranger. At DSA, Thales’ Malaysian partner Westar showed a 4×4 vehicle with the launcher mounted on top. Malaysia also bought the portable-stand Lightweight Multiple Launcher (LML). The missile can also be shoulder-fired. Only last week, the Malaysian army conducted another successful firing trial, shooting down target drones on its range in Johor.

The secretary said an “in-principal” decision has been made to send the Thales system after a request from Ukraine, adding that the system remains within the definition of a “defensive” weapon.

‘Defensive’ System

“It is vital… that Ukraine maintains its ability to fly and suppress Russian air attack,” Reuters quoted Wallace as saying at the Parliament.

“We believe that this system will remain within the definition of defensive weapons but will allow the Ukrainian force to better defend their skies.

“We shall also be increasing the supplies of rations, medical equipment, and other non-lethal military aid.”

3,615 Anti-Tank Systems Delivered

If approved, the Starstreak will be a step up on the “defensive weapons” the island nation has delivered to Ukraine so far, including 3,615 anti-tank NLAW (Next generation Light Anti-tank Weapon) systems.

The Starstreak missile flies at three times the speed of sound and can strike aircraft at over 7 kilometers (4.35 miles). The 14 kilograms (31 pounds) system can be shoulder-fired or mounted on land, sea, and air platforms.

Javelins on the Way

The UK will also send another batch of anti-tank weapons, including a “small consignment” of Javelin anti-tank missile systems, Sky News quoted Wallace as saying in parliament.

The Thales shoulder-fired weapon has a range of up to 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) against the 800 meters (2,625 feet) of the Saab NLAW. At 24.3 kilograms (53.6 pounds), however, the Javelin is almost twice as heavy as the Saab weapon.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9995367527008057}",neutral,0.9995367527008057,0

According to the US Department of Defense, the communication equipment will be configured to comply with National Security Agency cryptosecurity modernization requirements.

SINCGARS is a new set of combat net radios that provides primary command and control for infantry, armored, and artillery units.

It can transmit and receive voice and tactical data and record traffic messages while adhering to NATO interoperability requirements.

The communication system can be operated in a hostile environment with electronic counter-countermeasure technology. It is also designed to survive in a nuclear environment.

Work for the multibillion-dollar contract is expected to be complete by March 2032.

Prioritizing Communication Systems

The investment is part of a US Army effort to bolster its communication systems amid evolving battlefield scenarios.

Last month, the service tested its new mobile communications gear designed to improve the operational capabilities of armored units.

The equipment will reportedly address the “slow and clunky” communication between military units in the field and their command posts, making them more effective against adversaries.

The US Air Force has also contracted Space Micro to produce a laser communications pod, allowing secure communications between aircraft and orbital satellites.

The pod must be able to sit underneath a fighter aircraft and transmit up to 10 gigabits of data per second to allow US stealth aircraft to maintain secure high-bandwidth communications during combat operations.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.8803317546844482}",neutral,0.8803317546844482,0

Babcock International, Thales UK and PGZ MIECZNIK consortium announced the signing of a strategic cooperation through press releases. The Arrowhead 140 has been selected as the platform design for Poland’s MIECZNIK new frigate programme

MIECZNIK program

The Polish Armaments Agency selected Babcock’s Arrowhead 140 (AH140) from three different platform design proposals provided by the PGZ-MIECZNIK Consortium including Navantia, TKMS and Babcock. These proposals were originally down selected in July 2021.

The cooperation plans the three AH140 frigates will be built in Polish shipyards by a local workforce, drawing significantly from Polish suppliers and Babcock’s global supply chain.

Babcock press release stressed that “following the successful completion of the design phase, Babcock will support the MIECZNIK frigate build in Poland through a design licensing agreement, transferring knowledge and technologies to optimise Poland’s shipbuilding and industrial capabilities.“

“I’m delighted that Babcock has been selected as a platform design provider and technology partner for Poland, and that our Arrowhead 140 frigate has been chosen for Poland’s MIECZNIK programme. Its adaptability and capability mean we can tailor the design to suit the needs of the Polish Navy. Driven by innovation and backed by heritage, the Arrowhead 140 frigate has British ingenuity and engineering at its core.” David Lockwood, Babcock CEO

“Poland is one of our oldest and closest allies, and we continue to strengthen our partnership to help deter future threats. “The Arrowhead 140 frigate will be a formidable addition to Poland’s fleet, providing world-leading capabilities to Poland’s growing naval presence.” UK Minister for Defence Procurement, Jeremy Quin

Thales UK will supply the TACTICOS combat management system the company has announced. The company highlights that they’ll use their experience of Type 31 frigates construction “into good use to reduce risk and ease the path to vessel acceptance.” The vessel will be fitted with MBDA missiles.

Naval News comments

The system was developed by a team consisting of defence technology firm Thales UK, European intergovernmental organisation OCCAR, and the UK Ministry of Defence (MOD) through its Defence Equipment and Support procurement arm as part of the joint UK-French Maritime Mine Counter-Measures (MMCM) program.

The MMCM system includes a 12-metre-long unmanned surface vessel (USV) that is fitted with autonomous navigation sensors such as a Simrad radar and an obstacle detection and avoidance sonar. The other key components of the system are a towed synthetic aperture sonar and a portable command and control (C2) centre that will allow the USV to be monitored and operated by human crews from the relative safety of a mothership or a shore station. Local unmanned vessel manufacturer L3Harris supplied the custom-designed USV while other partners on the project include BAE Systems, Saab, and Wood and Douglas.

Live data and images are streamed from the USV and its various sensors to the C2 centre, which can be many kilometres distant. When a mine is located, the USV can be equipped to deploy a remotely operated vehicle (ROV), which is used to neutralise the threat through assured and accredited communications channels.

Unlike traditional systems on dedicated minehunting and minesweeping ships, the Thales solution is designed to be transported via container and rapidly deployed anywhere in the world. Once additional examples are available, these can also be used in multiples and in concert with allied forces to ensure more comprehensive mine countermeasures (MCM) coverage compared to traditional manned vessels.

The entire system is now undergoing rigorous capability development trials prior to being cleared for operational deployment, which navy officials expect will be before the end of 2022. A similar demonstrator prototype USV was recently delivered by Thales and OCCAR to the French Navy and is also undergoing testing before formally joining the fleet.

The Royal Navy intends to deploy the new Thales-developed system alongside its other unmanned MCM systems to ultimately replace the aging Sandown-class and Hunt-class minesweepers, which were built between the late 1970s and late 1990s and are now nearing the end of their operational service lives. Thales, meanwhile, expects that the technology can be migrated to other fields such as unmanned anti-submarine warfare, fisheries protection, coastal surveillance, and anti-smuggling operations.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999896287918091}",neutral,0.9999896287918091,0

The French Defence Ministry denies that France violated sanctions imposed by the European Union by continuing to sell military equipment to Moscow after it annexed Crimea in 2014.

A picture taken on June 17, 2020, shows the entrance of the French multinational Thales plant, specialised in defense and electrical systems, in Toulouse, southwestern France.

Investigative journalism NGO Disclose reported on 14 March that the French government approved around 152 million euros of military gear for export since 2015, citing both ""top secret"" documents and public sources.

Most of the equipment consisted of ""thermal cameras to equip more than 1,000 Russian tanks,"" but also included ""navigation systems and infrared sensors for fighter planes and helicopters"" manufactured by Thales and Safran, companies whose largest shareholder is the French state, according to Disclose.

It also claimed that tanks and aircraft of the types involved had been used in Russia's invasion of Ukraine since February 24.

Six months after Moscow annexed Crimea in February 2014, the European Union imposed arms sanctions.

France went so far as to cancel delivery of two Mistral helicopter carrier ships.

But successive governments ""made the most of a chink in the European embargo: it isn't retroactive,"" Disclose charged.

'Grandfather' clause

""France complies strictly with its international engagements as concerns exports of military equipment,"" defence ministry spokesman Hervé Grandjean responded in an elaborate Twitter thread.

Nevertheless, the so-called ""grandfather"" clause meant that ""a contract signed before the annexation of Crimea can run its course...this possibility is clearly provided for in the sanctions regime,"" he added.

""No new contracts have been made with Russia since 2014. No deliveries have been made to Russia since the beginning of the war in Ukraine.""

But Disclose points out that this still meant that France continued to fulfill its arms-related contract obligations after 2014, even if deliveries were stopped before the Russian invastion into Ukraine.

In 2019, Disclose won the Visa d’or for Best Digital News for its investigation ""Made In France"", on France’s role in selling arms used in Yemen’s civil war.

Littoral Combat Ship Still in Troubled Waters - Asian Military Review,"Thu, 31 Mar 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFzaWFubWlsaXRhcnlyZXZpZXcuY29tLzIwMjIvMDMvbGl0dG9yYWwtY29tYmF0LXNoaXAtc3RpbGwtaW4tdHJvdWJsZWQtd2F0ZXJzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The saga of Malaysia’s troubled Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) continues. Prime contractor Bousted Heavy Industries Corporation (BHIC) was a notable absentee from DSA 2022 – the only significant Malaysian defence company that did not exhibit. The LCS project is mired in technical difficulties, cost overruns, delays and corruption.

Designed as a multi-mission ship to replace the Royal Malaysian Navy’s (RMN’s) older frigates and corvettes, the first LCS was due for delivery in 2019. Bousted won the $2.2 billion contract five years earlier. But although the first ship was launched in August 2017, it has still not been delivered. Four more are part-built. Having previously threatened to cancel the project, or to provide any more funding, the government is currently reviewing a ‘recovery plan’.

The LCS displaces 3,100 tons and features a number of weapons systems. They include 30mm and 57mm guns, Kongsberg Naval Strike Missiles (NSMs), MBDA Mica SAMs, and torpedo launchers. Kelvin Hughes, Rheinmetall and Thales provide the sensors. It seems that there have been various integration problems, not helped by the multitude of subcontractors involved.

Moreover, last January the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) arrested two senior executives involved in the project. A source in MACC told local media that the pair were suspected of receiving bribes through payments to three companies abroad. Their names, and the companies, were not specified. Bousted did not respond to a request for comment.

Abu Dhabi's Sanad signs deal with Thales to develop aviation services - The National,"Mon, 14 Mar 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVuYXRpb25hbG5ld3MuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2F2aWF0aW9uLzIwMjIvMDMvMTQvYWJ1LWRoYWJpcy1zYW5hZC1zaWducy1kZWFsLXdpdGgtdGhhbGVzLXRvLWRldmVsb3AtYXZpYXRpb24tc2VydmljZXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Mubadala Investment Company's Sanad Group signed a preliminary agreement with Thales on Monday to develop industrial services for airport security, air traffic and avionics systems as it seeks to further diversify its operations.

Under the agreement, the companies will exchange knowledge and work together on regional and international projects, Sanad said.

Sanad will provide industrial systems while Thales will head the design-and-build aspect of the projects.

“Through this new agreement, Sanad seeks to build national competencies and excellence in these sectors, localising the most advanced technologies and promoting the transfer of knowledge through partnerships with major international companies leading in these sectors,” said Mansoor Janahi, group chief executive of Sanad.

Sanad, which currently provides financing, leasing and maintenance services to the global aerospace, energy and industrial sectors, said earlier this year that it aims to expand operations to other verticals.

The Abu Dhabi company said it will focus on providing technology-driven and integrated industrial services as it pivots to new sectors that are in line with the UAE's industrial sector growth strategy, Operation 300bn.

The UAE aims to localise manufacturing, reduce its reliance on imports of industrial inputs and cut its dependence on global supply chains amid the Covid-19 pandemic that has disrupted world trade since 2020.

Operation 300bn, which is part of the country's diversification strategy, seeks to double the manufacturing sector's contribution to the economy by 2031.

“As we look to build a future that we can all trust, it is innovation and knowledge exchange that play a vital role in promoting sustainable growth and creating industries with a competitive advantage at a global stage,” said Bernard Roux, chief executive of Thales in the UAE.

The latest partnership with Thales “also confirms Sanad’s ability to implement its new strategy”, said Mr Janahi, who was promoted to his current position in February to lead the new growth strategy of the company.

Sanad was formed in November 2019 after Mubadala merged three of its units — Sanad Aerotech, Sanad Powertech and Sanad Capital. Two of these are maintenance, repair and overhaul providers while the third is an aircraft leasing and financing company.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9847550988197327}",neutral,0.9847550988197327,0

The contract includes the upgrade of 42 machines for France [with the possibility of adding another 25 helicopters] and 18 for Spain. In addition, the contract provides for the possibility of Germany later joining the Tiger MkIII program.

The first flight of the first prototype is planned for 2025. The first delivery to the French Directorate General of Armaments [DGA] will take place at the end of 2029, followed by the first delivery to Spain in 2030. Development and upgrade work will take place at Airbus Helicopters factories in Albacete [Spain], Marignane [France] and Donauwörth [Germany] carried out.

Comprehensive upgrade

The Tiger MkIII is a major upgrade of the European attack helicopter’s systems. The new standard enables the platform to be connected to the digital battlefield to enable cooperation with manned and unmanned systems and exchange tactical information in real-time.

The standard configuration of the Tiger MkIII includes the integration of Safran Strix NG sighting device, Thales FlytX avionics suite, Topowl DD helmet visor, an Indra IFF upgrade, Thales GNSS, and Safran’s inertial navigation system. The communications equipment will be upgraded with Thales Contact/Synaps radio and data links for collaboration between manned and unmanned aircraft.

Link16 and SATCOM functions will also be installed for Spain. The Spanish Tiger MkIII will be equipped with an Indra battlefield management system and countermeasures, while the French Tiger MkIII will be equipped with an ATOS battlefield management system and Thales countermeasures.

The new weapons package for France includes the MBDA MAST-F [Future Tactical Air-to-Surface Missile] and the Mistral 3 air-to-air missile. For Spain, new capabilities include 70mm guided missiles and a new air-to-surface guided missile.

“The Tiger MkIII program will be a European response to the need for a state-of-the-art attack helicopter for decades to come. With this upgrade, the Tiger remains an indispensable and modern tool for European armies and strengthens defense cooperation in Europe,” said Bruno Even, CEO of Airbus Helicopters.

German skepticism

The Ministry of Defense in Berlin wrote about the Tiger MkIII in December 2021: “Further German participation in the Tiger MkIII project will be assessed holistically, taking into account the associated risks and affordability. The main parameters are the total costs, the fulfillment of technical requirements and the availability of the KH in the course of the conversion, and also the point in time at which the conversion measures are to be completed. A final decision will be made in the 20th legislative period – at the earliest in mid-2022 – in particular, taking into account the financial framework conditions than available”.

The army’s dissatisfaction with the Tiger remains a problem: “The material operational readiness and the available flight hours of the Tiger are stagnating at an insufficient level. The measures taken to improve the operational readiness, the standardization of the construction status, the measures to reduce the maintenance intensity as well as the initiated Measures to strengthen the aircraft technical capacities in the troops and in particular also in the system-supporting industry will only have an effect in the medium to long term… To maintain the operational value of the KH TIGER weapon system, work must already be carried out on further technical development, in particular, to proactively eliminate obsolescence, to keep the core functionalities state-of-the-art and thus to meet the requirements of modern deployment scenarios in peacekeeping operations, but also in the context of national and alliance defense”.

Who is undermining Hawkei? - Australian Defence Magazine,"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1c3RyYWxpYW5kZWZlbmNlLmNvbS5hdS9kZWZlbmNlL2xhbmQvd2hvLWlzLXVuZGVybWluaW5nLWhhd2tladIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Braking issues affecting the Thales Hawkei vehicles being manufactured for Army resurfaced in the ABC last week, revealing inconsistencies in Defence public statements that suggest someone may be trying to undermine the program.

The 04 March story revisited news that Defence stopped accepting delivery of the vehicles in December 2020 - just three months after the start of full rate production - due to 'concerns about their brakes'. The Department provided the same statement to ADM on the same day the ABC story appeared.

However, in July 2021 – seven months after Defence says it stopped accepting delivery of the vehicles - Minister for Defence Peter Dutton and Minister for Defence Industry Melissa Price announced the Hawkei had resolved the braking problem and achieved Initial Operating Capability (IOC).

So why is Defence now re-raising an issue that was apparently resolved eight months ago?

Timeline

Full rate production of the Hawkei began in September 2020. According to the ANAO's Major Projects Report, a Hawkei 'was involved in a safety incident involving brake functionality' on 23 November 2020. Defence temporarily suspended use of the fleet two days later, and in December 2020, began rejecting vehicle deliveries.

The ANAO report then says Thales Australia developed a software fix that was incorporated into the Hawkei's vehicle control system and administrative controls were put in place to prevent the issue from occurring until the software fix was implemented across the fleet, with a deadline of June 2022.

The report subsequently concluded that the brakes were 'no longer a major issue': ""With administrative controls in place, operating restrictions have been eased, enabling Hawkei rollout and vehicle acceptance to recommence.""

Initial Operating Capability was reached on 20 May 2021, and in July 2021 Minister Dutton and Minister Price announced the braking issue was resolved in a press release that is still available online at the time of writing.

""Defence and Thales Australia have resolved a braking issue identified in late 2020, with a technical solution being rolled out across the Hawkei fleet,"" the Ministers stated. ""With appropriate controls in place, Defence has lifted the Hawkei’s operating restrictions, enabling the recommencement of full-rate production and rollout of the capability.""

In 2022, delivered Hawkei vehicles appeared in promotional media released by Defence to celebrate the re-raising of the 10th Light Horse and in official social media posts from recent flood relief efforts in Queensland.

Then all of a sudden, the issue resurfaced in the ABC on 04 March, and in its statement provided to ADM on the same afternoon Defence said: ""Army will not accept these vehicles into service until the vehicles are safe to operate. Defence and Thales have agreed to a brake remediation plan, and Thales are currently working to uplift the remaining vehicles to the agreed contracted standard. The vehicles remaining at the Thales facility in Bendigo will not be delivered to Army units until this work is completed.""

A Thales spokesperson said: ""Our focus is on getting this advanced capability into the hands of Army units as quickly as possible. Several hundred Hawkei vehicles have already been delivered to the Army, and the Hawkei is now being used safely by Army units around the country.""

Thales was unable to respond to further questions due to contractual arrangements with Defence. ADM understands the company has manufactured 979 Hawkei vehicles. Defence has reportedly agreed to pay Thales for 674 vehicles and expects the vehicles to be ready for acceptance by June 2023.

Who is undermining Hawkei?

So why has the braking issue resurfaced now when it was 'resolved' in July 2021?

Even though Thales' software rollout may be on-going until June this year, according to the ANAO, the administrative controls put in place over a year ago should have put the issue to bed (as Minister Dutton and Minister Price themselves stated in July 2021).

It's worth noting that similar negative headlines have appeared about particular platforms ahead of major changes. Examples include the Tiger Armed Reconnaissance Helicopters (since replaced by Boeing Apaches); the MRH-90 Taipan helicopters (since replaced by Sikorsky Black Hawks); and most famously the Attack class submarines. More on this will be available in the upcoming May print edition of ADM.

In addition, ADM understands that Defence statements provided to the media must be cleared through the Minister for Defence's office, and that contractual requirements usually prevent companies from speaking to the media without prior Defence approval. In theory, this arrangement would make it easy for blame to fall on industry for program delays, seeing as industry cannot respond.

With that in mind, ADM sent further questions to Defence to ask if there is an intent to modify or delay Hawkei's route to Final Operational Capability (FOC) prior to the federal election.

Defence had not responded to those questions by deadline.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.8741371035575867}",neutral,0.8741371035575867,0

StrikeMaster: a Bushmaster variant with a big bite | The Strategist - The Strategist,"Mon, 07 Mar 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFzcGlzdHJhdGVnaXN0Lm9yZy5hdS9zdHJpa2VtYXN0ZXItYS1idXNobWFzdGVyLXZhcmlhbnQtd2l0aC1hLWJpZy1iaXRlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"As Australia’s defensive focus switches to development of mobile missile systems to discourage any potential attacker, the highly successful Australian-designed and -built Bushmaster armoured troop carrier may be born again with a powerful set of new teeth.

A concept is being put together for a Bushmaster variant carrying a launcher for a pair of anti-ship missiles with a range of over 250 kilometres. The missile can also be used effectively to attack targets on land.

If the concept is accepted by the Australian Defence Force, the StrikeMaster will be built on the existing ‘ute’ design using the latest Bushmaster technology, with front doors as in variants sold recently to the Netherlands and tougher axles as in those sold to New Zealand.

The vehicle would be provided by its manufacturer, Thales Australia, and the naval strike missile launcher from Kongsberg Defence Australia for the Australian Army’s deployable land-based anti-ship system (Project Land 4100, Phase 2).

The missile is already in operational use in Malaysia, Norway, Poland and the US Navy and US Marine Corps, and is being delivered to Germany, Romania and Canada.

The system is versatile, with the US Marine Corps using a twin launcher on an unmanned joint light tactical vehicle and Poland using four missiles in a ‘quad pack’ carried on a large truck.

The missile can fly over land and sea at a low level, making it highly effective in both the littoral and blue-water environments.

It is designated as ‘totally passive’ in that it uses an advanced imaging infrared seeker to search for, detect and automatically recognise enemy vessels down to specific ship classes.

The missile is also in contention for fitting to the Royal Australian Navy’s major surface combatants under Project Sea 1300 and is suitable for its offshore patrol vessels. A helicopter version could also be carried on the navy’s MH-60R Seahawks.

The launcher can operate independently if needed or as part of a broader strike missile coastal defence system with integrated fire control and sensors.

The StrikeMaster could be transported on the Royal Australian Air Force’s transport aircraft and on small landing craft, making it highly deployable. That is a core requirement for the US Marine Corps’ operational concept of ‘island hopping’ launchers as part of its anti-access/area-denial activities.

The launcher and vehicle would be made in Australia—the Bushmaster by Thales Australia and its local supply chain, and the launcher by Kongsberg Defence Australia and its local supply chain.

The companies say the launcher system could be operational in two to three years.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999860525131226}",neutral,0.9999860525131226,0

The system with thermal imaging device and high-resolution daylight color camera enables targets to be identified in the range of up to four kilometres, depending on their size. In continuous operation, the entire hemisphere around the vehicle can be covered. A laser rangefinder offers measuring distances of up to ten kilometres. It can also be raised above the vehicle roof to allow the monitoring of targets from behind a ridgeline without putting the user in a direct line of sight, which greatly reduces operational risk.

An Automatic Video Tracking (AVT) and Assisted Target Detection (ATD) is also included in the JFST PAAG system. Combined with an artillery command and control system PAAG will contribute significantly to the capability being fielded.

The BOXER Programme, managed by the European armament’s agency OCCAr, provides the German, Netherland, Lithuanian and UK armies, with a new generation of all terrain armoured utility vehicles on the basis of balanced capabilities of transport capacity, mobility, protection, survivability, growth potential and efficient life cycle costs.

The JFST programme in Germany will see the delivery of two prototype JFST-heavy vehicles based on the BOXER 8x8 Armoured Vehicle coupled with a new JFST Mission Module integrating Thales PAAG.

The BOXER is an 8x8 all-terrain heavily armoured utility vehicle with a unique modular concept of a common drive module and an exchangeable mission module, making it a flexible military vehicle, thus ensuring maximum strategic and tactical mobility in a wide range of operational scenarios.

Oliver Dörre, CEO and Country Director Thales in Germany, said: ""We are delighted that the German Armed Forces and our long-standing partner Krauss-Maffei Wegmann have chosen the most advanced optronics from Thales for its BOXER JFST. This means that the German Armed Forces are now one of the 50 armies worldwide that rely on our trusted solutions for their vehicle optronic.""","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9980584979057312}",neutral,0.9980584979057312,0

The Thales system also makes it easier for controllers to handle fluctuations in traffic volume, changing weather, and all types of situations that can influence air traffic control decisions at any time, Thales said in a statement.

“With the ongoing series of strategic expansions and development projects through the DAEP, Dubai International Airport is exponentially growing its passengers and cargo handling capacity, number of plane movements and the network of connected destinations” said Suzanne AlEnany, chief executive of DAEP. .
