"Mastercard, Thales boost digital ID in Australia - SecureIDNews","Thu, 19 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlY3VyZWlkbmV3cy5jb20vbmV3cy1pdGVtL21hc3RlcmNhcmQtdGhhbGVzLWJvb3N0LWRpZ2l0YWwtaWQtaW4tYXVzdHJhbGlhL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Mastercard, Thales boost digital ID in Australia

As more countries move to adopt digital ID programs, such efforts are attracting the interest of other players in the larger identification ecosystem. Australia provides a fresh example of that, with Mastercard and Thales each taking steps to become more prominent digital ID players there.

The payment card network reportedly has launched a digital ID pilot program in Australia with “with the aim of developing a new system to verify a person’s identity immediately, safely and securely in both the digital and the physical world,” according to a recent report from CMO.au. “The pilot program will test a new way for people to prove their identity without having to carry multiple documents; instead, using owner data at the heart of the system.”

The first part of the pilot included student volunteers from Deakin University testing an identity verification process for student registration and digital exams at the Burwood and Geelong campuses in Victoria

The general idea of the program involves not only the data that resides on a person’s smartphone or other mobile device, but also uses information from that person’s financial accounts or other sources to bypass the need for what the report called a “centralized identity database.”

The first part of the pilot included student volunteers from Deakin University “testing an identity verification process for student registration and digital exams at the Burwood and Geelong campuses in Victoria,” the report says.

As Mastercard gears up to further test its own digital ID capabilities in Australia, other news has also recently emerged that France-based Thales has won a contract from Queensland to help craft and deploy that state’s mobile driver’s license program.

“In addition to digital driver licenses, Thales said the smartphone app will be designed to host a range of other digitized official documents including photo ID cards, marine licenses, vehicle registration, as well as provide access to the Department of Transport and Main Roads’ online services,” according to the report, from ZDNet. The app will also include technology from Thales-owned Gemalto — specifically, its Digital ID Platform and Wallet technology.

Last year, Australia’s nationwide digital identity program took a significant step forward when The Australia Post, the country’s postal service, according to a report, become a “trusted provider of a digital proof-of-identity service under the framework administered by the federal Digital Transformation Agency, two years after introducing its Digital iD service.”

The digital ID offering from Australia Post was launched in 2017, but it only recently “became the second digital identity service provider to receive the trust-mark this week, with the Digital ID system joining the Commonwealth’s own myGovID product, which is in a trial phase.” Not only that, but Australia Post reported it is the first organization this is not wholly within government to receive that mark from the Digital Transformation Agency. Australia Post is proposing a solution that puts the user in control of their identity and attributes.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999186992645264}",neutral,0.9999186992645264,0
Len Industri & Thales to Modernise Indonesian Frigate KRI Usman-Harun - Naval News,"Tue, 10 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdmFsbmV3cy5jb20vbmF2YWwtbmV3cy8yMDIwLzAzL2xlbi1pbmR1c3RyaS10aGFsZXMtdG8tbW9kZXJuaXNlLWluZG9uZXNpYW4tZnJpZ2F0ZS1rcmktdXNtYW4taGFydW4v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Len Industri & Thales to Modernise Indonesian Frigate KRI Usman-Harun On 10 March in Jakarta, Len Industri and Thales signed a contract for the complete modernisation of the Indonesian Navy (TNI AL) KRI Usman-Harun multi-role light frigate’s mission system, witnessed by King Willem Alexander of the Netherlands and Minister of Trade Agus Suparmanto.

Thales press release

Thales has been a leading partner of the Indonesian Navy for the last forty years, as the appointed supplier of combat systems for all warships in service. In addition, Thales has a long-standing relationship with Len Industri, who is the systems integrator for the KRI Usman-Harun’s Mid Life Modernisation (MLM) programme.

The KRI Usman-Harun frigate has more than 15 years of service under its belt. Building on the long collaboration Thales has with the Indonesian Navy, the contract will see Len Industri and Thales install the TACTICOS Combat Management System, the SMART-S Mk2 air and surface surveillance radar, the STIR EO Mk2 radar and EO fire control system and the Vigile Mk2 tactical multi-purpose R-ESM system. These systems are currently also installed on the Indonesian Navy’s new Raden Eddy Martadinata class frigates, enabling consistency in operations for the Navy, and ensuring that their fleet remains one of most advanced in the region.

Modernisation programmes are a cost-effective means of extending the lifecycle of any naval fleet and upgrading the critical mission systems ensures that the latest developments in combat management and sensors are installed for optimum performance. This upgrade for the KRI Usman-Harun is expected to be completed by the end of 2023, and it will considerably extend the life of the frigate.

Thales has established strong credentials in naval modernisation worldwide. In Indonesia, Thales has supplied and integrated the naval combat electronics for four Sigma class corvettes and is also the supplier and integrator of the naval mission systems for the current Indonesian Raden Eddy Martadinata Frigate programme.

Aligned with Indonesia’s vision of building indigenous capabilities in the defence sector, Thales has worked closely with Len Industri over the last decade, including signing Memorandums of Understanding and naval combat management systems, through research and transfer of technology. The modernisation of the KRI Usman-Harun is Len Industri’s first major mission modernisation and its first mission systems integration programme.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9991697072982788}",neutral,0.9991697072982788,0
Thales Introduces Fifth-Generation DME - Aviation Week,"Wed, 11 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9zaG93cy1ldmVudHMvd29ybGQtYXRtLWNvbmdyZXNzL3RoYWxlcy1pbnRyb2R1Y2VzLWZpZnRoLWdlbmVyYXRpb24tZG1l0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LYON, France–Thales is gearing up for its first deliveries of the DME 500, the French group’s fifth-generation distance measuring equipment (DME) which is compatible with existing onboard receivers.

“We have some launch customers, we will deliver the first examples in the third or fourth quarter this year and entry into service will follow within weeks,” Thales’ managing director of navigation aids and surveillance Kais Mnif said.

The so-called signal in space is the same as in previous-generation DMEs, thus guaranteeing compatibility for avionics. But technology advancements may enable greater precision in determining positioning from the ground, according to Thales’ engineering director of airspace mobility solutions Christophe Grollet.

Company engineers are considering a 5 m (16 ft.) accuracy in DME-DME triangulation positioning, up from the current 15 m. In the “alternative position navigation timing” mode (APNT, currently at the research stage), a 3 m accuracy could be obtained. APNT is being studied in the framework of Europe's SESAR project for entry into service in 2022-23.

“We bring spectral purity and measurement stability,” Grollet explained. The former means signal deformation is limited and the air navigation service provider (ANSP) can therefore better use spectrum—a scarce resource. Measurement stability means the processing time is constant, enhancing the signal’s accuracy.

The bottom line is the potential use of more demanding navigation methods, such as RNAV.

While the trend in navigation appears to be toward an increased use of satellite guidance, ground-based navigation aids will retain a key role, according to Grollet. “The GPS has its shortcomings—it can be spoofed, it is not always available and the signal is weak.” Therefore, the two types of systems will stay, he said.

“There is a need for a new generation of DMEs to address the congestion issue with a capability to meet the GPS' positioning accuracy,” Grollet added.

A European Union rule requires member states to keep ground-based navigation aids.

Another reason is sovereignty. Some states want navigation over their territory to rely on means they control. And not every country has its constellation like the U.S.' GPS or Europe's Galileo.

In maintainability, the DME 500 was designed to offer better reliability, a reduction in the number or line of replaceable units and a 20-30% cut in electrical power consumption. It can be accommodated in the same shelter as an older DME.

Digitalization implemented in the DME 500 will help an ANSP monitor its network of DMEs and use predictive maintenance, Grollet said.

Another feature of digitalization will be faster turnarounds for calibration. The current practice is to use conventional aircraft for calibration flights, which is time-consuming and involves post-processing of data.

The DME 500 is compatible with a calibration flight performed by an unmanned air system. It can transmit enough data for health monitoring and parameter check purposes. In turn, calibration can be performed in real time.

Grollet believes calibration flights performed by a UAS could be envisaged from 2021.

The DME 500 is Thales' second product in fifth-generation navigation aids. It was preceded by a new Doppler-VHF Omnidirectional Range (DVOR). It will be followed in the coming years by a new instrument landing system (ILS).","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999177873134613}",neutral,0.999177873134613,0
From Thales of Miletus to AI and the fourth industrial revolution: A brief history of monopolies - AI Business,"Thu, 12 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL2FpYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL3ZlcnRpY2Fscy9mcm9tLXRoYWxlcy1vZi1taWxldHVzLXRvLWFpLWFuZC10aGUtZm91cnRoLWluZHVzdHJpYWwtcmV2b2x1dGlvbi1hLWJyaWVmLWhpc3Rvcnktb2YtbW9ub3BvbGllc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"by Jérôme Lecat, Scality 12 March 2020

One of the most important news stories of 2017 was Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods for $13.7 billion. The past two years have shown that this event has had significant negative impact, both reducing choices for Whole Foods customers, and opportunity for smaller grocery producers.

There is something even more unsettling about the acquisition, though, linked to the power of data in today's digital world. Here, we explore the importance of living in a competitive world and the dangers of monopolies empowered by data and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the fourth industrial revolution.

A brief history of monopolies

To understand and contextualize this acquisition, it is useful to look back at major events throughout history which have led to the monopolies of today.

The first instance of monopolistic practices as we know them today arises from Greece in 600 BC. Well-known astronomer and mathematician, Thales of Miletus, became wealthy by creating a monopoly on olive oil, using what we now call 'futures' and 'options' in economics. Based on his knowledge of astronomy, he could predict the times olives would be plentiful in a given year and buy access to all the olive presses for these periods. Holding the monopoly, he rented out the presses at a huge profit.

Fast-forward 2,000 years, the Republic of Venice gives us the first example of a state-organized monopoly. Between the 13th and 16th centuries, Venice used typical monopolistic practices to keep the price of salt artificially high. The Republic ensured it was the only producer of salt in the region, even when that meant destroying alternative production sites. This monopoly played a crucial role in that state's economic growth.

With time, monopolies grew in sophistication and number. During the 19th century, the US government supported the growth of “big businesses” in the hope that such stable business would foster economic growth. However, towards the end of the century, several corporate holding companies including the Sugar Trust and the Rockefeller Oil Trust were becoming nationwide monopolies and hurting farmers, consumers, workers and suppliers. The Granger Movement in 1867 demanded a law be passed to cease such practices, leading to the Sherman act of 1890. The act aims to encourage competition in business by prohibiting anti-competitive agreements and any attempt to monopolize a certain market.

Monopolies today

Despite such anti-trust laws, monopolies have not disappeared. The US telecom market is still one of the most expensive in the world for consumers due to the AT&T monopoly which was dismantled in 1982. We all remember the lawsuit of the United States against Microsoft in 2011 for leveraging its influence in the PC market to gain a position in the Internet market. More recently, the EU fined Google $1.7 billion for drawing on its dominance as a prevalent search engine to gain advantage in the online advertising market.

Typical behavior of monopolistic business can be described as: businesses will charge the maximum possible price up to the point they lose customers. This has been seen many times throughout history. And we are seeing it today. Companies such as Salesforce and Google are raising prices unilaterally without any real alternative for their customers.

Another example is in the public cloud. In today's digital world, the efficiency of IT infrastructure defines the competitiveness of organizations, and a cloud architecture, whether public or private, is essential to maintain a competitive edge. Yet, to depend 100% on a single public cloud provider is to empower a monopoly. That cloud provider will predictably raise prices to the point that the organization cannot pay, capturing all the value-add. Many enterprises are repatriating some of their data from the public cloud and moving to hybrid and multi-cloud infrastructures to remain in control.

Monopolies and competition in a world powered by AI

Returning to Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods, we find a clear example of an enterprise using its monopolistic strength to branch into another area. But how far will that go? As one of biggest retailers on the planet, Amazon has access to an extraordinary volume of data that, with big data analytics and AI, can provide invaluable insight into what sells and what doesn't sell.

But there is another twist with AI-powered businesses. Historically, competition creates choice and lowers cost for the consumer. This is not necessarily true for a market where several AI-fueled businesses gain dominance. Indeed, there is a fundamental difference between human-driven and AI-driven competition. Humans compete through creativity, creating new products, supply chain disruption, or new pricing schemes. Today’s AI have no creative power, they compete through optimization.

AI competition will tend to consume as much power as it creates value, applying more and more power to smaller and smaller optimizations. This already happens in the airline industry, where AIs price airplane seats, reducing airlines' margins to a point where they are barely sustainable. It is a lose-lose game.

Care, creativity and artisanship

AI today, while extremely powerful, is limited. Its strengths currently lie in pattern recognition and reproduction, multi-level optimization algorithms, and its sustained accuracy. 'General' AI, also known as strong or full AI where machines can perform any task a human can, is likely to remain out of reach for at least the next 20 years, or more. Creativity, care and artisanship are the three key human traits that AI has yet to achieve and are the key to compete effectively against an AI-powered monopoly.

The power of data in the fourth industrial revolution is still relatively new and unknown: how dangerous will new monopolies become if they fully leverage the power of the fourth industrial revolution and AI? What will be the consequence of AI achieving monopolistic dominance?

Thales UK’s most advanced new mine countermeasures (MCM) 2093 wideband variable depth sonar installed on HMS Grimsby has been part of a two-week joint NATO operation that has led to 38 pieces of ordnance being found – 18 by HMS Grimsby alone. During the joint operation, four ships were involved with the sonar on HMS Grimsby performing exceptionally well in the deep and cold water conditions.

Although operationally proven, an evolving mine warfare environment prompted Thales UK to develop the enhanced 2093 wideband variant, under the 2093 Capability Sustainment Programme (CSP) for the Royal Navy, providing a step-change improvement in threat recognition capability and range. This capability has now spectacularly proved it’s worth in difficult conditions, making shipping channels and inlets safer for marine traffic.

“This is a unique system; there is nothing like it in the world. We like to think of the Royal Navy’s expertise in mine warfare as being world-leading, and this really is up there.” Lieutenant Commander Kev Giles, Royal Navy mine warfare specialist, Royal Navy headquarters, Portsmouth

Nathan Noall, Project Manager for 2093 CSP at Thales UK, said: “This is a great result for the new Thales 2093 Wideband Sonar, proving that the outstanding performance has real world application to provide safety for marine traffic worldwide. We are very proud to provide the Royal Navy with this exceptional capability.”

2093 Wideband: technical details

2093 Wideband is a multi-frequency variable depth sonar system designed to counter the threat of modern mines in both deep and shallow water.

Its sonar transmitters and receivers are contained within a towed body which is lowered below the ship, penetrating oceanic thermocline layers which can cause sonar interference.

The new 2093 wideband capability has evolved from Thales’s world-leading 2193 sonar, which has been in service on the Royal Navy’s Hunt-class minehunters for a decade, giving 2093 an extensive deep water performance previously only seen in shallow waters. Pulse compression technology allows long range detection and classification of new generation, low target strength mines, while wider fields of view and multiple search and classification frequencies ensure that the critical mine hunting parameters of ‘coverage rate’ and ‘speed of advance’ are maximised under any operational conditions. The 2093 wideband’s human-computer interface has also been converged with 2193, making familiarisation training quicker for sonar operators from Hunt Class ships.

From March 9 to 12 at Satellite 2020, the leading international conference and exhibition held every year in Washington, D.C., Thales Alenia Space will showcase its latest technologies for space-based telecommunications systems.

A new decade, a turning point in the space telecom market

Over the last few years, the geostationary communications satellite market had seen a significant downturn. But the market began recovering in 2019, with orders for 17 geostationary communications satellites worldwide: 13 in the commercial market and 4 governmental satellites. Although the market didn’t reach the average volume of about 20/year seen from 2011 to 2016, orders showed a sharp rise from 2017 and 2018, when only 10 and 9 satellites of this type were ordered, respectively. The figures for 2019 herald a recovery in the space telecom market to meet emerging requirements. Driven by the global explosion in demand for connectivity, mobility and very high throughput, the sector should show a strong growth outlook between now and 2025.

Thales Alenia Space also returned in force in this burgeoning market, as it logged four orders for communications satellites in 2019, along with payloads for the Spanish government’s two SPAINSAT NG satellites, then a new contract for Amazonas Nexus in early 2020. Since the middle of the last decade, European manufacturers have won contracts for 11 communications satellites using electric propulsion (which maximizes payload capacity), including seven for Thales Alenia Space. Our all-electric and modular Spacebus NEO platforms, coupled with our flexible very-high-throughput satellite (VHTS) payloads drove us to leadership in this market segment. For example, we’re now building a new satellite, EUTELSAT KONNECT VHTS, featuring all-electric propulsion and a digital payload, with a very-high-performance 5th generation digital transparent processor (DTP5G). This powerful, high-throughput satellite, in the 500 Gbps class, could deliver high-speed Internet to isolated areas in France and throughout Europe where setting up terrestrial infrastructure is problematic. DTP5G is a real differentiating technology, one that allowed us to win several recent contracts: SATRIA for Indonesia, EUTELSAT 10B and Amazonas Nexus for Hispasat.

Solutions tailored to operator needs

Building on our expertise in VHTS technologies, Thales Alenia Space is now launching a brand-new line of communications satellites, Space Inspire. Based on a new medium-size platform, the Space Inspire solution is software-defined, ultra-flexible and fully reprogrammable in orbit, including for coverage zones.

Space Inspire satellites will be fitted with 6th generation digital processors to change the paradigm in the fast-evolving telecom market. Our customers are increasingly forced to develop advanced new services and seize commercial opportunities at any given moment. With our new product line, digital payloads and enhanced flexibility allow operators to dynamically allocate capacity anywhere and at any time, for any bandwidth. To support this new line, Thales Alenia Space recently inaugurated a new “Factory 4 .0” in Hasselt, Belgium. This plant is dedicated to the automated production of photovoltaic assemblies (P.V.A.), which are used on satellite solar arrays to generate electrical power. Both Space Inspire and Spacebus NEO platforms will be fitted with these solar cells.

Thales Alenia Space paves the way for 5G

5G is coming, and everybody’s talking about it. It will shortly define the next generation of mobile devices.

With space-based systems, 5G will offer higher accessibility, reliability and resilience, along with broadcasting and multi-broadcasting capabilities. We expect 5G to support a wide variety of applications so that everybody in the world can be connected. Along with space and mobile phone companies, Thales Alenia Space is supporting the efforts of 3GPP to develop solutions that support the vision of a single global network, with space-based platforms playing a key role and fully integrated in mobile operators’ 5G strategy.

Setting the global standard for satellite constellations

Two communications satellite constellations built by Thales Alenia Space as prime contractor completed their in-orbit deployment in 2019: O3b on behalf of SES, which now has 20 satellites in medium Earth orbit (MEO), and Iridium NEXT on behalf of Iridium, which now has 66 operational satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO).

Having built a total of 125 satellites to date as prime contractor for three constellations (Globalstar 2, O3b and Iridium® NEXT), Thales Alenia Space, which also built 70% of the first-generation Globalstar system, clearly sets the standard for LEO and MEO communications satellite constellations. We’re fully prepared, along with our international partners, to meet even more ambitious challenges for the production of constellations, whether for communications or Earth observation.

We have capitalized on our proven expertise in this field to address three new markets in partnership with startups. Working with SpaceFlight Industries, NorthStar and Hemeria, Thales Alenia Space is offering competitive and innovative, even disruptive solutions adapted to different market segments.

With SpaceFlight Industries, an American startup, Thales Alenia Space has created the equal joint venture LeoStella LCC. A resolutely “New Space” enterprise, this company will produce BlackSky, the first constellation offering very high revisit rates, comprising 60 high-resolution optical observation satellites.

In 2018, the Space Alliance (between Telespazio and Thales Alenia Space) took a stake in NorthStar Earth & Space Inc to develop a system that monitors space from space. The Space Alliance will provide NorthStar with design, development and production solutions for a single constellation of 40 satellites.

Thales Alenia Space is also the system architect for Kineis, a constellation of 25 nano-satellites dedicated to the Internet of Things, produced in conjunction with Hemeria.

A fast-evolving telecom market, and a brand-new lineup

In addition to our proven expertise in constellations, Thales Alenia Space offers various product lines that specifically address the new expectations of the telecommunications market. From Spacebus 4000 B2 platforms, well suited to regional operators, to Spacebus NEO, ready to bring high-speed connectivity to the world, to Space Inspire, the brand-new line of all-digital and reconfigurable platforms, Thales Alenia Space provides solutions tailored to each operator’s exact requirements, to enhance connectivity and bridge the digital divide worldwide.

On 25 November 2019, Thales RaiLED signals were implemented and put into operation as a pilot project at the Serbian Railways. After three months of successful operation in the field and first experiences, the signals are now in full operation.



The Serbian Railways (Železnice Srbije) are the largest railway company on the Balkans with a total network of around 4,000 kilometers. Until 2003, they were part of the Yugoslav Railways. When Yugoslavia collapsed in 2003 it was divided into several individual railway networks, including the Serbian Railways. Due to the resulting fragmentation, especially regional rail traffic decreased sharply; the railways lost competitiveness compared to bus and car travel.

To restore confidence in the rail system again, the Serbian gouvernment is investing heavily in the expansion of the Serbian rail network. Among other things, the installation of leading-edge signalling equipment is being pushed in order to make rail traffic even safer and more efficient.

At Thales, we collaborate to architect and deliver high technology solutions that are innovative, resilient and sustainable. Together with the Serbian Railways and with a local partner, Thales experts have developed and authorised a version of the modern and energy-efficient RaiLED signal that is customised for rail traffic in Serbia.

I have been with Thales Alenia Space for 27 years now. Today, I’m in charge of the Observation Payload Engineering department in the Observation and Navigation domain in Italy. I coordinate a 40-person team that designs, develops and tests microwave instruments for Earth observation.

I’ve spent my entire career at Thales Alenia Space. Prior to my current position, I held various engineering and management positions in Remote Sensing, encompassing systems, ground segments and payloads. It’s been a long journey with a variety of technical and managerial challenges, plus the pleasure of knowing that our teamwork enhances Earth monitoring and security. If it now seems normal that we can observe our planet day and night, under any weather conditions, that’s because of the ongoing technical progress in this field, to which I was lucky enough to contribute. We design, develop and test the remote sensing systems that have completely changed the field of Earth monitoring.

Today, thanks to our state-of-the-art satellites like COSMO-SkyMed, we can help prevent disasters or at least monitor their effects almost immediately, even in remote locations, as shown by recent catastrophic earthquakes. I was also fortunate enough to participate in space exploration programs, namely Cassini to Saturn’s moon Titan, Mars Express and ExoMars 2016. These programs gave scientists a deeper understanding of our Solar System, along with major clues to the Earth’s own history and how to protect our planet.

What are you most proud of in your day-to-day activity?

The real beauty of my work is that I feel it’s a bridge between state-of-art technologies wielded by experts and the public. Our overriding aim is to improve the quality of life. The systems we design and build help space agencies from around the world protect our planet. We’re now at a turning point, as we all worry about sustainable development, climate change, the Earth’s health and more. I am very proud of doing my best to contribute to this vital task for the future of our planet and all upcoming generations.

I’m also very proud of being the mother of three sons, and that’s related. I hope that my work experience, which they see every day, will make them realize that it’s possible to realize their dreams through commitment and dedication, while also achieving a fair work-life balance. This is probably the most important achievement my generation should leave them.

Which aspects of your career have you enjoyed the most?

Discovering water in the 20-km-wide lake of liquid water underneath solid ice in the Planum Australe region of Mars, published online by “Science” (First Release) on July 25, 2018. This discovery was based on the analysis of data from the MARSIS sounder (Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionosphere Sounding), an instrument that I helped design and develop in the early 2000s. Radar images collected between May 2012 and December 2015 contain evidence of liquid water trapped below the ice of the south polar layered deposits. This result was achieved by a team from the Italian National Institute for Astrophysics (INAF), building on the work of Professor G. Picardi from the University of Rome La Sapienza, who had assumed the presence of liquid water under the Martian surface in the 1990s and imagined an instrument of this type. Thales Alenia Space in Italy designed and developed the instrument for the Italian space agency and delivered it to ESA for the Mars Express mission. The spacecraft was launched in 2003, so it took more than 15 years for this unique scientific achievement. By analyzing Martian history in this way, we get a foreshadowing of the possible desertification of Earth. Moreover the presence of water in the Mars subsurface boosts the possibility of human exploration, one of the main challenges of space exploration in the next two decades. In short, this was the most concrete example of my real motivation in work: Space for Life.

In 3 words, what are the qualities required in your profession?

Get to know our long serving Dockmaster based out of Sydney’s Garden Island, Bradley Lovegrove.

Born in Sydney, Brad grew up on the water in Oyster Bay. Following the call to the sea early on, he started sailing when he was only eight years old and began working in boatsheds when he was twelve. When asked what he was like as a youngster at school, Brad begins to laugh and states simply, “that’s why I started working in boatsheds when I was twelve.”

As most young sailors do, Brad started sailing in the Heron class, the entry level dinghy sailing boats that are often seen en masse on harbours and ports all around the country, and moved up through the ranks. “Anything that was made of timber, I’d sailed.”

His career “slipping” boats kicked off when he was just twelve, pulling them apart, antifouling them, and then putting them back together again. By the time he’d hit sixteen years old the workload was so intense and the money in it was so good, Brad says he actually took a pay cut when he started his apprenticeship at Garden Island as a Shipwright with the Department of Defence (DoD).

Although he was enjoying life as a ship handyman, in the back of his mind he knew he needed to have a trade behind him, and a Shipwright was in line with his passion for being on the water.

“That was 1975 and I worked here at Garden Island Monday to Friday as an apprentice,” he says. “But then I worked in the boatsheds on the weekends. Plus, I was mowing lawns, selling birds and washing cars. Sailing is an expensive sport and back then my apprentice wage was only 95c per hour, so I had to keep up the weekend work. My life was this; if I wasn’t working I was sailing, and if I wasn’t sailing I was working.”

When he looks back at his apprenticeship, Brad says that he was very fortunate because he got to move through various areas of the Island.

“I worked in the boatshed downstairs, the boatshed upstairs, the fibreglass shop, the drawing office, the dock squad and the outside Shipwrights,” he says as he recalls the four years. “I got a very diverse execution of all the skillsets. One of the areas I enjoyed the most was the dock squad, funnily enough,” he laughs.

He says that what he liked most working on the dock squad was that he could see the results of his work instantly.

“Every day you could see what you’d accomplished,” he notes. “You see a ship come in and sits down and you know you did that. It’s gotten to the point now where pretty much every ship on Sydney Harbour I’d docked.”

Turning Twenty-One

At the end of Brad’s apprenticeship in 1979, he’d bought a property on the Central Coast and was in the process of designing and building his first house.

“I was twenty-one and I needed a change,” he says. “So, I quit the dockyard life and moved myself up the coast to finish building my house.”

Brad took a job with a company called Vickers Xatal producing Easyrider/Nautiglass Boats and Mustang Boats. They’d also won the contract to make the front-end cabin for the new Express Passenger Train (XPT) trains set to hit the railways by 1981.

“There were four shipwrights and two pattern makers working on that project,” he recalls. “So, I led a small team which made the first half dozen XPT front-ends to enter service.”

Once that project was completed, Brad followed his calling back towards the sea and moved into the boating department of the company, doing fit outs for the boats. This role had him working on every aspect of the craft from its installation of electrical wiring, installation of alignment of stern drives and to the general fitting out of the rest of the systems and components of the vessel.

After a year of this type of work Brad felt the urge to move, and so he and a group of five mates packed up and drove north to Cairns over a six-month period.

“It was fantastic,” he says with a wry smile. “I worked in pubs as a handyman and in boatsheds along the way to make money. We towed a twenty-eight-foot half cabin cruiser along with us and we went out onto the water as often as we could, often island hopping as we got further north.”

Back in the Docks

After the trip north Brad got a phone call from a friend telling him about some casual work offered in the shipyard at Cockatoo Island.

“They’d laid the keel for HMAS Success and they needed people for a few months,” he says. “I was meant to be there for three months and ended up staying there for five and a half years! In these years I worked both the Sutherland Dock and the Fitzroy Dock as well as the small slipways.”

Brad then got another call about work, this time back at Garden Island as a supervisor.

“That was in 1987 and I’ve been here ever since.”

Since then he has moved from Scheduling to Surveying, Planning, then front line Supervision, and then onto the docks.

“Originally when I was told I’d been moved to the dock group to fill in for a guy who was off sick, I didn’t want to go since I spent so much time at Cockatoo Island working on the docks,” he chuckles. “It was only for three weeks but I said no. Anyway, they told me I was moving regardless, and the three weeks became… Well that was 1989 and I’m still here. In that time, control of the work transferred from Defence to ADI, then Thompson Transfield and then to Thales. So, I’ve been here through all of those organisational and cultural changes.”

When he’s asked what’s kept him here for so long he sits back in his chair and smiles.

“You know I was asked this exact question last night, and I answered ‘Boats and Ships’. Ships are my passion more so than smaller pleasure craft, even though I own one myself. For holidays I still go cruising because I just can’t get enough of ships. The Island is close by to home and I can see the ships come in and out from there which is a big tick in the box for me.

“The people I work with, they are a huge part of my life. I really enjoy liaising with the customers we work with here and we have proved time and time again just how good Thales is at this type of work.”

A Shift in Focus

Brad says that a few years back he began to shift his focus to more of a teacher, or mentor role.

He explained how in the 90’s, he “inherited a lot of disciplines” over the years and was eventually “running the dock group (and all its disciplines)” by himself and three supervisors. “To put it in context, back in the DoD days we had twelve supervisors and two managers.”

One of the main hurdles Brad has had to overcome in this transition has been getting used to the fact that he can rely on the next generation of employees and he doesn’t need to do it all himself.

“I have a real passion for what I do,” he says emphatically. “Clearly, that’s why I’m still here. But I’ve taken a step back a bit from front line, in the last four to five years, and taken on more of a role of teaching. I’m enjoying it, although it has its challenges.

“I am able to teach people, like Chris Campbell, who can bring the ships in and out and that helps a lot.”

Brad says the prep work for bringing a ship in to the dry dock (Captain Cook Graving Dock as it is formally known) begins six to eights weeks prior to its arrival. He studies the ships drawings with the Naval Architect (NA) to analyse every aspect of the ship, then moves on to the dock where he plans the timber blocks layout so it can “sit down” in the right position.

Then comes to docking day where the plan is executed. A successful docking day relies on many different disciplines (e.g. electricians, shipwrights, fitters…) which all play a role for the completion of the various tasks involved to dock a vessel. The size of a vessel dictates the amount of people required to line handle a vessel in to the dock.

“It’s that night, the night before the docking that I have a sleepless night,” he says. “I run through all the contingencies if certain things go wrong. It’s interesting because we’ve done this for so long and done a good job of it it’s easy for other people to forget just how wrong things can go. One miscalculation, one wrong judgement call, or one piece of information not communicated and the results could damage the company’s reputation and the vessel.”

Communication throughout the day is vital; liaising with pilots, tug masters and dockyard line handlers, as it contributes to the manoeuvring of a vessel inside the dock walls by pulling on ropes at different intervals. Overall, it takes plenty of planning and a whole lot of trust built up over time for precise work.

“But like I said, we do a good job and we’ve done so for a long, long time now. So, our customers trust us to get the job done safely and efficiently.”

When I ask him about his scariest moment there at the dock Brad smiles and shakes his head, obviously recalling a memory from the past.

“The scariest one I’ve had wasn’t here on Garden Island. It was on my first time in the boatshed, when I was 12, to bring a vessel to the slip. It was a twenty-four-footer, so no toy,” he laughs. “I had to go out to the mooring buoy to slip the mooring line but I didn’t account for the wind, tide and the engine not starting but eventually it started so I could bring the vessel in. I learnt a lot on that day and those lessons have helped me throughout my career.”

Three Life Tips from the Dockmaster

Believe and trust in your own decisions Keep developing your own moral level, how you see the world and how the world sees you Never stop challenging yourself.

All three of these are intertwined and directly impact each other. If you can do these things, you’ll be a happy person no doubt.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999961256980896}",neutral,0.999961256980896,0
Safer seas with autonomous unmanned vessels for mine countermeasures - Thales,"Thu, 12 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi91bml0ZWQta2luZ2RvbS9uZXdzL3NhZmVyLXNlYXMtYXV0b25vbW91cy11bm1hbm5lZC12ZXNzZWxzLW1pbmUtY291bnRlcm1lYXN1cmVz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Safer seas with autonomous unmanned vessels for mine countermeasures Autonomous Mine Countermeasure system Mine Counter Measures Share this article

Thales has been providing navies around the world with world leading mission capabilities for almost a century. Today, our expertise in maritime technology is transforming the science of mine countermeasures (MCM). Here’s why.

As much as 95% of UK trade, including about half of all our food and fuel, reaches us through the sea. Put another way, that’s goods to the value of well over £500 billion every year. Keeping maritime trade safe, when the majority of it passes through just a handful of chokepoints, is a constant task for the British Royal Navy and her allies.

Inexpensive and easy to deploy, mines - which can be improvised by hostile forces - are a growing menace. Until now, clearing them has been a personnel intensive and slow and dangerous process, even with four ships on permanent deployment. But Thales is working with L3Harris under the terms of a recently signed Memorandum of Understanding to create Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USV) to counter the threat safely and quickly.

Thales and L3Harris (formerly known as ASV Ltd) have a long-standing partnership which began in 2012 with the design, build and commissioning of the Halcyon USV. The versatile 11m USV served as a platform to test and develop new concepts of autonomous operation.

L3Harris is a good fit for Thales because of its impressive track record in building a variety of unmanned surface vehicle systems for military, security and offshore energy applications. The history of our partnership and this new agreement give us a great foundation for developing future market leading capabilities, while supporting Thales’ model of forming close partnerships across industry, SMEs and academia.

Together, Thales and L3Harris have developed a new class of USV. The first of their kind, Artemis and Apollo represent an important step towards the next generation of MCM technology.

These first two of these USVs will enter service with the Royal Navy and France’s Marine Nationale in 2020. The culmination of 4,000 hours of trials over a period of 4 years, the boats are equipped with a powerful autonomy engine and our Towed Synthetic Aperture Sonar, which work in unison to detect, classify and locate mines.

Live data and images are streamed to a control centre, which can be many kilometres distant, either on a ship or quayside. When a mine is located, the USV can be equipped to deploy a remotely operated vehicle, which is used to neutralise the threat through assured and accredited communications channels.

Unlike traditional systems on dedicated mine hunting and sweeping ships, Thales’s entire solution is designed to be packed up into a container and rapidly deployed anywhere in the world. It can also be used in multiples and in concert with allied forces, making the clearing of a path through a minefield quicker and safer than ever before.

These particular boats, which are being built to our custom design, are the heart for a system of systems which provides a world leading unmanned MCM capability at a distance and without the risk of sending divers down into harms way.

Now that our ability to build, equip and control unmanned surface vehicles has been fully tested over thousands of hours, we expect it to migrate to other fields such as unmanned anti-submarine warfare, fisheries protection, coastal surveillance and anti-smuggling operations, to name a few.

Some of these may require a different platform or configuration, of course, but the capability has been proven. There is no reason why the technology can’t migrate into new markets and we’re open to approaches from interested parties.

On Tuesday 10 March, representatives from CSIRO, local high schools and industry attended the CSIRO STEM Professionals in Schools networking event held at our Rydalmere site.

CSIRO STEM Professionals in Schools is a national volunteer program that facilitates partnerships between schools and industry to bring real world STEM into the classroom.

A number of Thales staff have been participating in the program, and Thales volunteered to hold the first meeting of 2020 at the Rydalmere site. STEM Professionals in Schools Project Officer Camille Rogers said that these kinds of events are always invaluable to the attendees, whether they are new to the program or have been participating for a while.

‘There is the opportunity for everyone to gain a greater understanding of what an industry player actually does, and what they have to offer potential partners or the wider community. It also presents a wonderful networking opportunity, and the chance to hear from existing partnerships who share their own insights and activity examples - it’s a very inspiring experience,’ said Camille.

Those attending the event received an overview of the different projects that Thales Australia works on, which was followed by a tour of the Rydalmere facility. The tour included an overview of the Transport Lab, an explanation of how acoustic production works, an overview of the overall sonar system development and support capability, and a tour of the EMI chamber.

The last stop on the tour was a visit to the AVS COOL lab, where the collective training capability, FlyX future avionics demonstrator, Virtual Reality training system UniVRS and Helmet Mounted Displays developments were showcased.

To wrap up the evening, there were a series of ‘Lightning Lectures’ where four STEM professionals presented on the work they were doing with local schools and discussed the benefits it was bringing to both themselves and the school.

Phil Swadling, Technical Director, Avionics facilitated the evening and said events like this are important as it provides a fantastic opportunity to connect with the community of people contributing to the pool of STEM talent.

‘It is a great way for Thales to contribute to this vital work, by ensuring teachers are aware of the very real career opportunities that are available through organisations such as Thales.’

Could you please explain your job?

I’m an IVVQ engineer, meaning that I’m in charge of the integration, verification, validation and qualification of instruments, components and subassemblies used on Earth observation and space exploration missions. I joined Thales Alenia Space’s facility in Zurich in 2012, when it was still Ruag Space. When I was a kid, I loved astronomy. So it’s only natural that I would go into science and technology. Working in the space sector then seemed the logical next step.

What are you most proud of in your day-to-day activity?

I’ve worked on a number of fascinating programs, including BepiColombo, designed to explore Mercury, Sentinel-4, with a suite of two instruments that will also be used on the two sounding satellites in the Meteosat Third Generation (MTG) family. These instruments are designed to analyze traces of gas and aerosols in the Earth’s atmosphere. At Thales Alenia Space in Switzerland, we supply electronic equipment for the instruments on Sentinel-4 (six in all, three per mission).

MTG is the new generation of weather satellites, comprising six satellites in all: four imaging satellites and two atmospheric sounders. Working on behalf of ESA and Eumetsat, Thales Alenia Space is in charge of this program, which will considerably enhance the capabilities of European meteorology from geostationary orbit.

Our company is also a major partner on the European Union’s Copernicus program. For instance, we are developing several series of Sentinel satellites and instruments for ESA. We really take this program to heart, because it’s designed to enhance environmental monitoring for the benefit of everybody in Europe and all over the world. The Sentinels will always keep a benevolent watch over our planet.

I’m also working on the technologies used in cameras carried by the ExoMars rover, and I’m delighted to be contributing to such an amazing program. It’s very moving to know that rover technologies “Made in Switzerland” will make a 500 million kilometer trip before they land on Mars. When I was young, if you had told me I’d be working on a space exploration project like this, I wouldn’t have believed you! I must admit that I’m very proud to be working for a company that’s involved in a mission to discover traces of past life on Mars. Beyond the scientific aspects, already very exciting, we’re tackling a very existential issue: is there life on other planets? Are we alone in the Universe?

I’m also happy to be working for a company that’s a partner in some of the most fantastic journeys to explore our Solar System. Just imagine, Thales Alenia Space has participated in the exploration of Saturn-Titan (Cassini-Huygens), Mars (ExoMars), comets (Rosetta-Philae), exoplanets (CHEOPS), Mercury (BepiColombo), the Sun (Solar Orbiter) and much more. In the near future, Europe may also travel to the Moon. We are capitalizing on the expertise acquired in terms of orbital infrastructures (40% of the ISS is built by Thales Alenia Space) and space transport system to design new technologies that will help us explore our neighboring planets and even deep space.

What aspects of your career have you enjoyed the most?

Well, I took a selfie with the camera from the ExoMars rover… (laughs)

In 3 words, what are the qualities required in your profession?

Flexibility, the ability to communicate (teamwork) and affinity for technical work.

UAE's Mirages to Get Lockheed Martin Sniper Pods - Defense & Security Monitor,"Fri, 13 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vZHNtLmZvcmVjYXN0aW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC5jb20vMjAyMC8wMy8xMy91LWEtZS1zLW1pcmFnZXMtdG8tZ2V0LWxvY2toZWVkLW1hcnRpbi1zbmlwZXItcG9kcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Back on November 29, 2017, Forecast International posted to its blog that a deal concerning a Thales upgrade of the UAE Air Force’s Mirage 2000-9s, announced during Dubai Airshow 2017, would involve the TALIOS electro-optical pod. However, on February 26, 2020, Lockheed Martin announced that it would instead be integrating its Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod with the UAE’s Mirages.

While this is a coup for Lockheed Martin’s team – with its Sniper pod continuing to expand its customer base, including a recent win for a place on board F-16Vs – it has to be disappointing for Thales, which has only found limited acceptance for its TALIOS on board select Dassault Rafales. The Rafale program itself has struggled to draw customers, and what could have been a massive, 100+ strong order from India has now dwindled to only a few dozen examples.

In the November 2017 post, Forecast International projected that the UAE’s Mirage upgrade would also include the RDY-3 radar. At this time, we are aware of no information that contradicts this forecast, and therefore continue to project that the upgraded Mirage 2000-9s will carry Thales’ RDY-3.

BAE Systems Submarines, which is building four nuclear submarines for the Royal Navy, awarded the contract which is worth around £330m.

Trident submarines to carry one of Royal Navy’s most famous names

In a statement, Thales chief executive Victor Chavez said: “Thales is immensely proud of our contribution to the Continuous at-Sea Deterrent over the last 50 years. This announcement represents a £330m investment in world-class sonar and optronics systems; providing the battle-winning edge for the Royal Navy.”

The Dreadnought sonar system will be developed at Thales sites in Templecombe, Somerset, and Stockport. The periscope - known as the ‘Combat System Mast’ - will be developed and manufactured in Govan with technical input from the workforce in Crawley.

The fleet will also be equipped with Thales Sonar 2076, which is already in service with the Navy’s Trafalgar and Astute Class submarines. The visual and situational awareness sensor will combine electronic warfare technology with cameras to provide the Dreadnought crew with a visual link to the sea surface.

The next-generation Dreadnought submarines are expected to enter service from the early 2030s to provide the UK’s nuclear deterrent when they replace the Vanguard-class of ballistic missile submarines.

Most of the jobs being created by the sub-contract to Thales UK are highly-skilled and in manufacturing, engineering and design. There will be 30 new posts in both Templecombe and Cheadle Heath, where 50 jobs will be secured at each site respectively.

Inexpensive and easy to deploy, mines - which can be improvised by hostile forces - are a growing menace. Until now, clearing them has been a personnel intensive and slow and dangerous process, even with four ships on permanent deployment. But Thales is working with L3Harris under the terms of a recently signed Memorandum of Understanding to create Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USV) to counter the threat safely and quickly.

Thales and L3Harris (formerly known as ASV Ltd) have a long-standing partnership which began in 2012 with the design, build and commissioning of the Halcyon USV. The versatile 11m USV served as a platform to test and develop new concepts of autonomous operation.

L3Harris is a good fit for Thales because of its impressive track record in building a variety of unmanned surface vehicle systems for military, security and offshore energy applications. The history of our partnership and this new agreement give us a great foundation for developing future market-leading capabilities while supporting Thales’ model of forming close partnerships across industry, SMEs and academia.

Together, Thales and L3Harris have developed a new class of USV. The first of their kind, Artemis and Apollo represent an important step towards the next generation of MCM technology.

These first two of these USVs will enter service with the Royal Navy and France’s Marine Nationale in 2020. The culmination of 4,000 hours of trials over a period of 4 years, the boats are equipped with a powerful autonomy engine and our Towed Synthetic Aperture Sonar, which work in unison to detect, classify and locate mines.

Live data and images are streamed to a control centre, which can be many kilometres distant, either on a ship or quayside. When a mine is located, the USV can be equipped to deploy a remotely operated vehicle, which is used to neutralise the threat through assured and accredited communications channels.

Unlike traditional systems on dedicated mine hunting and sweeping ships, Thales’s entire solution is designed to be packed up into a container and rapidly deployed anywhere in the world. It can also be used in multiples and in concert with allied forces, making the clearing of a path through a minefield quicker and safer than ever before.

The Laserdyne rangefinder is integrated into two of Thales Netherlands’ key products: the Mirador Mk2 lightweight, compact electro-optical multi sensor system used for surveillance, tracking and fire control operations, as well as the STIR 1.2 EO Mk2, a medium-to-long range illumination and tracking system.

Laserdyne has been supplying products to Thales Netherlands since 2012, and in total, has now provided over 100 units of their advanced digital laser.

Both Thales systems are designed for use on a wide range of platforms, from small patrol craft to large carriers. The Mirador and STIR 1.2 EO Mk2 act as observation systems and fire control directors for optical investigation, as well as anti-surface and anti-air warfare. The Mirador system has been sold to 10 navies, generating substantial demand for Laserdyne’s laser rangefinders.

Tim White, CEO of Laserdyne, says that the company is “proud of the long-term and continuing supply of sophisticated EO products to a such a prestigious client as Thales. Our quest to grow the business we conduct across the Thales group has been enhanced by the activities and insights afforded by the Thales GSC team, with new opportunities continuing to arise in Europe and globally.”

Laserdyne’s eyesafe rangefinder was also a key part of a recent upgrade program for the Mirador system, which Thales says has significantly enhanced the digital sensor suite.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999998807907104}",positive,0.9999998807907104,1

Garden Island is a familiar landmark on Sydney Harbour. It is well known as the East Coast home of the Royal Australian Navy, but it is also the site of one of Australia’s greatest engineering triumphs, the Captain Cook Graving Dock.

How the Dock came to be

The outbreak of World War ll in 1939 led to a Government announcement on 1st May 1940, that the new dock was to be built and work commenced in August the same year. Previously, the closest naval graving dock capable of taking capital ships was in Singapore, which required ships in the western Pacific region to undertake a significant transit; up to 4,000-nautical-miles taking around two weeks.

Work continued from August 1940 to when it officially opened on March 24, 1945 with the Governor General’s wife naming it as the Captain Cook Graving Dock. The first ship to use the dock was HMS Illustrious, although this occurred a few weeks prior to the official opening as it was in urgent need of repairs.

A major part of the Dock’s history is the attack on Sydney in 1942 and the lives that were lost as a result. You can read more about this at the Naval Historical Society of Australia’s page, here.

Thales and the Captain Cook Graving Dock

Since 1999, Thales Australia has played a critical role in operating and maintaining the Captain Cook Graving Dock on behalf of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) and broader Defence organisation. In addition to managing the dock, Thales Australia has been providing critical ship repair and maintenance services out of Garden Island to the Royal Australian Navy for over 20 years.

Throughout the years, for those who operate, maintain and accept the stewardship role in keeping this sovereign Defence asset operational, a significant sense of pride and accomplishment has been built.

Together with the RAN, other Defence stakeholders and industry partners, management of the Captain Cook Graving Dock has been a continuous and collaborative exercise in supporting Australia’s national interest.

Moreover, an updated version of the digital periscopes – now renamed Combat System Masts – which are used by Astute class of hunter-killer submarines, have been ordered.

The Dreadnought class subs will be equipped with second-generation optronic periscopes, combining electronic warfare technology with cameras.

The scopes will be fitted with many of the same features (night vision, the ability to record hi-resolution imagery) but inside a smaller, less obtrusive mast to make it even harder to locate the boat.

The sonar system will be developed at Thales’ sites in Templecombe, Somerset, and Stockport.

Work on first two submarines (Dreadnough and Vailiant) is well underway with the former due to take over from the first Vanguard-class submarine to retire in the early 2030s.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.6764056086540222}",positive,0.6764056086540222,1
