O3b Orders Eight More Satellites from Thales Alenia Space - SpaceNews,"Thu, 10 Dec 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9vM2Itb3JkZXJzLWVpZ2h0LW1vcmUtc2F0ZWxsaXRlcy1mcm9tLXRoYWxlcy1hbGVuaWEtc3BhY2Uv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Satellite builder Thales Alenia Space on Dec. 10 said it had contracted with satellite broadband provider O3b Networks to build eight additional O3b medium-Earth-orbit satellites, a move that will bring the O3b constellation to 20 spacecraft by mid-2018.

The value of the contract was not disclosed. But O3b, based in Britain’s Channel Islands, announced separately Dec. 10 that it had raised $460 million in “incremental financing” to pay for the new satellites. The satellite contract alone carries an estimated value of between $350 million and $400 million, according to industry estimates.

O3b had filed a $300 million insurance claim in 2014 following a power defect on the first four satellites, launched in June 2013. The subsequent satellites were launched in July and December 2014.

Martin Van Schaik, Thales Alenia Space senior vice president for sales, said the satellites, like the previous 12, would be launched in groups of four aboard Europeanized Russian Soyuz rockets from Europe’s Guiana Space Center in French Guiana, with the first four to be launched in late 2017 and the second batch launched in early 2018.

O3b did not immediately respond to questions about whether the company had in fact already signed contracts for the Soyuz launches.

The satellite contract, which had been expected, is for spacecraft to operate in the same 8,000-kilometer equatorial orbit as the current Ka-band constellation, said Bertrand Maureau, director of telecommunications at Thales Alenia Space.

But the new batch will include higher-level encryption that will require about 20 percent more power per satellite, he said. Besides this and what he called a minor refinement of the antennas, the satellites are identical to the previous 12, he said.

O3b has said that attracting business from the U.S. Defense Department and other militaries is a company priority, as is the market for offshore energy exploration and production.

O3b Chief Executive Steve Collar said in a statement that the new satellites “will ensure that we have enough capacity to service the demand.” The company had reported a backlog of $530 million as of June 30.

Satellite fleet operator SES of Luxembourg is a 45 percent shareholder in O3b. SES said it participated in the $460 million financing round, but declined to say whether the latest financing resulted in SES’s increasing its percentage ownership. SES has said it was likely to take control of O3b sometime in 2016 given the growth of O3b’s customer backlog and near-term business prospects.

SES had forecast that O3b would be generating $100 million in annualized revenue by late 2015, with the ultimate goal of each satellite producing up to $35 million per year in revenue by 2018.

Thales Alenia Space also is prime contractor for the Iridium Next constellation of 81 mobile communications satellites, 72 of which are scheduled for launch between March 2016 and late 2017.

Maureau said the Iridium Next and O3b supply chains have some overlap but not much, and that the addition of eight new O3b spacecraft will not put a strain on the prime contractor or its suppliers. The Iridium satellites undergo final assembly, integration and testing in the United States, whereas the O3b satellites are fully built and assembled in Europe.

The 12 satellites in orbit have 190 gigabits of total throughput. The constellation’s design — made by the same people who are now designing the Ku-band OneWeb constellation of 720 low-orbiting broadband satellites — allows O3b to add satellites as it sees fit once the first six are in operation and providing initial service.

In addition to adding total capacity to the network, designed to provide broadband data communications between 40-45 degrees north and 40-45 degrees south of the equator, each new satellite addition will reduce the amount of movement required by O3b customers’ ground antennas for uninterrupted communications links.

O3b entered commercial service in September 2014. The company said it now has 40 customers, including telecommunications network operators in the Pacific Islands and leisure cruise operator Royal Caribbean, which has made a key selling point the fact that it can offer broadband to its passengers."
Thales Group to Help Drive Morocco’s Aerospace Industry with Industrial Competence Center for Metal 3D Printing - 3DPrint.com,"Thu, 10 Dec 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vM2RwcmludC5jb20vMTEwMzA3L3RoYWxlcy1tb3JvY2NvLTNkLXByaW50aW5nL9IBOmh0dHBzOi8vM2RwcmludC5jb20vMTEwMzA3L3RoYWxlcy1tb3JvY2NvLTNkLXByaW50aW5nL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Last year, the government of Morocco launched an Industrial Acceleration Plan, aimed at boosting the country’s economy and creating a new, modernized industrial sector. The plan, which is being implemented over the period of 2014 to 2020, is expected to create half a million industrial jobs during that time. One major part of the acceleration plan is the further development of Morocco’s aerospace industry.

As we’ve been seeing again and again lately, 3D printing is changing aerospace. The technology is dramatically reducing the time and cost involved in manufacturing metal parts for aircraft and spacecraft, as well as making them faster, safer, and more efficient. Morocco’s aerospace industry has been growing quickly in the last few years, but it still has a long way to go in terms of staying competitive. A CNN report estimated, earlier this year, that approximately 20,000 more trained personnel, mostly machinists and technicians, will be required in the next four years, and the industry will need to up its manufacturing capabilities in order to produce more complex parts.

That’s where French company Thales Group comes in. Next year, construction will begin on a new industrial competence center for metal 3D printing in Morocco. The center is expected to be fully operational by 2018, and will significantly drive Morocco’s aerospace manufacturing capabilities forward.

“This project consolidates Morocco’s position as a key industrial platform, expanding our aerospace ecosystem to include a new technology that will undoubtedly shape the future of the aerospace industry,” said Moulay Hafid Elalamy, Morocco’s Minister of Industry, Trade, Investment and Digital Economy.

The Thales Group, which has a presence on every continent besides Antarctica, has been increasing its presence in international aerospace industries lately. Thales Alenia Space recently constructed 3D printed antenna supports for a pair of Korean satellites; the supports were the largest 3D printed parts ever made in Europe. Globally, a staggering two thirds of all aircraft that take off and land each day utilize Thales equipment. The industrial competence center in Morocco will be a point of pride not only for the country, but for Thales itself.

“This competence centre will give us access to a highly capable ecosystem of industrial suppliers specialising in mechanical parts; helping us meet all our requirements in terms of material, performance and reproducibility for the aerospace and space markets,” said Pierre Prigent, country director of Thales Morocco.

The company’s presence in Morocco will not be limited to the new competence center; Thales has been working periodically with the country’s industrial sector for the last ten years. The new project is only one of three partnerships with Moroccan authorities to further drive production and help to implement the Industrial Acceleration Plan over the remainder of the decade.

Gegard Mousasi Hints At Possible Fight With Thales Leites - LowKick MMA,"Sun, 27 Dec 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiImh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmxvd2tpY2ttbWEuY29tLzMzODMyNi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Former DREAM and Strikeforce champion Gegard “The Dreamcatcher” Mousasi was originally scheduled to take on longtime UFC veteran Michael “The Count” Bisping in the main event of UFC Fight Night 83 which is set for February 27, 2016 from the O2 Arena in London.

However, things were shaken up when the UFC pulled Bisping from the scrap with Mousasi, instead pairing “The Count” up against legendary former middleweight champion Anderson “The Spider” Silva.

Soon after the news broke, however, “The Dreamcatcher” made it clear that he planned on staying on the card, although an opponent was not yet known.

While nothing has been confirmed by the UFC just yet, a possible fight may be in the works, as Mousasi took to his official Facebook page to hint at who he would be taking on in London:

Posted by Gegard Mousasi on Sunday, December 27, 2015

Thales Leites currently sits at No. 10 in the divisional rankings, and has won four out his last five with the only loss in that stretch ironically coming against Bisping last July.

The Brazilian has shown strong submission skills, as well as brutal power on the feet, making him a tough out for any 185-pounder.

Mousasi is currently ranked No. 9 and is also coming off of an upset loss at the hands of Uriah Hall. Prior to that he had won two straight against Dan Henderson and Costas Philippou.

This matchup definitely makes since for both men, as it would give each a chance to bounce back.

Any thoughts?"
Thales Alenia Inks Deal To Build 2 More Sentinel Satellites for ESA - SpaceNews,"Tue, 15 Dec 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS90aGFsZXMtYWxlbmlhLXNwYWNlLXNpZ25zLWNvbnRyYWN0LXRvLWJ1aWxkLTItbW9yZS1zZW50aW5lbC1zYXRlbGxpdGVzLWZvci1lc2Ev0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"ROME — The European Space Agency on Dec. 15 contracted with Thales Alenia Space to build two C-band radar satellites, Sentinel-1C and Sentinel-1D, as part of the European Commission’s Copernicus Earth observation system.

The contract, valued at 402 million euros ($441 million), will help guarantee the promised data continuity of the multibillion-euro Copernicus effort, which includes 15 satellites performing a range of Earth observation missions.

The Sentinel-1A satellite was launched in 2014 and the identical Sentinel-1B is scheduled for launch in April aboard a Europeanized Russian Soyuz rocket. Each is designed to operate for at least seven years in polar low Earth orbit, with sufficient fuel to last for 12 years.

The Sentinel-1C and -1D satellites placed under contract Dec. 15 will be launched starting in 2021 and are nearly identical to the previous pair, with some new elements.

Both will carry Automatic Identification System terminals to enable European coastal authorities to monitor sea traffic when ships are beyond the reach of terrestrial radars. The European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) will be using the terminals but it remains unclear whether the European Commission will finance a data delivery service.

The two new satellites also have upgraded navigation terminals to use both the U.S. GPS and European Galileo satellite systems.

In what European officials said is a feature never before tested in orbit, the two satellites will be equipped with a mechanism that will automatically separate the radar antenna from the satellite’s body when the spacecraft begins to enter Earth’s atmosphere.

Guido Levrini, Copernicus program manager at the 22-nation ESA, said the first two Sentinel-1 models were designed before global space safety and debris mitigation guidelines were adopted. ESA has publicly committed itself to following these guidelines with all future satellites, even when doing so will add substantial cost to the spacecraft.

Addressing the Sentinel-1C/1D contract signing here, Levrini said the system separating the 900-kilogram, 12.3-meter-long, 90-centimeter-wide radar antenna from the satellite is triggered automatically when it senses the sudden heat rise accompanying initial atmospheric re-entry.

“These satellites are not going to be in orbit before 2020 and we did not want to stick with a design that goes against debris mitigation guidelines that will be 10 years old by then,” Levrini said. “We were nonetheless concerned that we would be forced into a satellite redesign to meet this requirement, but the solution that was found is very clever and did not cause a new design or any major cost increase.”

Nonbinding space safety guidelines call for satellite owners to perform a controlled re-entry of their hardware — meaning guiding it to re-enter over the ocean — if there is a more than 1-in-10,000 chance of injuring someone.

The Sentinel-1 satellites use titanium fuel tanks that are more likely to survive re-entry because they are mainly shielded by the radar antenna. Jettisoning the antenna makes it more likely that the tanks will burn up.

Airbus Defence and Space has a patent pending on the separation technology and plans to test the system at a specially designed heat chamber in Friedrichshafen, Germany, Airbus said.

Airbus is providing the radar antenna’s structure and other elements of the satellite under a contract to Thales Alenia Space valued at 143 million euros, Airbus said.

European Commission rules prevent contract commitments stretching over more than a single seven-year funding cycle, which made it impossible to contract with Thales for all four Sentinel-1 satellites.

Splitting the order into two parts nonetheless did not result in a substantial increase in cost despite the gap of eight years, said Volker Liebig, ESA’s director of Earth observation.

The comparison with the first two-satellite order — for 420 million euros in 2007, against 402 million euros for the latest order — is made more difficult because this time around ESA had to purchase two laser-optical communications terminals from Germany’s Tesat Spacecom. For the earlier order, the German aerospace center, DLR, had contributed the terminals as part of a German government contribution, Liebig said.

“We’re now in late 2015 for a contract that will be continuing to 2020, and when you look at the entire picture we are not paying much more than we would have for recurring models ordered all at once,” Liebig said.

Mauro Facchini, head of the European Commission’s Copernicus unit, agreed.

“Of course we would have preferred to order all four at once,” Facchini said. “But in the end the cost was not much more than it would have been.”"

Santiago Calatrava's Museum of Tomorrow opens in Rio - Dezeen,"Thu, 17 Dec 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlemVlbi5jb20vMjAxNS8xMi8xNy9zY2llbmNlLW11c2V1bS1vZi10b21vcnJvdy1zYW50aWFnby1jYWxhdHJhdmEtb3BlbnMtcmlvLWRlLWphbmVpcm8tYnJhemlsL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava's science museum with a skeletal roof that projects over a public plaza has opened in Rio de Janeiro (+ slideshow).

Called the Museum of Tomorrow, the museum holds 5,000 square metres (53,819 square feet) of exhibition space surrounded by a 7,600-square-metre (81,805 square feet) plaza on Guanabara Bay.

The project is part of a larger revitalisation of the Porto Maravilha neighbourhood near the bay.

""The city of Rio de Janeiro is setting an example to the world of how to recover quality urban spaces through drastic intervention and the creation of cultural facilities such as the Museum of Tomorrow,"" said Calatrava.

""This vision led us, in our first designs, to propose the addition of a plaza outside the museum,"" the architect added. ""The plaza creates a more cohesive urban space and reflects the neighbourhood's greater transformation.""

Burle Marx Studio designed the grounds, which include native planting surrounding the large paved piazza.

The building is oriented along the north-south axis, perpendicular to the bay. This highlights the horizontal of the design, which includes a massive trussed roof capped with solar panels that move to follow the position of the sun.

The roof is supported by curving white ribs. A half circle-shaped window tops the entrance.

Water from the bay is used to cool the building and feed the large reflecting pools on both ends of the museum. The water is then returned back into the sea.

Inside, the museum includes temporary and permanent exhibition areas, a 400-seat auditorium, an education centre, cafe and gift shop.

The all-white interior has curving walls, staircases, and ceilings. Many of the displays, created by US-based exhibition designer Ralph Appelbaum, are freestanding.

The museum will explore topics such as climate change and population growth, changes in biodiversity, genetic engineering and bioethics, and new advances in technology.

The project was funded the City of Rio de Janeiro, the Roberto Marinho Foundation, Banco Santander, BG Project, and the government of Brazil. Rio is gearing up to host the 2016 Olympic Summer games, which will largely take place in 15 sports venues on a lagoon-side peninsula masterplanned by AECOM.

Calatrava recently unveiled designs for a trio of bridges in the Chinese city of Huashan. He is also working on a transit hub and a Greek Orthodox church at the World Trade Center site."
Military plans to refurbish 'unsupportable' radar systems - CBC News,"Thu, 31 Dec 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9uZXdzL3BvbGl0aWNzL21pbGl0YXJ5LXBsYW5zLXRvLXJlZnVyYmlzaC11bnN1cHBvcnRhYmxlLXJhZGFyLXN5c3RlbXMtMS4zMzg0NTI40gEgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2JjLmNhL2FtcC8xLjMzODQ1Mjg?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Canadian military will refurbish rather than retire two ground-based radar systems that were recently declared ""unsupportable"" and ""urgently"" in need of replacement.

The decision to extend the life of the aging systems, which support Canada's CF-18 fighter jets, follows the collapse of a five-year-old procurement deal that was supposed to deliver high-tech replacements by this year.

Stephen Harper's Conservative government officially terminated the $55-million deal with Thales Canada Ltd. in July, after paying the company $2.6 million in development costs, ending a contract signed in 2010 with no equipment delivered.

Patrick Drouin/Canadian Forces Combat Camera) The military has never said why the deal fell through. And an internal Public Works document from June says: ""It will be a condition of the termination agreement with Thales that, except as required by law, this matter will remain confidential.""

Public Works had said the termination agreement was required before the military could ""re-initiate"" the procurement process for new tactical-control radar systems.

Deal expected in 2016

But any replacement contract is not imminent, and the military will sign a deal early in the new year to overhaul and repair the radar systems that are based in Bagotville, Que., and Cold Lake, Alta., home to the CF-18 squadrons.

""The Canadian Armed Forces has decided to continue to employ the TPS-70 mobile radar systems until such time as a new capability can be delivered,"" said Jessica Kingsbury, a spokeswoman for Public Works.

""In order to maintain the existing TPS-70 radars, [Canada] expects to award a competitive repair and overhaul contract by early 2016.""

Public Works issued a notice to the defence industry in early 2008, saying the existing TPS-70 radars were ""past their life expectancy [and] are no longer supportable.""

A replacement radar [is] urgently required. - July 9 briefing note for then-defence minister Jason Kenney

Documents obtained by CBC News under the Access to Information Act indicate that assessment had not changed when the Thales deal was ended. ""A replacement radar [is] urgently required by the Royal Canadian Air Force,"" says a July 9 briefing note for Jason Kenney, then the Conservative defence minister.

Canada's two mobile radar systems, bought in 1991, help direct CF-18s to intercept potential air threats, and are frequently used in NORAD training. In May this year, one of the systems was deployed to Resolute Bay, Nunavut, for the high-Arctic NORAD exercise ""Amalgam Dart.""

The mobile radars were also used for G8 and G20 summit security in Toronto and Huntsville, Ont., in 2010, and for security at the Vancouver Winter Olympics earlier the same year.

Talks considered sensitive

The France-based parent of Thales Canada, Thales Group, says its modern Ground Master 400 systems have been sold to Germany, Finland and Malaysia, among others. The Thales replacement radars were to have supported 40 jobs in Canada, with first deliveries to the Canadian military slated for 2013.

A protester reacts to the riot police while marching along the streets of downtown Toronto during the G20 Summit in 2010. The military's aging mobile-radar system was sent to Toronto to monitor air threats. (Nathan Denette/Canadian Press) Negotiations on contract termination with Thales began in October 2014, and a heavily censored Public Works document suggests the talks were especially sensitive because of ""a long-standing relationship with the contractor on other contracts … which needs to be taken into consideration.""

The Harper government oversaw a series of troubled procurements, including the F-35 Stealth Fighter project and the Cyclone helicopter purchase to replace the aging Sea Kings. During the recent election campaign, the Liberals vowed to scrap any F-35 purchase, and plow the savings into the navy.

But the military also points to success stories, including the acquisition of five C-17 heavy-lift transport aircraft; 17 Hercules C-130-J tactical transport aircraft; and 15 new Chinook helicopters.

Not only does this make it more user-friendly, its design also increases the hit rate. The latest asset of the Australian Defence Force (ADF), the F90 Assault Rifle provides a clear advantage when used in close-quarter combat.



An upgrade from its predecessor, the Austeyr F88, the F90 was developed by Thales Australia to meet the requirements of the modern-day soldier. At 4.8kg, the F88 was significantly heavier and had been used by the ADF since 1998.

Lighter, easier and faster



Similar to the F88, the F90 can be fitted with the M203 grenade launcher through a simple attachment. However, the newer gun is 1.36kg lighter even when both weapons are fully fitted with their grenade launchers.



Thales Australia Armaments Vice-President Kevin Wall said: ""Our soldiers deserve the best possible equipment and the F90 delivers on all counts.



""Enhancing the Austeyr is the most cost-effective way to deliver a capability upgrade, and we've worked closely with defence and army units to design, test and manufacture this world-class weapon.""



Featuring a bullpup design, the F90 allows for a shorter overall weapon for a given barrel length. With the magazine located behind the trigger, such a design allows the bullet to travel faster and with greater accuracy because of its longer barrel length. This also improves the rifle's manoeuvrability and reduces its weight.



A similar design is found in the Singapore Assault Rifle 21, which proves to be a huge advantage in urban combat as the use of long rifles is limited by confined spaces.



Thales Australia Chief Executive Officer Chris Jenkins said: ""The F90 is a weapon ideally suited to the modern battlefield. Light, compact and adaptable, it offers armed forces a cost-effective upgrade with a substantial degree of future-proofing.""



While working on the enhancements, Thales Australia also increased the reliability and general handling of the rifle. These were done through a redesigned butt-stock with a ribbed polymer buttplate for improved shoulder grip, a lengthened top rail, and the inclusion of a case deflector next to the ejection port so that the weapon can be fired from the left shoulder.



Other improvements include the introduction of a bolt release catch and the red dot grenade launcher sight. The former allows magazine changes to be done faster, while the latter reduces the time taken to execute a grenade firing and helps soldiers to hit their targets more accurately.



Used by the ADF, the F90 is light, accurate and more user friendly than its predecessor.

A hit with soldiers



To mark its significant enhancements, the F90 will be known as the Enhanced F88 (EF88) within the ADF. The first batch was issued to the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (1 RAR) for trials in June this year and they were a hit with the soldiers. Results showed that they considered the EF88 to be remarkably modular, balanced and accurate during combat and longer range shooting.



Private Jake Whitlock of 1 RAR, who was involved in a trial of the EF88, said: ""The EF88 impressed everyone with its accuracy, reliability and design.""



There are already plans for 1 RAR to use the EF88 during upcoming Support Company courses, jungle training and exercises.



Thales Australia was awarded AUD 100 million ($100.3 million) by the Australian Department of Defence to produce and deliver 30,000 F90s to the ADF.



The weapons issued will have two variants: a 20-inch barrel rifle and a carbine version. These are the F90M and F90 products from Thales' range, which also includes versions with grenade launchers. Deliveries have already begun and will be done in phases over six years.
