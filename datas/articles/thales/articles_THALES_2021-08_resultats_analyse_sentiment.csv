Hitachi Makes Big Statement With Thales Acquisition - RailwayAge Magazine,"Wed, 18 Aug 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJhaWx3YXlhZ2UuY29tL2NzL2hpdGFjaGktbWFrZXMtYmlnLXN0YXRlbWVudC13aXRoLXRoYWxlcy1hY3F1aXNpdGlvbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Commentary Hitachi Makes Big Statement With Thales Acquisition Written by Kevin Smith , Editor-in-Chief, International Railway Journal









Hitachi Rail’s announcement on Aug. 4 that it will acquire Thales’ railway business is set to shake up the global signaling sector. International Railway Journal Editor-in-Chief Kevin Smith examines the deal and its implications for the market.

Hitachi Rail has come a long way since bursting into the European market in 2004. That initial order for 30 six-car Javelin EMUs based on Shinkansen technology for Britain’s Southeastern franchise was followed by the Intercity Express Programme (IEP) contract in 2009 and the establishment of a rolling stock assembly facility at Newton Aycliffe in northeast England. The acquisition of Italy’s AnsaldoBreda and Ansaldo STS in 2015 provided the company with a firm foothold on the European continent.

Those deals and continuing order success propelled the Japanese manufacturer into the top five of railway equipment suppliers in SCI Verkehr’s 2018 Worldwide Railway Market for Industries study. The latest chapter in the Hitachi Rail story was penned on Aug. 4, when the supplier confirmed that it had entered into an agreement with Thales to acquire its Ground Transportation Systems (GTS) business for an enterprise value of €1.66 billion.

The supplier says the acquisition will increase its annual revenues to €7.7 billion within four years of the deal going through, which it expects by the end of 2022. Based on 2020 figures, this would place Hitachi Rail in fourth position behind Siemens Mobility with around €9 billion of annual revenue, but ahead of Wabtec, which recorded €6.42 billion of sales in 2020. Wabtec passed Hitachi into fifth position in the 2020 edition of SCI’s study, which is based on 2019 results, following its equally impressive recent growth. CRRC and Alstom, though, remain well out in front.

As well as adding scale to Hitachi Rail, the deal to acquire Thales’ rail business is significant as it effectively reduces the railway signaling market to three key players: Alstom, Siemens, and Hitachi.

This is a far cry from around a decade ago, when larger equipment OEMs regularly joined with specialist signaling companies when competing for contracts. Siemens’ acquisition of Invensys Rail in May 2013 set the scene for a period of consolidation. Hitachi’s acquisition of Ansaldo STS and entry into the market took place at around the same time that Alstom inherited General Electric’s signaling activities as part of the deal for the U.S. industrial giant to acquire Alstom’s power division. Alstom also acquired Bombardier’s signaling business as part of the acquisition of its long-time rival earlier this year.

Thales entered the railway market in 2007 with the purchase of Alcatel-Lucent’s signaling activities. Transport was responsible for 10% of Thales’ total sales, and recorded revenues of €756 million and an EBIT of €39 million in the first half of 2021. After recording a negative Ebit of €37 million in 2015, a reorganization of the Transport portfolio enabled Thales to return to the black the following year, which continued over subsequent years, including an Ebit of €86 million in 2020. GTS’ sales are split between mainline signaling (50%), urban rail signaling (20%), integrated communications systems (20%) and revenue collection systems (10%).

Thales says its exit from rail will allow it to refocus on Defense and Security, Digital Identity and Security, and Aerospace and Space, and achieve its objective of delivering double-digit margins in these sectors. It’s also an industrial and technological decision. Thales CEO Patrice Caine says operators, and especially metros, are increasingly looking for integrated and turnkey solutions for new projects. His colleague, Philippe Keryer, Deputy General Manager of Strategy, Research and Technology, explains that this requires integration, but without a rolling stock portfolio, this pushes Thales to form partnerships to win contracts, potentially losing out to other suppliers that can offer this efficiency.

Really Good Time

Thales has a strong presence in Asia, including in Singapore.

With a full complement of passenger rail vehicles for main line, metro and light rail, Hitachi Rail has no such issue. Reports in April suggested that Thales had approached Hitachi, Alstom, CAF, Stadler and private equity groups over the sale of GTS, and Hitachi Rail CEO Andrew Barr says the opportunity to acquires Thales “came at a really good time” as the company looked at the future of its business.

“We’ve established good product lines and Thales brings with it a good pedigree in the market that is complementary to our own signaling business,” Barr told IRJ. “In addition to that, they have got good technologies in digital and are already on the way to establishing the basis of a Mobility as a Service (MaaS) offering, which is something that we are working on, too. So put those two together and it works very well for us.”

Hitachi said in its statement confirming the acquisition that research shows that the MaaS market is set to grow by 25% by 2025. Barr says the company’s strong relationship with municipalities and cities around the world puts it in a great position to capitalize. He explains that Hitachi is already working on operational aspects of MaaS through the provision of system, control and digital elements, specifically via Hitachi Group’s Lumada platform, which was bolstered by the acquisition of GlobalLogic, a digital product engineering company, in July. However, Thales provides capabilities in ticketing and information systems that Hitachi did not have previously, meaning it can develop what is already there and not have to start from scratch.

“It is a really exciting opportunity to exploit that and actually take it in a slightly different direction,” Barr says.

In main line and urban rail signaling, Barr says Thales’ offer is again complimentary to what Hitachi gained from Ansaldo STS. While both companies have strong references, in general Thales has a stronger global footprint. The acquisition will help the Japanese company to build presence in Germany, Canada and Britain, where it is not currently as active. It also gains ground in the Asia Pacific market. While Hitachi is strong in its domestic market of Japan, where the technologies and products used differ from the wider market, Thales has a strong presence in the important urban rail markets in Singapore and Hong Kong and China through its Thales Sec Transport joint venture with Shanghai Electric.

“The access to the market alongside the skills and technical competence they have again makes this very complementary,” Barr says. “Hitachi was already strongly present in Taipei, and we are breaking into new markets like Sri Lanka. We can use that presence to gain a really strong foothold in the Asia Pacific area outside of Japan. In Canada, we are present, but we support that from elsewhere, and particularly the mainland U.S. and our site in Pittsburgh. Adding that capability to our business is a real benefit.”

Integrating a company of 9,000 employees into Hitachi Rail’s 14,000 person setup is no easy task. Barr says it is Hitachi’s intention to bring Thales into the Hitachi Group with two aspects to this process: aligning both companies’ signaling activities on the one hand, and the focus on digitalization and MaaS on the other. Based on the experience with Ansaldo STS, he expects this process to take around 18 months.

When asked whether he was confident the deal would proceed given the problems experienced with the proposed merger of Alstom and Siemens due to the expected impact on competition in the signaling market, Barr says a detailed study will be undertaken, but he is confident a deal will proceed after the company “spent a lot of time evaluating” the acquisition.

Having just three dominant players could present issues to railways and transit authorities by reducing their options when tendering big contracts. Barr though doesn’t discount the role that smaller players could continue to play in the market. “It depends on the customer and their preference,” he says. “But the fact that we’ve got the presence that we have, we have good access to a range of customers of all sizes and that’s the main part of our growth strategy.”

Certainly AZD Praha, CAF Signaling, and the tie-up between Stadler and Mermec will not want the “big three” to have it all their own way. Chinese signaling suppliers could also potentially have a role to play, although Barr believes their technology is domestically focused and not quite yet up to the level of their European rivals.

As well as greater efficiency, advances in new technology will define which signaling suppliers will succeed, especially as the pressure builds to reduce headways and boost network capacity.

Artificial Intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), Digital Twins and satellite-based communication are all touted to enhance the capabilities of signaling and communications infrastructure. Suppliers are actively exploring work in these fields through various projects. There is an emphasis on reducing the amount of hardware required for metro networks, and Barr believes a lot of future control systems will operate in the cloud.

There is also an increasing emphasis on expanding automation and centralized operation pioneered in the metro space to the main line. Barr played a key role in the Rio Tinto automation project while working for Ansaldo STS, which is now running more than 50 trains per day entirely autonomously across the Pilbara in Australia.

This project showed that large scale main line automation is possible, and work is now well under way on more complicated applications; French National Railways (SNCF), German Rail (DB) and Dutch infrastructure manager ProRail are among the pioneers in Europe introducing ATO over ETCS, while several U.S. Class I’s, among them Union Pacific, are exploring the capabilities of these types of technologies for North American freight rail. China became the first country to open an automated high-speed line, the 174km Beijing North – Zhangjiakou line in December 2019, while Russia is also pushing ahead, including through technologies developed by Transmashholding subsidiary LocoTech Signal.

Thales’ Lucy test train is at the forefront of the company’s work on main line automation.

Thales’ Lucy test train is a rolling laboratory active on a 22km test track near Chemnitz, Germany, that showcases the very latest in the company’s automation technology, including the use of AI to “think” and move for itself, 5G, and the building blocks for Hybrid ETCS Level 3. Barr says that Thales’ work in this area will bolster Hitachi’s own capabilities.

The technological emphasis of these main line automation projects is expected shift the emphasis from smart infrastructure that controls on-track assets to smart rolling stock assets, which are responsive to what is going on around them. This could be the speed of the train in front, or obstacles on the track, as pioneered in LRVs.

Thales GTS Vice President Technical and Innovation Amaury Jourdan told IRJ earlier this year that he expects significant progress in this area during the next 10 years. It is an exciting prospect for the upturns in railway network performance it is expected to unlock. And while three big companies look likely to lead the charge, other suppliers should take heart that further innovation could yet enable them to forge their own important place in this compelling marketplace.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9217698574066162}",neutral,0.9217698574066162,0
Thales technology makes light work of heavy seas - Thales,"Wed, 25 Aug 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi9ncm91cC9tYWdhemluZS90aGFsZXMtdGVjaG5vbG9neS1tYWtlcy1saWdodC13b3JrLWhlYXZ5LXNlYXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales technology makes light work of heavy seas Wind Farm Sustainability Share this article

In the UK, Thales has been at the heart of an original and ambitious project that combines robotics, autonomy and artificial intelligence to support energy transition.

The project was led by the (Offshore Renewable Energy) Catapult centre dedicated to wind power, and wave and tidal energy, with the aim of providing maintenance for offshore wind farms, initially using human-robot teams – within the next ten years – and then robots only by the year 2050. The project is vital to the UK’s ambition to reach a net-zero target by that date.

The two-year, £4 million feasibility phase – financed by Innovate UK - has just been successfully completed, allowing the team of scientists and engineers to prove the technologies that lie at the heart of this futuristic project that is like something straight out of James Bond.

This particular scenario opens with the appearance of an autonomous mothership called Halcyon, originally designed by Thales for mine countermeasures. Its onboard camera inspects the wind turbines blades, scanning the structure as they continue to turn at speeds of up to 200mph.

Scene two: As soon as the camera detects any kind of defect (cracks, traces of erosion or lightning strikes), Halcyon then signals the blades in question to stop.

Scene three: Halcyon launches a drone carrying the ‘blade-crawler’ robot that will then carry out the repairs.

Besides eliminating the need to send workers to wind turbines at sea – often in hazardous conditions – this scenario, according to the Catapult centre, could also a 10% reduction in the cost of the energy produced, notably by lowering production overheads by almost 30%.

When Mars inspires Neptune

The moving wind turbine inspection system was developed by Thales from world-leading optronic technology already used on submarines, tanks and armoured vehicles, combined with artificial intelligence.

Barry Connor, Innovation & Technology Manager for Optronics in the UK, says, “Thanks to Thales’s experience in stabilising systems in harsh environments, the camera system is able to overcome wave motion and take stable, multiple images of the turning blades from 100 metres away.”

What is interesting is that this maritime project was in fact inspired by space exploration, which is the epitome of a harsh environment. The AI system that controls how the autonomous robots work together and communicate with humans was developed by Professor Sara Bernardini, from Royal Holloway, The University of London, who has previously worked on mission planning for space operations with NASA

As she explains, “Space provides a good example of humans working with robots. The current Mars exploration programme uses a team of robots - from helicopters to rovers - that are controlled from the command centre on Earth, and which can withstand extreme conditions. Likewise, future offshore work will be about humans being in the control room, managing and working in collaboration with robots.”

Dr Paul Gosling, Chief Technical Officer for Thales in the UK, fully shared this point of view: “Increasingly we are seeing the technologies around robotics, autonomy sensing and AI providing solutions that enable activities in harsh environments to be undertaken using unmanned systems. This project is a perfect example of how a team of experts using this technology can benefit society and the environment, and I am delighted that Thales was able to be a part of its success.”

1In addition to Thales, the project team includes Plant Integrity, Wootzano, Bristol University, Manchester University, and the Royal College of Art.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999433696269989}",neutral,0.999433696269989,0
"Thales Academy is bringing a low-cost, private K-12 school to Greenville - Greenville Journal","Wed, 25 Aug 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vZ3JlZW52aWxsZWpvdXJuYWwuY29tL2VkdWNhdGlvbi90aGFsZXMtYWNhZGVteS1pcy1icmluZ2luZy1hLWxvdy1jb3N0LXByaXZhdGUtay0xMi1zY2hvb2wtdG8tZ3JlZW52aWxsZS1zYy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Bob Luddy made his fortune manufacturing commercial kitchen ventilation systems and HVAC equipment, which is not exactly the typical background for a man striving to reinvent the American education system.

But Luddy prefers that outsider’s perspective.

“What I knew going into this is what everybody knows, which is that there’s been many challenges within the public school system going back 20 to 30 years, if not longer,” Luddy said.

As an old-school businessman with Libertarian leanings and a penchant for classical Greek logic, Luddy found himself seeking to improve the public school system in North Carolina in the late 1990s. He started off with a charter school, Franklin Academy, which soon became the largest charter school in the state, with a waiting list of four students for every one spot.

“But government cannot stop regulating, so it’s not easy to run a charter because you have both federal and state mandates,” Luddy said. “Over time, public administrators will try to put more and more rules on them.”

That left private school as the only remaining option to achieve his vision, though he was well aware the very term “private school” calls to mind enclaves of the rich and elite. If Luddy was to make his model work for the people who needed it most, he needed to come up with a different option.

Enter Thales Academy.

Founded in 2007, the collection of private schools — which will soon open a Greenville location at the Hartness Urban Community — approaches education with a classic mindset and a modern approach to affordability.

“We always knew we wanted to have an educational, civic component to Hartness,” said Sean Hartness, founder of the Hartness Development. “The goal is to have families that are able to move in or live nearby and literally walk to school safely and have that community there.”

Restoring a community-minded notion of education is also key to Thales.

Aiming to “embody traditional American values” with a curriculum that focuses on critical thinking and a classical education model, Luddy sees Thales as a course correction for an education system that has, in his mind, been either hamstrung by regulations or rendered inaccessible by costs.

Pricing is crucial, Luddy said, otherwise, what’s the point?

If you want to send your kid to Thales, you’ll spend $5,500 a year.

“We keep costs down in several ways,” Luddy said. “One is not having a lot of administration. If you look at a typical public school, they have as many employees not teaching as they do teaching. That’s a horrendous cost.”

At Thales, there is one school administrator, one assistant administrator and then teachers. That’s it. The teachers run their classrooms, Luddy said, which allows for more autonomy depending upon the needs of each specific class.

“Very light administration keeps costs as low as possible,” he said.

Another gripe Luddy has with the public school system is the focus on accreditation — that is, requiring teachers to meet certain standards in order to be eligible to teach in each state. In South Carolina, for example, prospective teachers must have at least a bachelor’s degree from an accredited college or university, pass the Praxis assessments, complete a background check and complete an approved South Carolina teacher preparation program.

“On the surface, accreditation sounds OK,” Luddy said. “But I believe if accreditation solved the problem of delivering a quality education, we wouldn’t be talking about all these other school choice options. Essentially, accreditation as I see it as a system of licensing that has not proven to be effective and which is, I believe, a very arcane methodology primarily driven by government’s addiction to trying to control everything to the detriment of the outcome.”

In other words, Thales Academy hires teachers based upon their expertise and their teaching ability, rather than a specific checklist of items.

“If you hold a master’s degree in math but aren’t a good math teacher, what is that degree worth to the children?” he said.

The school buildings are another cost-saving measure. Once Luddy landed upon a design that worked, he didn’t fuss with it, so each Thales Academy building looks essentially identical.

“We build the same building every time,” Luddy said. “They’re cost effective, safe and beautiful, and we don’t do a new set just for its own sake. We make technical improvements but that’s all.”

As for the groundbreaking on the new Thales School building at Hartness, that has yet to be determined, Luddy said, but those interested in finding out about enrollment can do so at ThalesAcademy.org.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998268485069275}",neutral,0.9998268485069275,0
Masks no longer optional at two Thales Academy campuses - WRAL News,"Wed, 11 Aug 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndyYWwuY29tL3N0b3J5L21hc2tzLW5vLWxvbmdlci1vcHRpb25hbC1hdC10d28tdGhhbGVzLWFjYWRlbXktY2FtcHVzZXMvMTk4MjIyMzAv0gEiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3JhbC5jb20vYW1wLzE5ODIyMjMwLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Masks are no longer optional at two locations of a chain of private schools in the Triangle. Thales Academy is requiring students in Wake Forest and Raleigh to mask up after reporting coronavirus cases.

Several parents reached out to WRAL News with concerns about the school's COVID-19 protocols after its founder, Bob Luddy, wrote in an email to a parent that ""the flu is far more serious for children than COVID.”

Luddy said he stands by that statement.

""It’s more unnerving now than it was going to school last year,"" said one Thales mom.

The mom, who asked not to be identified by WRAL News, had great things to say about the education offered at Thales and didn't want to jeopardize that by identifying herself.

""At first, there were no protocols, so that wasn't good,"" she said.

In an email sent to parents in July, school leaders outlined protocol changes from the previous school year. Masks became optional for students, staff and visitors.

""I don't understand why they changed it,"" said the concerned mom. ""Last year, they did a wonderful job ... it was a wonderful school year, so I honestly don't know what changed over the summer vacation.""

Another parent wrote to WRAL that Thales Academy ""ripped away all sense of health, precaution and concern that was present at the end of last year.""

That same parent got an email within days of the start of classes alerting them that their child had possible direct contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case on campus.

Another parent wrote to WRAL, saying, ""the school does not inform us of school positive cases and we are only notified if our child was in six feet.""

A spokeswoman for Wake County Public Health said they have not identified any clusters or outbreaks at any Thales location.

Thales' founder Luddy responded to WRAL News by email, saying, ""the number of cases is low but the quarantine rules create a panic and a perception of a major COVID crisis. With the masks in place in Wake Forest and Raleigh, quarantines will be very minimal.”

Masks are now mandated at those two schools through Aug. 27. They remain optional at other locations.

""It is imperative for students to be in school, where they flourish,"" Luddy said in an email to WRAL. ""Thales takes prudent steps to keep our students safe.""

""I'm glad to see the progress they're making and the changes that they've made, but it's definitely been a scary first month back at school,"" said a parent who asked not to be identified by WRAL News.

A Wake County Public Health spokeswoman said their team met with Thales Academy health staff and leadership numerous times to review quarantine procedures and the effectiveness of masks, and that private schools are only required to report cases to the local and state health departments, not to the public.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998788833618164}",neutral,0.9998788833618164,0

helmet-mounted displays avionics jet fighter - Military & Aerospace Electronics,"Thu, 19 Aug 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pbGl0YXJ5YWVyb3NwYWNlLmNvbS9jb21tdW5pY2F0aW9ucy9hcnRpY2xlLzE0MjA4OTEyL2hlbG1ldC1tb3VudGVkLWRpc3BsYXlzLWF2aW9uaWNzLWpldC1maWdodGVy0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS – Officials of the French defense procurement agency in France needed helmet-mounted displays for the Dassault Aviation Rafale jet fighter. They found their solution from Thales in Paris.

Officials of the French defense procurement agency have ordered 350 Scorpion helmet-mounted sight and display systems and 400 digital multifunction displays from Thales to enhance the Rafale's tactical situational awareness and slave the weapon or mission systems to the pilot’s line of sight.

Thales will supply Scorpion helmet-mounted sight and display systems and digital multi-function displays for all the Dassault Aviation Rafale multirole jet fighter aircraft in service with the French air and space forces and the French navy.

Scorpion is from Thales Visionix, a division of Thales Defense & Security Inc. in Aurora, Ill., which develops helmet mounted display and motion tracking technologies, including inertial tracking and sensor-fusion.

The Visionix Scorpion system is in full production under several commercial OEM productions contracts and current U.S. government contracts and flies on the A-10 Thunderbolt; F-16 Viper; Spanish F/A-18; AC-130W Dragon Spear; AT-6; F-22; OV-10; UH-60/S-70; MD530G; H125M; H145M; and H225.

The Scorpion helmet-mounted cueing system, allows for rapid installation by requiring no avionics bay modifications, and features an interface control unit that mounts in the aircraft cockpit.

System control is via the Ethernet databus, and one LRU fits in the aircraft's side console DZUS rail mount. The system's inertial optical hybrid tracker requires no mapping, works either from an Ethernet or MIL-STD-1553B databus.

Scorpion is designed, engineered and manufactured by Thales Visionix to integrate with night-vision goggles, as well as protective visors and oxygen masks. Scorpion enables the pilot to create his own cockpit.

The see-through Scorpion display module is the focal point of the HMCS, and shows necessary data in a virtual heads up display (HUD) with 360-by-360-degree conformal color symbology.

The system provides precise head-steered weapons and sensor cueing; rapid target acquisition and handoff to sensors and weapons; sensor video capability with full-color overlay symbols; simple boresighting; is compatible with clear/glare/yellow/LEP/step-in visors and eyeglasses.

Rafale aircrews must analyse much data quickly while on combat missions in complex environments. Coupled with the aircraft's weapon systems, the Scorpion helmet-mounted sight and display enables pilots to quickly to a range of threats.

The Scorpion's helmet-mounted display symbology brings together information from the aircraft’s onboard sensors to help pilots perform their missions by creating a continuum between the cockpit and the outside world to improve awareness.

Scorpion couples the aircraft's weapon system to designate and track targets anywhere in the crew's field of view in daylight and at night. Scorpion is optimized for weight and balance.

The 400 digital multi-function displays on order will replace the lateral displays on France's in-service Rafale aircraft, which inform the pilot about the status of the aircraft's systems and provide imagery from its onboard sensors.

The new equipment offers a larger display area, an improved touchscreen interface, and greater processing power.

Hitachi Rail to acquire Thales Ground Transportation Systems - International Railway Journal,"Wed, 04 Aug 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJhaWxqb3VybmFsLmNvbS9maW5hbmNpYWwvaGl0YWNoaS1yYWlsLXRvLWFjcXVpcmUtdGhhbGVzLWdyb3VuZC10cmFuc3BvcnRhdGlvbi1zeXN0ZW1zL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"HITACHI Rail has agreed to acquire Thales’ Ground Transportation Systems business for €1.66bn. The deal is expected to conclude in late 2022.

Thales GTS is a global leader in railway signalling and train control, telecommunications and supervision, and fare collection. The company generated €1.6bn of revenues in the fiscal year 2020 and employs around 9000 people in 42 countries. Hitachi Rail expects Thales GTS to show continued revenue and Ebit growth with the division generating revenues of €756m and Ebit of €39m in the first half of 2021.

Reports in April suggested that Thales was ready to sell its signalling business and it reportedly approached Alstom, Hitachi, Stadler, CAF and private equity groups over the possible transaction. The report said the French firm was seeking to streamline operations and bolster the company’s finances, which were impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic.

Mr Philippe Keryer, Thales’ executive vice-president strategy, research and technology, confirmed that the company conducted discussions with key market players and has selected the “best industrial partner to ensure a successful long-term development of the Ground Transportation Systems business.” Ground Transportation Systems is part of the company’s Transport division. Thales also has Defense and Security, Digital Identity and Security, and Aerospace and Space, for which Mr Patrice Caine, Thales chairman and CEO, says the company is focused on delivering double digit margins and further strengthening their market position.

Hitachi previously strengthened its mainline and urban rail signalling capabilities with the acquisition of Italy’s Ansaldo STS, which was completed in January 2019.

Hitachi says it expects the latest acquisition to drive growth by expanding the scale of its global railway signalling business, bringing an enhanced turnkey offering to new markets around the world and accelerating development of its Mobility as a Service (MaaS) offer, a market which is expected to grow by 25% by 2025. Hitachi says that by adding Thales GTS’ signalling activities as well as expected rapid growth in MaaS and digitisation of the rail sector it will achieve revenues of €7.7bn and double digit adjusted operating income by fiscal year 2026, or four years from closing the transaction. The transaction is expected to result in run-rate synergies in excess of €100m around four years after closing due to the increased scale of the combined business, which will enable cross-selling to a wider customer base and improved cost competitiveness.

Thales GTS comprises four business units: mainline railway signalling, which is responsible for around 50% of revenues, urban rail signalling (20%), integrated communication systems (20%), and revenue collection systems (10%). Around 50% of the business is dedicated to digital offerings.

Hitachi says the acquisition complements its presence in Japan, Italy, Britain and the United States through Thales GTS’ headquarters in France, Germany and Canada, and will provide further access to the British urban signalling and German signalling market as well as urban rail signalling in Asia Pacific, notably Hong Kong and Singapore, and China through the Thales Sec joint venture with Shanghai Electric. Hitachi’s presence is also bolstered in North America through urban rail signalling headquarters in Canada.

“Today’s announcement marks an exciting opportunity for the teams at Hitachi Rail and Thales’ Ground Transportation Systems business to create new value for our customers, cities and passengers around the world,” says Mr Andrew Barr, CEO of Hitachi Rail. “Not only will we grow the reach of our core signalling capabilities as part of our turnkey offering, but we are also bringing together our digital and MaaS capabilities. The strong teams, customer relationships and technologies at GTS will help us grow to become a major player, further enabled by Lumada and the digital engineering of our teams at GlobalLogic and the broader Hitachi Group.”

Hitachi says employee representatives will be informed and consulted according to the laws of the respective countries throughout the process. Hitachi says it intends to promote the conditions for a smooth and successful integration and is willing to take a number of social commitments in this respect.

The deal marks another significant consolidation in rail signalling in the past decade. In addition to Hitachi’s purchase of Ansaldo STS, Siemens acquired Invensys Rail in 2013, Alstom inherited GE’s signalling division as part of the deal to sell its power division in 2015, and also acquired Bombardier’s signalling activities as part of the takeover of Bombardier Transportation, which concluded in January 2021.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999997615814209}",positive,0.9999997615814209,1
Should the Pythagorean theorem be renamed the Thalean theorem? - Big Think,"Mon, 23 Aug 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vYmlndGhpbmsuY29tL3RoaW5raW5nL3B5dGhhZ29yZWFuLXRoZW9yZW0tcmVuYW1lZC10aGFsZWFuLXRoZW9yZW0v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Among my colleagues working in ancient science, mathematics, and philosophy, the conventional view is that Pythagoras (c. 570-495 BCE) has been discredited as being the discoverer of the famous theorem bearing his name because the reports connecting him with it are judged too late to be secure testimony. My argument here is that the theorem might very well have been “visualized” by Thales (c. 625-545 BCE) and hence grasped already by the middle of the 6th century, c. 550 BCE, pushing back the Greek discovery by as much as half a century or more.

Proof: the cosmos is constructed of right triangles

To get the background for this story, I direct the readers to my earlier essays in which I tried to show that Plato’s Timaeus (mid-4th century BCE) memorializes what I call the “lost narrative” — the connection of philosophy and geometry in Thales and Pythagoras. Plato’s Timaeus promulgates the view that the right triangle is the fundamental geometrical figure. The logic is as follows:

All objects have surfaces, and every surface can be dissected into triangles (Figure 1). Inside every triangle are two right triangles (Figure 2).

If we continue to divide from the right angle, we can create two similar right triangles, isosceles and scalene (Figure 3).

This division into smaller and smaller triangles can continue forever (Figure 4). Therefore, the whole cosmos is built out of right triangles!

Nobody can make such a grand claim without a proof, or line of reasoning, to show that the right triangle is the fundamental geometrical figure. It seems to me — and this is entirely overlooked in the secondary literature — that the proof was the Pythagorean theorem.

But let me emphasize a point that is rarely raised on this Greek problem: which proof? Since we know that there are more than 350 proofs of the Pythagorean theorem, which one was used? Does one of those proofs show that the right triangle is the fundamental geometrical figure of all cosmic appearances?

Yes, it seems to me that the lines of one of two proofs preserved by Euclid VI.31 — the proof by similar right triangles, the so-called enlargement of the Pythagorean theorem — follows just this line of reasoning. Could Thales have visualized the hypotenuse theorem along these lines and Pythagoras (or his followers, the Pythagoreans) proved it later? Perhaps the scholarly consensus has it wrong? Pythagoras may well have proved the theorem as it was already visualized by his older contemporary, Thales.

Thales’ vision

If Thales visualized it, how exactly?

Among the geometrical propositions credited by name to Thales is the isosceles triangle proposition: if a triangle has two sides of equal length, the angles opposite those sides must be equal. This proposition was pivotal in another geometrical discovery attributed to Thales that every triangle inscribed in a circle on its diameter must be right-angled. Let’s take another look at this diagram.

As shown above, the isosceles right triangle is on the left, and the scalene right triangle is on the right. When Thales realizes this, he has a way to make countless right triangles for further investigation. He knows the angles in every triangle sum to two right angles (that is, 180°). In the diagram on the left, since BD and AD are both radii of the circle ABC, they must be equal in length, and so angles α and α must be equal. The angle ADB is right, so each angle α must equal half of a right angle. One can see immediately the argument is the same, ceteris paribus, for β, and so β equals half of a right angle. Hence, α + β also equals one right angle, and every triangle inscribed in a circle on its diameter must be right.

Now, had Thales followed this line of thought, he can see inside every right triangle, as they collapse (or expand) by the perpendicular AD from the right angle A to the hypotenuse BC, they do so in a pattern: the square on the perpendicular AD (that is, the square bounded by AD and DC, which are of equal length) is equal in area to the rectangle made by the two parts of BC into which the perpendicular divides the hypotenuse. (Imagine that the second rectangle — in this case, also a square — has length BD and width DC after this latter line segment is “folded” downward.)

To see that pattern is to discover the “mean proportional” or “continuous proportion” (BD:AD :: AD:DC).

This is immediately obvious in the case of the isosceles right triangle (shown on the left). Since BD, AD, and DC are all radii of the circle, they must be equal in length, and so the square on AD/DC is equal to the square made by the two parts in which the hypotenuse is divided, BD/DC. For the scalene right triangle, the areal equivalences — that is, the square on AD/DC equals the rectangle on BD/DC (after DC is “folded” downward making the width of the rectangle) — would have to be confirmed empirically, with a compass and ruler.

Now, had Thales noticed this pattern of continuous proportions by which the right triangles collapse (or expand), he might have looked more closely yet and wondered if there were other “mean proportionals” to be discovered. Had he done so, he was in a position to observe that there were indeed two more.

In the scalene right triangle shown below (on the right), the whole hypotenuse (BC) of the largest triangle ABC is to its shortest side (AC) as the hypotenuse (AC) of the smallest triangle ADC is to its shortest side (DC). In other words, BC:AC :: AC:DC.

In the case of the isosceles right triangle (shown above on the left), the perpendicular divides triangle ABC into two equal smaller triangles, but the continuous proportion still appears: BC:AC :: AC:DC. Geometrically, this means that the square on AC is equal to the figure made by the two parts into which the hypotenuse is divided, which is a rectangle.

Symmetrically, then, on the other side, BC:AB :: AB:BD, hence the square on AB is equal to the rectangle made by the two parts into which the hypotenuse is divided. One can see this areal equivalence immediately in the case of the isosceles right triangle; the scalene right triangle must be measured empirically to confirm.

The case for Thales’ discovery of the hypotenuse theorem

The visualization of two “mean proportionals” or “continuous proportions” is the visualization of one proof of the Pythagorean theorem. Had Thales followed this line of reasoning, he would have visualized the hypotenuse theorem before the time of Pythagoras and the Pythagoreans. And he would have done so as an unanticipated consequence of searching for and identifying the fundamental geometrical figure — the right triangle — and then looking inside to see what more he might discover.

According to Aristotle, Thales and the earliest philosophers posited a basic underlying nature out of which all things appeared; Thales called it water. Because this underlying unity never perishes, all appearances are only alterations or modifications of water. How does this happen? Might Thales’ explorations in geometry have been to discover the underlying structure of water, and he concluded it was the right triangle? If so, now we can see from Plato’s Timaeus, looking back a century and a half, how the project began of building the cosmos out of right triangles.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999861717224121}",neutral,0.9999861717224121,0

We spoke with Elizabeth Baker, Head of Exports for Thales in the UK, about her role, how Carrier Strike Group’s (CSG) capabilities are helping Thales tap into more export opportunities, and what the Government and Royal Navy are doing to support Britain’s export potential.

Can you tell us a bit about your career journey up to this point?

After graduating with a degree in Natural Sciences, I eventually arrived at Thales via BT and Vodafone, QinetiQ, Airbus Defence and Space, and consultancy BWCS. I’ve always been genuinely interested in technology – not just what it can do, but how it works and the value it brings. Working for Thales means I can indulge my passion for learning about, promoting and sharing the company’s capabilities.

Can you give us a brief description of your role – and how it fits in with CSG?

I’m responsible for growing UK exports across all our business lines in Thales UK and all our markets internationally. It’s a sizeable chunk of business – about £400m last year – and it’s growing. We work alongside all of the Group’s Business Lines to help Export Capture Leads achieve the results which fuel this growth. Winning export deals in defence and space very often needs heavy-weight support from UK Government. Our small central team – Joe Barry, Joe Jones, and Vivian Njambi – help me make sure our colleagues in Government understand the potential Thales has to achieve export growth for the UK – and therefore the Government’s overall prosperity agenda. And to get them to intervene on our behalf with other governments and our customers in support of export campaigns. At the moment, we’re working with Government to make the most of the visits made by HMS Queen Elizabeth and her Carrier Strike Group to take some critical and meaningful steps to push our business forward.

There are seven UK capability areas behind most of our export success, and there’s a lot of overlap with what's on the Carrier Strike Group. In fact, you could say the CSG is the world’s largest mobile showroom for Thales UK’s maritime defence capabilities.

Can you tell us a bit more about the capabilities you export from the UK?

Anti-submarine warfare is an important UK capability – we export surface ship sonar and submarine sonar, as well as our optronics masts. There are our mine warfare capabilities, including conventional mine warfare sonars, ship refurbishments, command systems and our autonomous mine warfare capability – which is generating lots of interest from potential export nations right now. We provide and integrate the mission systems for various ships – our ability to do so from the UK is growing following our success with the Type 31 frigate – and our offer includes our naval communications solutions. Our electronic warfare (EW) capabilities provide information advantage for vessels by analysing the radio spectrum to give the earliest possible warning of approaching threats. We provide a range of weapons systems and fuzing, which are currently some of the stars of our portfolio – our missiles are very visible on CSG vessels, arming the Wildcat helicopter. We also offer a range of sensor systems, some of which are used for the CSG’s airborne surveillance capability. A key theme for the UK MOD at the moment is multi-domain integration, and Thales solutions on the Queen Elizabeth Class carrier pull together live sensor information from across defence to give a powerful global view of threats. Not present on CSG, but growing in importance for export, are our vehicle integration and optronics capabilities.

Are the UK Government and Royal Navy supportive when it comes to exporting?

I’ve noticed a big change in the five years since I’ve been at Thales. Exports are playing an increasingly central role in domestic and international policy with the Government often taking the initiative. That’s because strong exports support UK prosperity. This certainly helps me in my role. For example, I was recently on board HMS Defender (part of the CSG) in Odessa to represent Thales for the signing of a tri-partite memorandum of implementation between Ukraine, UK, and Babcock on HMS Defender. Thales is providing the mission systems fit for the vessels Babcock is offering the Ukrainian Navy. The event was great for Thales because the ship has our early warning (EW), our comms, and our Lightweight Multirole Missile (LMM) systems on board. Having these capabilities so visible, and clearly and obviously endorsed by the Royal Navy is, in itself, an extremely powerful export proposition.

So having multiple capabilities at the heart of CSG is helping the export process?

Absolutely. CSG events, like the one on board HMS Defender, show the power of bringing stakeholders together in one place. It’s extremely rare to get UK industry partners, the customer, and our Government in the same room at the same time, but it’s so valuable for sparking conversations in a hugely impressive environment. It’s one aspect of my job I really enjoy. It gives me the chance to host in a market where I’m the visitor. It’s like a little bit of the UK ,where you’re able to warmly welcome and host friends and colleagues from industry, from Government, and from allied nations we’re hoping to do business with.

Thales UK is at the leading edge of maritime defence capabilities. What’s behind the company's success in your view?

I think it’s a combination of our heritage and our long-standing expertise. Together they build trust, which is, ultimately, what the UK Government and our export customers put in us to deliver for them. I’d also say it’s and our ability to work closely with the MoD to identify capability gaps, to innovate, and to see what they need to achieve next.

Anything else you’d like to add?

There’s a full run-down on the capabilities we provide to the HMS Queen Elizabeth and the wider Carrier Strike Group here.

Georgia Start, Graduate Engineer, Thales UK

There’s no question about it: the future is autonomous. But while the future of autonomy is bright, it’s a difficult field to be involved in. The industry ecosystem is notoriously complex and depends on the right talent and know-how. Plus, the rapid pace of development has left legislative, ethical and policy direction in its wake. All the while, getting it wrong is daunting for any company.

Helping our users stay ahead of the curve with this shift towards autonomy is the thinking behind Thales’s decision to launch its Autonomy Technology Centre. The Centre comprises a team of specialists who act as a central point of support, enabling us to bring together our learning and experience across autonomy to help whoever we work with bring their own capabilities to market.

The Centre also underpins some of the work Thales has already been doing in the field, and its establishment reiterates our view that, as a country, the UK can position itself to become an autonomy Superpower.

Chris Shepherd, Director of the Autonomy Technology Centre, tells us a little more…

How the idea of an Autonomy Technology Centre came about

Autonomy’s potential to take people out of harm’s way, reduce human effort on dull and dirty jobs, and to act as a force multiplier is clearly an attractive proposition to companies across almost every industry. Here at Thales, we’re already exploiting autonomy across each of our domains. So we wanted to bring together our efforts and experience in the field, which is where the idea of an Autonomy Technology Centre was born. Crucially, the Centre chimes with our desire to help UK industry lead and set standards for trusted, safe and ethical autonomous systems in the Digital Age. We want to help deliver market-leading autonomous solutions that are trusted by users and endorsed by Governments. In this sense, we envisage our Autonomy Technology Centre becoming not only a platform trusted by our users, but also a hub from where we can advise Government departments on legislation.

We were early to recognise the importance of digital transformation to the Aerospace sector. Here, Thales UK has been a long-standing advocate for the development and exploitation of civil drones to deliver major societal and economic benefits. Chris Shepherd, Director of the Autonomy Technology Centre

A repository that brings together Thales’s experience

Today, autonomy touches everything we do. And the aim of the Centre is to receive and share knowledge from across all parts of the Thales business, bringing together experience from across diverse sectors such as land, maritime, air and space.

For example, we have been helping clients in the military and civil maritime field deliver operational effectiveness and efficiency that resonates with the Department for Transport’s Maritime 2050 goal: that the UK will be a world-leader in the design, manufacture, uptake, and use of maritime autonomy and other innovative ship-board technologies.

In the same field, carbon-zero strategies are also driving the rapid roll-out of floating wind and alternative propulsion for shipping, as highlighted in the Government’s Clean Maritime Plan. In particular, we have worked with both the Royal Navy and the French Navy to help them become early adopters of autonomous systems – a complex undertaking given long procurement times for ships, submarines and aircraft, the high security requirements and the consequences of poor resilience and untrustworthy data sources.

We were early to recognise the importance of digital transformation to the Aerospace sector. Here, Thales UK has been a long-standing advocate for the development and exploitation of civil drones to deliver major societal and economic benefits. In terms of air autonomy, our UK CEO met the Prime Minister at No.10 Downing Street, to voice support for the Amy Johnson Challenge. This led to the Future Flight Challenge, a strategic initiative to position UK industry in this emerging market, to accelerate development of a holistic system of systems approach, and to bring critical mass to UK industry’s efforts.

It is exactly this breadth and depth of experience across our business that we want to capitalise on through the Autonomy Technology Centre. Whether we’re working with innovative SMEs, directly with customers or providing support internally to Thales, we want to help people deliver their own capabilities more efficiently while at the same time driving the profile of the UK’s expertise in the field.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.5748134851455688}",neutral,0.5748134851455688,0
Hitachi acquires Thales' GTS business in $2 billion deal - Techzine Europe,"Thu, 05 Aug 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2h6aW5lLmV1L25ld3MvcHJpdmFjeS1jb21wbGlhbmNlLzYzNTk3L2hpdGFjaGktYWNxdWlyZXMtdGhhbGVzLWd0cy1idXNpbmVzcy1pbi0yLWJpbGxpb24tZGVhbC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The sale follows the French company’s efforts to streamline operations and reaffirm confidence among its investors as it prioritizes its core interests in high-tech defense and aerospace equipment.

Europe’s largest company for defense electronics, Thales, announced they were in talks to sell their GTS railway signaling business to the Japanese brand Hitachi, with the deal valued at 1.66 billion euros.

The goal for the defense magnate

The Thales CEO, Patrick Caine, commented on this move, hoping to realign the company to focus on their core high-tech businesses for long-term growth and revenue. These three main businesses are aerospace, digital security and identity, and defense.

Hitachi reported that their acquisition of Thales’ GTS arm would significantly augment their Rail division and help them reach their expected revenue goals of 1 trillion yen by 2026.

The 1.66 billion euro price tag is valued and linked to the enterprise value, which includes the existing debt, of Thales’ GTS unit, formally known as the Ground Transportation System.

Price calculations

This price was reached by multiplying the GTS unit’s annual earnings 13.8 times before factoring in the interests and taxes. Thales released a statement that they expected to finalize this deal by the end of 2022 or the start of 2023.

The company also added that they targeted an EBIT margin of 9.8-10.3% (earnings before interests and taxes).

Impact on the industry

The signaling unit for GTS also comes with train collection systems and services for fare collection. The overall unit is small when compared to competitors. This sale follows a wave of consolidation in the equipment industry, with many smaller players merging with larger industrial groups.

The French company Alstom, which specializes in train making, acquired the smaller Bombardier at 5.5 billion euros. This move has cemented their place at second position in the railway industry, after the Chinese giant CRRC.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998557567596436}",neutral,0.9998557567596436,0
Thales Australia Cuts Steel for New Zealand's new Bushmasters - Overt Defense -,"Fri, 20 Aug 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm92ZXJ0ZGVmZW5zZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wOC8yMC90aGFsZXMtYXVzdHJhbGlhLWN1dHMtc3RlZWwtZm9yLW5ldy16ZWFsYW5kcy1uZXctYnVzaG1hc3RlcnMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Pin 0 Shares

Thales Australia has cut the first steel for New Zealand’s new fleet of Bushmaster Protected Mobility Vehicles (PMV) at its factory in the Australian State of Victoria. New Zealand ordered an additional 43 of the type in 2020, to replace its aging fleet of armoured Pinzgauer transports. Previously, in 2015, New Zealand’s special forces, the New Zealand Special Air Service (NZSAS), acquired five of the type from Australia which they have operated ever since.



New Zealand’s decision to acquire additional Bushmasters to replace the Pinzgaurers was driven by concerns about the existing fleet’s survivability, as well as its advanced age. According to the then Minister of Defence, Ron Mark;



“The age and lack of protection offered by the old fleet [of Pinzgauers] make this another investment in New Zealand Defence Force capability that must be made in order to protect our service people,“

As part of the $69 million USD deal, New Zealand is set to acquire 43 vehicles across five variants as well as supporting infrastructure and training. While the exact amount of each variant is not specified, the five types are troop carrier, command and control, maintenance, logistics and ambulance.



Unlike New Zealand’s current vehicles, the Bushmasters on order are of an improved “NZ5.5” configuration. This includes various upgrades over previous variants, including a larger rear door, improved payload and the inclusion of run-flat tires.

According to documents released by the New Zealand Ministry of Defence, the Thales Bushmaster competed against the German Dingo 3 6×6, manufactured by KMW, as well as the Swiss GDELS Eagle 6×6 for the contract. Thale’s offering won out, however, because of the proven operational history of the type, as well as the interoperability it offered with Australia.

The new generation system - EDR Magazine,"Fri, 13 Aug 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVkcm1hZ2F6aW5lLmV1L3RoZS1uZXctZ2VuZXJhdGlvbi1zeXN0ZW3SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Luca Peruzzi

The SAMP/T NG contract programme, which is already operative, will see the adoption of new engagement (ME), command (MC) and radar & IFF (MRI + MGE) modules as well as the upgrade of missile launcher modules (MLT), in addition to the new Aster 30 B1NT effector.

The new engagement and command post modules have been designed to achieve a capacitive increment in terms of tactical management of operational airspace, higher interoperability, and will allow treating simultaneously a higher volume of threats in an enlarged airspace arena. The new engagement module also features some growth potential (such as integration with other ground air defence systems, acting as tactical operational centre). In terms of functional and software architecture, the SAMP/T NG maintains software elements already acquired in the development of the software open architecture in the framework of the initial phase of the Sustainment & Enhancement (S&E) contract. Additional capabilities will be provided by the increased number of operator consoles and software functionalities that will optimise C2 activities and the tactical air space management. Each engagement and command post module will feature a completely new generation hardware with increased computing capabilities and four operator consoles (versus two of the current system) with new generation, large touchscreen colour displays and ergonomic console providing enhanced human-machine interface (HMI) capabilities for a higher data and track volume management.

In the Italian battery configuration, the future ME NG (specifically named MEC for the Italian variant as it will feature both ME (Engagement Module) and MC (Command Post) functions) will have the same layout for both SAMP/T NG configurations (French and Italian). The difference will be in SW functions that will be given to the Italian variant to perform the activity as MC. The Command Post (MC) will therefore present the same layout and capabilities of the engagement module (ME), allowing the MC to take over ME duties should the latter fail.

The system is also set for any future requirement and development that will allow inserting new capacities. The new system will also have an enhanced set of communication equipment allowing for a higher data and more secure distribution of information, including software-defined radios and data links such as the latest Link 16 evolved standards (STANAG 5516 Edition 8).

To fully exploit the capabilities offered by the new munition and maintain a technology and operational edge, alongside the resolution of the medium-long term obsolescence issue of the current ARABEL 90 multi-function radar module, the two MoDs decided to respectively introduce a new national system each. The French MoD selected the Thales France Ground Fire 300 (GF 300), which shares the same fully digital 4D AESA antenna and software defined architecture already developed for the naval Sea Fire four fixed faces (4FF), to be fitted to the Frégate de Défense et d’Intervention (FDI). The Ground Fire 300 – single rotating but larger antenna, and the Sea Fire 4FF solution, share the same digital level at antenna’s elements and the Gallium Nitride (GaN) technology into transmitter-receiver modules (TRMs), together with a wide RF bandwidth for high range resolution and non-cooperative target recognition (NCTR). With a software defined architecture providing mission performing through software and growth potential through software updates to handle new threats and new tasks, according to Thales, the new radar has 360° azimuth and 90° elevation coverage air surveillance capacity, a 400 km range; it can track up to 1,000 targets, with an update rate of 1 Hz in rotating mode and up to 10 Hz in staring mode- With an SSR/IFF system compliant to NATO Stanag 4193 edition III, the GF 300 has an enhanced surveillance capability on all targets, claims Thales, from slow moving and very low radar cross-section to fast up to hypersonic, or highly manoeuvring targets, with range performance to autonomously engage short-range ballistic targets in rotating mode and medium-range ballistic missiles in staring mode when cued. The GF 300 comes in a single 20’ ISO container with a weight under 10 tonnes, which can be deployed in 15 minutes and decamped in 10 minutes. It is transportable by road, rail, and tactical aircraft (C-130 or A400M type).

The Italian MoD selected the Leonardo Kronos Ground Mobile High Power (Kronos GM HP) system, the development and procurement programme approved late last year by the Parliament including five radar systems and a ten-year logistic support package. Based on information released by the Italian MoD, the new 3D multifunction AESA radar will have surveillance, tracking and engagement performances in line with the requirements of the SAMP/T NG, allowing to counter more efficiently a wider range of ABT and ballistic missile threats, thanks to the new Aster 30 Block 1NT missile. Beside coping with the increased threat scenario, the new system must ensure ‘plug & fight’ integration with the engagement module and be able to deal with evolutionary developments of the SAMP/T NG system. No further technical information was provided, but according to the development roadmap of the Leonardo Kronos family, EDR On-Line understood that the GM HP will be based on the same system being developed for the Italian Army Forza NEC programme but, thanks to the software defined design, a dedicated software was developed to respond to specific SAMP/T NG requirements. Based on the current Leonardo Kronos Ground Mobile radar architecture, the HP differs for the use of GaN versus Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) TRMs, already used, together with new processing and algorithms, in the naval Kronos 4FF version being provided for the Italian Navy’s Pattugliatore Polivalente d’Altura (PPA). The HP will feature a single rotating antenna, as for the GM family, with a revised architecture to cope with the higher-power TRMs including cooling enhancements, as well as the same new radar system processing and algorithms developed to cope with challenging emerging threats such as higher-speed low-radar cross air-breathing weapon systems and ballistic missiles, the latter characterized by demanding trajectories and terminal guidance with separable warheads. Leonardo demonstrated the BMD capabilities of its Kronos radar family at NATO levels through “At Sea Demonstration/Formidable Shield” naval integrated air and ballistic missile defence (IAMD) initiatives, where the Italian Navy FREMM frigates were equipped with modified Leonardo MFRA multi-function single-antenna 3D radar with GaAs TRMs. No details were released about the HP performances, but the already fielded Kronos Grand Mobile offers a 300 km instrumented, mission configurable surveillance elevation coverage, and a 90° tracking elevation coverage in any mission/configuration thanks to its software defined architecture. The new GM HP radar will have an integrated phased array IFF system compliant with Stanag 4193 edition III, able to operate in staring mode by electronic scanning, and will come in a mobile configuration in an ISO 20 standard container transportable by aircraft, ship, rail or standard/high-mobility vehicle, ensuring reduced deployment time, indicated in 15 minutes.

The MLT ground vertical launch module with eight missile launchers, which in the current configuration is capable of a rate of fire of two missiles in less than one second and all eight missiles from the same launcher in about 10 seconds, will be enhanced according to Italy MoD’s Land Armament Directorate with new Thales St@r Mille HP UHF-band software defined radio providing secure and more capable and distant communication links with the engagement module, and with a new launcher/munition control, alongside the monitoring system and software, in addition to a complete system overhaul. Thanks to these enhancements, the MLT will be able to operate the current and new ammunition and foreseen developments.

According to Eurosam, thanks to the new rotating AESA multi-function radar and to the new Aster 30 Block 1NT, the SAMP/T NG will have a radar detection range exceeding 300 km and an intercept range of 150 km.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9101381897926331}",positive,0.9101381897926331,1

Thales’s Armidale Class Patrol Boat (ACPB) In-Service Support teams, located in Cairns and Darwin, maintain a high tempo of maintenance, defect rectification, engineering and logistic support. This support ensures maximum operational availability of the 12 ACPBs operating throughout the North and North Eastern regions of Australia.

When a Boat is docked, it is removed from the water, providing an opportunity to conduct deep-level maintenance such hull preservation, propulsion train maintenance (propellers, hubs, shafts), under water valves maintenance and major structural repairs. This is further complemented with a range of non-docking related planned and corrective maintenance activities.

The on time undocking of Albany, was achieved as a result of hard work and collaboration with local industry to deliver to Navy, on time, every time.

Sarah Yuen, Director Capability Programs, Thales Above Water Systems (AWS), said, “The development of the Thales ACPB sustainment capability in Cairns has gone from leaps to bounds and I am very proud of the Cairns team and what they have achieved”. “The extension of the high performing ACPB sustainment capability in Darwin has enabled establishment of the Cairns operation in a short timeframe.” “Building local relationships and local industry capability is of utmost importance. This was also accomplished with significant improvements in safety. The many lessons learnt will be documented and applied for future vessels in Cairns,” added Sarah.

This is the fourth Armidale Class Patrol Boat major maintenance period Thales has conducted in Cairns in the last 18 months, and was achieved with greater than 80% of the maintenance work sub-contracted to local industry.

We’d like to recognise and thank all our local supply chain partners, as well as Fleet Support Unit and Norship Shipyard, for their efforts in a job well done. Fair winds and a following sea HMAS Albany.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.7879794239997864}",neutral,0.7879794239997864,0

Galileo G2 navigation payloads begin testing - GPS World magazine,"Fri, 06 Aug 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdwc3dvcmxkLmNvbS9nYWxpbGVvLWcyLW5hdmlnYXRpb24tcGF5bG9hZHMtYmVnaW4tdGVzdGluZy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Testing on Galileo’s second-generation hardware has begun.

Test versions of the satellites’ navigation payloads is undergoing evaluation by Airbus Defence and Space at its Ottobrunn facility in Germany and by Thales Alenia Space at the ESTEC technical center in the Netherlands of the European Space Agency (ESA).

Known as the Galileo Payload Testbeds (GPLTBs), these are development models of the navigation payloads intended for the Galileo Second Generation (G2) satellites. The navigation antennas of the testbed payloads are being testing to check whether they meet the ambitious performance levels set for the G2 satellites.

Instead of being assembled from space-ready components like an actual satellite payload, the GPLTBs are built from electronic parts placed in test racks, with a proof-of-concept version of a navigation antenna attached.

“The goal with these test campaigns is to prove their design concepts early, and anticipate any technical issues that might arise as early as possible,” said Cédric Magueur, ESA’s payload manager for the Thales G2 satellites.

“These campaigns also make it possible to develop and validate new performance measurements concepts for these new generation of complex navigation payloads,” said Dirk Hannes, ESA’s payload manager for the Airbus G2 satellites. “This will allow us to optimize the production efficiency of the flight model series.”

“Results from the testing will feed into the up-coming Preliminary Design Review for the new satellites, backing up the analyses by the companies with solid measurements,” Cédric said. “Such early testing also supports the ambitious timescale for the development and construction of G2 satellites, with the first satellites planned to reach orbit by the middle of this decade.”

There are 26 Galileo satellites now in orbit; deployment of 12 more will begin by the end of this year. Next will come the first 12 G2 satellites, featuring enhanced navigation signals and fully digital payloads. The new generation will be made up of two independent families of satellites meeting the same performance requirements, produced by Thales Alenia Space in Italy and Airbus Defence and Space in Germany.

Airbus Defence and Space’s GPLTB is undergoing radiated testing at the company’s Ottobrunn facility, inside a Compact Antenna Test Range (CATR). Meanwhile, the Thales Alenia Space GPLTB is about to start testing inside ESTEC’s own Hybrid European Radio Frequency and Antenna Test Zone (Hertz) chamber. The metal-walled chambers are isolated from external radio interference, with inner walls studded with foam pyramids to minimize radio-frequency signal reflections, mimicking the void of space.

“Up until now all GPLTB testing has taken place by plugging them into test boards,” Cédric said. “These test campaigns mark the first time that their performances will be confirmed in terms of radiating signals. In our first phase we will perform near-field measurements directly around the antenna to measure all the characteristics of the signal shape, to check it matches previous conductance tests. Then, via computation, we can derive its far-field performance.”

In the second test phase, the actual far-field measurements will be performed using another feature of the chambers, a pair of paraboloid reflectors. In this way, the signal from the testbed can be reshaped as if it had traveled the long distance that actual Galileo signals need to travel, from an altitude of 23,222 km down to Earth’s surface.

At Airbus, the testing is being undertaken in reverse order, with the far-field measurements taking place before performing the near-field measurements.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999979734420776}",neutral,0.9999979734420776,0

Something to Fear That Goes Bump in the Night: Chinese Military Night Vision Goggles - The National Interest Online,"Wed, 18 Aug 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vbmF0aW9uYWxpbnRlcmVzdC5vcmcvYmxvZy9yZWJvb3Qvc29tZXRoaW5nLWZlYXItZ29lcy1idW1wLW5pZ2h0LWNoaW5lc2UtbWlsaXRhcnktbmlnaHQtdmlzaW9uLWdvZ2dsZXMtMTkxOTcy0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Here's What You Need to Remember: The BBG-011A is clearly a clone of the Thales LUCIE night vision goggles, a popular European NVG that has seen use with the German Bundeswehr and French Army. The LUCIE is notable for being relatively “flat”, having the form factor of a rectangular box with a lens in the upper right corner. The choice to clone the European LUCIE device instead of American or Russian monocular-style devices is interesting, given that monoculars are generally held to have far more advantages over offset-lens binoculars.

Recently, various Chinese military night vision units have been showing up on the Chinese domestic market. This provides an interesting opportunity to evaluate the capability of such units, as manufacturers publish the specifications and characteristics of these units. However, as with most night vision technology, there are caveats. Typically a night vision unit consists of two basic elements, the image intensifier (I2) tube, and the housing. The tube generally is the largest determinant of the quality and resolution of the image, while the housing affects how the unit is mounted, how durable it is, and its other ergonomic properties. While the housings available on the civilian market are fairly representative of Chinese military stock, the I2 tubes in the housings may not be representative of what’s actually issued to the Chinese military.

The BBG-011A is an interesting example of a Chinese military night vision unit on the civilian market. The unit is clearly a clone of the Thales LUCIE night vision goggles, a popular European NVG that has seen use with the German Bundeswehr and French Army. The LUCIE is notable for being relatively “flat”, having the form factor of a rectangular box with a lens in the upper right corner. The offset lens is controversial among users of the LUCIE, with users often complaining that the offset lens makes “close up” work unintuitive and clumsy. However, it’s possible that the lens is offset to interface well with carryhandle mounted optics on the FAMAS rifle, which makes sense given that the Chinese QBZ-95 is set up in a similar way.

The BBG-011A on the civilian market comes with one of three I2 tubes, the NT-3, CNT-4, and DNT-6. NT-3s have figures of merit (FOMs) of around 1200, CNT-4s have FOMs of around 1440, and DNT-6s have FOMs of around 1960. DNT-6 tubes also have autogating technology, which helps preserve tube life when bright light sources are viewed through the tube. All of the I2 tubes the BBG-011A is available with are Gen 2+, which is behind the Gen 3 tubes commonly used by the US military. Most US military NVGs have FOMs of over 2000, with some even going above 2500. Modern Generation 3 military-used Chinese tubes are probably over 2000 FOM, but are not seen on civilian-available examples, and would probably not be used in the BBG-011A, as it is an older design.

The BBG-011A has a dovetail mount which is proprietary. PLA standard operating procedure appears to be the mounting the BBG to a headclamp style mount, which a ballistic helmet is then worn over. This is not ideal, as headclamp mounts are generally considered to be uncomfortable, especially with a helmet worn over them. Adapters are available that allow the BBG-011A to be mounted on a standard Notoros Rhino or Wilcox L4G24 mount that American PVS-series night vision are generally mounted on.

Overall, the BBG-011A is an interesting look into Chinese night vision development. The choice to clone the European LUCIE device instead of American or Russian monocular-style devices is interesting, given that monoculars are generally held to have far more advantages over offset-lens binoculars. But perhaps the desire for passive-aiming capability through a reflex sight and the similarities in layout between the FAMAS and QBZ-95 rifles lead to the adoption of the BBG-011A.

NIOA wins case against Thales over 'misleading and deceptive behaviours' - Australian Defence Magazine,"Thu, 05 Aug 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1c3RyYWxpYW5kZWZlbmNlLmNvbS5hdS9kZWZlbmNlL2dlbmVyYWwvbmlvYS13aW5zLWNhc2UtYWdhaW5zdC10aGFsZXMtb3Zlci1taXNsZWFkaW5nLWFuZC1kZWNlcHRpdmUtYmVoYXZpb3Vyc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"After the better part of a decade of court action between Madritsch KG v Thales Australia (NIOA acting with the Austrian gunmaker), the Queensland Supreme Court has found in favour of the Madritsch/NIOA team, with all three charges relating to the firing capability of the AusSteyr EF88 rifle.

The design changes under investigation were related to the issues of the underslung 40mm grenade launcher attached to the rifle that impaired the ability of the rifle to fire its regular round. Once the soldier fired a grenade from the rifle, the gun was unable to fire a normal bullet without the operator having to take corrective action.

It was alleged that Thales did not honour their non-disclosure agreements (NDA) in place when it came to IP and actively misrepresented their actions to partners (and the court during the case) as to their development process with ‘misleading and deceptive conduct’.

Thales was found to have engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct ""by leading them to believe that Thales had a continuing interest and even an intention to enter into a sub-licence agreement with NIOA for the Madritsch Solution. By engaging in that conduct, Thales contravened s 18 of the Australian Consumer Law Act.” (Para 436).

The court was particularly scathing of Thales’ behaviour and the judge called in to question most of their witnesses, including existing senior employees of the Lithgow small arms factory where the breaches occurred.

Para 266 of the judgement:

Attempts to minimise… knowledge and role were without credibility. If accepted, it would follow that a major supplier of armaments for the ADF left the design of a solution to a significant operational issue in the standard service rifle to a draftsperson without professional engineering qualifications.

Thales essentially argued that the laws of physics are available to everyone and they applied them accordingly. The court did not agree with this assessment given the testimony and evidence supplied.

The judgement document made it clear that the court was not happy with the level of transparent communications between all three parties at various points. Para 435 of the judgement - when Thales finally advised NIOA that they would not proceed to purchase the Madritsch solution – “This appears to be the first honest communication from Thales to NIOA in nearly six months.""

Para 437 of the judgement: I am satisfied Thales engaged in this conduct with the purpose of misleading or deceiving the plaintiffs so that they (and NIOA in particular) would not make a direct approach to the Commonwealth about supplying the Madritsch Solution kits for the use of the ADF until such time as Thales was ready to market its alternative solution to the bolt unlocking problem to the Commonwealth in the Land 125-3C program.

The full available remedies for NIOA and Madritsch are yet to be determined, however Thales has been ordered to pay damages and costs, with the extent of damages yet to be determined.

""We are disappointed with the judgement and assessing options for an appeal,"" a Thales spokesperson said to ADM.

ADM Comment: This was no small defect; not being able to fire a bullet after letting a grenade into the world is far from ideal. The judgement provides an amazing timeline and technical detail of the problem and its solution set for those who value such things. The nuance between different clauses of the NDA are for legal eagles to mull over but the moral of the story is that NDAs matter.

The phrase ‘mislead or deceive’ was used consistently against Thales in the judgement, a damning reflection of the actions of the company. As with any case, these were the allegations that could be tested and proved in a court of law. I also understand that NIOA was advised by multiple parties not to even bother with the case as their chances of winning were so low.

Government and the acquisition and sustainment agencies in the Department of Defence (not limited to CASG) are asking companies to work together more, to collaborate, to innovate together to achieve the capabilities required by government. There is no other way to deliver the array of programs and projects on the horizon.

This case is a shot across the bows of all companies that do not act in good faith with this approach to IP management. The ripples from this case will be far reaching, as they should be.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9944117665290833}",neutral,0.9944117665290833,0
Thales and Hitachi Rail Negotiate Sale of Ground Transportation Systems Business - railway-news.com,"Thu, 05 Aug 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vcmFpbHdheS1uZXdzLmNvbS90aGFsZXMtYW5kLWhpdGFjaGktcmFpbC1uZWdvdGlhdGUtc2FsZS1vZi1ncm91bmQtdHJhbnNwb3J0YXRpb24tc3lzdGVtcy1idXNpbmVzcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales and Hitachi Rail have announced they’re entering into exclusive negotiations regarding the sale of Thales’s Ground Transportation Systems Global Business Unit for 1,660m euros (1,965.89m USD).

Ground Transportation Systems (GTS) is a global leader in rail signalling and train control systems, telecommunications and supervision systems and fare collection solutions.

Around 8bn passengers benefit from its rail technologies every year and the business achieved a remarkable turnaround over the past five years, delivering its best financial performance of the past seven years in 2020 and the first half of 2020, despite the Covid-19 pandemic.

Thanks to the strong technical, geographical and commercial similarities between Hitachi Rail and GTS, the combined business will be positioned as a global leader in the rail signalling market.

The companies’ joint digital expertise will also help Hitachi Rail to accelerate its mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) offering.

Andrew Barr, Chief Executive Officer at Hitachi Rail, said: “Today's announcement marks an exciting opportunity for the teams at Hitachi Rail and Thales’ Ground Transportations Systems business to create new value for our customers, cities and passengers around the world. Not only will we grow the reach of our core signalling capabilities as part of our turnkey offering, but we are also bringing together our digital and MaaS capabilities. “The strong teams, customer relationships and technologies at GTS will help us grow to become a major player, further enabled by Lumada and the digital engineering of our teams at GlobalLogic and the broader Hitachi Group.”

Hitachi Rail’s acquisition of GTS will require the carve-out of the business in several countries, and is subject to the usual conditions including regulatory and antitrust clearances. It is expected to close by the end of 2022 or early 2023. Employee representatives of both Thales and Hitachi Rail will also be consulted.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999998807907104}",positive,0.9999998807907104,1

""Since the judgement was handed down on 26 July 2021 Thales has carefully assessed its options for an appeal,"" a spokesperson said. ""We have lodged an appeal with the Queensland Court of Appeal on the basis that Thales was incorrectly found liable based on inferences that were not supported by the evidence, and in some respects were contrary to the evidence.

""The appeal is against both the breach of confidence and the misleading and deceptive conduct rulings. We look forward to the matters being heard by the Court of Appeal, most likely in 2022.""

The design changes under investigation involve the underslung 40mm grenade launcher impairing the ability of the rifle to fire its regular round. Once the soldier fired a grenade from the rifle, the gun was unable to fire a normal bullet without the operator having to take corrective action.

There were two main issues discussed by the Court: first, whether Thales used the ‘Madritsch KG IP’ in their own, internally developed solution; second, it was alleged (by Madritsch/NIOA) that Thales acted in a manner that comprised ‘misleading and deceptive conduct’ under s18 of the Australian Consumer Law Act.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9810888767242432}",neutral,0.9810888767242432,0
Hitachi signals intent with €1.7bn deal for railway rival Thales - The Times,"Thu, 05 Aug 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXRpbWVzLmNvLnVrL2FydGljbGUvaGl0YWNoaS1zaWduYWxzLWludGVudC13aXRoLTEtN2JuLWRlYWwtZm9yLXJhaWx3YXktcml2YWwtdGhhbGVzLXc4MjV6OTZwbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Hitachi has struck a €1.7 billion deal to buy the railway signalling business of Thales, the French engineering group.

While Hitachi is looking to boost its rail division, Thales wants to simplify its sprawling operations and narrow its focus on making high-technology equipment for the aerospace and defence industries.

The carve out of its ground transportation systems division will also strengthen its balance sheet.

GTS, whose technology has long been used on the London Underground, specialises in rail signalling and train control systems, although it also offers fare collection services. It employs 9,000 people in 42 countries and last year generated revenue of €1.6 billion.

Hitachi expects that, with the addition of GTS, its rail business, Hitachi Rail, will hit ¥1 trillion (€7.7 billion)","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999985694885254}",positive,0.9999985694885254,1
