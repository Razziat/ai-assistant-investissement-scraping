On Saturday morning, Edmonton Transit said a software issue prompted a train moving north from Kingsway to NAIT onto the wrong track. That train ended up heading towards another train already on that track at the NAIT station.

The system stopped the train before any potential collision took place – officials said the train was backed up and switched to the other track.

Taryn Oseen is a student at NAIT, and she told CTV News the incident has her concerned.

“It’s a little freaky I guess,” Oseen said. “You never know what could happen, that’s why I always sit at the back of the train, in case it happens.”

That incident came after a system error in October when crossing arms lifted at an intersection before the train had passed through.

The City and the contractor, Thales, are investigating the incidents. Meanwhile, trains are moving at slower speeds.

Later Monday, Thales issued a statement in response to the incidents:

“Thales takes this issue very seriously. The reliability of our system for the residents of Edmonton is our top priority. Thales provided immediate, on-the-ground assistance to Edmonton Transit Service and is working collaboratively with the City of Edmonton officials.

“At no time was passenger safety compromised. We continue to work in close partnership with the City of Edmonton in resolving this issue.”

While also studying a Master in Innovation in the Digital Era and Information Management. As an overall space enthusiast, Eduardo has also taken part in many ECSL activities, is engaged with research at the University of Leuphana and is an active participants in the space law community! We asked him to tell us about the work he does for Thales Alenia, how he got the job and if he has any tips for others looking to break into the space sector.

What is your name, where do you come from and where do you work?

My name is Eduardo Bressel. I come from Zaragoza, Spain. I am currently doing the Young Talent Program of Thales Alenia Space in Madrid, Spain. I am specializing in drafting and negotiating contracts for the design and manufacturing of space systems. During my free time I work as a researcher for the Prof. Lesley Jane Smith (Leuphana Universität). My last research dealt with the “Legal Regulation of Stratospheric Balloon Flights and Uses”.

Describe your workplace and a normal day at work:

My daily work is focused on giving legal advice to my company for any contractual problem which can derive from the design and manufacturing of space systems. These problems include among others: the trasnmission of confidential information, intelectual property rights, review of new contracts and clauses, adjustment of the payment plan and delivery schedule, etc..

I also take part in the negotiations of contracts in order to ensure that all rights and obligations are acceptable for my company. Sometimes some clauses could compromise the normal activity of a company, e.g. violation of competition law, excessives liabilities, etc..

What is your educational background, and how did you get the job you have today?

I have a Bachelor in Law by the University of Zaragoza (Spain) and I specialized in Space Law during an international program with Leuphana Universität in Lüneburg, Germany. I have taken part in different courses, such as the Space Law and Policy course by the European Centre of Space Law and the Future of Outer Space Security course by the Geneva Centre of Security, where I focused on Space Defence and Strategy. I am currently studying a master in Innovation in the Digital Era and Information Management.

After finishing my law degree I worked in ESA´s Procurement Department at ESAC (Madrid, Spain) for 6 months, drafting and negotiating contracts. I can assure that the work I have today is largely due to this internship. Working at ESA is one of the best starts you can have in your professional career. It allows to have a global vision of the European space industry.

What is your favourite thing about the work you do?

The best thing about my work is that I am constantly learning from others with more experience than me. From a professional point of view I would say that negotiating a contract is one of my favourite tasks, but it is as grateful as tough. This industry is quite small in terms of companies. Those who are your suppliers today, could be your customers tomorrow. Therefore, the behaviour between parties must be equal and respectful.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999920129776001}",neutral,0.9999920129776001,0

The Origin of Evolutionism: It Didn't Begin with Darwin - Answers In Genesis,"Sat, 04 Nov 2017 10:27:24 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vYW5zd2Vyc2luZ2VuZXNpcy5vcmcvdGhlb3J5LW9mLWV2b2x1dGlvbi9vcmlnaW4tb2YtZXZvbHV0aW9uaXNtLWRpZG50LWJlZ2luLXdpdGgtZGFyd2luL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Editor’s Note: First published in St. Louis MetroVoice 5, no. 5 (May 1995).

Evolutionism is a belief system based upon the assumption that there is a purely materialistic explanation for the origin of virtually everything that ever has existed or ever will exist. The essential feature of this belief (often called materialism) is that everything in nature arose spontaneously by a process of self-transformation without the necessity of supernatural intervention. Julian Huxley once said,

The whole of reality is evolution, a single process of self-transformation (Evolution and Genetics, Simon & Shuster, 1955, p. 278).

In today’s public schools, history teachers teach how the universe evolved; earth science teachers tell how the earth evolved; biology teachers relate how living things evolved; and social studies teachers preach about how our values and religion evolved—however, students are rarely instructed in how belief in evolutionism itself evolved. To be sure, it didn’t begin with Darwin, nor was it first proposed by scientists working in the field or in the laboratory.

Ancient Greek philosophers were perhaps the first to clearly formulate a materialistic evolutionary concept of origins.

Ancient Greek philosophers were perhaps the first to clearly formulate a materialistic evolutionary concept of origins. It must be emphasized that these Greek philosophers were neither scientists nor experimentalists; rather they speculated on the origin of the universe in a way consistent with their religious and philosophical beliefs. Although many of the earliest Greek philosophers considered their gods to be creators, this began to change with the influence of Thales of Miletus. Thales (who lived at the time of Nebuchadnezzar’s destruction of Jerusalem in 586 BC) founded the Milesian school of natural philosophy. One of the primary assumptions of this school of thought was that the origin of everything in nature could be explained in terms of its own material composition. Thus, they sought to explain the origin of everything by a process of self-assembly from some underlying material element. Thales believed that water was that basic element from which all things evolved.

Anaximenes (560–502 BC), a disciple of Thales’ Milesian school, believed that air was the basic element from which everything evolved. He insisted that virtually everything in the universe (including the gods) was merely rarefied or condensed air! He believed that when air rarefied, it became fire—which formed the sun and heavenly bodies—and that when it condensed, it became cold and formed wind, water, and earth.

Heraclitus of Ephesus (535–475 BC) preferred fire as the basic element from which everything in the universe evolved. Like modern day evolutionists, Heraclitus was preoccupied with the idea of limitless change. He attempted to eliminate any necessity for a Creator by postulating a constantly changing world with neither beginning nor end. Since anything man declares to be eternal becomes his god, nature itself became the god of materialism.

Empedocles (484–424 BC) attempted to cover all bases by proposing that everything in the universe evolved from four basic elements—water, air, fire, and earth. He believed that all parts of living organisms were formed independently and were brought together in random combinations. Those combinations that were not well suited to live perished, while the better-suited combinations survived. This ludicrous speculation is strikingly similar to Darwinian “survival of the fittest,” yet Empedocles predated Darwin by over 2,000 years!

Epicurus (341–270 BC) would have been very comfortable with “modern” evolutionary cosmologists. He believed that everything in the universe evolved by chance combinations of randomly moving elementary particles called atoms! Epicurus was the father of an influential philosophical system known as Epicureanism, which taught that the universe was eternal and that nothing could influence it from without. The seeds of today’s crass materialism were sown in the Epicurean assumptions that the whole of existence is made of atomic particles or is a void—and sensation is the sole source of all knowledge.

The most detailed account of the role of evolutionary materialism in Epicurean philosophy is found in Lucretius’ De Rerum Natura (On the Nature of Things) written in the first century BC. Lucretius came remarkably close to Darwin’s views on natural selection when he told of the existence of monstrous creatures early in the earth’s history, which eventually disappeared because they proved to be unsuited to their changing environment. Like the other Greek philosophers of his day, Lucretius attempted to satisfy a deep, philosophical need for a self-assembling cosmos without a sovereign Creator. For him, evolutionary materialism was an attempt to emancipate men from two great fears—the fear of the arbitrary interference of the gods in the affairs of men, and the fear of accountability after death.

Epicurean philosophers were among those whom the apostle Paul encountered on his third missionary journey to Athens. Paul described them as men who “spent their time in nothing else but either to tell or to hear some new thing” (Acts 17:21). Paul pointed out to them that the primary difference between their gods (idols) and the true God hinged on the critically important matters of creation and our accountability to our Creator. He said:

I proclaim to you God, who made the world and everything in it, since He is Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made with hands. Nor is He worshipped with men’s hands, as though He needed anything, since He gives to all life, breath, and all things. And He has made from one blood every nation of men to dwell on all the face of the earth, and has determined their pre-appointed times and the boundaries of their dwellings, so that they should seek the Lord, in the hope that they might grope for Him and find Him, though He is not far from each one of us; for in Him we live and move and have our being, as also some of your own poets have said, “For we are also His offspring.” Therefore, since we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Divine Nature is like gold or silver or stone, something shaped by art and man’s devising. Truly, these times of ignorance God overlooked, but now commands all men everywhere to repent, because He has appointed a day on which He will judge the world in righteousness by the Man whom He has ordained. He has given assurance of this to all by raising Him from the dead (Acts 17:23–31; NKJV).

Sadly, even today there are many who profess to be Christians or Jews who seem unaware of the essential difference between Greek idols and the Creator God. The Scriptures tell us that our Creator “does whatever He pleases” (Psalm 115:3; NKJV), while idols cannot physically do anything—“They have mouths, but they do not speak; eyes they have, but they do not see; they have ears, but they do not hear” (Psalm 115:5–7; NKJV). Even some atheists have noticed that many liberal Christians and Jews appear to believe in a god that doesn’t physically do anything (at least nothing specific to which they will admit). In an atheist tract titled “There Is No God” (The American Atheists, PO Box 2117, Austin TX, 78768), Fred Woodworth states that the religious liberal denies that he believes in the “old God” but his “new god serves no purpose that he will define, so it cannot be attacked, but only denied.” Woodworth correctly points out that “this is only an attempt to preserve the notion of a god after the substance has been destroyed. Lacking any separate function, such as being creator of the universe, etc., the idea of a god is completely to no purpose.”

It is indeed tragic that God at times must use the likes of atheists and Balaam’s ass (Numbers 22:23–34) to instruct those who should know better.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999995231628418}",neutral,0.999995231628418,0

Holographic radar technology for detecting small UAVs - Defence Procurement International,"Tue, 28 Nov 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuY2Vwcm9jdXJlbWVudGludGVybmF0aW9uYWwuY29tL25ld3MvbGFuZC90aGFsZXMtYWNxdWlyZXMtYXZlaWxsYW500gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales has acquired Aveillant Ltd, a Cambridge (UK) based start-up which specialises in holographic radar technology. Holographic radars—otherwise known as staring radar, which unlike traditional radar systems that scan, stares continuously in a certain direction—establishes a permanent and complete picture of the total air space volume. The cost of the acquisition was not disclosed in a statement published by Thales.

The holographic or staring rader technique is ideally adapted to the growing drone market, enabling the detection, tracking and classification of very small, moving targets such as unmanned aerial vehicles or UAVs.

Aveillant’s radar solution, Gamekeeper, which is based on the staring array concept, uses a broad beam antenna to illuminate the whole of the desired search volume, with a static multi-element 2D receiver array digitised at element level. Appropriate processing of the receive array generates multiple simultaneous beams that collectively cover the whole of the illuminated search volume. This means all the targets in the surveillance volume are illuminated all the time.

Writing in Defence Procurement International’s Summer 2017 issue, Aveillant said: “The fixed arrangements of multiple simultaneous beams mean the sensor can dwell on targets continuously, giving high sensitivity and enabling very fine Doppler resolution. In the case of small drone targets, the height information and Doppler resolution assist in discrimination from stationary ground clutter.”

Its Gamekeeper solution has been installed at Paris's Charles de Gaulle airport and to Singapore's ST Electronics.

With this acquisition, Thales, a pioneer of digital technologies, will be able to offer customers, a new capability complementing its surveillance offering. David Crisp, CEO of Aveillant, added: “We are delighted to join a worldwide group the size of Thales, which will provide Aveillant with the resources and backing that is needed to accelerate its growth potential.”

“Our customers are increasingly faced with significant challenges to ensure the protection of large infrastructures, critical sites and airports. Aveillant’s holographic radar technology will provide a key building block for integrated solutions to provide this type of protection,” commented Serge Adrian, senior vice president for surface radar activities at Thales.

The global market for drone detection systems is tipped to exceed $11billion by 2020.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9994305968284607}",neutral,0.9994305968284607,0

Rome - November 8, 2017 - Thales Alenia Space takes another key step in its transformation toward Industry 4.0 through the development and use of new production technologies contributing to improve flexibility and reduce time-to-market . In its L’Aquila plant located in Italy, the company takes pride in revealing the new multi-purpose collaborative robot, or cobot, CRATOS (Collaborative Robot Addressed To Operative Solutions), which is already implementing its first mission to integrate electronic components into the first COSMO-SkyMed second-generation flight model.

“Cratos cobot sets a new milestone in the global Thales Alenia Space digital transformation strategy by facilitating production and accelerating time-to-market while complementing employees’ jobs in addition to automated machines and augmented reality,” said Donato Amoroso, Deputy CEO of Thales Alenia Space. “I am proud of our ability to match the fast-evolving market demand by using innovative technologies while capitalizing on the skills of our teams ”.

For Thales Alenia Space, CRATOS (derived from Kratos, the god of power in Greek mythology) is the first collaborative robot used to integrate electronic equipment, it can operate alongside employees, in the same area without any physical barriers. CRATOS is a highly versatile cobot capable of assembling and bonding components and parts, as well as checking these operations. Thanks to its flexible architecture, all operations are carried out in sequence, to considerably reduce assembly time. It also enables full control over the integration process, with a measurable improvement in quality. The CRATOS robot can be programmed via a conventional wire link, receiving instructions from CAD system files, or by a self-learning process. It was designed to continuously extend its scope of applications, including a 3D reconstruction feature, based on a panoramic photographic system and infrared barriers that will increase speed during automated integration while ensuring safety.

In the framework of its Industry 4.0 roadmap, Thales Alenia Space has also been operating SAPHIR, in its facility in Cannes, France. SAPHIR , is a collaborative robot designed to automatically prepare and install inserts in the structural panels on telecommunications satellites. It significantly reduces production cycles and costs on these satellites, each of which has some 3,500 inserts. Furthermore, Thales Alenia Space recently announced the construction of a new state-of-the-art plant in Hasselt, Belgium to produce photovoltaic assemblies (PVA). The facility will feature new technologies, including the robotic assembly of panels, digitization of the production process, with digital management of data and traceability, including online tests and checks, as well as the use of augmented reality.

Meet Ida Chiavari: a career shaped by a passion for science! - Thales,"Wed, 08 Nov 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi93b3JsZHdpZGUvc3BhY2UvbmV3cy9tZWV0LWlkYS1jaGlhdmFyaS1jYXJlZXItc2hhcGVkLXBhc3Npb24tc2NpZW5jZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"How long have you worked for Thales Alenia Space and what’s your current position?

I’ve been at Thales Alenia Space since 2011, starting as Quality Assurance manager in the Composite Materials Department, then for the Galileo program and next in Materials & Processes. I’m currently in the Technology Department, in charge of validating area array devices for digital equipment – the state of the art in terms of performance and computation capability.

What was your major at university?

Chemistry, which has fascinated me since I was young. I wanted to work in R&D… and now I do!

Who has had the greatest influence on your career choices?

My father! His passion for science inspired my studies, and he also encouraged me to travel and to learn about different industries.

What’s it like working in the clean rooms in Thales Alenia Space?

They’re really the heart of the facility, so that’s very fulfilling. They span some 4,200 square meters and have to provide extremely precise temperature, humidity and cleanliness (particulate matter) control.

Could you tell us a little more about the new L’Aquila plant…

Recent market conditions, with fierce global competition in an economic downturn, have led to increasingly challenging cost, quality and delivery requirements, which in turn demand greater flexibility, innovation, service and efficiency. This was one of the reasons for our redesign of the L’Aquila plant, following the earthquake which mostly destroyed it in 2009. The original facility in L’Aquila was a key to the company’s business, because it developed and built strategic products, which were also critical parts of the systems produced in other Thales Alenia Space’s Italian facilities. The new complex features a high level of seismic protection to ensure the safety of staff and the integrity of its machinery and equipment, while also guaranteeing business continuity.

What are some of the challenges you’ve met in your career?

The most challenging program is undoubtedly COSMO-SkyMed, the first dual-purpose satellite observation system, designed for both civil and military applications. In particular, I worked on the development of a dedicated assembly process for FPGAs (field-programmable gate arrays), an integrated circuit that can be programmed after manufacture. This 1752-column FPGA is the most advanced device of its kind in terms of integration, memory and data processing. An FPGA can be reconfigured in orbit by an uplink code, which means the mission itself can be reconfigured.

What advice would you give young women considering a career in science and technology?

Each of us is strong in certain areas or activities that we enjoy and also find fulfilling. So my advice would be: go out and find your favorite field of endeavor! You can’t just decide to become passionate about something, you must discover what inspires you and focus on that area.

Also, be ready to accept change in your career, and learn how to adapt… the best is yet to come!","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9996252059936523}",neutral,0.9996252059936523,0
Augmented and Virtual: a Reality Double Play at Thales Alenia Space - Thales,"Wed, 08 Nov 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi93b3JsZHdpZGUvc3BhY2UvbmV3cy9hdWdtZW50ZWQtYW5kLXZpcnR1YWwtcmVhbGl0eS1kb3VibGUtcGxheS10aGFsZXMtYWxlbmlhLXNwYWNl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Both augmented and virtual reality have quietly insinuated themselves into our daily lives. Why are these exciting new technologies now creating a buzz on the Net? Augmented and virtual reality, also known as AR and VR, have gone from underground to ubiquitous. One of the most visible reflections of society’s digital transformation, these technologies are also gaining ground in industry. The space industry, often at the forefront of technology, is obviously part of this reality double play.

Theoretically, virtual reality completely transports users into an imaginary 3D world. Wearing a specially-designed headset, they can interact with this environment, for example picking up an object or moving around. Along with this virtual plunge into an amazingly realistic universe, users may also be accompanied by a technology called sound spatialization. Users can not only move in this new environment, but also perceive all the surrounding acoustic sensations, so that virtual reality is almost more “real” than the actual world!



Augmented reality, on the other hand, is a measured mixture of virtual reality and the actual world. What it means in practice is overlaying or combining 2D or 3D information (images, data, schematics, etc.) with the user’s real world view. The user can then interact with this information using devices such as a headset, goggles, tablet or smartphone. In other words, the user’s perceived reality is augmented with digital information. This technology is very popular in certain sectors because augmented reality goggles are portable. Which means that users, especially in industry and hospitals, can be fully independent: they don’t have to drop what they’re doing to go find information on a separate screen, for example.

Thales Alenia Space: reality x 2!





From the auto and aviation industries, to healthcare and other sectors, virtual and augmented reality are now an integral part of production, maintenance and training. Since 2015, the space industry has multiplied projects based on the use of these two new technologies. Most facilities in Thales Alenia Space’s host countries have already deployed virtual and/or augmented reality, especially in Belgium, France, Italy and Spain.

Concrete achievements, vast possibilities



Building a satellite demands a huge amount of information, strict procedures and flawless traceability. Operatives have to be able to perform their assigned tasks without being blocked by problems of information transmission or availability. In the past, they spent nearly half of their daily operating time on the traceability of the tasks they had to perform, as well as looking for information. Augmented reality quickly came to the fore as an ideal information transmission medium, since it could receive info directly from the design department and place it directly in front of operatives in clean rooms. Using special goggles or a tablet, the operative sees a virtual image of the planned subassembly, right where it has to be assembled. All of the information needed for this job is concentrated in a single interface. By reducing operatives’ “travel time”, and eliminating repetitive tasks that add no value, augmented reality helps reduce the time needed to build a satellite.





Several Thales Alenia Space production facilities make wide use of virtual reality to organize the areas that will be used for satellite assembly, integration and testing (AIT). For example, this technology was used for an immersive look at the dimensions of the company’s planned stratospheric multi-mission airship, StratobusTM . It was also used at Thales Alenia Space’s clean rooms in Rome, to determine the best configuration for the assembly and integration of eight satellites in the O3b constellation. Of course, one of the key advantages of virtual reality is that it can quickly resolve all accessibility issues for the equipment that the operatives will be working on. For example, VR was used during the assembly of payload components on the SES-17 satellite.

Innovation across the board at Thales Alenia Space

Virtual and augmented reality are an integral part of Thales Alenia Space’s innovation-based strategy, expressed in the “Factory of the Future” concept. In the fiercely competitive sector of communications satellites, it is now an imperative to produce “faster, better, cheaper”. New technologies such as AR and VR have become essential tools in a drive to increase productivity in today’s fast-changing industrial environment. The “Factory of the Future” concept incorporates these state-of-the-art technologies to enhance the competitiveness of its production organization. “Innovation” may seem like nothing more than a trendy buzzword these days, but with the widespread deployment of robots, cobots, Factory 4.0, VR, AR and more, it has really come into its own at Thales Alenia Space!

A UK company has been selected to undertake the Assembly, Integration and Test (AIT) for a satellite which will help tackle climate change, Science Minister Jo Johnson announced today. Thales Alenia Space has signed a contract with the UK Space Agency to work on MicroCarb, a joint UK-French satellite mission which will measure sources and sinks of carbon, the principal greenhouse gas driving global warming. It is the first European mission intended to characterise greenhouse gas fluxes on Earth’s surface and gauge how much carbon is being absorbed by oceans and forests, the main sinks on the planet. The mission, scheduled to launch in 2020, will also contribute to international efforts to measure how much carbon gas is being emitted by natural processes and human activities. MicroCarb will enable the UK Space Agency and CNES to pave the way for a longer term operational system in response to the Paris COP21 Agreement. Thales Alenia Space engineers will work closely with the CNES project team and then take full responsibility to manage and deliver the satellite AIT programme at the UK’s National Satellite Test Facility (NSTF) in Harwell. This world class facility, due to open in 2020, has been awarded £99 million in funding by the UK Government’s Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund to boost the UK’s space capabilities for the design and build of more complex space instruments and technologically advanced satellites.

Science Minister, Jo Johnson, speaking on a visit to Thales Alenia Space’s Belfast facility, said: “The UK space sector is brimming with talent and our collaboration with France on MicroCarb is an excellent platform to demonstrate our cutting-edge science and engineering, which is at the core of our Industrial Strategy. It is great to see our £99m investment in the new National Satellite Test Facility is already making a difference for the sector. This facility will make Harwell a world-class hub for innovative space technology, helping UK companies like Thales Alenia Space be more competitive in the global market and support our ambition to capture 10% of the global space market by 2030.”

The contract reflects Thales Alenia Space’s strategy of growing its European footprint and is fully in line with market trends and growth dynamics.

Ben Olivier, CEO of Thales Alenia Space in the UK, said: “MicroCarb will be a significant demonstration of what space technology and science from satellites can contribute to the understanding of the carbon cycle; ultimately helping decision makers to develop the best policies to make the World a better place. We are proud to be a part of this effort.”

For Thales Alenia Space in the UK, this is a significant milestone in the recognition of the company’s developing capability as a Prime contractor in the UK for major space missions.



The Assembly Integration and Test of the MicroCarb satellite is Thales Alenia Space in the UK’s first opportunity to work with CNES to deliver on an important Earth Observation Mission.

The Cygnus Pressurized Cargo Module (PCM) is manufactured by Thales Alenia Space’s plant in Turin, Italy, under contract to the prime contractor Orbital ATK. Thales Alenia Space developed the design of the PCM by drawing on previous productions for the ISS, such as the Multi-Purpose Logistics Module (MPLM), built on behalf of the Italian space agency for NASA and carried many time by the U.S. Space Shuttle. Thales Alenia Space also played a key role on the Columbus laboratory and was prime contractor for Node 2, Node 3 and the Cupola, all still part of the ISS.

Cyg-nificant science!

The Cygnus spacecraft has evolved over the last few years into more than just a dedicated cargo carrier. For instance, in 2015, a Cygnus vessel carried a key scientific experiment, the Portable onboard 3D Printer, dedicated to test the 3D printing technology under zero gravity conditions.

The spaceborne 3D printer enabled the production of a small object from polymer materials built inside the International Space Station : that was a European first! It was used to conduct the Spacecraft Fire Safety Experiment, or SAFFIRE, developed by NASA to study flammability and fire propagation under zero gravity conditions and therefore improve crew safety.

The Cygnus spacecraft will continue to support “zero g” scientific experiments that cannot be done elsewhere, taking advantage of its regular trips to the space lab. Stay tuned for the latest adventures of the Cygnus PCM!

From Rail to Road: 'Big Data' and Transport - Thales,"Fri, 10 Nov 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi91bml0ZWQta2luZ2RvbS9uZXdzL3JhaWwtcm9hZC1iaWctZGF0YS1hbmQtdHJhbnNwb3J00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"From Rail to Road: ‘Big Data’ and Transport Share this article



LinkedIn

In August 2016, users of Singapore’s normally-reliable Circle Line increasingly found their daily journeys disrupted. Seemingly without warning, trains would suddenly apply their emergency brakes and rapidly come to a stop.



For the next few months, the problem persisted. Passengers became increasingly annoyed, but so too did the people at Singapore Mass Rapid Transport (SMRT), the line’s operator. It wasn’t that they didn’t know what the problem was - that much had been diagnosed relatively quickly. Periodically, the trains would suffer signal loss, which would rightly trigger the emergency brake. The problem was that they couldn’t find anything wrong with the trains affected or the signal transmitters. This seemed to happen entirely at random.

Eventually, as much in frustration as with any hope of resolution, SMRT and the LTA, Singapore’s transport authority, began to look outside of their immediate comfort zone for help. This led them to Singapore’s GovTech Data Science Division. More specifically, to data scientists Daniel Sim, Lee Shangqian and Clarence Ng.

“I take a train on the Circle Line to my office at one-north every morning.” Daniel Sim would later write. “So on 5 November, when my team was given the chance to investigate the cause, I volunteered without hesitation.”

Given the nature of their work, it is perhaps not surprising that Sim and the others in his team refused to accept that the problem was actually random. Yet the data available to disprove this was limited. SMRT could only provide the date and time of each incident, its location, the ID number of the train involved and the direction it was travelling in.

Nonetheless, Sim and his team got to work, compiling the data into a useful format and setting to work on its analysis. Their early efforts revealed little of promise. The incidents were spread throughout the day and happened at various locations. Nor did they seem to affect only a small group of trains.

None of this was news to SMRT. Indeed it largely reflected what they’d concluded themselves. As dedicated data scientists, however, Sim and his colleagues weren’t finished. They kept working with the data, looking for a better way to visualise it. They decided to plot the relationship between the passage of time, trains, and location in a more complex way so, inspired by Edward Tufte, they put together a Marey Chart.

And suddenly, there on the screen, they begin to see a pattern. The breakdowns always happened in sequence. Whenever a train got hit by signal interference, another train behind it, moving in the same direction, would be affected soon after.

“What we’d established was that there seemed to be a pattern over time and location.” Sim wrote. “Incidents were happening one after another, in the opposite direction of the previous incident. It seemed almost like there was a “trail of destruction”.

This pattern got Sim and his team thinking: Maybe the trains that were experiencing the problem weren’t causing it. Maybe it was something that was being done to them. For this to be true, however, then that cause would also have to be moving. Otherwise, the signal loss would happen in a more consistent location. This led to an obvious question - what was happening on the other track at the time each incident occurred?

That question, in turn, led the team to a hypothesis - the line had a mysterious ‘rogue train’. One that was fine in and of itself, but whose proximity to other trains would somehow cause them problems.

It was a solid hypothesis and one that should have been easy enough to test. The problem was, the dataset that SMRT had provided Sim’s team was incomplete. SMRT didn’t have data available, at least in a format the team could work with, on where every train on the network had been at the time of each incident.

Unwilling to admit defeat, however, the team got permission to head down to Kim Chuan Train Depot that night and get creative. It wasn’t that SMRT didn’t have that data, they suspected, it was just that they weren’t thinking about data in the right way.





The rogue one

By 03:00 the next morning Sim and his team were tired, but feeling confident. At the depot, they had found the extra data source they needed - video records of every departure from every station. It had been a painstaking, manual process, but by cross-checking incident times against video recordings of station platform departures they had identified a likely candidate for their rogue train hypothesis - unit PV46.

Later that day, SMRT put the team’s theory to the test - PV46 went into service during off-peak hours and, as the team had predicted, a number of failures soon occurred. On Monday, this happened again. SMRT removed the train from service and, after careful investigation, the issue finally became clear. For reasons unknown, PV46 had developed a unique fault - its signalling hardware was emitting additional, erroneous signals. This didn’t affect its own operational pattern, but it meant that, when PV46, another unit and the trackside signalling system were in a specific alignment, the other train’s own signal would be interrupted.

By analysing the data, and by finding more of it to fill the gaps in their knowledge, Sim and his team had solved the Circle Line mystery.



Bringing ‘Big Data’ to rail

“If you look at why ‘Big Data’ and ‘Industrial Internet’ has happened now and not, say, 15 or even 10 years ago. If you ask ‘what has caused this digital revolution now?’ It’s a kind of perfect storm.”

John Raymond is a Director of Digital Services at Thales. That title brings with it both the responsibility for their cloud-based Asset Management solution for railways and metro systems around the world and an understanding that situations (and solutions) like those seen in Singapore are increasingly common.

“The cost of transmitting data has significantly reduced.” He continues. “The cost of storing data in the cloud is negligible, and the personal revolution of the internet now gives us the ability to access that data anywhere, anytime, on any platform.”

‘Big Data’ and ‘Industrial Internet’ may seem like buzzwords, but ultimately they’re just technical shorthand for the world that John describes - one in which it is possible to track, store and access data about infrastructure and networks on a level that has not previously been seen.

None of those activities in themselves would be special. In combination, however, they enable exactly the kind of activities that Sim’s team undertook in Singapore. They allow both human and, increasingly, automatic assessment of the state of a piece of infrastructure. That assessment can then be used to spot emerging problems and trigger interventions before they occur, or - as in Singapore - help make seemingly random occurrences significantly less so.

As a concept, of course, this is nothing new. The ‘predict and prevent’ maintenance methodology has existed since the moment the first linesman walked the track, tapping the rail. What’s changed, however, is the cost of collecting and storing the information. Where once actively monitoring the state of an asset required frequent, physical inspection and acres of physical storage space, now the same information can be gathered, transmitted and stored remotely.



This doesn’t just make gathering (and storing) the same information as before cheaper. It also opens up a whole new range of data sources on which decisions can be based.

“As an example, let’s take a level crossing.” Raymond says. “Twenty years ago, how interested was someone in knowing how many times that had gone up and down? Even if they were, the cost of storing that data was prohibitive. No one would have wanted to keep that data for five years at that point, because it was pointless – how were you going to use it? How were you going to transmit it? It just wasn’t worthwhile.”

Today, however, that information can be added to the pool. It becomes another data point available for establishing the health of the infrastructure and - beyond that - contributing to strategic decisions about the railways.

Just how quickly the railways can adapt to this change, however, is something that is still to be seen.

“Big Data is mostly being used really for maintenance rather than operational decisions.” Raymond admits. ""You’re using data to predict failure.”

“It can do more than that, but to make strategic decisions you need more data.”

Gathering that extra data isn’t always simple. The railways bring with them a unique set of challenges, not least due to the slow pace at which various layers of the underlying infrastructure change. Baking the ability to collect and transmit data into new systems is easy. Retro-fitting it is significantly harder - particularly in areas with a long railway history, like London.

“The whole point of digitisation is you need assets that can produce data.” Raymond explains. “If you’ve got Victorian infrastructure, I can’t help you. Even systems that are twenty years old… the skills and technology move so fast that there often aren’t enough people around anymore that understand how the software on them was built and really works.”

This isn’t to say that gathering data from those systems isn’t possible, just that the options are limited.

“If you’ve got a railway that is particularly old and unreliable, you could say ‘where is it unreliable?’ But it does limit what you can do.”



The devil in the analysis

Gathering the data is, of course, only half of the battle. In order to draw effective conclusions, it has to be both the right data and be analysed.

“A lot of organisations go into this and think Big Data is the end result.” Raymond explains. “In a way, I suppose it is. Provided you do the analysis, and use that data in the right way.”

That analysis isn’t always easy. As Sims admits in his own, comprehensive write up of the events in Singapore, the team there got lucky. The distribution pattern of stations and the train frequencies on the Circle Line meant that the failures happened close together. This resulted in a clear pattern once the data was plotted correctly. That pattern would still have been there if the network had been shaped differently, but it would have been far harder for a data scientist unfamiliar with transport infrastructure to spot.

“Cross-industry, at the moment this is an area being dominated by traditional IT companies.” Says Raymond. “They struggle to understand how a railway works though. They don’t understand the challenges that the industry has. They don’t, for example, build point machines, so they don’t understand the different ways in which point machines fail.”

That understanding is critical, he says. So is accepting that the act of analysing the data, at least to begin with, is just as likely to highlight gaps in an operator’s knowledge that need to be filled as it is to yield quick solutions to perceived problems.

“Those companies that start off small, incrementally proving that Big Data has a ‘Small Data’ application, they generally get there.” He comments. “It may take longer, but each expansion – from operational to strategic – leaves them understanding how to use data and what they should be collecting, a little bit better.”

That incremental approach is something that traditionally hasn’t sat well in rail. This is one area in which Raymond argues the industry needs to accept that planning for, collecting and analysing infrastructure data is a bit different.

“The cost of repeating the architecture if you end up having two Big Data systems isn’t enormous.” He says. “Prove to the business that you can deliver direct, digital change and the architecture will follow. That’s more important.”

“Predictive analytics and assisted decision-making are difficult to adapt to culturally, though.” He admits. “And a lot of this is about cultural change and changes to the business model. Air traffic management faced a similar issue in previous decades. Rail has lagged behind that.”



Changing road infrastructure management

Bringing that same Big Data approach to roads is the next challenge. As with rail, this represents its own, unique challenge. Not least because in some ways roads are actually significantly ahead.

“With everything that’s going on in the road market with regards to driverless cars and Uber, it’s more advanced and taking a larger risk in some areas.” Says Raymond.



At the same time, however, he acknowledges that the role Big Data can play in addressing the wider strategic and operational issues the road industry faces is still open to debate.

Partly, this is because those issues are broad, but it’s also because so too are the opportunities for intervention. This makes finding the right starting points (and establishing both their cost and impact) more complex.

An obvious opportunity for Big Data exists in smoothing traffic management and reducing congestion, for example, and in various areas, this is already underway. Not only does this have a positive impact on journey times, but it helps tackle the problem of emissions-based pollution as well. Something that’s an increasingly critical issue for cities like London.

Yet this isn’t the only potential low-hanging fruit in this area. One of the biggest causes of delays in the capital is badly-timed (or badly placed) roadworks. Taking the ‘predict and prevent’ methodology more effectively to road, thus allowing critical works to be scheduled for less-busy times ahead of actual infrastructure failure, would have a similar effect.

Which of those two things would have more of an impact both for road users and the bodies tasked with managing local and national infrastructure? Which is more likely to trigger that cultural transition to an organisation which ‘gets’ the need to digitally iterate? What else can be done?

This is a debate which we will return to in future.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9808652997016907}",neutral,0.9808652997016907,0

Each month we celebrate our engineering community who are flying the flag for STEM in the UK!

The 2016 Engineering UK report highlights that companies are projected to need 182,000 additional people with engineering skills each year until 2022. Why should we – and more importantly – why should you care? The need for engineers and those with STEM qualifications is critical to the UK infrastructure and our development of new technologies, which will have a significant impact on the UK’s economy.

One of the biggest challenges for Thales in the UK is breaking the stereotypes, debunking the myths and demystifying what an engineer does; shaping a sustainable future by crafting solutions to everyday problems we face. Sustainability and diversity are two pinnacles of our ability to innovate, so Thales is striving to champion opportunities for everyone – regardless of demographic or background – to pursue careers in engineering.

The path to reduce the gender gap may not be as clear. For every parent, young person and teacher, it's important to recognise the part you play in solving this problem.

Dylan Halpin, a rail engineering apprentice at Thales UK, shares with us her experience on how she started working for Thales.

""I have always had a passion for maths, particularly as my father was a big influencer in this regard. This led me to pursue studying maths for my A-levels, however whilst making a choice for my course, I discovered Electronic and Electrical Engineering. I fell in love with it during those two years, which led to my decision to study Engineering at university. A twist of events around student finance meant that I missed the start date of the course, and I decided I didn't want to study something else or wait another year. Instead, I chose to pursue a rail engineer apprenticeship with Thales. I'm now in my second year in the scheme working with Thales, based at Waterloo Station, and I love it.

You're working with London Underground, which is the world's third longest system with 250 miles worth of track. How interesting a place is it to work?

“My day to day role is working in a great team of radio engineers that test the voice quality of messages passed over the connect radio system, which Thales has manufactured. We test the signal strength in places that anyone working on the station might need, to ensure they are able to make contact for help if necessary. With the data collected they produce a report to highlight problem areas or deterioration in quality, so that it can be corrected and retested to ensure London Underground has a complete coverage of service. These radios are a lifeline to all who use the tube.""

""I get to explore the unseen rooms of London Underground. I visit all of the stations across the Tube network to test the frequency and reception of each room, as well as intervention points in the tunnels. Like any urban explorer would understand, the disused trains and platforms are exciting to visit. Just last week we visited the spot in the Green Park station, which Winston Churchill had used as an underground bunker.



""Whilst in college, I was a STEM ambassador. I visited primary schools to engage with children and promote STEM subjects. It was inspiring to see the kids' thought processes – they have a diverse way of problem-solving, just like engineers do. It's important to celebrate the diverse way we think and tackle problems!

""I work with a wonderful team of people with diverse minds, all of whom are from different disciplines and ages with a range of experience. These people have taught me a lot and been helpful when it comes to offering career advice. Recently, two other female apprentices have joined, so we are a diverse team in an inclusive environment. I'm very happy where I am.""

W h at advice would you give to someone who is looking to pursue a career in engineering?

""There are a lot of everyday things that solutions need to be found for, which keeps the job open-ended and gives a lot of scope for growth and specialisation. I would advise them to take on as much experience as possible, as this helps to gain knowledge from people that have been in the industry for years, but once you find something that challenges and interests you, stick with it to learn as much as possible! As our social requirements evolve, so does the complexity of problems within society. It is important to have this thought process to look at things in a different light. Engineering opens a world of possibilities for your career. If you want an exciting job with many avenues for growth, choose engineering!""","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.8934310078620911}",neutral,0.8934310078620911,0

Thales is proud to be part of a joint Ministry of Defence-industry team to be recognised for its excellence in delivering UK armed forces with a ‘world leading and unique’ surveillance system to protect troops from the threat of biological attack.

The CBRN Delivery Team was presented with a Minister for Defence Procurement Acquisition Award by Harriett Baldwin MP at a ceremony at the MOD Main Building on November 28.



​The new protection system is called Biological Surveillance and Collector System (BSCS) and the first were signed into service earlier this year to be operated by the RAF Regiment.

CBRN stands for Chemical biological, radiological and nuclear and the system is designed to protect UK’s forces overseas from biological attack by detecting incoming attacking particles in the air through specialised sensors and evaluating equipment.

Developed by Thales in partnership with Defence Equipment & Support and Dstl, the programme involved a partnership of 26 organisations and SMEs, the majority from the UK. Technical partners and experts, including Williams Advanced Engineering, were selected to build this leading edge technical solution.

Speaking during the system’s launch earlier this year, Air Commodore David Lee, responsible for the delivery of this capability into service, said “BSCS is a critical capability for our deployed forces in an uncertain world. Asymmetric Warfare has presented CBRN challenges, the most recent of which being the chemical attacks in Syria - the biological threat to our forces is no less critical.""

“The integrated project team of DE&S, Thales, Dstl and the RAF Regiment have worked extremely hard over the last two years to develop this world-leading and unique system.”

Gareth Williams, Vice President of Thales UK’s Security business, said: “We are delighted to have part of the wider team to receive an award from the Minister. Our team has developed this leading edge biological surveillance capability through excellent cooperation with the experts at Dstl and DE&S and technical partners such as Williams. Working together with a strong UK supply chain - including SMEs - has been key to its success.”

Minister for Defence Procurement, Harriett Baldwin, said:

CAIRO – 16 November 2017: Spanish company Thales Group established a three-year contract with the Egyptian National Railway (ENR) estimated at €127.2 million to modernize its signaling and telecommunications systems and all works related to the 180-kilometer long section of line.



The line runs between the towns of Asiut, Qena and Nag Hammadi, located in the Upper Egypt portion of the Alexandria–Cairo–Aswan rail corridor.



The project is among ENR's infrastructure transformation plan, promoted by the Ministry of Transportation and financed by the World Bank, according to Spanish newspaper El Periódico. The project aims to improve traffic and allow trains to travel around the country at higher speeds.



The president of Thales Group said that ENR is the biggest railway operator in Africa.



The project also includes full protection of signaling and telecommunications systems against cyber-attacks, to ensure safety and system availability and to take all necessary measures to protect civilians from risks of cyber-attacks.



Egyptian efforts to improve its railway network include comprehensive renovations by the Egyptian Railway Authority (ERA), which will include 110 new train conductors and 1,300 new train carriages due to start working in January, the head of ERA, Sayed Salem said on Wednesday.



The ERA is working on renovating 1,220 kilometers of railway line, of which 200 kilometers have already been completed, Salem added in a press conference.



Banha-Alexandria and Beni Suef-Assuit train signaling systems will be updated to an electronic system, which will be finished by January 2019, Salem noted.



The SNCF, France’s national state-owned rail way company will also provide technical assistance and training.



Additionally, the private sector is expected to become involved in the railway sector in 2018 as amendments to the Railway Act — which would open up the sector to private companies—are expected to be introduced to parliament next month, according to Hesham Arafat, Egypt’s Transportation minister.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999164342880249}",neutral,0.9999164342880249,0

Modernisation of the Entire Italian Rail Network

This project is part of a long term strategic plan initiated by RFI for the modernisation of the entire Italian rail network. As part of this contract, Thales is in charge of deploying new integrated communication and supervision systems that will improve security in 61 railway stations. These new systems will facilitate the operation of all auxiliary security systems. They will be supported by users friendly interfaces to enable real time situational awareness, and enable operators to respond immediately in case of aggressions, acts of vandalism or violent behaviours and all other incidents requiring the physical intervention of security personnel. The ultimate aim is to optimise operational processes for security personnel, and allow them to respond more proactively in order to enhance passenger safety.

This latest contract follows an earlier one signed in 2008 for 143 stations.

New Security Systems

The new systems are designed to seamlessly integrate with legacy systems and ensure operational continuity within the scope of the 5-year warranty and maintenance services. The proposed solutions, include the introduction of new centralised software platforms to broaden the spectrum of activities that can be monitored at reduced maintenance costs. In addition, the integration of new technologies represents an important step by RFI in their efforts to guarantee livable and secure stations to become integral parts of the new cities, improving passengers experience.

Roberto Tazzioli, Country director for Thales in Italy, said:

This new contract reaffirms Thales’ capabilities in physical site security for critical infrastructure like rail network and stations. We’ve been a long standing partner of RFI and have proven expertise in this field as Thales and its partners have more than 10 years of experience of successful contract delivery for similar projects for RFI.

Software glitch in signalling system led to Joo Koon train collision - Yahoo Singapore News,"Wed, 15 Nov 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vc2cubmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vZ2xpdGNoLXNpZ25hbGxpbmctc3lzdGVtLWxlZC10cmFpbi1jb2xsaXNpb24tam9vLWtvb24tbXJ0LXN0YXRpb24tMTQwNzAzNjQ0Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Alvin Kek (left), SMRT Trains’ senior vice-president for rail operations (NSEWL) and Chua Chong Keng, LTA’s deputy chief executive officer, at Wednesday’s (15 November) press conference.

A software glitch in the East-West Line (EWL) signalling system was behind Wednesday (15 November) morning’s collision at Joo Koon station, according to preliminary findings by the Land Transport Authority (LTA), train operator SMRT and French conglomerate Thales.

At about 8.18am, a train heading towards Tuas Link station stopped at Joo Koon station to detrain passengers due to a fault in the train signalling system. At 8.19am, a second train stopped 10.7m behind the first train, in accordance with the existing safety protocol for safe stopping distance between two trains.

A minute late, the first train’s doors closed but before it could move off, the second train was activated by the signalling system and moved forward, hitting the first train at a speed of 16kmh.

The first train was found to have departed Ulu Pandan Depot with a software protection feature but this was removed when it passed by a faulty signalling circuit. As such, when the train arrived at Joo Koon station, its profile on the new Communication-Based Train Control (CBTC) signalling system showed it as a three-car train instead of a six-car train.

Consequently, the second train misjudged the distance between the two, thereby causing the collision.

This information was shared with the media by LTA deputy chief executive Chua Chong Kheng at a press conference held on Wednesday evening at SMRT’s headquarters along North Bridge Road.

Chua emphasised that investigations were still ongoing as to why the software protection feature had been removed.

Checks will be conducted on the whole network that uses the CBTC system, he said, but emphasis would be placed on the EWL, which is undergoing the transition from the older system to the new one.

The EWL currently runs on the older signalling system from Pasir Ris to Pioneer stations, and on the new system from Joo Koon to Tuas Link. As a precautionary measure, all trains will undergo an additional layer of control measures and manual checks before they are deployed.

Story continues

Operations from Joo Koon to Tuas Link stations will also be suspended for the whole of Thursday (16 November) for Thales, the French conglomerate that is supplying the new signalling system, LTA and SMRT to conduct checks. Bus bridging services will also be deployed for the affected stretch.

Other precautions being taken include reminders to be sent to train captains to be “a lot more vigilant” even if they are driving the trains in automatic mode, said Alvin Kek, SMRT’s senior vice-president for rail operations (North-South East-West Lines).

“Secondly, we have increased the separation of the trains, the distance between the trains travelling on both lines,” he added, referring to both the EWL and North-South Line (NSL). This will result in a lengthened train headway, which refers to the time between trains at stations.

The train headway has been increased from 2 minutes to “2.5 or 3 minutes”, said Kek, who added that the new measure was implemented on Wednesday afternoon.

Signalling systems still operationally safe

Thales has confirmed that the old and new signalling systems continue to be safe for operation, said Chua.

According to Thales representative Peter Tawn, who was also at the conference, the safety distance that the system allows for between trains differs according to the speed at which they are travelling.

“It’s a dynamic signalling system… the slower it goes, the closer they can be together, the faster the trains are travelling, the greater the distance,” Tawn said.

Kek said that while there are systems in place that allow captains to halt the trains in emergency situations, investigations are still being conducted to assess whether the driver of the second train had enough time to react given the short distance between the trains.

There were only 10 seconds between when the second train started moving and when it came into contact with the first train, he noted.

Injured passengers

It was also revealed that the captain of the second train was one of the two SMRT staff injured in the accident, the other being an assistant station manager who had helped to detrain passengers.

All the injured commuters were from the second train while there was no injured in the first train as commuters have detrained from it. In total, 36 people were injured in the accident and have been attended to at the National University Hospital and Ng Teng Fong General Hospital.

Most of the injuries were related to knocks, falls and bruises, with one passenger suffering a broken tooth and another having fainted, Chua said.

When asked about which party should take responsibility for the collision, Chua said, “We are looking to Thales in terms of the solution, and also to convince SMRT and (LTA) that the system is safe… We will work as a team but, primarily, the responsibility for the signalling safety is with the supplier.”

Regarding the safety of the Thales’ system, Tawn said “We’ve never had an incident of this nature. In fact, the CBTC system … has been, I think, on record one of the safest systems. We’ve never had a collision.”

The last such front-to-back train collision took place in August 1993 at Clementi station, which left 156 people injured. In the wake of the accident, an independent inquiry panel was formed to look into the matter and SMRT subsequently revised some of its operating procedures.

Note: This story was updated at 7pm on 16 November 2017 to reflect the latest number of injured persons involved in the collision

What wasn’t known at the time was that the level of integration achieved between the Boeing Insitu ScanEagle and the guided missile frigate’s Thales-developed Australian Distributed Architecture Combat System (ADACS) may have been a world first.

“To the best of our knowledge, no-one else has yet had a UAV integrated into a combat system effectively as a shipboard organic sensor,” Damien Elford, director Above Water Systems at Thales Australia commented.

“Previous trials enable operators to see the live video and that’s very exciting, but that’s the relatively easy bit.”

ScanEagle’s proprietary control station and microwave line-of-sight uplinks and downlinks were used during the evaluation for flight controls and streaming position and sensor data to the host ship.

“The original plan was to have ScanEagle as a standalone system, with streaming video viewed at the control station in the hangar and the operations room advised by voice of developments – that was the extent of it,” Elford said. “But we ran the video cable up into the ops room so the video could be displayed on all the consoles.”

“Importantly, we also achieved digital integration via ADACS, so the track information reported from ScanEagle’s sensors was taken into the C² systems. Additionally, the UAV was reporting its own position so we could report both out on the datalinks to the task group for greater situational awareness.”

We had undertaken significant R&D work that was able to be quickly leveraged to deliver the capability in a very short period of time

Elford said the team was able to task ScanEagle dynamically; for instance by programming waypoints or loitering positions while the vehicle was in the air, either with or without a man-in-the-loop.

Integration development was undertaken at the Thales facility in Leederville near Perth, facilitated by cooperation with Insitu Pacific and with the Navy Unmanned Aircraft System Unit (NUASU).

“It was on a fortuitous visit by Navy and CASG to the Thales site that they realised we had undertaken significant R&D work that was able to be quickly leveraged to deliver the capability in a very short period of time,” Elford explained.

“We undertook the architecture of how we’re progressing UAV integration in a fairly generic fashion, we’ve been agnostic on the platform and concentrated on how to make the most of the onboard sensors.”

The one exception was the inclusion of the Thales Fulmar fixed wing mini-UAV in the Sea 129 Phase 5 Stage 1 Request for Information (RfI) for a maritime tactical unmanned air system to be operated by the RAN’s forthcoming offshore patrol vessels. The RfI closed in July.

Thales Australia had also undertaken integration work with the Schiebel S-100 Camcopter UAV, two systems of which have recently been acquired by the RAN as part of its continuing evaluation of rotary wing versus fixed wing UAVs.

“If somebody asked ‘can you plug a Schiebel into ADACS?’ Thales would respond that we’ve already got the code there, it just needs some final testing,” Elford commented.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999420642852783}",neutral,0.9999420642852783,0

However, that reputation has taken a hit, of late, when a stalled Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) train was rear-ended by another train, injuring 29 commuters.

This was the third incident to happen in two months after two separate incidents occurred last month. First, a section of a tunnel was flooded between Bishan and Braddell MRT stations after a heavy downpour and later that evening, a small fire was reported trackside in the tunnel near the Marina Bay MRT Station.

Thales takes ‘full responsibility’

A joint press release by the Singaporean Land Transport Authority (LTA) MRT operator, SMRT Cooperation yesterday determined that the train collision “was caused by an unexpected disabling of a protective feature on the train that was hit.” A software glitch by the signalling system provider Thales led to miscommunication between the old and the new signalling systems which then caused the collision.

Thales has taken “full responsibility” of the incident.

“I want to take the opportunity to apologise to the commuters whose travels were disrupted especially to those who were injured due to the accident,” Thales Executive Vice President, Millar Crawford said in a press conference.

He added that Thales is pooling its own resources and working hand in hand with the LTA and SMRT to ensure a “deep and meaningful” examination of the accident.

Public perception affected

Singapore’s train networks are currently being improved and general public perception is at all time high according to a recent survey conducted by the Public Transport Council. However, recent incidences like the collision and tunnel flooding have caused immense delays for commuters and has been testing the public’s patience.

Singaporean satisfaction towards the country's public transport system

“I can say the MRT is a relatively good transport system. However, the number of MRT incidences does not justify the amount of money spent on it. There's some serious systemic problems that the transport minister needs to address,” said Singaporean citizen, Anand Ramchandani, a frequent user of the MRT.

Another Singaporean, Farid Alias lamented that the MRT problem has been an issue for several years now. He thinks that the broader issue at hand is that the Singaporean government’s mantra of ‘world class efficiency’ is now at risk.

“Staying in Jakarta for almost eight years, you get frustrated with the transportation system and traffic but you accept it because, well, the government isn’t that efficient in finding solutions. You got to ask, why are they taking this long to do something or what are they actually doing to make it as efficient as it was before,” he opined.

Towards a car-lite nation

Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, during his party’s convention, acknowledged the people’s frustration in light of the recent mishaps.

“We have made progress, but there have been setbacks,” Lee said.

Nevertheless, Lee maintains that the standards of public transportation in Singapore is still “first class.”

In a recent ranking of Smart Cities released by Swedish based company, Easy Park, Singapore was ranked second after Copenhagen. However, in terms of public transportation, Singapore was ranked first, with a perfect 10 score.

Singapore’s public transportation network – not limited to the MRT – services the entire island nation. Given that the cost of owning a car in the Singapore is one of the highest in the world, most Singaporeans are reliant on public trains and buses for daily travel. The densely populated city state has close to 1 million cars on the road.Late last month, the government announced that it sought to freeze the number of private passenger cars allowed on its roads starting in 2018 in a bid to reduce traffic congestion.

Now more than ever, the republic has to ensure that its public transportation system is operating at its maximum efficiency as the government’s latest policy is bound to increase the number of daily commuters. Nevertheless, over the past six years, the Singaporean government has expanded the public transportation network by 30 percent and added 41 new train stations. It also plans to invest 20 billion dollars to improve public transportation infrastructure over the next five years.

Train services between Joo Koon and Tuas Link to be suspended for at least a day on Nov 16 - TODAY,"Wed, 15 Nov 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvZGF5b25saW5lLmNvbS9zaW5nYXBvcmUvdHJhaW4tc2VydmljZXMtYmV0d2Vlbi1qb28ta29vbi1hbmQtdHVhcy1saW5rLWJlLXN1c3BlbmRlZC1sZWFzdC1kYXktbm92LTE20gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"SINGAPORE – Train services between Joo Koon and Tuas Link stations will be suspended for at least a day on Thursday (Nov 16) so that “assurance checks” can be conducted with signalling system supplier Thales, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) said following a collision between two trains that injured 29 people.

“We are planning to suspend (operations) for a whole day, to give us adequate time and make sure that we do a thorough check along with Thales,"" LTA's deputy chief executive Mr Chua Chong Kheng told reporters at a press conference on Wednesday evening.

Mr Alvin Kek, SMRT's senior vice president for rail operations (NSEWL), added that commuters can also expect longer waiting times for trains, due to an increase in separation distance between the trains. Bus bridging services would be provided during the affected period.

Mr Kek said the longer waiting times for trains, which could increase from “two minutes to two-and-a-half, three minutes”, is already in place. This could explain why commuters have been experiencing increased delays since Wednesday afternoon, he added.

Trains will go through an additional layer of control measures and manual checks before they are deployed, as a precautionary measure, said Mr Chua.

Senior officials from LTA, SMRT and Thales held a press briefing on Wednesday to explain the incident at Joo Koon, the second major MRT collision in 24 years. Preliminary investigations suggested that it was due to a software failure, causing an approaching train to misjudge the distance with a stationary train in the station.

The East-West Line is currently running on two signalling systems - a legacy one for the stretch from Pasir Ris to Pioneer, while the section from Joo Koon to Tuas Link uses the new signalling system.

Thales assured at the briefing that both signalling systems continue to be safe for operation. Senior executives from the company said they would be looking at individual circuits where they suspect the faults could be coming from, and are also looking into all systems and software.

Following the train collision, SMRT train captains have also been told to be more vigilant, said Mr Kek. He added: ""We have told our train captains to be more vigilant in (handling) the train even if the trains are driven in an automatic mode.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9989116191864014}",neutral,0.9989116191864014,0
Poland eyes purchase of Hawkei vehicles and Adelaide class frigates | ADBR - ADBR,"Thu, 02 Nov 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vYWRici5jb20uYXUvcG9sYW5kLWV5ZXMtcHVyY2hhc2Utb2YtaGF3a2VpLXZlaGljbGVzLWFuZC1hZGVsYWlkZS1jbGFzcy1mcmlnYXRlcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Minister for Defence Industry Christopher Pyne has visited Poland to support a bid by Thales Australia to export the Hawkei protected vehicle, and to strengthen the defence relationship between Australia and Poland.

Minister Pyne also discussed an expression of interest in purchasing Adelaide class frigates from Australia as they are withdrawn from service over the next two years.

Poland is working to significantly modernise its military capabilities, Pyne said in a statement, and is looking to initially acquire about 50 protected mobility vehicles, with follow-on acquisition programs expected to increase this figure to approximately 700 vehicles.

“Thales Australia’s Hawkei vehicle is ideally placed to provide Poland’s defence forces with the world-class protected vehicle capability they need,” Minister Pyne said.

“The vehicle is a fantastic example of the innovation and capability of Australia’s defence industry. It builds upon Thales Australia’s international success with the Bushmaster vehicle, which is in service with seven countries.

“If successful, Thales Australia’s bid to export the Hawkei to Poland will provide additional work and job security for their Hawkei workforce and the supply chain to Thales.”

During the visit, Pyne witnessed the signing of a memorandum of intent between Polish company WB Electronics and Cablex, which has its headquarters in Melbourne, to work together and look to provide WB’s communications systems and unmanned aircraft systems to the Australian government and other customers.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.95863276720047}",positive,0.95863276720047,1
