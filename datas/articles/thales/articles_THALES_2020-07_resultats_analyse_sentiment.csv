A critical step to human space exploration

NASA’s lunar rover will explore the South Pole of the Moon in search for water ice and other potential resources by means of its three instruments and a 1-meter (3.28-foot) drill. The data collected by the rover will show where the Moon’s water ice is most likely to be found and easiest to access. The first water maps of the Moon will mark a critical step forward in NASA’s Artemis program to establish a sustainable human presence on the surface of the Moon later this decade. Furthermore, the exploration of lunar resources to produce oxygen and propellants could enable new mission architectures to human space exploration. The VIPER rover will be delivered to the Moon as part of NASA’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS). With a launch foreseen in late 2023, the mission will have a duration of 100 Earth days, covering 3 cycles of lunar day and night.

Thales Alenia Space wins lion's share of newly awarded Copernicus contracts - SpaceNews,"Mon, 06 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS90aGFsZXMtYWxlbmlhLXNwYWNlLXdpbnMtbGlvbnMtc2hhcmUtb2YtbmV3bHktYXdhcmRlZC1jb3Blcm5pY3VzLWNvbnRyYWN0cy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"WASHINGTON — Thales Alenia Space of France and Italy won the largest share of prime contracts the European Space Agency awarded July 1 for further development of six new Copernicus satellite missions.

All told, Thales Alenia Space was awarded the lead development role for three of the six planned Earth-observation missions, a contract haul totaling more than 1.4 billion euros ($1.6 billion). The Thales-led missions will use synthetic aperture radar, hyperspectral imaging and microwave radiometry to monitor the Earth’s oceans and land masses to track soil moisture, ocean salinity, and sea ice concentrations, among other variables.

Airbus Defence and Space, with a win apiece for its German and Spanish divisions, hauled in 675 million euros in prime contract awards for missions that will employ a mix of radar altimetry, microwave radiometry and thermal infrared imaging to keep tabs on sea ice thickness and land surface temperatures.

OHB Space Systems of Germany, meanwhile, won a 445-million-euro contract to lead the further development of a mission that will employ near-infrared and shortwave-infrared spectrometers to monitor the impact of human activity on atmospheric carbon dioxide.

The 2.55 billion euros in contract awards kick off the key design phase for the six missions, leading to a planned mid-to-late 2021 decision on proceeding into full development.

More details on the selected missions, and how they fit into Europe’s broader Copernicus program, can be found in the news release ESA issued July 3:

Contracts awarded for development of six new Copernicus missions Following the financial commitment from ESA Member States at last November’s Council at Ministerial Level Space19+, ESA’s industrial policy committee has approved contracts totalling €2.55 billion to forward the development of six new Copernicus satellite missions, each mission comprising two satellites, a development and a recurrent unit. The overall package is co-funded by the EU and ESA Member States, and relies on future funding from the EU Multiannual financial framework. The approval provides the green light to start industrial contracts for the six missions. However, two important milestones need to be met before the missions can be fully developed: an agreement between ESA and the EU for the EU co-funded part of the programme, and a positive decision by the EC as well as ESA/EU Member States to go from Phase B2 to Phase C/D. This decision point is planned in the second half of 2021. Copernicus is the biggest provider of Earth observation data in the world – and while the EU is at the helm of this environmental monitoring programme, ESA develops, builds and launches the dedicated satellites. It also operates some of the missions and ensures the availability of data from third party missions. Copernicus is often quoted as a prime example how the European Commission and ESA can successfully work together in space, making perfect use of each other’s strengths. The current suite of Sentinel missions are at the heart of the programme. Data from the Sentinels feed into the Copernicus Services, which help address challenges such as food security, air pollution, rising sea levels, diminishing polar ice, natural disasters and, importantly, climate change. Looking to the future, six high-priority candidate missions will expand the current capabilities of the Sentinels and address EU policy priorities and gaps in Copernicus user needs. The new industrial contracts now kick off the key design phases (Phase B) for these six missions. The Copernicus Anthropogenic Carbon Dioxide Monitoring, CO2M, mission will carry a near-infrared and shortwave-infrared spectrometer to measure atmospheric carbon dioxide produced by human activity. OHB-System Germany will lead the development with a contract value of €445 million. The Copernicus Hyperspectral Imaging Mission, CHIME, will carry a hyperspectral imager to return detailed information for sustainable agricultural and biodiversity management. Thales Alenia Space France will lead the development with a contract value of €455 million. The Copernicus Imaging Microwave Radiometer, CIMR, mission will carry a microwave radiometer to provide observations of sea-surface temperature, sea-ice concentration and sea-surface salinity. Thales Alenia Space Italy will lead the development with a contract value of €495 million. The Copernicus Polar Ice and Snow Topography Altimeter, CRISTAL, mission will carry a multi-frequency radar altimeter and microwave radiometer to measure and monitor sea-ice thickness and overlying snow depth. Airbus Defence and Space Germany will lead the development with a contract value of €300 million. The Copernicus Land Surface Temperature Monitoring, LSTM, mission will carry a high spatial-temporal resolution thermal infrared sensor to provide observations of land-surface temperature for sustainable agriculture and to predict drought. Airbus Defence and Space Spain will lead the development with a contract value of €375 million. The L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar, ROSE-L, mission will carry an L-band synthetic radar altimeter that penetrates through materials such as vegetation, to support forest management and to monitor subsidence and soil moisture. Thales Alenia Space Italy will lead the development with a contract value of €482 million. ESA’s Director General, Jan Wörner, said, “With us concerned about issues such as climate change, Europe’s Copernicus programme and the Sentinel missions play a pivotal role in providing free and open data to manage the environment.

“These new contracts are the next step in ensuring the family of Copernicus satellites expands to deliver vital information that will ultimately help protect the environment and citizens alike.” European Commission’s Deputy-Director General for Space, Pierre Delsaux, noted, “Copernicus is a European success story and the cooperation between the European Commission and ESA is exemplary in implementing this programme. These new Copernicus satellite missions will not only provide key information for European citizens and decision makers to support the implementation of the European Green Deal, but also to further contribute to the EU’s Digital Agenda.” ESA’s Director of Earth Observation Programmes, Josef Aschbacher, added, “These contracts for the development of the high-priority missions is also a really important step for industry in our Member States, particularly as we are living in times of COVID-19 where there is a lot of uncertainty. “We now also look forward to the second half of next year, at the end of Phase B2 of development, when we hope to get commitment from the EU and our Member States to fully develop these new exciting missions.” [ESA]

At 7:15 a.m., drop-off was underway at schools in Raleigh, Apex, Holly Springs, Knightdale, Wake Forest and Rolesville.

As a private school, Thales is not required to adhere to state guidelines for public schools.

Thales Academy said it has an extensive protocol to prevent the spread of COVID-19, including daily temperature checks and symptom surveys, social distancing, frequent hand washing and no shared supplies. Students ages 11 and up will also be wearing masks.

Some campuses are getting upgraded air systems to allow more fresh air inside the building.

In an effort to social distance, only half of year-round students are returning to school. Online options are being offered to families.

“Thales Academy is thrilled to open our schools on time for the 2020-21 school year. We strongly believe that providing an in-person educational experience is of utmost importance for the wellbeing of our students and families,” Holly Clark, a spokeswoman for Thales Academy, wrote in an email.

According to school leaders, interest in enrollment has been high, and some campuses have a wait list.

In March, at the start of the pandemic, Thales Academy Raleigh sent a note to parents alerting them that one of the school's parents had a confirmed case of coronavirus.

Ticagrelor plus aspirin lowered the risk for stroke or death within 30 days compared with placebo in patients with acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack who did not undergo IV or endovascular thrombolysis, researchers found.

Both groups had a similar incidence of disability, according to the THALES trial published in The New England Journal of Medicine.

Combo ticagrelor and aspirin vs. aspirin alone in 30-day stroke or death following acute ischemic stroke or TIA.

“Although there was an increased risk for bleeding, the absolute risk was small compared with the benefit in reducing strokes,” S. Claiborne Johnston, MD, dean of the Dell Medical School at the University of Texas at Austin and lead investigator for the THALES trial, told Healio.

In this randomized trial, researchers analyzed data from 11,016 patients aged at least 40 years with mild to moderate acute noncardioembolic ischemic stroke or TIA without thrombolysis or thrombectomy.

S. Claiborne Johnston



“The rates of stroke in these patients are simply too high, even with aspirin, the prior standard of care,” Johnston said in an interview. “Ticagrelor had promising characteristics as an antiplatelet agent, and we hoped that it would benefit patients when used with aspirin.”

Within 24 hours of symptom onset, patients were assigned ticagrelor (Brilinta, AstraZeneca) plus aspirin (n = 5,523; mean age, 65 years; 38% women) or matching placebo plus aspirin (n = 5,493; mean age, 65 years; 40% women), both of which were given for 30 days. Patients assigned combination therapy received loading doses of ticagrelor (180 mg then 90 mg twice per day) and aspirin (300 mg to 325 mg on the first day then 75 mg to 100 mg daily).

The primary outcome was a composite of stroke or death at 30 days. Secondary outcomes included first subsequent ischemic stroke and disability within 30 days. A primary safety outcome was defined as severe bleeding.

Stroke or death occurred in 5.5% of patients assigned ticagrelor plus aspirin compared with 6.6% of those assigned aspirin alone (HR = 0.83; 95% CI, 0.71-0.96).

Ischemic stroke occurred in 5% of patients in the ticagrelor plus aspirin group vs. 6.3% of those in the aspirin alone group (HR = 0.79; 95% CI, 0.68-0.93). The incidence of disability was not significantly different in patients assigned ticagrelor plus aspirin (23.8%) compared with those assigned aspirin alone (24.1%; OR = 0.98; 95% CI, 0.89-1.07).

Severe bleeding was observed in 0.5% of patients assigned ticagrelor plus aspirin vs. 0.1% of those assigned aspirin alone (P = .001).

“We have another proven treatment to reduce stroke risk in these high-risk patients,” Johnston told Healio.

APEX, N.C. (WTVD) -- Vice President Mike Pence will make a visit to Thales Academy in Apex and NCBiotech in Research Triangle Park on Wednesday.

In an email sent Monday, school officials said Pence will visit Thales Academy K-5 to see how school choice works and to advocate for its further implementation.

School officials also said students will not have homework Tuesday and will have to leave their book bags at school that night but they can bring lunch bags home and back.

The private school opted to open schools for in-person instruction July 20 along with virtual learning. Days after opening a staff member in training tested positive for COVID-19 at the school's Raleigh campus.

Pence is set to land at RDU at noon aboard Air Force 2.

He will first visit Thales Academy, a school founded by businessman and prominent GOP donor Robert Luddy. Luddy has invited and hosted other political dignitaries on campuses in years past.

RELATED: Thales Academy welcomes students back to the classroom

During his visit, Pence will stop in a classroom and take part in a small roundtable to discuss safely reopening schools. Thales Academy is offering in-person instruction, which has found support from the White House.

""If they can come and combine a trip to a school which is operated by one of the major GOP donors in the state (and) at the same time they're showing a school in operation, that's kind of a 2-for-1 deal for them,"" said David McLennan, a political science professor at Meredith College.

After his trip to Thales Academy, Pence will head to NC Biotech at Research Triangle Park. ABC11 has learned M3-Wake Research will be meeting with Pence tomorrow during his visit.

""All of us at Wake Research are excited that Vice President Pence is visiting Research Triangle tomorrow and meeting with the M3-Wake Research team.. Hopefully his visit will help bring additional national attention and recognition to all of the great work that so many medical, science, and research companies are doing here, including Wake Research, as we commence the nation's first Phase III clinical trials of a COVID vaccine. The Research Triangle is the national epicenter of medical and biotech research and we at Wake Research are honored to be a part of this community and the global effort to find a cure for COVID and put an end to this pandemic as soon as possible,"" said Dr. Ella Grach, CEO of M3-Wake Research.

The company is currently conducting COVID-19 clinical research trials in Raleigh and Fayetteville, as well as cities in five other states. During the visit, NC Biotech will be closed to staff and the public.

FULL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE

In the 2016 election, President Trump carried North Carolina by about 175,000 votes though early polls indicate a tighter race in November. With large-scale, in-person events no longer possible due to COVID-19, McLennan said these visits serve a dual-purpose.

""They're combining campaigning with some policy issues,"" said McLennan.

On Monday, President Trump was greeted by an enthusiastic crowd of supporters and protesters.

""North Carolina is a good state for fundraising. So every time the President or the Vice President comes to the state, even though there's no major fundraising event associated with the visit to the school tomorrow or the president's visit to (FUJIFILM Diosynth Biotechnologies) yesterday, you do see a ramp up in fundraising because of that,"" said McLennan.

ABC11 requested interviews with Thales Academy and Mr. Luddy; both referred our requests to the White House. The Vice President's Communications team has not answered our questions about his visit as of this evening.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999884366989136}",neutral,0.9999884366989136,0
Thales Launches a New Integrated 24/7 NOC-SOC In the Netherlands - Business Wire,"Tue, 21 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzd2lyZS5jb20vbmV3cy9ob21lLzIwMjAwNzIxMDA1MDI2L2VuL1RoYWxlcy1MYXVuY2hlcy1hLU5ldy1JbnRlZ3JhdGVkLTI0Ny1OT0MtU09DLUluLXRoZS1OZXRoZXJsYW5kc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS LA DÉFENSE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Forming part of Thales’s international network of premium Cybersecurity Operations Centres, the Group’s first integrated Network Operations Centre (NOC) and Security Operations Centre (SOC) will simultaneously monitor customers’ IT and OT infrastructure 24/7. Since IT/OT assets in the new NOC/SOC are monitored from the Netherlands, data remain in the country and sensitive information is viewed only by screened personnel. Being able to deliver these secure integrated managed services in the Netherlands is a first for Thales.

As a rule, organisations outsource night-time monitoring to SOCs in other countries. From now on, Thales will be able to offer this service for and from the Netherlands. The NOC currently analyses anonymised transaction data from public transport companies 24/7 in order to rectify faults, and the SOC focuses on monitoring the computer and network activities of critical infrastructure companies, while keeping the networks physically separate. The NOC monitors mainly systems availability, while the SOC monitors cyber security. This enables both services to intervene quickly in the event of an incident, shortening any downtime and reducing damage.

Now the two centres have been merged so that the teams have everything at their disposal to further optimise service levels and meet the highest standards of security. SOC and NOC employees are screened and trained to meet far-reaching Dutch quality standards and SOC services fully comply with Dutch legislation and regulations (ISO 27001 and NEN 7510).

Thales has more than 15 years’ experience in managed cybersecurity services worldwide. The Group is positioned as the trusted partner of choice for the most demanding organisations worldwide in terms of cybersecurity, operating five premium Cybersecurity Operations Centers around the world, in France, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Canada and Hong Kong.

""I am proud of this next step in our provision of services, as a result of which we are the first to offer 24/7 monitoring of assets and IT on Dutch soil,"" said Mark Donderwinkel, VP Thales Secure Communications and Information Systems .""As a result of Covid-19, much more use is being made of remote collaboration tools. This is making organisations more vulnerable, and the number of cyber attacks is rising sharply. Now that we are in a phase of opening up our infrastructure and networks, it is crucial that downtime is kept to the absolute minimum. In order to achieve this, better monitoring is necessary, both of assets and of computer and network activities. We can now provide our customers with the highest and continuous level of service for both asset management and cyber security.""

Thales Academy Students Head Back To School With Safety Protocols In Place - JoCo Report,"Wed, 22 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vam9jb3JlcG9ydC5jb20vdGhhbGVzLWFjYWRlbXktc3R1ZGVudHMtaGVhZC1iYWNrLXRvLXNjaG9vbC13aXRoLXNhZmV0eS1wcm90b2NvbHMtaW4tcGxhY2Uv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"RALEIGH – Thales Academy, a college preparatory network of Pre-K-12 independent schools, opened the doors of its eight North Carolina campuses plus its first out-of-state campus in Glen Allen, Virginia for the first day of school this week as scheduled for the first quarter of its year-round calendar for the 2020-2021 school year. Thales Academy Franklin K-3 in Tennessee will open the doors of its new campus August 3. Thales Academy said they have prepared each campus to be a safe, in-person learning environment and is offering a virtual learning option as well for the first quarter.

“We are thrilled to be open this week for the 2020-21 school year and are grateful to our hard-working, committed staff for their diligent efforts to provide a safe and excellent educational experience every day for our students,” says Bob Luddy, Founder and Chairman of Thales Academy. “We are committed to providing the highest quality education to as many students as possible and are proud to offer strong in-person and virtual learning options to families during this important time.”

Josh Herring, Dean of Students, explains, “We strongly believe that providing an in-person educational experience is of utmost importance for the wellbeing of our students and families. Returning to school helps students to continue progressing academically and socially, promotes positive mental health, and allows our working parents to focus on their obligations to their employers.”

Families got a taste of the new safety protocols upon their first day of school on Monday, July 20, and those returning to campus are reassured by Thales Academy’s extensive precautions to ensure the safety of its students and staff. Safety measures for the in-person option include:

Thales Academy will continue to monitor conditions and guidelines and will update protocols continuously as new information is released.

Daily temperature checks and symptom surveys completed before students enter the building

Social distancing whenever possible

Frequent hand washing

Staying within the same cohort of students and teachers throughout the day to minimize contact with others

No shared supplies

One-way traffic flows in hallways and stairwells

No mass gatherings

Staggered class change times to reduce the number of students in hallways at any one time

No visitors or parents permitted in the building

Masks worn in compliance with county and state mandates

Advanced HVAC units that provide up to 100% outdoor air – these units continuously remove and do not recirculate contaminated indoor air and replace it with highly filtered, fresh outdoor air (crucial to protect students from airborne viruses)

If any student or staff member tests positive for COVID-19, or has been in close contact with someone who has, the individual is asked to quarantine at home and is not permitted to return to school until numerous conditions are met to ensure symptoms have abated and the individual is no longer contagious.

Thales Alenia Space gains momentum in the US market - Thales,"Wed, 01 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi93b3JsZHdpZGUvc3BhY2UvbmV3cy90aGFsZXMtYWxlbmlhLXNwYWNlLWdhaW5zLW1vbWVudHVtLXVzLW1hcmtldNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Space Q&A with Steve Good, Vice President, Business Development North America

Thales Alenia Space is considered the international benchmark for telecom constellations. What does that mean to you and your U.S. customers?

We’re prime for three major constellations, totaling 125 satellites: Iridium NEXT, O3b and Globalstar 2. For Iridium, we replaced their entire constellation without interrupting service, a world first, and it’s working perfectly. This is the most sophisticated space telecom system ever built, and it’s software defined, reflecting a strong industry trend. One of the keys to its success is the close relationship with our major partner on this program, Northrop Grumman (originally Orbital ATK). Our objective is to increase collaboration with U.S. companies, including the majors. We are designing and building the SES-17 satellite to improve aeronautical communications, including connectivity for Thales’ FlytLIVE in-flight entertainment system, with coverage of North America. At the same time, we aim to work with new players in the sector, such as SpaceX, which has launched 75 Iridium NEXT over a 2-year period. Thales Alenia Space has leveraged on its long-standing expertise regarding satcom constellation to address several New Space markets through collaboration with Kinéis, Blacksky and NorthStar and most recently with Omnispace, here in 2020, to address the growing need for hybrid Non Terrestrial Networks focused on growth areas.

Thales Alenia Space is known for its contributions to space exploration missions, but have you ever worked with NASA?

Yes, of course. For instance we worked on the Cassini-Huygens mission to explore Saturn and its moons. We supplied Cassini’s high-gain antenna for communications with Earth and we were prime for the Huygens probe that landed on the moon Titan in 2005, after a seven-year amazing space exploration.

Over the past few years, we have become a direct equipment supplier to NASA, providing S-band transponders and TWTAs for the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (Formerly called WFIRST) and for the PACE (Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud and ocean Ecosystem) missions.

On the International Space Station, we made fully half of its pressurized volume, or 40% of the whole, including the Cupola – the astronauts’ favorite observation point. Our Turin plant was a major partner onboard Columbus lab, where most experiments are carried out.

We are currently working with Northrop Grumman on Cygnus cargo vessels, as supplier of the pressurized cargo modules, and we are in the front seat of the consortium led by Dynetics to help develop human landing systems for NASA’s Artemis project. Concerning additional topics linked to lunar exploration, you have to know that CommStar Space Communications has recently announced its intention to deploy next-generation hybrid data relay satellite between the Earth and the Moon by 2023. The company has signed a Letter of Intent with Thales Alenia Space for the design of its advanced hybrid satellite.

© @AxiomSpace

And now Thales Alenia Space has just been selected by Axiom to provide 2 key pressurized elements, Node1 and Habitat, the first parts of their future commercial space station.

Thales Alenia Space has developed extensive expertise in both optical and radar-based instruments. Are you involved in any American Earth observation programs?

Our long-standing capabilities in oceanography and altimetry are acknowledged worldwide. For instance we built all Jason oceanography satellites, including the Poseidon altimeter, a global benchmark. We’re now teaming up with the French space agency and NASA/JPL on SWOT, a very ambitious American-French program that will shape the future of space-based oceanography. With SpaceFlight Industries we have created a joint venture called LeoStella on February 2019. Based in Seattle, this company aims to develop an Earth observation constellation with 60 satellites offering high revisit rates and resolution of less than a meter. Through advanced big data analysis and artificial intelligence, this network will provide deep insights into events on a planetary scale.

Does Thales Alenia Space plan to capitalize on its position as a leader in both commercial and government space applications to expand its footprint in the domestic U.S. market?

Yes, we are very optimistic about the possibilities offered by LeoStella with its BlackSky constellation. There is strong demand from government customers for higher resolution and more analytical space-based imagery, to be used for intelligence, planning and strategic requirements – and that’s exactly what LeoStella is able to offer! The U.S. government is also very interested in smallsats because they’re the key to more secure and less expensive distributed networks.

Could you tell more about Leostella?

Sure. LeoStella’s ability to minimize costs and reduce development and manufacturing time helps meet the increasing demand for satellite constellations in a time sensitive ecosystem. LeoStella’s new production facility was developed to change the way satellites and constellations are produced to better meet the needs of agile space customers. The factory is a fully digital and networked environment that includes intelligent workstations, connected tools, automated test equipment, statistical process control, embedded product assurance, and a custom Manufacturing Resource Planning (MRP) backbone that manages and tracks all activities. Coupled with the manufacturing process is a robust supply chain of industry leaders with a focus on advanced technologies that help LeoStella offer an exceptional value proposition for its customers. Meanwile, Leostella recently delivered the first BlackSky Satellites from its new Production Line.

Any other space program which would apply to the U.S. market?

Thales Alenia Space is developing a breakthrough ground antenna solution called MEOLUT Next for the NOAA, as part of the Cospas-Sarsat Search & Rescue system, which will considerably boost capability – and help save hundreds of lives a year. We also won a contract from Omnispace this year to produce two nanosatellites dedicated to the Internet of Things (IoT). This is only the first step in Omnispace’s ambitious plan to develop a global constellation that will offer the world’s first hybrid (ground/space) 5G network.

In the past 60 years, almost 8 billion tons of plastic have been produced. Thales, world leader in digital security, is convinced that reducing the usage from source would be the most effective way to get rid of unnecessary plastic waste. As a result, Thales was the first supplier providing Gemalto Bio Sourced (PLA) cards, an innovative alternative to plastic, and has already delivered more than 2 million of those to banks in different countries.

Amongst them, APS, the leading Maltese community bank has recently signed a contract with Thales to migrate its entire portfolio of cards in the first months of 2020, resulting in the production of nearly 60 000 eco-friendly personalized cards. They have made this essential shift towards eco-responsibility, the majority of banking cards being up until now uniquely produced with PVC. A few banks have already adopted an eco-responsible attitude by using Poly Lactic Acid (PLA). Changing the manufacturing material from PVC to PLA, a renewable bio-source reduces the carbon footprint considerably. Gemalto is the first supplier to produce these bio-sourced cards, which reduces the use of PVC by more than 80% within the cards.

“From February 2020 APS Bank is migrating its entire portfolio of to Gemalto Bio-sourced cards. The new innovative bio sourced cards come in a vertical format and bright choice of 4 colors, a first for Malta. This project is an opportunity for the Bank to show its commitment to innovation and to a better future for the communities it serves” said Herve Delpech, Chief Strategy Officer at APS Bank.

Gemalto Bio Sourced cards (based on PLA) are the leading option when it comes to eco-friendly products. Poly Lactic Acid, a sustainable plastic substitute made of field corn from Nebraska, US, is derived from renewable sources. The field corn used is primarily exploited for ethanol production and livestock feed, with no dietary purpose. PLA is biodegradable and has a very low rate of greenhouse gas emission, when PVC is not bio-degradable and emanates toxic gas when incinerated. This is why Gemalto turned to PLA, which is now used to produce 84% of the core structure of every card, the antenna of the NFC cards (contactless) and the chip making up the rest. The final product brings seamless experience to the customer, without having any impact on the card printing or personalization.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.7193141579627991}",neutral,0.7193141579627991,0
Thales Alenia Space proposals for the Copernicus project selected by European Space Agency - Thales,"Thu, 02 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi93b3JsZHdpZGUvc3BhY2UvcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZS90aGFsZXMtYWxlbmlhLXNwYWNlLXByb3Bvc2Fscy1jb3Blcm5pY3VzLXByb2plY3Qtc2VsZWN0ZWQtZXVyb3BlYW7SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales Alenia Space proposals for the Copernicus project selected by European Space Agency Thales Alenia Space Earth Observation Share this article



LinkedIn

Cannes, 2020, July 2 - Thales Alenia Space, a Joint Venture between Thales (67 %) and Leonardo (33 %), has recently been selected by the European Space Agency (ESA) in coordination and with the agreement of the European Commission, for major Copernicus missions. Copernicus is the core satellite Earth observation program of the European Commission and the European Space Agency ESA. It provides Earth observation data for environmental protection, climate monitoring, natural disaster assessment and other social tasks.

Thales Alenia Space will serve as prime contractor for the following missions:

Thales Alenia Space France for CHIME (Hyperspectral Imaging mission) with OHB system and Leonardo as main subcontractors

Thales Alenia Space Italia for CIMR (Passive Microwave Imaging Mission) with OHB system and OHB Italia as subcontractors

Thales Alenia Space Italia for ROSE L (L-band SAR Mission) with Airbus Defence & Space Germany as subcontractor.

Thales Alenia Space will also be responsible for the payload on two further missions:

Thales Alenia Space France for CO2M instrument (the CO2 Monitoring Mission) to measure global anthropogenic CO2 emissions and thus play a key role in studying the causes of climate change and monitoring it, with OHB system as prime contractor

Thales Alenia Space France for the CRISTAL (Polar Ice and Snow Topographic Mission) altimeter with Airbus Defence & Space Germany as prime contractor

The order volume resulting from the recent bid decisions is expected to be around EUR 1.8 billion1. Final contract negotiations will start shortly and contract signings are expected in the coming weeks.

Hervé Derrey, CEO of Thales Alenia Space declared: “I really want to warmly thank ESA for the trust they put in our company to be on-board of five of the six new Copernicus missions, driving three of them as prime contractor. These successes are reflecting the capacity of Thales Alenia Space to address complex Earth Observation missions in various configurations including optical and radar relevant solutions. I also would like to warmly thank the European Commission, the member states, and all national space agencies in particular CNES and ASI for their strong support”.

1 In line with the ESA contractual framework, the associated IFRS 15 order intake for Thales Alenia Space in 2020 should represent around €200 million

More About Copernicus missions

The CO2M or Sentinel 7 mission will carry a near-infrared and shortwave-infrared spectrometer to measure atmospheric carbon dioxide produced by human activity. These measurements will reduce current uncertainties in estimates of emissions of carbon dioxide from the combustion of fossil fuel at national and regional scales. This will provide the EU with a unique and independent source of information to assess the effectiveness of policy measures, and to track their impact towards decarbonising Europe and meeting national emission reduction targets.

The CRISTAL or Sentinel 9 mission will carry a multi-frequency radar altimeter and microwave radiometer to measure and monitor sea-ice thickness and overlying snow depth. It will also measure and monitor changes in the height of ice sheets and glaciers around the world. Measurements of sea-ice thickness would support maritime operations in polar oceans and, in the longer term would help in the planning of activities in the polar regions. Since inter-annual sea-ice variability is sensitive to climate change, the mission will contribute to a better understand of climate processes.

The CHIME or Sentinel 10 mission will carry a unique visible to shortwave infrared spectrometer to provide routine hyperspectral observations to support new and enhanced services for sustainable agricultural and biodiversity management, as well as soil property characterization. The mission will complement Copernicus Sentinel-2 for applications such as land-cover mapping.

The CIMR or Sentinel 11 mission will carry a wide-swath conically-scanning multi-frequency microwave radiometer to provide observations of sea-surface temperature, sea-ice concentration and sea-surface salinity. Uniquely, it would also observe a wide range of other sea-ice parameters. CIMR responds to high-priority requirements from key Arctic user communities.

The ROSE-L or Sentinel 12 mission will carry an L-band SAR. Since the longer L-band signal can penetrate through many natural materials such as vegetation, dry snow and ice, the mission will provide additional information that cannot be gathered by the Copernicus Sentinel-1 C-band radar mission. It will be used in support of forest management, to monitor subsidence and soil moisture and to discriminate crop types for precision farming and food security. In addition, the mission will contribute to the monitoring of polar ice sheets and ice caps, sea-ice extent in the polar region, and of seasonal snow.

In the fiercely competitive satellite market, you now have to produce “more, faster and cheaper”. New technologies are a key to the quest to turn out more satellites in an industry undergoing major changes. The “Factory of the Future” concept is designed to introduce state-of-the-art and cost-competitive production technologies as an integral part of each company’s digital transformation. Additive manufacturing, robots, cobots, Factory 4.0, virtual and augmented reality, digital twins… All these concepts and more show how innovation in the true sense of the word has really come into its own at Thales Alenia Space.

While we often associate digital transformation with the incorporation of new technologies in the production process, we also tend to forget that this transition depends on the complete digitalization of ground and space segments alike. You’ve undoubtedly noticed that, since about 2010, telecom satellite payloads are becoming more and more digital. Our satellites based on all-electric Spacebus Neo platforms are increasingly fitted with digital and flexible payloads to deliver very high throughput satellite (VHTS) connectivity and meet users’ needs, while providing access to increasingly data-heavy content, or quite simply to bridge the digital divide around the world.That’s especially the case of the EUTELSAT KONNECT VHTS satellite, which will facilitate access to online content in isolated areas of France and throughout Europe.

We are also developing Space INSPIRE, a family of medium-size, agile and ultra-flexible communications satellites that can be fully reconfigured in orbit in less than 24 hours. Solutions such as these demand equally agile digital ground infrastructures, especially to securely manage the huge data streams, while also supporting our customers throughout the life of the satellite.

Digital transformation from A to Z

With the digitalization of satellite systems, we’re shifting the focus from hardware to software, or, in a word, software-defined. One good example is the Iridium NEXT constellation of very-high-throughput telecom satellites, combining Spacebus NEO platforms with VHTS payloads, or our new Space Inspire family. Current VHTS payloads feature a 5th generation digital transparent processor (DTP) – and Space Inspire will even offer a 6th generation model. With this unique technology, Thales Alenia Space took over leadership in the VHTS market at the end of 2019.

No satellite market segment has escaped this rampant digitalization, whether telecom, Earth Observation, or satellite navigation. The digital transformation of ground segments will inevitably follow.

About SpaceOps, the ground segment for telecom missions

For our upcoming VHTS communications systems, Thales Alenia Space is offering a mission ground segment based on our innovative SpaceOpsTM solution. This type of system monitors the digital payload and reconfigures it dynamically in line with users’ changing needs. Using information from the onboard processor, it actively manages bandwidth and power amplification levels to optimize traffic and meet each user’s specific needs. The agility of new-generation satellites, combined with our new-generation of mission ground segments, supports highly flexible reconfiguration in line with changing demand.

The importance of the imaging ground segment for Sentinel missions

You’ve undoubtedly heard of the Sentinel satellites developed for the European Space Agency (ESA) as part of the European Union’s vast Copernicus environmental monitoring program. These satellites are a key to environmental monitoring in Europe. Thales Alenia Space is prime contractor for the Sentinel-1 and -3 families (4 satellites each), it’s also in charge of the image ground segment for Sentinel-2, and it makes the imaging spectrometer for Sentinel-5P and the Poseidon-4 radar altimeter for the Jason-CS/Sentinel-6 mission. The company was recently selected by ESA, in agreement with the European Commission, on 5 out of 6 new Copernicus missions, including 3 as prime contractor: CHIME (Sentinel-10), CIMR (Sentinel-11) and ROSE-L (Sentinel-12). Thales Alenia Space will also be responsible for 2 payloads for CO2M (Sentinel-7) and CRISTAL (Sentinel-9).

Sentinel-2 image ground segment

In this article, we’re spotlighting the Sentinel-2 image ground segment. These satellites, built by Airbus Defence & Space as prime contractor, provide optical imaging to map the changing state of the Earth’s surface, identify pollution in lakes and coastal zones, help manage natural disasters and facilitate humanitarian rescue missions. To date, this family includes two identical satellites, Sentinel-2A and -2B. Operating in tandem, they give us a completely refreshed image of our planet’s land masses every five days.

Without the ground segment, the system would not generate any data! Every 100 minutes Sentinel-2A transfers its data to a data acquisition center. This data is then processed to produce images, which takes about an hour and a half. The image production process takes place in four steps: the satellite acquires raw data, which it transmits to a ground acquisition center. This data is then transferred to a processing center to generate the images, which are then distributed to other centers. Lastly, the data is stored in an archiving center, where it is accessible on user request.

Sentinel-2A alone completes a full cycle – total coverage of the Earth – in ten days, sending down 14 color “photos” per day, or one every 100 minutes. When combined with Sentinel-2B, the complete cycle takes only five days, based on one image every 50 minutes, or 28 per day.

The ground segment was designed to handle this data stream. Thales Alenia Space was chosen as image ground segment prime contractor in 2011 because of its proven expertise in this field, based on work for advanced Earth observation programs such as Envisat and MetOp.

Three keys to the digital transformation of ground segments

By digitalizing ground segments, we can automate algorithms to remotely reconfigure payloads – and this requires the use of artificial intelligence.

Secondly, to remotely manage this ever-increasing volume of data, we have to increase computing power. Our new solutions tend to be cloud-based, a method that provides a high degree of flexibility in ground segment operations. A cloud-based system directly speeds up time-to-market, since it allows us to offer our customers custom-tailored functions that change in line with demand. Furthermore, since we get immediate access to customer feedback, we can quickly carry out corrective measures in a virtually transparent manner – and that fosters a very close customer relationship. Last, but far from least, because of the sensitivity of the immense volume data involved, our ground segment integrates a native cybersecurity solution.

Artificial intelligence, cloud computing and cybersecurity are the three pillars of our digital ground segment solutions. And we’re working on adapting this winning trifecta to all space applications: communications, Earth observation and satellite navigation.

Stay tuned for more space chronicles addressing the digital transformation of Thales Alenia Space!

Rover's SuperCam instrument including Thales laser ready for liftoff to Mars! - Thales,"Thu, 23 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi93b3JsZHdpZGUvc3BhY2UvbmV3cy9yb3ZlcnMtc3VwZXJjYW0taW5zdHJ1bWVudC1pbmNsdWRpbmctdGhhbGVzLWxhc2VyLXJlYWR5LWxpZnRvZmYtbWFyc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Rover’s SuperCam instrument including Thales laser ready for liftoff to Mars! Angénieux Laser Thales Mars Share this article



LinkedIn

On July 30, 2020 at 7:50 am local time, an Atlas V rocket will lift off with NASA’s Perseverance rover from Cape Canaveral in Florida, en route to the Red Planet. This is a decisive moment in NASA’s Mars 2020 mission, designed to study the surface of Mars, look for traces of past life, take soil samples at selected sites and place them in defined locations to be brought back to Earth by the upcoming Mars Sample Return mission, to be carried out jointly with the European Space Agency (ESA).

From the Moon to Mars: Thales has teamed up with NASA since 1964

Optics from Angénieux, today brand of the Thales group, allowed the Ranger 7 space probe to take the first close-up photos of the Moon’s surface, in 1964. Angénieux optics were again part of the equipment chosen by NASA to film the first human steps on the Moon during the legendary Apollo 11 mission some 51 years ago, especially stunning shots of the lunar module approaching the surface.

Closer to us, Thales laser is part of the ChemCam instrument carried by the Curiosity rover, that has been operating over the last eight years. This instrument aims to determine if a life-friendly environment ever existed on Mars, to analyze the mineral composition of the surface, to study the geology of the areas explored and to collect meteorological and radiation data. ChemCam is still the only power laser to date that has operated on an extraterrestrial planet.

A laser for SuperCam, the rover’s high-performance remote sensing instrument

Thales has provided an even higher-performance new-generation laser for SuperCam, one out of the seven instruments carried by the Perseverance rover.

Like the laser on ChemCam, SuperCam will use an infrared beam to heat the material to be studied to a temperature of about 10,000 degrees Celsius (18,000°F) thus vaporizing it to apply an analysis method known as Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS). Combined with a special camera, this method will provide a qualitative and quantitative portrait of the basic chemical composition of a sample. It can also carry out simultaneous multi-element measurements on any type of material, in this case Martian rocks!

Unlike ChemCam, the SuperCam laser also emits a green laser beam which will help determine the molecular composition of surface materials. This green beam excites the chemical bonds in a sample, and produces a different signal according to the various linked components, a technique known as Raman spectroscopy – an analytical technique that has never been tested on Mars, and will enable us to detect any markers of life.

The green laser beam will also be used to induce fluorescence in certain mineral and organic compounds, thus allowing scientists to more accurately determine the constituent components.

Thales Alenia Space: Martian mission expert

Thales Alenia Space is prime contractor for ExoMars 2016 and 2022 missions, conducted by ESA in conjunction with the Russian space agency Roscosmos. These missions are designed to look for traces of past or present life on Mars. The Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) from the first mission is already in orbit around Mars to analyze the planet’s atmosphere. ExoMars 2022 will deploy a rover equipped with a drill able to extract soil samples as deep as two meters below the surface and analyze them in its own integrated mini-lab.

The companies involved include Thales in the UK, Bombardier Belfast, Collins Aerospace, GE Aviation UK, GKN Aerospace, Martin Baker, and QinetiQ. This is the first phase of organisations to sign such agreements, with more to be announced.

The announcement represents a significant step forward by bringing additional expertise into the Team Tempest project. Team Tempest is a collaboration between BAE Systems, Leonardo UK, MBDA UK, Rolls-Royce and the UK Ministry of Defence, working together to develop game-changing technologies at pace and in an affordable manner.

At the opening of Farnborough today, Secretary of State for Defence Ben Wallace spoke of the changing face of air power for the UK, where the armed forces and industry must embrace new and emerging technologies to counter disruptive capabilities and adversaries.

He said UK armed forces can no longer rely on one type of aircraft that can only do one thing. The focus must be on future combat air systems with a virtual brain which can embrace AI, deep learning, sensors and communications technology.

The Minister also spoke of flexible platforms and closer integration of the services, embracing technologies in cyber and space and systems built with open architecture for constant upgrades.

Thales is a global technology leader shaping the world of tomorrow today. We are investing heavily across the world and the UK in digital innovation such as connectivity, Big Data, artificial intelligence and cybersecurity.

Building on our extensive expertise in systems of systems architecture and design and international expertise in securing complex digital ecosystems, Thales is pleased to be entering into this new agreement with Team Tempest to explore how we will play a leading role in designing and securing the digital ecosystem which will be fundamental to operating the platforms of the future.

In doing so, we will establish the know-how and grow the skills required to support both the programme and the prosperity of the UK.

Alex Cresswell, Chief Executive and Chairman of Thales in the UK, said:

As we move from the industrial to information age Thales are delighted to be bringing our global expertise in cutting edge digital technologies and our world leading avionics business to support Team Tempest. Bringing the best of breed digital technologies from both the military and civil arenas to Team Tempest will enable the UK to dominate the digital battlespace of the future.

The companies will now seek opportunities to join forces on established projects and developments with the core Team Tempest partners, bringing the best of British expertise and ingenuity to optimally designing, manufacturing and operating combat air systems through life.

Jeremy Quin, the UK Minister for Defence Procurement, said: “Today’s announcement demonstrates further progress in delivering the UK’s combat air strategy, with more companies collaborating on the future of the UK’s Air Defence. This is a highly innovative project-based around cutting-edge technology and drawing on a skills base where the UK excels. I am delighted that the success and strengths of Team Tempest are being enhanced through drawing on UK expertise; working with industrial partners and highly capable international team we are configured for future success.”

Monitoring Earth and climate change impact from space - Thales,"Tue, 07 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi9ncm91cC9tYWdhemluZS9tb25pdG9yaW5nLWVhcnRoLWFuZC1jbGltYXRlLWNoYW5nZS1pbXBhY3Qtc3BhY2XSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The blue planet or the green one? As climate change is becoming one of the greatest long-term challenges that society is facing, its consequences on Earth are more and more visible, starting with its colour, when observed from space.

To anticipate the consequences of global warming and protect our planet, we need precise information about how the natural environment is changing. Some Earth Observation satellites can provide reliable and highly accurate information on Earth over long periods of time and on a global scale.

While meteorology was the first scientific discipline to use space capabilities in the 1960s, satellites are now able to help us monitor how healthy – or not – the planet we call home is, based on a broad range of data including weather analyses, the oceans’ colour and temperature, or measures of earth gravity. Three-quarters of the data used in numerical weather prediction models depend on satellite measurements, says OECD's quarterly magazine, OECD Observer.

“It’s not something we can study from Earth. Of course we would get some data, but we wouldn’t be able to get a global view. It would be like watching television through a little hole,” says Sandrine Mathieu, Product Line Manager for Meteorology, Environment and Oceanography, at Thales Alenia Space.

“Satellites give us a global view that progresses in time, showing how events are related and how fast they are evolving,” she adds.

Some of the observation satellites orbiting around the Earth are purpose-designed for environmental monitoring. Satellites allow scientists and decision makers to better monitor the impact of climate change, and they can also be the only solution to monitor parts of the world where ground systems are not deployable.

Every day, their eyes stay focused on our planet, capturing images that provide invaluable data to help us respond when nature goes wild, as well as to understand climate change, make better use of natural resources and protect populations at risk.

Creating a ‘digital twin’ of Earth

For example, satellites were able to detect the impact that the intense bushfires in Australia at the end of 2019 had on air quality in the United States, 15,000 kilometres away.

Another key purpose of satellites is the monitoring of oceans. Around 70% of the planet’s surface is covered by oceans, which have a crucial impact on climate, regulating heat, absorbing CO2 and providing food as well as economic sustenance to coastal communities.

Monitoring the oceans from space means we can have a comprehensive picture of their health by checking their depth with millimetre accuracy thanks to radar technology, their temperature with thermal infra-red sensors, and their salinity and – last but not least – their colour through the eyes of optical sensors.

Oceans are not always blue. Their hue depends on the concentration of phytoplankton and other particle matters that could indicate discharges or the presence of pollution. By keeping an eye on oceans, we can detect algae bloom, which have a deadly effect on marine wildlife.

The new-generation satellites will offer greater capabilities. The next step in the study of the Earth from space will be a hyperspectral 2D sounding meteorology mission that will provide a 3D vision of the atmosphere, compared with the surface data we can gather today. This will provide a gigantic leap in the knowledge we can apply to air transport, as well as the study of typhoons and air quality.

“The logical continuation is the creation of a ‘digital twin’ for the Earth, which will allow us to gather all sorts of environment parameters (biodiversity, agricultural ressources, water quality, water height, …) on the global surface planet and monitor them in real time. By observing and understanding interactions we will eventually be able to anticipate pollution, extreme events, harvests, forest fires, climate change impacts, etc ,” says Sandrine Mathieu.

Providing technology that benefits the daily lives of people

At Thales, we’re fully aware of the impact of global warming. For more than 40 years now, Thales Alenia Space engineers have leveraged their expertise to give the world’s scientists and decision-makers the means they need to acquire vital data for environmental monitoring, oceanography and meteorology.

Thales Alenia Space has been at the forefront of European geostationary meteorology, as prime contractor for three generations of Meteosat weather satellites on behalf of the European Space Agency (ESA) and EUMETSAT, the European operational satellite agency for monitoring weather, climate and the environment.

The company is also involved in major Sentinel missions, a key to Europe’s environmental monitoring efforts. Sentinel satellites are being built on behalf of ESA as part of the European Union’s Copernicus programme. Thales Alenia Space is a major partneronboard this very ambitious programme, which is designed to monitor land and ocean, vegetation, soil and coastal areas, and study sea-surface as well as the temperature and colour of sea and land.

As a world leader in altimetry and a major partner onboard the most iconic international missions dedicated to oceanography, Thales Alenia Space is also working on the French-American oceanography satellite SWOT (Surface Water Ocean Topography), which will revolutionise modern oceanography by detecting ocean features with 10 times better resolution than current technologies.

Thales, which aims to provide technology that benefits the daily lives of people around the world, is committed to fighting climate disruption. Observation of the Earth from space is crucial to defining and implementing responsible environmental policies as satellite missions ensure that the environment we live in – the air we breathe, the water where we bathe and the forests we walk in -- remains as clean as possible.

The latest generation TTC audio frequency track circuit, developed entirely by Thales in Spain, provides predictive information for the maintenance of the system and ensures the safety of railway operations by detecting the occupation, presence and departure of a train in a given area. Its assembly can be carried out both indoors and in outdoor cabinets, as it has local and remote diagnosis. The solution complements the Thales Axle Counter family to provide the most comprehensive Train Detection Portfolio in the market.

The TTC audio-frequency track circuit designed with Thales technology has been included in the register of products and companies validated by Adif, publicly accessible through the Adif and Adif AV web pages.

With this inclusion, the ADIF validation process for this solution applicable to both high-speed and conventional networks is approved and closed. It also complies with the technical specifications for interoperability (ETI) related to the Command and Signaling Control subsystems of the trans-European rail system, allowing possible extensions in the future. Adif is not considered an accredited conformity assessment body and, therefore, this validation only has effects for Adif.

This new Thales track circuit is currently being laid out and put into service on the ADIF network, in the Salamanca-Fuentes de Oñoro line, on the Parets-La Garriga section belonging to the Barcelona commuter network and at the Vicálvaro Merchandise terminal in the conventional network in Madrid. It will also be installed on the new section La Encina-Xátiva-Valencia High Speed line of the ADIF network. Additionally, a pilot installation has been carried out in Portugal, on the Amara-Benfica line, after the approval of the Portuguese Infrastructure for the deployment in that country. In order to complete the validation process of Adif, Thales has deployed several pilots in the Railway Network of general interest (RFIG) as well as the implementation of the corresponding tests in accredited laboratories and tests on track, to verify the compliance with the requirements of train detection systems, based on audio-frequency track circuits.

For over 70 years, Thales has been a key supplier and pioneer of security systems and technological advances for Adif, the principal Spanish railway operator. Thales participated in the construction of the first Spanish high speed line between Madrid and Seville, inaugurated in 1992, and currently has a presence on the main high speed lines in Spain. More than 900 km of Adif railway is equipped with Thales ETCS L1 system; and Thales has signed 12 network maintenance contracts with Adif to oversee 2620 km of Spanish railway.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.998927652835846}",neutral,0.998927652835846,0

What’s so special about this picture?

On May 15 2020, when Solar Orbiter was travelling at 0.6 Astronomical Units from the Sun (60% of the mean Earth-Sun distance), Metis acquired the first simultaneous images of the Sun corona in visible and UltraViolet light. To see the extremely faint coronal light, Metis produces an artificial solar eclipse. The black disk at the center of the images is created the occultation of the Sun disk, whose size and orientation is illustrated by the sphere superimposed in the middle of the occulted region. When Solar Orbiter will approach the minimum distance from the Sun (0.28 Astronomical Units) the solar disk size will be more than doubled, but still completely “eclipsed”.

The image is taken in polarized visible light and clearly shows the characteristic configuration of the solar corona during the minimum phase of magnetic activity.

The solar magnetic field confines the coronal plasma mostly near the equatorial belt, where the field lines are closed, giving rise to the bright streamers, as shown by the image on the right where the map of the Sun magnetic field is superimposed to that of the Sun corona taken by Metis.

This first image taken by Metis in the UltraViolet (UV) light emitted from neutral hydrogen atoms represents also an absolute first: the UV Sun corona was never observed before in this region extending up to 7 solar radii from the solar center

They are the first images that will allow scientists to completely characterize the two most important plasma components in the Sun’s corona* and solar wind (electrons and protons). These images will help us answer fundamental questions about the origins of the fast and slow wind, the sources of solar energetic particles and the eruption and early changes in coronal mass ejections.

What’s so special about Metis?

Supplied by Thales Alenia Space as co-prime with OHB Italy, Metis will take simultaneous pictures of the corona in both visible and ultraviolet wavelengths. This will reveal unprecedented structural and dynamic details of the solar atmosphere in the range from 1.7 to about 9 solar radii from the Sun’s center, allowing scientists to investigate the link between the behavior of these regions and space weather in the inner Solar System.

These observations, based on the instruments’ unprecedented temporal coverage and spatial resolution, will enable us to study the structure and dynamic behavior of the corona and its features, finally disentangling their intrinsic characteristics from the effects of solar rotation.

Metis was proposed by an international scientific consortium led by Ester Antonucci from the INAF-Osservatorio Astrofisico di Torino (Turin Astrophysics Observatory), and is supported by the Italian space agency (ASI). The principal investigator is Marco Romoli, from the University of Florence.

What will Metis discover about solar weather?

The solar wind, full of charged particles (electrons, protons and helium nuclei with energies between 1 and 10 KeV, moving at speeds from 250 to 750 km/sec.), flows from the solar corona towards outer space.

During solar storms, large quantities of matter are expelled from the Sun’s corona (coronal mass ejections), generating strong solar winds that subsequently disturb the Earth’s magnetosphere, ionosphere and terrestrial thermosphere, causing geomagnetic storms. Space weather is the study of these types of phenomena.

Measurements from Metis will help scientists completely characterize the most important plasma components in the corona and the solar wind. Studying this area is a key to determining the relationship between different solar atmosphere phenomena and how they change in the inner heliosphere. In fact, this is one of the Solar Orbiter’s fundamental science goals.

What’s so special about the Solar Orbiter mission?

The Solar Orbiter is part of the European Space Agency’s “Cosmic Vision” program. It is designed to perform unprecedented close-up observations of the Sun, including from high-latitudes, to provide the first images of the uncharted polar regions of the Sun. Because it will be operating so close to the Sun, this mission is a key to better understanding the heliosphere and its impact on Earth.

Solar Orbiter is a joint international space mission between ESA and NASA, using a spacecraft developed by Airbus Defence and Space. A number of partners from both industry and academia have contributed to the spacecraft and its scientific instruments, with Thales Alenia Space playing a critical role.

How will Solar Orbiter explore the Sun?

Solar Orbiter will reach its operational orbit in the innermost region of the Solar System in just over two years, after gravity-assisted boosts around Venus and Earth. It will observe the Sun from as close as 0.28 Astronomical Units (AU), i.e. 28% of the average distance between Earth and Sun, and at latitudes up to 34° above the solar equator.

The spacecraft is equipped with ten scientific instruments: six remote-sensing instruments to observe and take pictures of the Sun and four “in situ” instruments to measure the heliosphere environment around the spacecraft. During its seven-year mission, this sophisticated equipment will measure the solar wind plasma, magnetic field, electromagnetic and electrostatic waves, and energetic particles emitted by the Sun. It will also acquire spectacular images of solar features at an unprecedented resolution, including the complete characterization of solar corona – thanks to Metis!

How does the Solar Orbiter protect Metis and the other instruments?

Thales Alenia Space designed and built an innovative and highly efficient heat shield to protect the spacecraft and its instruments from the tremendous heat, while also giving them a direct view of the Sun. Its high-temp black painted shield is made of several protective layers of titanium and it is further isolated from the satellite by a combination of thermal blankets, an aluminum honeycomb core and titanium star brackets.

One stands alone

When you take a close look, you can see that all instruments are safely protected by the heat shield… all but one. Just one stands out and defies the fierce heat of the Sun – Metis!

We asked Stefano Cesare, Thales Alenia Space Program Manager for the Metis instrument, to explain:

Yes indeed, Metis is the only instrument whose aperture protrudes out of the heat shield. It was protected from particulate contamination by a cap that was recently jettisoned (on March 13), enabling the corona’s light to reach its detectors for the first time. This unique feature was also one of the main design challenges facing Metis. At the closest distance from the Sun, its aperture, unprotected by the heat shield, will experience temperatures up to 400°C. This unprecedented challenge inspired the Metis consortium to develop some incredibly innovative solutions. While Solar Orbiter continues its voyage towards the Sun, Metis will stay wide awake! After collecting the “Sun’s first corona light”, during the journey towards the inner part of the Solar System, mission operators will focus on remotely activating and testing all functions and calibrating the instrument, to make sure it will deliver maximum performance once the scientific phase begins in about two years.

Thales Alenia Space has also provided to the mission the Solid State Mass Memory (SSMM), the heart of on board data flow management, and the Deep Space Transponder, a very compact device that offers cutting-edge performance for telemetry and data. Solar Orbiter will be able to orientate and maintain itself in the correct orbit with the help of Leonardo's star trackers (AA-STR).

*NASA describes the Sun’s corona as: “the outermost part of the Sun’s atmosphere, extending far out into space. The corona is usually hidden by the bright light of the Sun's surface, which makes it difficult to see without using special instruments”.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999599456787109}",neutral,0.9999599456787109,0
Analysis: Thales releases new information on future maritime mine warfare approach - Navy Recognition,"Tue, 28 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uYXZ5cmVjb2duaXRpb24uY29tL2luZGV4LnBocC9mb2N1cy1hbmFseXNpcy9uYXZhbC10ZWNobm9sb2d5Lzg3NzYtYW5hbHlzaXMtdGhhbGVzLXJlbGVhc2VzLW5ldy1pbmZvcm1hdGlvbi1vbi1mdXR1cmUtbWFyaXRpbWUtbWluZS13YXJmYXJlLWFwcHJvYWNoLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Maritime mine warfare technology is about to come of age. As 2020 draws to a close, four years of intensive development and testing is about to culminate in a breakthrough which will remove Royal Navy personnel from the supremely dangerous task of mine clearance. Here’s what’s happening.

Follow Navy Recognition on Google News at this link

Thales ASV (Picture source: Thales)

According to some estimates, there are perhaps a million naval mines of more than 300 types are in the inventories of more than 60 navies, excluding the US which doubtless has many more. Their simplicity and affordability bring them within reach of even the poorest nations and terror groups.

For decades, sea mines have been used in every armed conflict with a naval element. Some self-neutralise after a given time and many have been cleared. But it only takes one to sink a ship. And there are plenty of live mines which remain in our seas, unseen, unknown and ready to detonate.

At the moment, clearing mines is a slow, extremely dangerous process. With the British Royal Navy, which leads the world in mine countermeasures, the first stage is to enter the minefield in one of its Hunt-Class or Sandown-Class Mine Counter Measure Vessels, towing one of Thales’s sophisticated Towed Synthetic Aperture Sonars to look for mines. The second stage is to classify and destroy the target. Sometimes this can be achieved with a remote-controlled submersible; sometimes it requires the services of highly trained specialist divers. It’s hard to think of a more dangerous job.

There is some good news, however. Thales has been working on a solution for several years now investing its own R&D funds, and supported by a joint programme under the Lancaster House Treaty, (which assures close collaboration and technology-sharing between the United Kingdom and France for defence and security cooperation). This solution, when it passes its final tests later this year, will set a new standard in mine countermeasures.

Thales ASV (Picture source: Thales)

Faster, safer and assured mine warfare capability:

In the second half of 2020, a new mine warfare capability will be available, which can not only detect, classify and destroy mines faster than any other solution but which will also completely eliminate danger to human life.

Unlike any other mine countermeasures system in the world, it is comprehensive, proven and fully autonomous, with autonomous unmanned vessels and its own portable operating centre and, from which a complete mine-clearing operation can be planned, executed and monitored.

There are several components to the solution all of which have been tried and tested individually and in concert with each other. The Royal Navy had considerable input to the design and development. A system comprises at least one USV (Unmanned Surface Vehicle) – ideally two - equipped with a Towed Synthetic Aperture Sonar, an unmanned submersible for classifying the detected threat and a submersible for destroying the target and a powerful autonomy engine which interacts with the equipment to detect, classify and locate mines.

In crude terms, the operator tasks the boat with searching a defined area and the autonomy engine takes it from there. Live streams of data and video are streamed to the mobile operations centre, which can be many kilometres distant, either on a ship or quayside. When a mine is located, the USV can be equipped to deploy a remotely operated vehicle (ROV), which is used to nullify the threat. Two USVs, one to tow the sonar and the other following it, ready to destroy mines as they are detected, make the job even more efficient.

Unlike traditional systems on dedicated mine hunting and sweeping ships, Thales’s entire solution can be packed up into containers and rapidly deployed anywhere in the world. It can also be used in multiples and in concert with allied forces, making the clearing of a path through a minefield quicker and safer than ever before.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9973692893981934}",neutral,0.9973692893981934,0

Karen is a bit anxious. Comfortably installed in her pilot's seat, she takes her unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) down the runway and up into the morning sky. She’s flown many times before. But missions usually take place in segregated airspace — a corridor free of any other traffic, which is reserved, declared and authorised several days in advance. But today, for the first time, she’s flying to a training area through the same airspace as civilian traffic.

A new dial appears on her screen: it’s a Airborne Collision Avoidance System, (ACAS Xu), which wasn’t there before. Every aircraft in the system's range is displayed as a symbol: blue diamonds, yellow circles, and red squares for the ones in closest proximity. If the system spots the risk of a mid-air collision, it immediately calculates an avoidance manoeuvre.

This small display built into Karen’s flight management system is the result of over 10 years of R&D and efforts to update the relevant standards, algorithms and equipment to ready the skies for a massive influx of drones.

Flashback to 2020

TCAS collision avoidance system dedicated for airliners

For many years, commercial airliners have flown either in controlled airspace, where ATC services are provided, or in uncontrolled space, and they all carry a TCAS system. If two aircraft are on converging headings, these devices enable them to:

identify and alert each other via an interrogator / transponder system

receive confirmation from the other aircraft

calculate advisories so the two aircraft perform complementary avoidance manoeuvres (if one descends, for example, the other needs to climb).

But for the first generations of UCAVs operated by the armed forces, this kind of system was impractical. A typical TCAS unit is heavy — around 10 kg — and the vertical manoeuvres it recommends simply can’t be executed by drones, which are slower and much more agile horizontally than vertically. And even though the larger drones used a transponder with an encrypted military mode and Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) capability, it didn't allow them to fly in airspace with heavy traffic. After all, UCAV pilots don’t have a direct visual on the environment surrounding their aircraft...

ACAS X: developing a universal collision avoidance system for all aircraft

To overcome the problem, the first challenge was to review the relevant standards. Here, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), which helped develop the original TCAS system, had been working for several years on a new standard called ACAS X, based on a more advanced algorithm. Still fully compatible and interoperable with the previous TCAS, this new system is designed to:

specify avoidance manoeuvres for each aircraft type (airliner, UAV, helicopter, etc.).

for each aircraft type (airliner, UAV, helicopter, etc.). utilise information from the dialogue between cooperative interrogator / transponder systems, but also from non-cooperative onboard sensors such as radars, cameras and GPS receivers. This new functionality considerably reduces the number of false alarms or advisories that are issued but are unworkable when flying at low altitude, for example.

Working closely with MIT, experts from Thales took the new algorithm, launched an industrial development and simulated its performance using more than a million potential collision scenarios provided by Eurocontrol, the European organisation for the safety of air navigation.

The second challenge was to embed the new collision avoidance functionality on board the UAV platform without significantly adding to its weight. Should it be integrated into an existing piece of onboard equipment, or manufactured as a new unit, which would need to be exceptionally small and light? As it happened, Thales already offered the TSC 4000, an IFF transponder weighting just 2 kg, which had already been selected for a number of UCAVs programmes and been fully proven in the air. At the time, the product allowed drones to be identified , but it couldn’t interrogate the transponders on board airliners. So Thales engineers pulled off an impressive feat: with a simple software upgrade and an additional small circuit board, they gave the TSC 4000 all the functionality of an ACAS interrogator and the ability to run the ACAS Xu algorithm — the ACAS X variant for drones. Working with a whole array of industry partners, the teams just needed to test the concept in actual flight conditions and ensure interoperability with the various radars and optronic systems that equip most UCAVs.

Back to 2024: mission accomplished for Karen

From her home airbase, Karen starts her approach to the runway at the training area over 100 km away. As the drone gradually drops its altitude, the latest-generation ACAS system constantly scans the surrounding area, helping Karen complete the descent manoeuvre in complete safety. “It’s just as well I have this,” she says, realising there are up to 40 other aircraft in the airspace covered by her instruments.

Suddenly one of the aircraft symbols turns red. And thanks to ACAS Xu , the last-minute avoidance manoeuvre is immediately — and automatically — executed, and the plane is finally on the tarmac. And while it’s being towed to the hangar, Karen relaxes with a well-deserved coffee and starts to muse: “If only every helicopter, drone, commercial and military aircraft were equipped with the same kind of system!”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999984502792358}",neutral,0.9999984502792358,0
Coalition says making public parts of $1.3bn Thales arms deal audit would penalise weapons company - The Guardian,"Thu, 23 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vd29ybGQvMjAyMC9qdWwvMjMvY29hbGl0aW9uLXNheXMtbWFraW5nLXB1YmxpYy1wYXJ0cy1vZi0xM2JuLXRoYWxlcy1hcm1zLWRlYWwtYXVkaXQtd291bGQtcGVuYWxpc2Utd2VhcG9ucy1jb21wYW550gGOAWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS93b3JsZC8yMDIwL2p1bC8yMy9jb2FsaXRpb24tc2F5cy1tYWtpbmctcHVibGljLXBhcnRzLW9mLTEzYm4tdGhhbGVzLWFybXMtZGVhbC1hdWRpdC13b3VsZC1wZW5hbGlzZS13ZWFwb25zLWNvbXBhbnk?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Australian government is arguing parts of an audit of a $1.3bn arms purchase must be kept secret because a multinational weapons company Thales would have trouble selling its product if they were disclosed.

But the administrative appeals tribunal has heard that such an argument if allowed to stand would have a “devastating effect” on the auditor general’s ability to transparently and publicly criticise other government purchases.

The tribunal is hearing a case between the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet and crossbench senator Rex Patrick, who is fighting through freedom of information for full release of a 2018 audit report examining the government’s acquisition of the $1.3bn Hawkei combat vehicle fleet from French-based manufacturer Thales.

After representations from Thales, the attorney general, Christian Porter, made an extraordinary and largely unprecedented intervention to redact sections of the audit on the grounds they unfairly prejudiced Thales’s commercial interests and threatened Australia’s national security and defence.

The Guardian has since revealed the redacted material included a cost-comparison suggesting that Australia could have saved money by purchasing a different vehicle – the joint light tactical vehicle – from the United States.

On Thursday the government’s lawyers argued that allowing that information to be released would damage Thales’s ability to export the Hawkei.

“The issues at the heart of the proceedings are actually relatively simple,” the Australian government solicitor’s representative, Justin Davidson, said. “We say that the disclosure of the exempted material will harm or can be expected to harm the prospects of Thales and the Australian army to selling this vehicle to other buyers.

“We say that the information in dispute creates an unfair negative impression of the vehicle, including in comparison with a key competitor, and as such it is reasonable to expect disclosure of that information to harm its export prospects.”

The government also argued that a failure to promote and sell the Hawkei to export markets would have consequences for the Australian army.

The broader use of the vehicle would lead Thales to make greater investment in it, develop and evolve its capabilities, and create a greater supply chain for parts and maintenance. That would ultimately benefit Australia, it said.

But Patrick said such an argument would “open the floodgates” to companies wanting to suppress audits of government purchases for fear they would harm their commercial interests.

“The tribunal must get this right,” Patrick said. “Should the auditor general’s report to the prime minister be improperly censored on the basis of what amounts to a commercial consideration, we end up opening the floodgates to others seeking to do the same.

“That will have a devastating effect on the auditor general’s function. This goes to public interest. People have a right to know whether money has been spent wisely by the government.”

Patrick said much of the suppressed material had already been made public, through media reporting, a parliamentary inquiry, and federal court proceedings.

He also told the tribunal that he had a private conversation with Thales Australia’s chief executive, Chris Jenkins, who told him that the damage to the Hawkei had already been done through ongoing media reporting on the suppression of the audit.

The government has adduced evidence from major general Andrew Bottrell, the head of defence’s land systems division, who explained the importance to Australia of ensuring the Hawkei vehicle was adopted widely by partner nations.

“If all we ever do is produce 1,100 Hawkei for Australia, in my view that is a poor outcome,” he said. “Because we could have achieved much greater investment, development, and evolution of the capability with a broader user base, more investment in research in development from the company, a greater supply chain to draw from.”

Thales has argued the cost comparison contained in the audit is fundamentally flawed because it ignores the vast differences between the two vehicles and does not properly take into account the value to Australia of having locally manufactured vehicles.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.6796977519989014}",neutral,0.6796977519989014,0
Nine tips for recruiting during COVID-19 - Thales,"Thu, 23 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi91bml0ZWQta2luZ2RvbS9uZXdzL25pbmUtdGlwcy1yZWNydWl0aW5nLWR1cmluZy1jb3ZpZC0xOdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"COVID-19 has presented many challenges for businesses. From remote working to the unfortunate but necessary furloughing of some employees, finding ways to operate effectively under the new circumstances has been tough for everyone. One example of such a challenge has been Thales UK’s ambition to recruit a new intake of graduates and apprentices, starting in September 2020. With a recruitment approach that was no longer suitable for 2020, a radical rethink has been required by the Thales team and there are lessons that can been learned by everyone from their experience.

Historically, Thales UK has recruited an intake of graduates and apprentices each year that would take on a variety of roles within the business. From engineering to project management, the breadth of opportunities for kick starting careers is significant, with lots of applications and a rigorous selection process being witnessed and set in place each year. 2020, however, has presented challenges in ensuring that these places can still be filled.

By rewriting the strategy used by the UK talent acquisition team, utilising the various digital tools that are available and maintaining effective communication throughout, Thales is delighted to have succeeded in filling its early careers vacancies for 2020 with the usual high calibre of candidates.

Here are 9 tips from the Thales UK talent acquisition team that they have found key to ensuring success throughout COVID-19:

1. Back to the drawing board

Don’t be afraid to throw away your strategy and start again. Thales, for example, would usually have run face to face assessment centres to interview its candidates. This simply wasn’t going to be suitable in 2020 and so a rethink was required. This didn’t mean cancelling everything, however. Although daunting, sometimes it is necessary to take a backwards step in order to move forwards. Within two weeks, the team had a new approach that took into consideration the new environment we all live in.

2. Flexible thinking

In order to come up with a new or edited strategy, a flexible mind set is key. By keeping an open mind and exploring different options for meeting your objectives, you increase the chances of finding a solution that works for your situation. By being flexible, it is possible to take action in different ways that you may not have previously considered. Thales experienced this first hand by having to replace a tried and proven method of effective recruitment with new processes.

3. Commitment to your goals

The extent of change can be intimidating but by having clear goals, it is easier to remain focused on what you are looking to achieve. This can apply to many aspects of business but, in relation to recruitment, staying committed to the end goal of filling vacancies is fundamental in ensuring that your team stays on course for success.

4. Have the right tools

We live in a world where digital tools are increasingly the norm. For businesses that have not prioritised the implementation of digital tools or ways or workings, COVID-19 has left them with no choice. Leveraging the wide range of fantastic digital tools that exist for businesses, it’s possible to find support for whatever your needs, whether it’s communicating, sharing work or maintaining a sense of connection. If you haven’t already, take a critical look at the tools used by your business and question how effectively they meet your needs.

5. Suppliers you can trust

Having the latest tools to recruit effectively is definitely key, but having trusted suppliers that can support you in the implementation and use of these tools is invaluable. By understanding how your suppliers can help you, it is possible to learn from their expertise and find a solution together.

Thales, for example, has worked with Arctic Shores to deliver game-based assessment techniques for their graduate and apprentice applicants over recent years. In 2020, Arctic shores also supported Thales to deliver virtual group assessment activities using Zoom. The Thales team also partnered with My Kinda Future and their on-boarding platform Connectr to deliver engaging content to new starters. Users can connect with digital buddies and it also offers opportunities to network with their peers.

6. Keep the conversation going

In a year where ways of working have changed significantly, maintaining transparency between applicants and the recruiting organisation is key. By keeping applicants and hiring managers up to date on new processes and what they should expect, expectations can be managed and any nerves eased. Communication should be a priority throughout the entire process.

7. Ask for feedback

Conversation should be a two way interaction. Although it is vital to keep people informed, asking for their feedback can only help in ensuring that their questions are answered and your processes further improved. By giving those involved an opportunity to provide feedback on their experience of your new strategy, you may find that it continues to evolve and improve as you deliver it.

8. Having a back-up plan

You can never be too prepared, especially when relying on technologies that may be new to your organisation. When conducting virtual group assessment exercises for example, the Thales recruitment team used backup devices and even made sure that other members of the team were available to step in, should any technical difficulties be experienced. From extra devices to a team that can adapt in the event of any issues, having a backup will ensure that the experience of applying to an organisation is a smooth as possible for the applicant.

9. Engagement

So you have set up effective tools, conducted interviews and even offered jobs to successful applicants, but what comes next? The time between an applicant being offered a job and starting in their new role is a crucial time for introducing them to a company, as well as maintaining vital conversation. By keeping in touch with useful information, engaging content and providing a chance for them to meet their new peers, it helps to ensure that they feel as comfortable and motivated as possible, whilst also reducing the chance that they may change their mind.

Thales selected by Royal Netherlands Navy to provide 8 High Tech radars - EDR Magazine,"Wed, 15 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVkcm1hZ2F6aW5lLmV1L3RoYWxlcy1zZWxlY3RlZC1ieS1yb3lhbC1uZXRoZXJsYW5kcy1uYXZ5LXRvLXByb3ZpZGUtOC1oaWdoLXRlY2gtcmFkYXJz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Utrecht, 2 July 2020 – The Netherlands Defence Materiel Organisation and Thales signed a contract for the delivery of an NS100 radar, seven Scout Mk3 radars and an IFF system.

The NS100 dual-axis multi-beam surveillance radar will replace the Variant radar currently deployed on HNLMS Johan de Witt, one of the Landing Platform Docks (LPD) in service in the Royal Netherlands Navy. The Sea Acceptance Tests are scheduled to take place in 2023.

A major reason for selecting the NS100, next to its unparalleled performance, is fleet-wise logistic advantages. The Royal Netherlands Navy already operates the latest generation of Thales 4D AESA radars on the majority of its vessels and, given the radar’s flexible architecture, it is easy to offer through–life introduction of new capabilities thereby future-proofing the radar. The NS100 on the Royal Netherlands Navy’s other LPD, HNLMS Rotterdam, will be updated, so that the radars on both LPDs will be identical.

The same contract specifies the delivery of Scout Mk3 surveillance radars to be installed on HNLMS Johan de Witt and on the Combat Support Ship that is presently being built for the RNLN. The CSS will also receive a Thales IFF system. Five more Scout Mk3 radars will be supplied for the M-class frigates operated by the RNLN and the Belgian Naval Component and for spares and training purposes. This contract raises the number of Scout Mk3 radars under contract to 15.

Geert van der Molen, Vice President Naval at Thales: “This contract illustrates how convenient it is to update a Thales 4D AESA radar system in operation in order to align it with the same specifications as a new radar. The update involves only the exchange of one component and the installation of updated software, and can be carried out at the Naval base in Den Helder.“

About NS100: Selected for its unmatched performance and proven 4DAESA technology, the Thales NS100 dual-axis multi-beam sensor enables simultaneous detection of a high variety of targets in a single operational mode, providing unrivalled air and surface surveillance. With the additional forward and backward scanning technology, situational awareness is enhanced significantly resulting in fast track initiation and high quality weapon support.

This fully digital multifunction radar, equipped with advanced anti-air and anti-missile capabilities, is capable of countering a wide range of threats, including ballistic missiles.

Highly mobile, tactical and air transportable, the radar can be deployed in less than 15 minutes, a major advantage in the theaters of operation. It delivers unmatched performance and mobility with 360° coverage in azimuth, up to 90° in elevation, and a 400km range.

Designed to simultaneously detect and track a wide range of stealth targets, drone swarms and to prevent coordinated saturation attacks, the Ground Fire has an air defence missile guidance capability to intercept high-maneuvering or ballistic targets. Multi-mission, it can be used in various contexts, such as air defence, air surveillance, counter-battery or trajectography.

Ordered in 2019 by the French Procurement Agency, the radar draws on years of engineering and manufacturing development for the Sea Fire, the naval version of the radar selected to equip the Defence and Intervention Frigates of the French Navy. The Ground Fire benefits from Thales’ technological advances in artificial intelligence and cyber security, enabling it to respond perfectly to the fast evolving needs and threats faced by the Armed Forces.

Integrated by Thales at the Limours (in Essone) and Ymare (in Seine-Maritime) sites, the electronic and mechanical subassemblies are developed and produced in partnership with French SMEs such as Sermati and UMS.

The new Franklin campus joins Thales Academy’s eight existing North Carolina campuses as well as its other new out-of-state campus in Glen Allen, Virginia. Thales Academy Franklin is preparing the campus to be a safe, in-person learning environment and will initially offer grades K-3, with more grades to come in future years.

“We are thrilled to open the doors to our first campus in Tennessee and provide our newest Thales Academy students with our high-quality education at an affordable price in a safe environment,” says Bob Luddy, Founder and Chairman of Thales Academy.

Tuition at Thales Academy Franklin is $5,300 per year (or $5,000 annually if paid in full upfront), and scholarships, discounts and payment plans are available to further reduce this cost. The school will be following all required health practices that are known at this time in addition to adopting many recommended practices, based on necessity and feasibility for the campus. All procedures will be subject to change based on the most up-to-date information available throughout the school year, and Thales Academy will continue to monitor conditions and adjust accordingly.

“In this time of uncertainty for many school districts, we are glad to be able to offer educational strength and consistency for families at Thales Academy. Seats are filling fast, but we do still have a few spaces available at our new Franklin campus if anyone is still looking for a school option for their child for this school year,” says Bethany Bateman, Admissions Counselor.

Thales Academy educators are eager to begin teaching again in the classroom. “We strongly believe that providing an in-person educational experience is of utmost importance for the wellbeing of our students and families,” Josh Herring, Dean of Students, explains. “Returning to school will help students to continue progressing academically and socially, will promote positive mental health, and will allow our working parents to focus on their obligations to their employers.”

Hallmarks of Thales Academy include: rigorous, college-prep academics that emphasize learning to mastery; character formation; real world skills development; personalized attention and affordable tuition with no extra fees or fundraising. In addition to the low cost, other tangible benefits include: a stable, proven educational approach, a consistent calendar, and a simple dress code. The school strives to cultivate critical thinkers by teaching how to think, not what to think; fostering often forgotten skills such as writing and grammar; and developing confident leaders with strong character.

Thales press release

This maiden mission was organised off the coast of Brest at the end of June 2020 in the presence of officials from both nations, the French group adds

Over a period of a week, the minehunting mission completed four operational scenarios using all the subsystems developed for the programme by Thales and its partners: the unmanned surface vessel (USV) with its volume search sonar, the towed array sonar, two unmanned underwater vehicles (UUV) equipped with the SAMDIS sonar, and the robotic mine neutralisation system. This comprehensive mission included several sequences combining autonomous vehicles with high-level automated functions remotely controlled from the operational command centre via a secure communication system.

The first two scenarios involved end-to-end threat detection, classification and localisation throughout the mission. In the third scenario, readings were compared with data from an earlier mission to detect changes, and the last scenario entailed relocation and identification of several mines, and neutralisation of one of them. With all the threats positively detected and the robotic neutralisation procedure completed as planned, the mission was a success from beginning to end and confirmed the excellent operational performance of all the systems deployed.

“These operational scenarios at sea were very important to demonstrate interim operational capability performance of the MMCM prototype. Their achievement marks important progress towards achieving the start of the production phase, and we look forward to seeing the full operational capability demonstrated in Autumn this year.” Christophe Serrat – OCCAR Programme manager, FR/UK MMCM

“With this latest milestone, the MMCM programme has delivered the only operational system-of-systems of its kind in the world. This pioneering mission further consolidates Thales’s world leadership in both conventional mine countermeasures and the new generation of solutions based on a combination of autonomous and remotely operated systems. This uniquely complex programme brings major innovations in the service of the safety of the seas, seafarers and citizens,” Alexis Morel, VP Underwater activities, Thales, said.

MMCM Program

In 2012, UK and France initiated the Maritime Mine Counter Measures (MMCM) programme which aims at developing a prototype autonomous system for detection and neutralisation of sea mines and underwater improvised explosive devices (UWIEDs). Managed by the OCCAR European agency, the MMCM contract was awarded to Thales, in collaboration with BAE Systems and their partners in France (ECA) and in the UK (ASV, Wood & Douglas, SAAB).

MMCM is a complete mine warfare system, composed of Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) and Underwater Unmanned Vehicles (UUVs), aiming at replacing French Marine Nationale and UK Royal Navy current fleets of mine hunters. As part of the MMCM programme, Thales and BAE Systems are committed to providing systems to both the French Navy and Royal Navy for two years of evaluation testing, under the SLAM-F and MHC programs respectively.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999415874481201}",positive,0.9999415874481201,1
Private schools look to new air filtration systems to limit virus spread in classrooms - WRAL News,"Fri, 17 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndyYWwuY29tL3N0b3J5L3ByaXZhdGUtc2Nob29scy1sb29rLXRvLW5ldy1haXItZmlsdHJhdGlvbi1zeXN0ZW1zLXRvLWxpbWl0LXZpcnVzLXNwcmVhZC1pbi1jbGFzc3Jvb21zLzE5MTkzNzc3L9IBImh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndyYWwuY29tL2FtcC8xOTE5Mzc3Ny8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A group of private schools in the Triangle is upgrading its ventilation systems, and school officials say the change could prevent the spread of coronavirus when classes start next week.

""We want to make sure that Thales schools are as healthy as possible,"" said Brandon Hafner, manager of corporate operations for CaptiveAire Systems, which produces commercial kitchen ventilation systems and is owned by Bob Luddy, who founded the Thales Academy chain.

CaptiveAire plans to put a dedicated outdoor air system, or DOAS, in each Thales building. Unlike traditional HVAC systems that recirculate about 90 percent of indoor air, DOAS is capable of bringing in 100 percent outside air.

""It takes a building from a high level of contaminants to a reasonable level of contaminants in just a few hours,"" Hafner said. ""We know that recirculated air is an unhealthy environment for people to be in.""

Dr. David Wohl, an infectious disease specialist at the UNC School of Medicine, said a special air filtration system might help reduce the risk for spreading coronavirus but the science isn't really clear.

""There's something that we see a lot of in the hospital, which we'd call an abundance of precaution. So, even though we don't know for sure that something works, sometimes we do things just to be really over protective,"" Wohl said.

He noted that experts have debated for years over effective ways to combat transmitting flu virus, and there aren't any answers yet when it comes to coronavirus.

Wohl also said an air filtration system won't help if social distancing and other precautions aren't followed in the schools.

""One concern I do have is that, if we do put in a really nice, fancy-dancy filtration system, will we then think, well, we could not wear masks?"" he said. ""I think there could be a false level of security. We wouldn't want that. I would rather have masks on me [and] on other people around me.""

Thales Academy officials said they have an extensive protocol to prevent the spread of the virus, including daily temperature checks and symptom surveys, social distancing, frequent hand washing and no shared supplies.

Hafner said ""fresh air will be the way of the future,"" and the DOAS units will help Thales students and staff.

""We want a building that is highly energy efficient, so we seal up a building to make sure the heat can't get in and out,"" he said.

That’s micro-electromechanical systems based in silicon chips, for short. Accelerometers with up to 100g range and 70µg bias in a very small form factor — 6 cubic centimeters — are exploding the horizons for inertial applications.

In airborne, automotive, industrial, defense, mining, surveying, naval & marine — manned & unmanned in each sector — these silicon MEMS accelerometers are redrawing market lines and opening up new possibilities for high-performance navigation and guidance.

A free webinar on July 8 focuses on this exciting class of accelerometers and the applications growth they launch.

Complementary silicon MEMS advances in both accelerometers and gyroscopes now have bias stability performance exceeding Class 2 inertial requirements and on the verge of achieving Class I, high tactical grade. The webinar takes us in depth through high-performance accelerometer requirements for precise navigation and precise tilt sensing, among them:

• vastly improved good long-term stability

• support of fast convergence in data fusion

• extensive self-testing capability

• synchronization capability between several sensors, and easy interface with multiplex capability

Inside the manufacturing process, you’ll see just how this is accomplished: with a high-sensitivity vibrating beam principle, common mode error rejection and custom damping to improve performance under vibration.

You’ll learn how smart integration of the MEMS accelerometer enables very low acceleration offset and sensor bias, with high bandwidth and low data latency completing the picture.

Register now for this exciting look into new autonomous capabilities.

The new SYNAPS family of Software-Defined Radio systems (SDR) offers a set of remarkable and unique features that allow meeting the current and future needs of the Armed Forces, providing superiority of information through communities of interest. This is a leap forward in digital transformation and an opportunity for technological development for the industry. All of this will provide the Armed Forces with operational superiority and will guarantee international interoperability as well as the continuity and evolution of the radio family throughout its life cycle. It will also guarantee the maximum use of the radio spectrum and the exchange of secure critical data among all the actors.

In addition, this family of radios will provide logistical superiority to the Armed Forces, since a smaller number of radios are needed to cover the needs of both programs, resulting in a reduction in consumption, weight, and the number of antennas per vehicle, while improving the logistics configurations footprint. All of this translates into a clear decrease in maintenance costs. As they are fully compatible with the PR4G radios currently in use by the Spanish Armed Forces, SYNAPS radios are immediately ready to be deployed within Armed Forces without any technical or calendar risk, in a smooth transition. SYNAPS can be gradually phased in, without jeopardizing Forces’ operational readiness, allowing an optimized and mastered step-by-step modernization of the entire radio fleet.

Within the framework of the 8x8 GDLS VCR “Dragón” Vehicle Program, Thales has also shown the improvements to the command and control system of the vehicles, which is currently being carried out in collaboration with the company Indra, as a very satisfactory experience of cooperation between both companies to provide the Army with the best means of command and control.

Thales' offer also includes a detailed Industrial Cooperation Plan for Spain designed for export, which will develop its own technology with high added value and maintain national sovereignty in tactical communications. Thales employs more than 1,400 employees in Spain. At its Leganés site (in Madrid region), it has based its defense, aeronautics and security activities, with a specific radio production and maintenance center. Thales has also entrusted the production of various elements of its new SYNAPS software-defined radio family to the Basque company Manufacturas Zeta which will produce components for the SYNAPS-H handheld version for the soldier, as well as for the SYNAPS-T and SYNAPS-V for ground vehicles. This collaboration is a sign of Thales’ long-lasting confidence in Spanish SMEs, facilitating the technological development of the national industry and international cooperation.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.7962181568145752}",positive,0.7962181568145752,1
NIOA and Thales share Benalla (and maybe Mulwala) - Australian Defence Magazine,"Thu, 02 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1c3RyYWxpYW5kZWZlbmNlLmNvbS5hdS9kZWZlbmNlL2xhbmQvbmlvYS1hbmQtdGhhbGVzLXNoYXJlLWJlbmFsbGEtYW5kLW1heWJlLW11bHdhbGHSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The $1.1 billion 10-year Strategic Domestic Munitions Manufacturing (SDMM) contract with Thales Australia for the continued management and operation of Australia’s munition factories in Benalla (Victoria) and Mulwala (NSW) announced this week has some surprises.

Thales has invested more than $20 million in research and development and $25 million in capital infrastructure over the last 10 years at the Benalla and Mulwala facilities and will invest further to develop new and world leading products for the ADF, according to the company.

They employ approximately 650 highly skilled staff between its two Australian Government owned facilities in Benalla and Mulwala. It exports products to 17 countries globally.

In 2019, Thales spent $113 million with its Australian suppliers for munitions and small arms, supporting 414 direct jobs in the supply chain. This contract will enable Thales to secure more than $450 million in export and non-ADF orders over the coming 10 years.

“Mulwala and its sister facility in Benalla are the home of munitions manufacturing in Australia, generating vital job opportunities in regional NSW and Victoria,” Minister for Defence Senator Linda Reynolds said.

“This new agreement not only reinforces the 20-year strong partnership between Defence and Thales Australia, but also provides job certainty for more than 650 highly-skilled workers at these factories. The Government’s effort to ensure job security, especially in regional areas, is vital for the recovery of the Australian economy.”

Alongside this announcement was the news that Thales would be getting a neighbour at the Benalla facility with NIOA Munitions signing a 10-year tenancy contract at the facility as well.

This contract will establish NIOA as a tenant alongside Thales Australia

“NIOA is already pursuing export opportunities from the new tenancy at Benalla and is well placed to manufacture munitions for use by the ADF in the future,” Minister Reynolds said.

“This contract will establish NIOA as a tenant alongside Thales Australia, where together they will provide opportunities for domestic manufacturing while enhancing supplies of key munitions for Defence.”

NIOA’s new footprint at the Commonwealth Government-owned facility in north-eastern Victoria will commence from July 1, with the focus being on the production of medium and large calibre munitions for the ADF while bringing another 100 jobs to the region.

Revitalisation of the Benalla facility and adjacent landholdings is part of a $130 million capital investment in domestic munitions and explosives manufacturing by NIOA over the next five years. NIOA’s investment includes a $60 million artillery shell forging plant in Maryborough, Queensland with joint-venture partner Rheinmetall Waffe Munitions.

‘’This is also central to strengthening the nation’s self-sufficiency in defence manufacturing to deliver the requirements of the ADF warfighter while maximising the use of the government factory at Benalla well into the future,” Rob Nioa, NIOA founder and MD said.

“Sovereignty is not just about defence industry work in Australia. Sovereignty is about that work and the control of that work resting within our country. Australia’s national interests are always best served when such important projects for our national security are done in a way in which the programs are controlled within this country.

“The ownership, the intellectual property, the company’s headquarters, the jobs, the investments, the taxes, the profits and the control remain within Australia.”

While the initial focus at Benalla is to upgrade the infrastructure capability, NIOA has plans, subject to, government approval to produce 155mm Assegai Projectiles, 30mm ammunition for the Boxer vehicle, hand grenades, aircraft bombs and artillery fuses.

The deal, directly between the Commonwealth and NIOA, will see NIOA take over almost half of the Benalla facility. As previously reported by ADM, NIOA has purchased a 300 acre site right door to Benalla for further possible opportunities.

Both Thales and NIOA will bring a competitive tension to the sites going forward.

NIOA also confirmed to ADM that they will source their energetics from Mulwala and expects that there will be an exchange of goods and services between the two companies.

ADM Comment: There have a been a few failed efforts over the years to compete the facilities at Mulwala and Benalla. This latest series of agreements relies on a sole source arrangement for Mulwala for another decade essentially but sees Benalla truly opened up in a competitive sense with the addition of NIOA.

For the better part of two decades, Thales has made investments at both the government owned contractor operated (GOCO) sites that it acquired when the government sold off ADI. But there have still been questions about the value for money equation that have not balanced with Australian Industry Capability or Defence Sovereign Industry Capability Priorities. It depends on your viewpoint.

The recent report from Thales about their AIC impact last month does make for impressive reading. As Thales Australia MD Chris Jenkins pointed out in his ADM Congress speech in February this year looking at ADM’s own Top 40 data, Thales’ turnover has increased while their workforce has remained relatively steady over a decade. This was due to the company working with so many SMEs in their supply chain, he explained.

Both Thales and NIOA will bring a competitive tension to the sites going forward. This can only be a good thing as the ADF focuses on what it truly means to focus on a sovereign supply chain that also demonstrates value for money to taxpayers.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9989547729492188}",neutral,0.9989547729492188,0

Thales will supply 43 Bushmasters in a deal worth $75 million.

Bushmaster is a heavy 11-tonne, 4×4 protected vehicle with a 4-tonne payload and a V-hull design which deflects explosions away from the passenger cabin.

The Bushmaster has been a domestic and export success, famously in service in Afghanistan and other theatres and never suffering a soldier fatality despite the threat from improvised explosive devices (IEDs).

Thales describes the vehicle as a battle-proven, lifesaving, versatile and highly mobile vehicle that will bring a new level of capability and interoperability to the New Zealand Army.

Manufacture will involve more than 50 Australian businesses to deliver five variants of the vehicle.

Based in Bendigo, Victoria, Thales Australia also manufactures the smaller Hawkei seven-tonne 4x4 military vehicle for the Australian Army and is completing production of 1100 units and 1058 trailers in a contract worth $1.3 billion.

Thales Australia has also exported almost 180 units of the larger 11-tonne Bushmaster 4x4 in recent years, with the New Zealand contract coming just after the Netherlands ordered an additional six vehicles to its existing fleet of 100.

Thales, part of the French military and aerospace company Thales Group, manufactures in Bendigo but sources components from Australian subcontractors including Wollongong-based Bisalloy Steels, AME Systems in Ararat, DVR Engineering in Melbourne and KAB Seating in Dandenong.

The latest deal is understood to have secured 300 jobs at the Bendigo factory for the next two years, if not longer, and about 200 other jobs in the supply chain.

The New Zealand contract for the Bushmaster vehicles will replace its fleet of armoured Steyr Pinzgauer vehicles.

NZ defence minister Ron Mark said the new fleet of 43 Australian-designed and -built Bushmaster NZ5.5 vehicles would provide better protection for personnel and improved carrying capacity.

“The age and lack of protection offered by the old fleet make this another investment in New Zealand Defence Force capability that must be made in order to protect our service people,” he said when announcing the contract.

“The need to replace the army’s fleet of land vehicles was outlined in last year’s Defence Capability Plan, with the armoured Pinzgauer highlighted as a vehicle type reaching the end of its operational life and prioritised for replacement.

“The New Zealand Army operates in diverse and challenging environments, so a multipurpose, highly mobile vehicle has been selected, one that has proven its ability to provide a high level of protection.”

The substantial contract covers the vehicles, training, a desktop simulator, support equipment and infrastructure upgrades at Linton Military Camp near Palmerston North on New Zealand’s North Island.

“The versatility of this vehicle will increase the defence force’s ability to help our communities during a time of need such as a natural disaster, and contribute to supporting vital peacekeeping operations with our global partners,” Mr Mark said.

The Bushmaster is used in Australia and the other Five Eyes military intelligence nations – NZ, Canada, the US and UK – and is already in service with New Zealand’s Special Operations Forces.

The new Bushmaster fleet will supplement other vehicles and provide new capabilities, such as a protected ambulance that is a new addition to the NZ Army.

The Bushmaster’s high levels of blast and ballistic protection makes it suitable for deployment as a troop transport, operating as a command and communication hub.

Mr Mark said it was the second fleet of protected mobility vehicles approved for purchase by the government following the delivery this year of the Polaris MRZR fleet of side-by-side all-terrain vehicles to replace quad bikes and other small vehicles used by the Kiwi army.

Deliveries of the Bushmaster are expected to start in late 2022, with the full fleet beginning operational introduction from late 2023.

In early 2019, Thales Australia doubled output of the Hawkei vehicle from one to two vehicles a day to bring it up to full production capacity.

In late 2019, the outlook for the Hawkei – named after an Australian death adder snake which in turn was named after former prime minister Bob Hawke – was in doubt after engine supplier Steyr Motors went into receivership.

Thales, which had been a Steyr customer for more than 10 years, then bought the Austrian engine maker to secure the Hawkei program and hundreds of jobs at the Bendigo plant.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.8652365803718567}",neutral,0.8652365803718567,0

The Australian Army Orders More EF88 RiflesThe Firearm Blog - The Firearm Blog,"Wed, 15 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZpcmVhcm1ibG9nLmNvbS9ibG9nLzIwMjAvMDcvMTUvYXVzdHJhbGlhLW9yZGVycy1tb3JlLWVmODhzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Australian Government has announced that the Australian Defense Force will receive a further 8,500 EF88 rifles. This comes on top of the 30,000 already ordered and procured from the Thales owned Lithgow Arms. The move comes as Australia announced a major realignment of their defense policy, we covered this in more detail over at Overt Defense.

The effort to develop an ‘Enhanced’ F88 began in the early 2010s with the first rifles displayed in 2012. In 2015 we learned that Australia was seeking to deploy 30,000 of the new rifles and by June 2015 the first EF88s were undergoing field trials with 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment. In 2017 the Australian Defense Force unveiled its tiered issue scheme explaining which troops would be equipped with the improved rifles first and what attachments and accessories would be issued depending on mounted/dismounted and squad roles.

Minister for Defence, Senator the Hon Linda Reynolds CSC, said:

The rifles will be manufactured at the Thales Australia site in Lithgow, New South Wales which employs around 130 Australians. This acquisition is just another example of the nationwide benefits of the Morrison Government’s unprecedented investment in defence capability, particularly in rural and regional Australia. It also demonstrates our ongoing commitment to building a strong and sustainable defence industry.

The rifles are to be delivered under the lethality element of the Australian Army’s Soldier Modernisation Program. While no contract value has been disclosed the original order for 30,000 rifles came in at AUD100 million or $70 million.

The procurement of a new batch of EF88s will allow increased issue of the EF88 across the full and part-time force elements of the Australian Army – particularly Army’s 2nd Division

The impact of the ongoing Coronavirus Pandemic continues to be felt even in the defense industry and Reynolds explained that “this Government is doing all we can to help the Australian economy recover from COVID-19. The purchase of these additional EF88 weapon systems will provide certainty to the workforce at Lithgow and support jobs in regional Australia.”

The EF88 completed its first operational deployment back in 2018, with ADF elements deployed with Task Group Taji 5 in Iraq. The task force commander, Colonel Steve D’arcy, noted at the time that “the EF88 has proven itself as an extremely reliable, accurate and versatile weapon which has gained the praise of not only Australian personnel but also our New Zealand counterparts and coalition partners.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.8946453332901001}",neutral,0.8946453332901001,0
