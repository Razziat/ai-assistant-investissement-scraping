With this historical contract, Thales Alenia Space confirms its position as the industrial benchmark in global satellite constellations offering the world’s most efficient services for mobile connectivity (maritime, in-flight), backhauling of 4G and 5G communications, government networks and enterprise communications.

Cannes, February 9, 2021 – Thales Alenia Space, a joint venture between Thales (Euronext Paris: HO) (67%) and Leonardo (Milan stock exchange: LDO) (33%), has signed an agreement with leading global satellite operator Telesat to be the prime contractor on the construction of Lightspeed, its advanced LEO network, a multi-billion dollar project initially comprised of a fleet of 298 satellites.

This agreement has been signed in the presence of Bruno Le Maire, Minister of the Economy, Finance and Recovery of France.

Following the intense work done on Lightspeed’s innovative design, this selection represents a major step in the deployment of the project, as Telesat and Thales Alenia Space significantly increase the momentum of activities in parallel with the finalization of the Lightspeed project’s financial close.

Telesat will rely on Thales Alenia Space not only to provide the space and mission segments, but also to be responsible for the end-to-end network performance and related specifications of the system.

Lightspeed’s space segment will initially be comprised of 298 satellites, in the 700-750 kg class. The network will deliver multiple terabits per second across the globe for secure, low-latency, high-performing broadband professional services.

Lightspeed is based on an innovative architecture and next generation technologies, providing a very high level of flexibility in capacity allocation. The constellation is built on a unique combination of advanced on-board satellite equipment – sophisticated active antennas that can dynamically refocus beams a thousand times per second, powerful and flexible processors able to address a range of bandwidth, optical laser links between satellites to create a true global mesh coverage of the world – and a mix of on-board and on-ground software ensuring the optimal use of the system resources. The flexibility brought by this system is the key to true competitiveness as it optimizes sellable capacity in relation to the location of demand, which can vary significantly across time and between hot spots such as airports and low-density areas such as remote communities. The optical laser link interconnections between the constellation satellites will provide global, mesh coverage around the world, including above the oceans and poles, with a high level of security for end-to-end services. It will optimize the ground segment with a lower number of gateway sites, more freedom on gateway locations, and the ability to deploy gateways in line with the loading of the system.

The first satellites are expected to be ready for launch in two years.

“I want to warmly thank Telesat for putting its trust in our company, and we are proud to have been selected after successfully going through a very demanding competitive process,” said Hervé Derrey, President and CEO of Thales Alenia Space. “Thales Alenia Space is mastering end-to-end flight proven systems, digitalization of payloads, inter-satellite links, management of international organization as well as industrial capabilities dedicated to constellations, and we are honored to capitalize on all this expertise to serve this major program”.

“With our design and engineering work complete, we’re excited to move forward with Thales Alenia Space as our Prime Contractor to manufacture Lightspeed, the world’s most advanced and capable LEO network, stated Dan Goldberg, President and CEO of Telesat. “Thales Alenia Space has an impressive track record and proven success in delivering innovative satellite constellations. We are grateful for the excellent work they have done to date on our project and look forward to working closely together to transform and redefine space-based communications with the Lightspeed network.”

“Telesat's Lightspeed constellation will be at the highest level of global space connectivity. I am happy with the selection of Thales Alenia Space as industrial prime contractor for this ambitious project supported by a strong partnership between France and Canada. This selection also illustrates the excellence of the French and European space industry,” said Bruno Le Maire, Minister of the Economy, Finance and Recovery of France.

Franck Riester, French Minister Delegate for Foreign Trade and Economic Attractiveness, is pleased with this major contract, which strengthens ties between France, Europe and Canada in the space sector: “In France, for the next 5 years, this contract will mobilize Thales Alenia Space, which I visited last January, as well as a large number of French companies. This reflects the quality of our industrial and technological know-how.""

In connection with the agreement Thales Alenia Space and Telespazio made a capacity commitment on Lightspeed.



With GlobalStar 2, O3B and Iridium NEXT, Thales Alenia Space has developed all of the Low and Medium Earth Orbit telecommunications constellations in full operational service today. The company has leveraged on this long-standing experience to address additional new markets such as high revisit earth observation, the surveillance of space from space, space debris tracking and the Internet of Things.

Thales Alenia selected to build Telesat's broadband constellation - SpaceNews,"Tue, 09 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS90aGFsZXMtYWxlbmlhLXNlbGVjdGVkLXRvLWJ1aWxkLXRlbGVzYXRzLWJyb2FkYmFuZC1jb25zdGVsbGF0aW9uL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"WASHINGTON — Canadian satellite operator Telesat announced Feb. 9 it has selected Thales Alenia Space to manufacture 298 satellites for a broadband network in low-Earth orbit.

Telesat also announced that its constellation, named Lightspeed, will start offering services in 2023.

The selection of European manufacturer Thales Alenia caps a yearslong evaluation of competing providers. Thales Alenia Space in 2018 teamed with Maxar Technologies in a joint bid to take on Airbus Defense and Space. Thales Alenia and Maxar later split up and the Telesat constellation became a three-way competition.

Dan Goldberg, president and CEO of Telesat, told SpaceNews that Thales Alenia Space was selected for its satellite design but also for its engineering and ground services. The $3 billion deal is for the production of 298 satellites, network management software and for the integration of the satellites with gateways to be deployed around the world. The entire investment projected for Lightspeed is $5 billion.

Goldberg said Telesat and Thales Alenia have been working on the bus design for more than two years. He said Telesat was impressed by Thales Alenia’s performance as the prime contractor of the Iridium NEXT constellation and by the satellites it produced for SES’ O3B network. “That was a big part of our decision to select them,” he said.

Details about where the satellites will be manufactured have yet to be announced. “We expect that soon,” said Goldberg. “There will be significant job creation in Canada and in Europe.” Launches will start in 2022. The plan is to produce a satellite a day.

Telesat in 2019 signed an agreement with Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin for launch services on the New Glenn rocket but it’s not exclusive, said Goldberg. “We’ll be working with other launch providers too.”

Telesat’s 700-kilogram satellites will be launched to polar and inclined orbits — 78 satellites will deploy to a polar orbit with 13 satellites in six planes at an altitude of 1,015 kilometers. The other 220 will go to an inclined orbit with 11 satellites in 20 planes at an altitude of 1,325 kilometers. The architecture was designed for pole-to-pole global coverage, concentrating capacity in some areas where more demand is expected, the company said.

Goldberg said Telesat’s target markets are network operators, internet service providers, the maritime industry and governments. He insisted that Telesat does not view SpaceX’s massive internet constellation Starlink as a direct competitor. “Our focus is very different,” he said. “We’re a business to business provider, consumer broadband is not our focus.”

Telesat said it is developing several types of user terminals for different markets.

Each Telesat satellite will have four laser communications terminals for inter-satellite and space-to-ground connectivity. That will allow Telesat to offer capacity on its network for customers to move data, including the U.S. government.

“With optical inter-satellite links we can route traffic all over the world,” said Goldberg. “This minimizes the number of gateways we need.”

Having high-bandwidth data links creates a market opportunity, Goldberg said. Companies or government organizations that operate their own spacecraft and have compatible optical links can hop onto Telesat’s network “and we can move traffic for them,” he said.

This capability is of interest to the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and the Space Development Agency which are building mesh networks in low-Earth orbit. Telesat was selected by DARPA’s Blackjack program to demonstrate optical inter-satellite link technology in orbit. The company also teamed with Lockheed Martin to study the interoperability between Telesat’s LEO constellation and satellites Lockheed Martin is building for the Space Development Agency.

“That is certainly a big part of the work we’ve been doing with DARPA to demonstrate how the U.S. government could have their own satellites that could leverage the global optical network,” said Goldberg. “This would give them a more flexible and cheaper option to deploy capabilities.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999985694885254}",neutral,0.9999985694885254,0
Thales NS50 Radar Bringing Game Changing Features for Vessels of All Sizes - Naval News,"Mon, 08 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdmFsbmV3cy5jb20vbmF2YWwtbmV3cy8yMDIxLzAyL3RoYWxlcy1uczUwLXJhZGFyLWJyaW5naW5nLWdhbWUtY2hhbmdpbmctZmVhdHVyZXMtZm9yLXZlc3NlbHMtb2YtYWxsLXNpemVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales NS50 Radar Bringing Game Changing Features for Vessels of All Sizes Following the recent announcement that the NS50 was selected for 12 next generation Mine Counter Measures Vessels, we contacted Thales to find out what makes this radar unique.

4D and Fire control capabilities are true unique features of NS50

According to Thales, the NS50 provides for the first time a complete and superior level of self-protection capability against air and surface threats for this category of high value MCM vessels. A strategic choice for small to medium vessels, the NS50 offers dual functions between air and surface surveillance and fire control.

Contacted by Naval News, Commander Bultot, Project Leader of the BE-NL rMCM program said :

The Belgian and Royal Netherlands Navy are very pleased with the acquisition of the NS50 Radar. This advanced full 4D radar will provide the necessary features to our rMCM vessels to be able to perform their tasks in complex environments. The radar has very valuable features such as extended detection ranges, full aerial compilation picture for tracking our legacy UAV and other targets, excellent stabilization features, …

Pauline Clausard Leblais , Sales Manager for MCMV at Thales said during a phone interview:

This is an important contract for Thales because it gives us the opportunity to establish the NS50 in a market segment today which includes 2D radars exclusively. So we are happy with this contract award. We are very active on this market segment and of course we have several customers showing a great interest in the NS50.

Hugo Anbeek, NS50 product manager at Thales added:

“I think there is a very strong interest in the NS50 since we launched it at Euronaval 2018. We are pursuing several opportunities at this moment .”

Delivery of the first radar is planned for 2023 and while the last one is expected to be handed over to the customer before 2033, the contract spanning over a period of 10 years.

“We are currently in the final stage of the NS50 development. During this phase, we developed, produced and tested NS50 elements. The NS50 today has passed successfully all the major engineering design validation stages and we are now preparing for the series production of the radar” added Pauline Clausard Leblais.

The initial NS50 radar will be tested first at the Thales site of Hengelo (in the Netherlands) and then at the Naval Group shipyard in Brittany for the integration and tests of the radar with the combat system of the first-in-class MCM vessel for the Belgian Navy.

It has to be noted that unlike NS100 and NS200, Thales systematically delivers NS50 with a radome.

NS family of radars

An important aspect of the NS50 is that Thales maximized the use of components and software from the existing NS family of radars. “If you look at the below deck equipment, the commonality is almost 100%. The physical, electrical and data interfaces are almost identical. This helps the shipyards and integrators during construction of the ship, but it also helps us a lot in the development phase” explained Hugo Anbeek.

NS50 is an X-band radar, while NS100 and NS200 are S-band, therefore the transmitter receiver part is unique. There are four customers to date for the rest of the NS family of radars: The NS100 has been procured by the Republic of Singapore Navy (While Thales can not comment on this information but the RSN website indicates the Littoral Mission Vessels as the platform), the Royal Netherlands Navy (HNLMS Rotterdam and HNLMS Johan de Witt LPDs) and recently the Royal Navy (Type 31 frigates). The NS200 has been procured by the Royal Netherlands Army and is fitted on trucks.

Fire control

According to Pauline Clausard Leblais, what makes the NS50 unique is its fire control capability. Thanks to this new mode, customers don’t need to procure a dedicated fire control radar. With NS50 they pretty much get two radars in one. On the MCM motherships of the Belgian and Royal Netherlands Navies, the NS50 will be used to provide fire control data for the main gun (which is set to be the BAE Systems Bofors 40Mk4 as Naval News understands). There will be no dedicated fire control radars aboard these vessels.

“This is what makes the NS50 unique, it is a game changer. We bring dual performances in a single radar: Both surveillance and fire control. This is more affordable for the navies in terms of procurement. It also has advantages in terms of foot print and performances”.



Pauline Clausard Leblais

2D vs 4D

Thales calls the NS50 a “4D” radar. Thales image.

NS50 was designed to replace the Variant in Thales portfolio of naval radars. The Variant however, like all radars so far in this market segment (i.e. radar for MCM vessels, OPVs, Fast Attack Craft…) is a 2D radar while Thales defines the NS50 as being a “4D” AESA radar. Legacy 2D radars were limited to providing range and azimuth information only. In comparison, NS50 now brings:

Range

Azimuth

Altitude

Doppler / time on target

With NS50, Thales gives the end user the ability to electronically scan with the radar beams (dual axis multi beam technology): Thanks to the multiple beams in azimuth, the radar can spend more time on target and more effectively see and measure the target. This is yes another unique and game changing capability in this radar segment.

“NS50 is scalable. We can adapt the number of TR modules depending on customer requirements that means that NS50 can also be a good candidate for small corvette types of platforms”.



Hugo Anbeek

NS50 future upgrades and applications

Thales NS50 4D AESA radar scale-model showcased at LIMA 2019. Naval News picture.

A future upgrade of NS50 might bring a staring mode, where the radar stops from spinning and tracks the target more accurately, a technology inherited from the SMART-L MM which uses this mode for anti-ballistic missions. NS50 also inherits the latest radar technology from Thales development on the APAR Blk2.

Naval News understands that the NS50 could be used as a secondary, dedicated X-band radar aboard larger surface combatants (supplementing an S-band radar) in a similar fashion to Northrop Grumman’s SPQ-9B which is fitted aboard several classes of U.S. Navy and JMSDF vessels. Such a X-band radar has the capability to detect and track low-flying, high-speed, small Radar Cross Section anti-ship missile targets in heavy clutter environments…

Hugo Anbeek told us “That is an area where X-band radars excels over S-band radars because you have better performance against surface target, you have a better overall accuracy and resolution. For sure, we imagine NS50 being used in such a role for larger ships. We also see NS50 as a possible secondary radar, completing a NS100 or NS200”.

Naval News believes vessels such as Germany’s MKS180, Germany and Netherlands’ LCF replacement, Netherlands’ ASWF (M frigates replacement) and even Italy and France’s Horizon-class (post MLU) could feature NS50 in a similar role to SPQ-9B.

Right now Thales is focused on the naval market with NS50, but that doesn’t mean that it will not have a future in the land domain. This was the case of the NS200, initially unveiled at Euronaval 2016 for naval customers but the Netherlands Army ended up procuring it (as GM200 MMC).

About rMCM program

The Belgian Ministry of Defense officially notified the consortium Belgian Naval & Robotics (formed by Naval Group & ECA Group) on May 22, 2019, a contract to supply 12 motherships and associated equipment to the Belgian and Dutch Navies.

According to Commander Bultot, rMCM Project Leader, the first steel cut of the first-in-class ship is set to take place at the Kership (Piriou) shipyard in Concarneau, France, on 21 June 2021.

Designed by Naval Group, the MCM mothership has one port and one starboard LARS located slightly aft of midship, close to the ship’s centre of gravity. Each LARS consists of a pivoting A-Frame davit with the USV, weighing up to 18t, housed in a floating cradle. It allows the simultaneous launch of two USVs with maximal safety. For the Belgian-Dutch mine countermeasure (MCM) program, conducted by Belgium Naval Robotics – a Naval Group and ECA Group consortium -, they will be used to operate two ECA’s Inspector 125 USV.

The Inspector 125 USV has a length of about 12 meters, a beam of about 4 meters and a full load weight of 18.1 tons. According to ECA Group, the Inspector 125 is designed to receive a wide range of payload with easy and quick reconfiguration capability. It can carry, deploy and recover the A18 mid-size AUV, the T18 LARS for seafloor survey or MCM detection operation or 2x SEASCAN + 6x K-STER C for MCM identification and neutralization operations. The Inspector 125 has an endurance of 40 hours, a maximum speed of 25 knots and an operational range of 12 nautical miles (from the mother-ship).

The mothership itself is 82 meters long with a displacement of 2,500 tons and a crew complement of 30 sailors (total accommodation for 63 people). It is fitted with a Bofors 40Mk4 40m main gun system, FN Herstal’ Sea deFNder 12.7mm remote weapon stations, an NS50 radar by Thales, Sea Eagle EO/IR by Chess Dynamics, Saab TactiCall Communication System, and a platform for SKELDAR V-200 VTOL UAV.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999877214431763}",positive,0.9999877214431763,1

Telesat Picks Thales for Lightspeed LEO Constellation - Via Satellite,"Tue, 09 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhdGVsbGl0ZXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jb25uZWN0aXZpdHkvMjAyMS8wMi8wOS90ZWxlc2F0LXBpY2tzLXRoYWxlcy1mb3ItbGlnaHRzcGVlZC1sZW8tY29uc3RlbGxhdGlvbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Telesat has selected Thales Alenia Space as the prime contractor to manufacture the Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) constellation it is calling Lightspeed. The agreement between Telesat and Thales is worth $3 billion, and Telesat is investing about $5 billion total into the project, CEO Dan Goldberg said in a Tuesday press conference.

The deal marks a long-awaited announcement on the details of Telesat’s LEO constellation, its largest procurement ever, and a venture away from Geostationary Orbit (GEO) from the Canadian satellite operator.

“It is far and away the most advanced, capable Low-Earth Orbit satellite network ever conceived,” Goldberg said. “We’re calling it Lightspeed to capture the inherent speed advantages that our customers will have using this network for broadband connectivity.”

The initial constellation will be made up of 298 Ka-band satellites to provide broadband internet service. Telesat expects to launch the first satellites in approximately two years, with customer beta testing beginning shortly thereafter and commercial services commencing in the second half of 2023. Full global service is targeted for the second half of 2024.

Whereas Starlink, the business of competitor SpaceX, is going direct-to-consumer, Telesat is focused on the enterprise market. Goldberg said Lightspeed has been designed to service Mobile Network Operators (MNOs), telcos, Internet Service Providers (ISPs), and to provide backhaul connectivity and broadband to the aero, maritime, and government markets. In late 2020, Telesat reached a $462 million deal with the Canadian government to offer a dedicated pool of capacity that MNOs and ISPs can purchase at reduced rates to serve eligible rural households and Indigenous communities in Canada.

The combined capacity of the satellite network is 15 Tbps. Telesat did not share a price point for Lightspeed capacity. Goldberg said different markets have different characteristics on price, but said it will be an “order of magnitude” less expensive than the satellite services Telesat offers today.

Goldberg said Telesat is working with vendors in the different markets to develop user antennas, and Telesat is confident the terminals will be ready when the constellation is ready for service. Lightspeed will support both Electronically Steered Antennas (ESAs) and mechanically steered antennas for various markets including requirements for land, land-mobile, aeronautical, maritime, and other platforms.

“Some of these antennas already exist,” Goldberg said. “The type of antenna that would go on a cruise ship doesn’t look terribly different than the type of parabolic antennas that are on those types of ships today. They’ll be vastly more high throughput, it will able to deliver Gigabits of capacity to a cruise ship, for instance and Gigabits of capacity to remote communities and other locations.”

Telesat did not provide a target launch cadence, but Goldberg confirmed that as previously announced, Blue Origin will provide multiple launches for the constellation, and Telesat plans to use other launch service providers as well.

Telesat and Thales have performed a “significant” amount of work over the past two years together on this project. The satellites will be in the 700 kg class to 750 kg class, and involve a number of different advanced technologies. Each satellite will have phased array antennas combined with beam-hopping technology to create approximately 135,000 beams that can dynamically target multiple Gigabits per second of capacity to respond to demand. Each satellite will have four optical links to create a space-based mesh IP network. According to a network fact sheet, up to 7.5 Gbps can be offered to a single terminal, and up to 20 Gbps can be offered to a single hotspot site, such as a remote community, airport hub or sea port.

The constellation will also be deployed to both Polar and Inclined Orbital planes for global coverage, with 78 satellites in Polar Orbit, and 220 satellites in Inclined Orbit.

When the Thales factory is up and running, Thales plans to produce about one satellite per day. Thales will provide not only the space and mission segments, but also the end-to-end network performance and related specifications of the system.

“[Thales is the] world leader in delivering NGSO constellations,” Goldberg told Via Satellite Tuesday. “They build state-of-the-art satellites [and] they’re good at the other network elements. This is a very advanced, integrated network. We wanted a partner who could deliver more than just high-performing, advanced satellites — we wanted somebody who could deliver a high-performing, integrated, end-to-end network. They’ve got a really good track record on that with Iridium and the work they did for O3b.”

The deal is a win for Thales, the French-Italian aerospace manufacturer, which also developed GlobalStar 2, O3b and Iridium NEXT. Thales Alenia Space and joint venture Telespazio also made a capacity commitment on Lightspeed, the details of which were not disclosed.

“Telesat’s Lightspeed constellation will be at the highest level of global space connectivity. I am happy with the selection of Thales Alenia Space as industrial prime contractor for this ambitious project supported by a strong partnership between France and Canada. This selection also illustrates the excellence of the French and European space industry,” Bruno Le Maire, French minister of the Economy, Finance and Recovery commented in a press release.

Tuesday’s announcement was years in the making, as Telesat first announced its LEO plans in November 2016, and put up a demonstration satellite in 2018. At that time in 2018, Telesat was targeting service in 2021.

According to the announcement, financing for the project is still being finalized, but the parties will advance on the project in the meantime. This comes after Telesat announced in late 2020 that it will combine with major shareholder Loral Space & Communications to form one public company to finance the constellation. Goldberg said Tuesday the close of the deal does not need to await a stock market listing. He expects a public listing at some point over the summer.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999827146530151}",neutral,0.9999827146530151,0
Qatar Airways upgrading legacy IFE on 787-8s with Thales AVANT - Runway Girl Network,"Wed, 03 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMjEvMDIvcWF0YXItYWlyd2F5cy11cGdyYWRpbmctbGVnYWN5LWlmZS1vbi03ODctOHMtd2l0aC10aGFsZXMtYXZhbnQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Qatar Airways is upgrading the legacy Thales TopSeries inflight entertainment systems on its Boeing 787-8 twinjets with the latest generation Thales AVANT system which includes lightweight touchscreens and greater content storage.

The Doha-based carrier selected TopSeries for its 787-8s in 2010, saying it would also be the launch customer for Thales’ passenger handset controller. The idea was to have passengers interact with the IFE system in a way they were familiar with; a smartphone-like device with a capacitive screen that mimics everyday smartphone use.

But Thales’ execution of the tethered remote in aviation left a lot to be desired, as RGN learned in 2015 while on board British Airways’ 787-9, which featured the hardware in first class. The performance of the remote was partly the victim of the lengthy development and certification cycle in aviation. And by 2015, Thales was already hard at work on an update.

While Thales does not mention the remote in its latest statement about Qatar Airways’ IFE upgrade, it notes that the airline – already a customer of AVANT – has been eager to replicate the AVANT experience on its 787-8s without disrupting utilization of the fleet and minimizing downtime during the retrofit installation.

“To achieve the carrier’s ambition, Thales has developed an upgrade program to adapt the existing legacy system to incorporate new AVANT screens and servers into the existing seats and aircraft infrastructure,” says the French multinational corporation.

For Qatar Airways’ 787-8 IFE retrofit, the focus has shifted to new capacitive touchscreens. Thales assures that passengers will be able to seamlessly navigate the graphical user interface using familiar gestures.

The monitors – 17″ full HD touchscreens in business and 12″ smart displays in economy – are also two to three times brighter than the former technology, according to Thales.

“This turnkey approach includes delivery of full seat modification, hardware and all required certifications, as well as the ability to leverage media integration commonality across the Qatar Airways’ fleet equipped with AVANT,” adds the firm.

Financial terms have not been disclosed.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999462366104126}",neutral,0.9999462366104126,0

HALO: first component of Gateway cislunar space station takes shape - Thales,"Mon, 15 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi93b3JsZHdpZGUvc3BhY2UvbmV3cy9oYWxvLWZpcnN0LWNvbXBvbmVudC1nYXRld2F5LWNpc2x1bmFyLXNwYWNlLXN0YXRpb24tdGFrZXMtc2hhcGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Lunar Gateway’s Habitation And Logistics Outpost (HALO) is moving forwards. Thales Alenia Space, in coordination with prime contractor Northrop Grumman, marks a first major milestone regarding the Lunar quest: the welding of two components, a ring and a cylinder for HALO, initiating the assembly of the module’s primary structure. This memorable moment happened recently in our Turin plant.

This first milestone confirms the longstanding partnership between the two companies and their unrivaled expertise in flight-proven spacecraft technologies, allowing the delivery of this state-of-the-art deep space habitat.

Focus on HALO

HALO will be one of the first two elements, together with the Power and Propulsion Element (PPE), to form Lunar Gateway, scheduled for launch in 2024, as a part of Artemis mission, led by NASA.

The module will be the initial habitat for astronauts visiting Gateway, their basic living space, enabling the preparation for the trip to the lunar surface. It will provide command, control and data handling capabilities, energy storage and power distribution, thermal control, communications and tracking capabilities. It will be equipped with 3 docking ports for visiting vehicles and future modules, as well as space for science and stowage. With NASA’s Orion spacecraft docked, it will be able to sustain up to four astronauts for up to 30 days as they embark on, and return from, expeditions to the lunar surface.

Leveraging on its long-lasting legacy concerning Cygnus resupply vessels, for which Thales Alenia Space has provided all the pressurized cargo modules since 2013, our company will be able to deliver HALO’s pressurized module to Northrop Grumman, respecting a very ambitious schedule, while maintaining the highest quality standard.

The Moon at our fingertips

At Thales Alenia Space we are enthusiastic of being involved in Lunar Gateway, one of the pillars of NASA’s Artemis program, which aims to land people on the Moon by 2024. Our company has leveraged on its unique expertise regarding orbital infrastructures (producing half of the International Space Station’s pressurized volume), robotics, transportation systems & space exploration to become a top industrial partner onboard the cis-lunar Gateway space station.

In addition to HALO pressurized module, Thales Alenia Space was selected by ESA as the prime contractor for 2 additional elements, I-HAB and ESPRIT, dedicated to Gateway cislunar space station. We’re also onboard numerous programs linked to lunar exploration. While American company CommStar Space is counting on us to deploy a hybrid Earth-Moon communications relay satellite by 2023, we’ll also be supplying Earth-Moon telecom technologies for NASA’s VIPER rover, which will search for water on the surface. And we’re onboard the Dynetics-led consortium to help develop the Human Landing System for Artemis.

We’ve also been chosen by Axiom Space to provide 2 pressurized components of their future commercial space station, for which French designer Philippe Starck was selected to create interiors of the habitation module.

These recent successes strengthens Thales Alenia Space’s world leadership in orbital infrastructures and confirms its leading position in lunar exploration programs.

The space odyssey to the moon has never been so close!

"On Mars, with Perseverance! - Thales","Fri, 19 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi93b3JsZHdpZGUvc3BhY2UvbmV3cy9tYXJzLXBlcnNldmVyYW5jZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"After a journey lasting nearly seven months, NASA’s Perseverance rover touched down on Mars yesterday, February 18. It landed in the Jezero Crater, a 45-kilometer (28 mile) hole in the ground about 18 degrees north of the Martian equator.

This was a huge success for NASA’s Mars 2020 program and all partners involved, including of course Thales, which built the laser at the heart of SuperCam, the instrument that will look for potential signs of life on the Red Planet.

Everybody’s going to Mars!

In the last month alone, three new spacecraft arrived at our neighboring planet. This plethora of voyagers is not by chance: Earth and Mars are currently in the best position for interplanetary travel — a situation that occurs only once every 26 months. The first arrival, the United Arab Emirates’ Hope Probe, made it to the Red Planet on February 9, 2021. It will stay in orbit and study its atmosphere for one complete Martian year (687 Earth days). China’s Tianwen-1 spacecraft entered orbit this month and will begin scouting a potential landing site for its rover, due to be deployed in May.

These spacecraft joined six others already monitoring the Red Planet from above:

• NASA's Mars Odyssey, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO*) and MAVEN Orbiter

• Europe's Mars Express**

• India's Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM)

• ESA-Roscosmos ExoMars*** Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO)

Calling home… with a little help from your friends

Perseverance will rely on several fellow spacecraft already orbiting Mars to communicate with Earth – sending data and images back home and receiving commands from engineers.

The Thales Alenia Space-built Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) is one of these waystations. TGO was launched in March 2016 and has been in orbit around Mars since October 2016. It reached its definitive “scientific” orbit in April 2018 after an impressive aero-braking maneuver that allowed it to transition from a highly elliptic to a circular orbit while using very little propellant. Over the last four years, TGO has been carrying out scientific observations. Not only does it take detailed 3D pictures of the surface, it also analyzes the Martian atmosphere, looking in particular for traces of methane, an essential component of life, and then determining whether it is of biological or geological origin. In addition, TGO acts as a communications relay between Mars and Earth. In the following weeks TGO will try to take shots of Perseverance, since it will fly over this rover just four hours after the landing.

In addition to Mars 2020, TGO is also supporting NASA’s InSight mission, meaning that it can accommodate at least four data relay passages per Martian day (2 for Perseverance, 1 for InSight and 1 for Curiosity). This experience will be very useful for the upcoming ExoMars 2022 mission.

Europe’s Mars Express spacecraft, integrated by Thales Alenia Space and launched in 2003, also plays a critical role. Not only has it helped answer fundamental questions about the geology, atmosphere and potential for life on Mars, it also provides additional wide angle views and is monitoring conditions in the targeted Perseverance landing site.

Humanity got its first close-up look at Mars on July 15, 1965, when NASA’s Mariner 4 spacecraft flew past the Red Planet, recording grainy images of a barren, cratered surface. They were the first glimpses of another planet as seen from space.

Kicking off a new decade of space exploration

Thales Alenia Space recently signed an Authorization to Proceed (ATP) with Airbus Defence and Space, prime contractor for the Earth Return Orbiter (ERO), which will bring samples from Mars back to Earth. ERO is one of the key components in the Mars Sample Return (MSR) mission, an international program led by NASA.

At Thales Alenia Space, we are delighted to have been chosen for the Lunar Gateway, one of the pillars of NASA’s Artemis program, which aims to land people on the Moon by 2024. Our company leveraged its unique expertise in orbital infrastructures (including half of the International Space Station’s pressurized volume), robotics, transportation systems and space exploration to take an important role on the cis-lunar Gateway space station.

We are also involved in a number of other programs concerning lunar exploration. These recent successes strengthen Thales Alenia Space’s global leadership in orbital infrastructures and confirm our leading position in lunar exploration programs.

Thales Alenia Space develops cutting-edge solutions dedicated to the exploration of the Moon, Mars and deep space, with the Moon being used as an outpost for further-ranging human exploration missions. Mars will undoubtedly be the next stop after the Moon. In short, the Moon and Mars have never been so close!

*Thales Alenia Space supplied SHARAD (Mars SHAllow RADar), a subsurface sounding radar, for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) probe.

**MARSIS, the Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionosphere Sounding, one of the main instruments on ESA’s Mars Express orbiter, was developed on behalf of Italian space agency ASI by Sapienza University of Rome, in collaboration with JPL, and produced by Thales Alenia Space in Italy. It works by emitting low-frequency radio pulses that penetrate the subsurface and are reflected back, indicating changes in the density or composition of materials. By analyzing these echoes, it is possible to determine the dielectric constant.

The high-gain antenna, 2.54 meters in diameter, will operate in both the X and Ka bands. Just one of our contributions to the project, it will transmit data back to Earth and also be used for the radio-science instrument. Thales Alenia Space has already supplied high-gain antennas for major scientific missions, including Cassini, BepiColombo, ExoMars and Euclid.

The JUICE antenna is designed to withstand the stresses of launch, significant temperature variations, ionizing radiation, ultraviolet rays and the strong magnetic fields around Jupiter and its moons. It was developed directly as a proto-flight model, so an extensive delta qualification program was needed to check the performance of the composite materials and coating when subjected to 32000 ESH (equivalent sun hours) and a temperature range from -214°C to 214°C.

The antenna was designed by Thales Alenia Space in Rome, which also handled the integration and testing, with production at L'Aquila and painting in Turin.

Thales Alenia Space on board for an unprecedented technological experiment

February 4, 2021 – Thales Alenia Space, a joint venture between Thales (67%) and Leonardo (33%), is partnering with South Korean operator KT SAT, subsidiary of the world’s first 5G commercial service provider Korea Telecom, to lead 5G demonstration using the geostationary Koreasat 5A telecommunication satellite to provide 5G network to remote areas.

KT SAT will use 5G backhauling as the first stone of satellite integration in the 5G world. This unprecedented experiment consists in backhauling the connection between a 5G Core Network and a 5G gNB through KT SAT Koreasat-5A(GEO satellite). In this case, the satellite is not only a complement to terrestrial 5G network but a fully integrated part of it by receiving 5G network from Earth and then returning it to remote areas where traditional backhauling technologies (wired, fiber, radio beams) are not suitable for technical and/or economic reasons. This demo was implemented from the KT SAT’s Kumsan teleport.

Koreasat-5A, orbited by SpaceX in 2017, is based on a Thales Alenia Space’s Spacebus 4000B2 platform, and it is equipped with Ku-band transponders. Koreasat 5A covers Indochina, Japan, Korea, the Philippines and Central Asia. Thales Alenia Space was the prime contractor for KOREASAT-5A, in charge of its design, production and testing.

It is not the first time that Thales Alenia Space is involved in 5G demonstration. Indeed, on February 20th 2018, as part of “5G Champion”, a Horizon 20201 research project that is being financed by the European Commission, Thales Alenia Space, with CEA/LETI (electronics and IT lab) and Nokia as partners, showcased 5G communications technology demonstration at the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea. As a 3GPP2 member, Thales Alenia Space continue to adopt new standards regarding NTN (Non Terrestrial Network) in 5G with strong acceleration of the traditional cellular stakeholders.

“This new partnership between Thales Alenia Space and KT SAT shows a trustful relationship between both companies, reinforces Thales Alenia Space’s implication in South Korean market and strengthens its pioneer position in 5G” declared Marc-Henri Serre, VP Telecommunication at Thales Alenia Space.

KT SAT CEO Song Kyung-Min said “This satellite-based 5G backhaul experiment using KOREASAT has opened possibilities for 5G communications without geographical divisions caused by mountains and oceans. Based on this technology, KT SAT will expand its global outreach, particularly in Southeast Asia where terrestrial network construction faces difficulties.”

In November last year, KT SAT unveiled the world’s first router for hybrid satellite-terrestrial 5G transmission. The hybrid router, demonstrated online, was developed with the KT Institute of Convergence Technology, further expanding the role of satellites in 5G services.

1 Horizon 2020 is a European program supporting Research & Development for the period 2014-2020.

2 3rd Generation Partnership Project created in 1998. It groups seven international telecom standardization bodies, several hundred industry companies, associations and public institutions. It is tasked with the development and maintenance of technical specifications concerning mobile telephony standards.

Acting as telecommunications cell towers in space, the space assets – the plan envisages 16 satellites from 2022 to reach 96 satellites by 2025 with an investment of around 100 million euros – will enable the deployment of IoT services in sectors such as maritime, logistics, energy, agri-food, infrastructures and environmental monitoring.

Sateliot has reached an agreement with Thales Alenia Space in Spain and France to coordinate the design and development of the technologies required to offer the envisaged IoT services with 5G coverage from 2022.

In more detail, Thales Alenia Space will build on over 40 years of experience in the space sector to ensure the viability of the entire technical phase - including engineering activities and the definition of the mission and end-user needs - with the objective of guaranteeing coverage extension services to European, American, South American and even African telecommunications operators from 2022.

The agreement between Sateliot and Telespazio is aimed at promoting the development of the IoT market. In particular, Sateliot will leverage Telespazio’s experience and penetration in the international space services market to assess the main needs of customers in different sectors, while Telespazio will use Sateliot’s capabilities to boost its offering in an IoT sector that already includes global hybrid coverage based on the integration of LTE/WiFi/Lora/Satellite technologies.

This partnership confirms Telespazio’s vocation for innovation and the constant quest for increasingly advanced services for partners, customers and citizens, in-line with Leonardo’s strategy and initiatives aimed at sustainable progress in a safer world. The agreement will allow Telespazio and Sateliot to develop new IoT services in sectors such as seaborne freight, agriculture, infrastructure management and telecommunications. In the freight sector, for example, IoT sensors connected via satellite are able to offer information about the load status, allowing transport monitoring and enhanced security, while in the agricultural sector they can provide real-time data to promote sustainable crop management. IoT sensors are also one of the most promising solutions for infrastructure monitoring and management, maintenance management, traffic status control and rescue operations management after accidents.

According to Jaume Sanpera, founder and CEO of Sateliot, ""This strategic agreement with the Space Alliance, formed by Thales Alenia Space and Telespazio, underpins our business plan focused on two growth paths. On the one hand, through a transversal strategy with telecommunications operators. And, on the other, through a vertical business line, aimed at end customers, to whom we will facilitate the monitoring of different variables in real time for profitable decision making for their businesses"".

The objective of Sateliot's business plan is to close 2025 with a turnover of around 236 million euros and a total workforce of over 100 people. To make this possible, Sateliot has completed two capital increases and is negotiating a new round of financing with various international funds.

About Sateliot

Sateliot is the first satellite telecommunications operator that will provide global and continuous connectivity to all the elements that will make up the universe of the Internet of Things (IoT) -such as the connected car or home- under the 5G protocol. Thanks to a constellation of state-of-the-art nanosatellites, located at low altitude that act as mobile cell towers, Sateliot is the perfect complement to large telecommunications companies by providing the necessary infrastructure where terrestrial technologies do not reach.

IXV, the Intermediate Experimental Vehicle, was launched six years ago to the day, on February 11, 2015. It made a flawless suborbital flight lasting 100 minutes and covering 25,000 kilometers, the last 8,000 in a searing atmospheric descent and splashdown right on target in the Pacific Ocean. With the IXV space capsule, built in Italy by Thales Alenia Space, Europe was able to test critical reentry technologies.

ESA’s aero-thermodynamics experts continue to analize this data, to make sure their computer models match reality so they can design future reentry missions. These results confirmed many assumptions, but they also produced new findings. External temperatures were lower than predicted, while fuel consumption was higher, but this was offset by better aerodynamic performance, and the shorter blackout time during reentry allowed better communications.

Europe’s upcoming reentry vehicles will draw on all the lessons learned from the IXV mission. The next step is Space Rider, Europe’s own reusable space transportation system for unmanned missions and routine access to low Earth orbit (LEO). It will carry a variety of payloads into different LEO altitudes and inclinations.Designed as a free-flying orbital platform, Space Rider is capable of remaining two months in orbit, then reentering the atmosphere and landing to within 150 meters of its target. It can then be refurbished and reused for up to six missions.

The first launch is planned for 2023, using a Vega C light launcher from the Guiana Space Center in French Guiana. Space Rider will be 9.7 meters long and weigh 2,430 kg, with a payload capacity of 600 kg inside a 1.2 cubic meter cargo bay. It will hit a maximum speed of Mach 28 at an altitude of 90 km, with the nose reaching a maximum temperature of 1700K. During the descent, a parachute will open when it reaches an altitude of 16 km and a speed of Mach 0.73, decelerating the vehicle to 50 meters/second. The final part of the descent uses a parafoil to provide aero-braking and limit the landing run after touchdown.

Space Rider will facilitate Europe’s access to low Earth orbit since it combines the capabilities of a free-flying satellite platform with reusability. At the same time, it will further improve the technological capabilities of Europe’s space industry. A host of other applications is also possible, such as On-Orbit Servicing.

Thales Alenia Space leads a consortium of European manufacturers, research centers and universities, and is in charge of the development of the reentry module (RM), the most challenging part of the project. AVIO is responsible for the propulsion system and the expendable service module.

Rheinmetall BAE Systems Land (RBSL) and Rheinmetall Landsystems (RLS) having jointly awarded Thales in the UK a £180m contract for the supply and integration of the PROTECTOR RS4 Remote Weapon Station (RWS) and the Acusonic® Shot Detection system for the British Army’s new Boxer, 8x8, armoured vehicle.

Integration work will happen at Thales’s Glasgow Vehicle Integration Centre ensuring dozens of skilled engineering jobs are maintained on the banks of the Clyde for many years to come.

Minister of State for Defence, Baroness Goldie said:

“This £180m contract with Thales in the UK will deliver pioneering surveillance and protection for our front line soldiers and our new Boxer fleet. We depend on skills and technology from across the United Kingdom and this order will secure 700 Scottish jobs.""

“Our troops face a myriad of new and emerging threats so it is imperative we invest in critical detect and destroy technology such as this.”

As part of the contract Thales, as a strategic partner to Kongsberg Defence and Aerospace, will fully assemble and integrate around 500 RWS and deliver and integrate circa 500 Thales Acusonic® systems onto the Boxer vehicles over the next 10 years, as part of the UK MOD’s Mechanised Infantry Vehicle (MIV) programme.

Not only will Thales integrate Kongsberg’s RWS onto these new armoured vehicles but as an additional bonus Thales also supplies several of the components used in the PROTECTOR RS4 creating a double win for Thales. The Catherine EZ Thermal Imaging Module as well as the CELT3 Laser Range Finder, both products that are made at the Glasgow site and form crucial elements for the completed RWS, giving them their cutting edge ‘situational awareness’ capability.

Another Thales product, Acusonic, was first supplied in 2018 to the British Army’s AJAX Armoured Vehicle Programme and now, under this contract, will be fitted to Boxer as well. Designed to accurately sense and report the direction of incoming enemy fire, the Acusonic system gives the vehicle’s crew the critical situational awareness to react to the threat.

Its innovative sensing system is based on Thales’s world class sonar technology that provides the ‘ears’ for ships and submarines around the world.

Steven Lockley, Managing Director of Thales in the UK’s vehicle integration business in Glasgow, said:

“Thales’ sub-contract is a great step forward after months of hard work. Working with our strategic partners, Thales is bringing new skills and technologies into the programme, our facilities in Scotland and the UK supply chain.”

Thales helps to equip almost every major land platform in service or in development with the UK armed forces. The work for Boxer will be completed at Thales’s facility in Glasgow, which employs 700 skilled engineers and technicians. As a major contributor to the Scottish economy, this contract will support further growth and protect key manufacturing skills in the UK, including 30 apprentices currently receiving training in Glasgow.

Minister for Scotland, Iain Stewart said:

“We look forward to working with Thales in the UK on the delivery of these Remote Weapons Stations, knowing this contract will not only contribute to the safety of British military personnel on the front line, but also support industry growth here in Scotland.

“Protecting hundreds of jobs and supporting 30 apprenticeships, this £180 million UK Government investment further demonstrates our commitment to supporting the defence sector in Scotland and underscores the many opportunities available within the United Kingdom economy.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9994687438011169}",neutral,0.9994687438011169,0
"Tranquility and Cupola, a stellar combo benefiting mankind since 2010 - Thales","Mon, 08 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi93b3JsZHdpZGUvc3BhY2UvbmV3cy90cmFucXVpbGl0eS1hbmQtY3Vwb2xhLXN0ZWxsYXItY29tYm8tYmVuZWZpdGluZy1tYW5raW5kLTIwMTAtMNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Eleven years ago to the day, the Space Shuttle Endeavour lifted off with two new modules for the International Space Station: Node 3, dubbed Tranquility, and the Cupola. Both were designed, integrated and tested by Thales Alenia Space in Turin, Italy. The two modules were docked to the ISS a few days after the launch, to the great satisfaction of all astronauts involved.

Supporting life with Tranquility

Node 3, named Tranquility in honor of the first human landing on the Moon in July 1969, in the Sea of Tranquility, is the third connecting module on the Space Station. It joined two similar modules, Unity and Harmony, already part of the ISS from the outset. Tranquility, which also serves as a berthing location for the Cupola, not only provides crew members with additional room, but also includes life support systems such as water recycling and oxygen generation. It also houses a treadmill and a waste and lavatory compartment. It is definitely a “one-stop shop” for the astronauts, allowing them to go to the bathroom, exercise and relax.

Cupola, the real rock star module

Why is the Cupola so special? ESA astronaut Luca Parmitano, who recently returned to Earth after serving as commander of the “Beyond” mission on the International Space Station, wrote in his blog “This window on the world has fascinated and charmed all astronauts and cosmonauts who have had the privilege of looking at our planet from up here. Its seven windows allow a 360 degree view of the horizon and offer a spectacle of unparalleled beauty...”.

These are the largest windows ever installed on a manned space station. The Cupola, as its name suggests, is fully outfitted for astronauts to observe the Earth, including a variety of cameras. By design, the module always faces the Earth, allowing astronauts to observe day or night. They can also set up cameras to automatically shoot photos while they perform other tasks. Once published, these exceptional shots burnished the Space Station's reputation as an ideal spaceborne observatory, a taste of the future Window Tunnel onboard the Lunar Gateway.

From ISS to Gateway

Everybody at Thales Alenia Space is justifiably proud of the ISS. The company has provided fully half of the pressurized volume on the International Space Station, including Nodes 2 and 3, the Leonardo Permanent Multipurpose Module (PMM), the Multipurpose Logistics Modules (MPLM), the Cupola and the Columbus lab structure, along with cargo modules for the ATV resupply vessels and the structure for the Bishop commercial airlock from NanoRacks. Thales Alenia Space also builds, on behalf of Northrop Grumman, the pressurized cargo modules (PCM) for the Cygnus resupply vessels. Thales Alenia Space has capitalized on its expertise in low Earth orbit (LEO) technologies, orbital infrastructures and reusable space transport technologies to develop innovative solutions for future human exploration of the Moon, Mars and perhaps even deep space.

Our company was chosen by ESA to develop two key modules for the upcoming Lunar Gateway: I-HAB and the ESPRIT communications and refueling module.

And yet, Northrop Grumman has recently selected us to develop the pressurized module for HALO (Habitation And Logistic Outpost) which will be one of the first parts to form the lunar space station, Gateway, to be launched in 2023.

In August 2012 the Curiosity rover, equipped with the ChemCam and its high-powered laser, landed on Mars, tasked with discovering whether the environment on the planet may once have had the right conditions to support life forms. The answer was a resounding “Yes!” – there are indeed regions on Mars that, in a distant past, could have supported the micro-organisms known as microbes.

Almost nine years after that historic landing, there is a new rover on the Red Planet, as part of the Mars 2020 mission: Perseverance, which made its landing on 18 February 2021. Its goal is to explore and study in detail Jezero crater – billions of years ago the site of a lake and river delta – for the actual signs of that past life, and to identify and collect samples of rock and dust, which could be brought back to Earth by the Mars Sample Return mission for further, more comprehensive study.

© NASA/JPL-Caltech

Collecting rock samples might sound like a relatively simple task, but Mars’s arid terrain and extreme atmospheric conditions make the mission extremely difficult. The average temperature on the planet is -63°C (compared to around 15°C on Earth), with summer highs on the equator of 20°C and night-time lows sometimes reaching -143°C! Mars rovers thus need to be designed to carry the equipment needed for the mission, but also to withstand not only the icy cold but also the extreme differences in temperature.

This time around, the rover’s high-performance equipment includes SuperCam, a kind of supercharged version of Curiosity’s ChemCam, providing imaging, mineralogy and chemical composition analysis.

At the heart of SuperCam is an even more powerful laser, designed – just as it was for Curiosity – by teams at Thales. Our long-standing expertise in the field of laser technology, combined with close and trusted collaboration with SMEs and local partners, allowed it to overcome the complex challenges that Perseverance will face in seeking out the organic compounds that could point to past life on Mars.

The red laser in the SuperCam heats and vaporises material; the light emitted by the plasma this creates can then be analysed, thus providing the means to ascertain the chemical composition of rock samples.

In addition, a green laser enables the determination of the molecular makeup of materials on the planet’s surface, through a technique called Raman spectroscopy, which is being tested for the first time on Mars. These twin technologies mean that the SuperCam is capable of identifying the chemical and mineral makeup of tiny targets, some as small as a pencil point, from over 20 feet (7 metres) away.

The Red Planet may be tens of millions of miles away, but the degree of minute precision that Thales’s laser technology provides may finally allow us to dream of getting an answer to the age-old question: “Is there life on Mars?”

All it will take is time…and a little perseverance.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999886751174927}",neutral,0.9999886751174927,0

LinkedIn

10 years ago, Thales designed, developed and implemented the Auckland Integrated Fares System (AIFS), a scalable transport interoperability scheme with the ability to integrate rail, bus, ferry, and other transport modes.

The AIFS, branded ‘AT HOP’, is Auckland and New Zealand’s first, true multi-modal transport system.

Over 2 million AT HOP cards have been sold to date with around 1.5 million cards in circulation.

In 2009, Thales was awarded the contract for designing, developing and implementing a fully-integrated smartcard system across all of Auckland’s modes of public transport. Auckland and New Zealand’s first, true multi-modal transport ticket, AT HOP is similar to London’s Oyster system and Hong Kong’s Octopus. It’s benchmarked against some of the best systems in the world.

Launched in May 2011, the highly successful smart card system has provided New Zealand with a proven, mature, multi-modal and multi-operator system leveraging some of the best fare collection systems already in operation in the world including Hong Kong, the Netherlands and Dubai.

Thales’ AIFS system is scalable, using open architecture and standards and ensuring flexibility and interoperability with 3rd-party suppliers.

In December 2014, 464,000 cards have been sold and 278,000 were active and in use daily. 31% of the Auckland population uses Public Transport to travel to work. By October 2020, 2,133,727 cards have been sold and 1,574,479 are active and in circulation. Some regions of Public Transport report over 97% use of the HOP card for Public Tranport.

The AIFS scheme has one of the lowest operating costs in the world at 8.8% of revenue. (per AT board agenda item 11.2 - Aug 2016).","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999589920043945}",neutral,0.9999589920043945,0
France places additional order for Thales’s O-NYX night vision goggles - EDR Magazine,"Thu, 04 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVkcm1hZ2F6aW5lLmV1L2ZyYW5jZS1wbGFjZXMtYWRkaXRpb25hbC1vcmRlci1mb3ItdGhhbGVzcy1vLW55eC1uaWdodC12aXNpb24tZ29nZ2xlc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"4 February 2021 – The French armed forces have demonstrated renewed trust in Thales, extending a long-standing partnership in night vision solutions with a new order for 3,000 O-NYX goggles.

With more than 80 years of experience in high-end optics and more than 110,000 night vision goggles in service worldwide, Thales has built on feedback from successive generations of operational users to enhance the perception of soldiers on night-time missions.

Less is more

Weighing less than 350 g, O-NYX goggles have a patented low-profile design that shortens the distance between the eyes and the centre of gravity of the equipment to minimise neck strain and improve wearing comfort for prolonged use. But as well as being easy to wear, O-NYX goggles deliver significant improvements in optical performance.

Enhanced tactical efficiency

Over the years, Thales has worked with successive generations of operational users and harnessed the latest advances in light intensification technology to bring featherweight, ultra-compact goggles within reach of each and every infantry soldier who needs to operate at night.

O-NYX goggles offer a 51° field of view, expanding the observed scene by 70% compared with conventional goggles, and the combination of pin-sharp resolution and a wider field of view augments the soldier’s perception and enhances situational awareness. With its low energy consumption, the new goggle will work for up to 40 hours on a single charge and can run on standard AA batteries when needed.

Small equipment, big ambitions

The O-NYX programme is part of moves to replace small equipment — items like handguns, helmets and bullet-proof vests — under the current French defence spending plan.

Underpinning Thales’s leadership in the optronics market is the Group’s end-to-end technology expertise, an integrated approach to product development and active engagement with an ecosystem of innovative industry partners in France.

For the O-NYX French programme, Thales’s partner Photonis enhanced the performance of its image intensification tubes and worked with the DGA and the French Army to validate its latest 4G tube technology, which increases optical performance by 50-60% compared to existing solutions.

The latest order for O-NYX night vision goggles is a further endorsement of Thales’s ability to combine all these capabilities with the experience and insights of operational users to build a future we can all trust.

“The French Army is known to be a demanding user with active experience in theatres. The deployment of the first O-NYX goggles with units in the field is a source of huge satisfaction for our teams.

The 10-year contract will equip the three armed forces with a common information system and set of sensors and is designated a high-impact programme (PEM[1]), alongside CONTACT and SCORPION, under France's defence spending plan. This joint tactical SIGINT system will provide French armed forces command with an expanded tactical electronic support measures (ESM) capability.

The tactical SIGINT programme will upgrade the electronic warfare capabilities of front-line units, providing a set of high-performance portable or vehicle-mounted assets compatible with the latest communications technologies. The new system to monitor and localise enemy communications will support tactical manoeuvres in the theatre of operations, helping to keep our forces safe and secure. It will equip the electronic support vehicles of the French Army's 54th Signals Regiment (SCORPION programme), the French Navy's front-line warships and the Atlantique 2 maritime patrol aircraft, and could be deployed to protect air bases on military operations overseas.

The system will be the only one of its kind in service with the French forces. All three armed forces will rely on the same logistics infrastructure to simplify training of specialist operators and optimise through-life support delivery.

The programme will benefit from the combined experience of co-contractors Thales and Airbus.

Thales will draw on the SIGINT expertise developed by the Group on several legacy programmes: COHORTE (the current French Army tactical SIGINT system), MINREM[2] (French Navy SIGINT system), ARCHANGE[3] (French Air Force new-generation SIGINT aircraft) and CLOVIS[4] (strategic interministerial communications localisation project). Thales will also build on its capabilities in end-to-end communications, radio communications and communications security.

Airbus will provide its expertise in strategic ELINT systems, drawing on its experience on programmes such as RAMSES (strategic radio and satellite communications information system) and PARADOS (radio signal acquisition sensor). These systems are currently in operational service with France's defence intelligence agency (DRM[5]), the French Army, the French Air and Space Force, and the French Navy. Airbus will also draw on its complex-systems integration and security know-how.

The first phase of the programme will provide the three armed forces with an initial operational capability for signals monitoring, with subsequent optional tranches to significantly increase the number of units in service. New functions (new data analytics functions for the information system, expanded detection and technical analysis capabilities, etc.) will be added incrementally over the term of the contract to provide the French armed forces with a set of state-of-the-art electronic warfare systems and capabilities.

As part of the SNLE 3G programme, the French defence procurement agency (DGA) has signed an MoU with Thales for the development of a complete sonar suite including a broad range of sonar arrays and associated processing systems.

The technological innovations planned for the various sonars will lead to order-of-magnitude increases in data volumes compared to current systems, which will require the use of artificial intelligence and Big Data algorithms.

With the launch of full-scale development of France’s third generation of nuclear-powered ballistic-missile submarines (SNLE 3G), Thales is developing a new sonar suite based on disruptive technologies that represent a significant break from the systems in service today.

Thales will provide new-generation flank arrays and bow-mounted sonars, a towed linear array based on optical technology (ALRO), and all the other equipment making up the sonar suite (intercept arrays, echo-sounders, underwater telephones). The size of the arrays and the frequency bands they use will deliver unparalleled performance in terms of 3D (azimuth, elevation, range) detection precision.

The ALICIA sensor data processing system (Analyse, Localisation, Identification, Classification Intégrées et Alertes), with a user interface designed to handle the diversity and volume of available data, will optimise operator workload and provide decision support.

The new sonar suite will be deployed incrementally, with the first technological building blocks and system versions due to be installed on second-generation SSBNs (SNLE 2G) from 2025, and on the third-generation submarines (SNLE 3G) from 2035.

“Thales teams have been especially focused on the SNLE 3G project to ensure that it benefits from our very best sonar innovations, which have been taking shape over the last five years as part of nearly 50 years of consistent investments in sovereign R&D to guarantee the invulnerability of France’s SSBNs. New sovereign sonar array, processing and Big Data technologies will deliver unparalleled performance for the third-generation SSBNs and will also be of benefit to the modernised Triomphant-class second-generation SSBNs. We thank the Ministry for the Armed Forces for the trust they have place in us, and we are happy to be working hand in hand with Naval Group on this major national project.” Alexis Morel, Vice President, Underwater Systems, Thales.

LinkedIn

In 2008, the city of Stuttgart unveiled a new slogan describing itself as ""Das neue Herz Europas"" (""The new heart of Europe"") and launched an ambitious plan to transform rail transport in and around the metropolitan area.

As part of this plan, Thales was recently awarded a major contract (worth 127 million euros) to digitalise the signalling system for the Stuttgart rail node. Oliver Dörre, Chief Executive Officer and Country Director, Thales Deutschland, describes the project and explains how it is expected to be a blueprint and a decisive impulse for digitalisation of the entire German rail network.

Mr. Dörre, what does the Thales contract involve?

Deutsche Bahn, one of our most important customers in transportation, has selected Thales to comprehensively digitalise the Stuttgart rail node. Specifically, it involves installing a digital signalling system and deploying the latest European Train Control System (ETCS) Level 2 system, as well as an Automatic Train Operations (ATO) system with driver. This includes more than 6,000 electronic kilometre markers (balises), at least 1,300 axle counting points and approximately 650 point machines for real-time traffic supervision and guidance.

What are the main benefits for rail users?

The Stuttgart metropolitan region is one of the most densely populated in Germany, with about 2.7 million inhabitants, and has a high volume of road traffic. Furthermore, building new lines within the city limits is out of the question. By digitalising the signalling system, we will help boost the capacity of existing rail infrastructure by 20%.

How will you do that?

Digital signalling systems enable train operators to safely reduce the headway between trains, while maintaining maximum operational safety. That means they can run more passenger and freight trains, with better on-time performance and improved comfort, without building a single kilometre of new track.

And how will the operator, Deutsche Bahn, benefit?

Deutsche Bahn will benefit in many ways: by carrying more passengers and freight on the same rail infrastructure, reducing its carbon footprint and maintenance costs, increasing customer satisfaction, boosting revenues and improving the competitive performance of rail transport compared with other modes of transportation. More broadly, the project will support Europe's ambition to become carbon-neutral by 2050 through the promotion of greater rail transport use.

How important is the environmental dimension?

It's very important, particularly for Stuttgart region. By making rail transport more attractive, Deutsche Bahn and we are convinced that people will be encouraged to leave their cars at home and take the train instead — and that will bring significant reductions in CO2 emissions for us all.

“This demanding project will be a reference for European and worldwide major cities”.

What makes this particular contract so special for you?

For several reasons. First, it's a complex, challenging undertaking, in which we are able to demonstrate one of our core expertises, namely the handling of complexity at all technical levels. It's much harder to modernise an existing rail infrastructure, especially a high-density infrastructure like this, than to build a new one! You need to install a brand-new signalling system with minimum disruption to train service, and of course without compromising safety in any way. We are a renowned specialist in modernising legacy signalling infrastructure, as we have a lot of global experience not only with this type of operation on rail systems in general, but also in particular with Stuttgart, where we have been present for many years. What we are aiming to do is deliver top-notch technology from Stuttgart to Stuttgart itself.

That's also why the Stuttgart contract, which relies on very advanced technologies, is a co-innovation project with the operator. We have built a lot of mutual trust with our strategic customer Deutsche Bahn over the years, and in this case we will be working together even more closely because Thales's main competence centre for mainline rail is also located in Ditzingen, near Stuttgart.

Last, but not least, this contract is also the first stage in an even more ambitious programme. Stuttgart will be a blueprint for the digitalisation of Germany's entire rail network, and is likely to serve also as a shining reference for metropolitan regions all over the world.

“With our dual competencies in rail signalling and cybersecurity, Thales is exceptionally well placed to manage this type of large-scale project”.

What about cybersecurity?

Cybersecurity is clearly of paramount importance – it's something we design into the system from Day 1 and take into account at every subsequent stage of the project. We call this “Cyber-secured by design”. With our dual competencies in rail signalling and cybersecurity, Thales is exceptionally well placed to manage this type of large-scale project.

When will the project be delivered?

The Stuttgart node digitalisation project is scheduled to be completed by 2025. As of that date, long-distance, regional and suburban S-Bahn trains will all travel on a network equipped with the latest digital technology. Digitalisation of the entire German rail network is scheduled for completion in 2035.

LinkedIn

Train operators and owners had the chance to experience for themselves the latest on-board train control system by Thales.

The recent unveiling of a high-fidelity cab mock-up was an important milestone for Thales, not only confirming progress in an on-going project to retrofit three first-in-class (FiC) Class 43 power-cars, but also in establishing the company’s reputation as a supplier of train control systems in the UK.

Thales’s solution is set to modernise the on-board systems of the Class 43 power-cars which are owned by Porterbrook; this is an important step in Network Rail’s plans to introduce European Train Control System (ETCS) technology across Britain’s rail network.

The mock-up cab, located at Thales’s Birmingham site, gives drivers from train operating companies (TOCs) hands-on experience of how the system will look and feel. It also provides the opportunity for valuable user feedback to be fed into the Thales project team.

“We’ve received extremely positive feedback from the customers so far,” said Thales’s Senior Project Manager, Lokesh Anand. “Our stakeholders are able to experience the final solution and they are happy that we have taken on board their comments and feedback from the previous stage and that we are actively listening to them.”

“We have a state-of-the-art product, with proven, user-friendly technology and our solution provides the end user with the continuous speed supervision and real-time information about the state of the railway ahead”.

The positive response from end-users enables Thales to take a big step forward towards closing out final design phase and proceed towards commencing the fitting of the system to Porterbrook’s Class 43 power-cars, which are operated by a number of Britain’s TOCs as well as Network Rail. Installation of the systems is due to be completed and ready for integration testing this summer.

State-of-the-art technology

ETCS is the signalling and train control component of the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS), which is being adopted throughout Europe and beyond. Thales’s ETCS compliant system makes use of standard trackside equipment and wireless controlling equipment in the train to receive line-side information, removing the reliance on the driver to watch track-side signals.

The ETCS technology lets TOCs operate more trains on the same line safely. The implementation will aim to increase railways operators’ operational performance through enhanced capacity and speed and improved track utilisation.

Thales in Germany has developed the on-board systems combining established ETCS technology with additional technological features including enhanced automation, cyber-security and engineering assurance. In the UK, Thales is responsible for integrating the equipment into the Class 43 rolling stock with project partners Ricardo Rail, with installation by Thales’s project partners, Yellow Rail, located in Derby.

Overcoming challenges

Thales is a global technology company specialising in designing and installing safety-critical transport systems but this project has faced challenges, not least the remote working restrictions imposed by Covid-19.

“The number of stakeholders and suppliers involved, and the safety critical nature of the work makes this a very complex project,” said Mr Anand. “Covid-19 meant that we had to bring together many dispersed groups in different ways; even visits to the mock-up cab had to be arranged observing strict social distancing rules. We are, however, delighted to have brought everything together and all of this would not have been possible without the dedication and resilience shown by each member of this project team.”

Opening new opportunities for Thales

By confirming customer confidence in its ability to deliver on time and to specification, the success of the demonstration is important for Thales, which is establishing its ETCS technology in the market.

Thales is working towards securing potential customers across parts of the world where ETCS technology is being implemented and the UK is considered a flagship reference market for future customers around the world.

“Establishing supply chains and increasing design maturity for a new safety-critical product solution for the UK is always challenging,” said Mr Anand. “However, we are very confident that the product maturity continues to build, and we’re delighted to have reached this milestone in the project.”

Qatar Airways upgrades 787-8 IFE to Thales AVANT - PaxEx.Aero,"Tue, 02 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vcGF4ZXguYWVyby9xYXRhci1haXJ3YXlzLWF2YW50LWlmZS03ODctOC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Qatar Airways 787-8 fleet is getting an upgrade. The carrier will swap out the in-flight entertainment system on board its oldest Dreamliners to the Thales AVANT platform.

With the latest in-flight technology, including lightweight screens, greater content storage and full HD touch screens, we are delighted to work with Thales in bringing the most advanced AVANT IFE system on board our Boeing 787-8 fleet. – Ms. Salam Al Shawa, Qatar Airways Senior Vice President, Marketing & Corporate Communications

The new AVANT system gives business class passengers a 17″ HD touch screen. Economy class travelers will get the 12″ version.

The new screens are 2-3x brighter than the prior generation while also significantly lighter. They also consume less power and give off less heat.

On the server end the AVANT kit being installed on the Qatar 787-8s includes more than a terabyte of storage for content, including HD movies, TV shows and music.

The retrofit process sees the screens and servers on board swapped out but keeps the existing seats and other infrastructure in place. This allows for the upgrade to occur without disrupting aircraft utilization and minimizing time out of service. Thales developed a turnkey upgrade process that includes all the hardware and certifications required to effect the upgrade.

The AVANT solution replaces the older i5000 platform on this fleet. While it was relatively advanced when introduced, the UX on the i5000 offering, particularly around the handset control and the menus, left a lot to be desired. It launched during the PED/tablet transition era where consumers quickly adjusted their behaviors and expectations with respect to digital interactions. And, as always, aircraft systems lagged badly in keeping up with the changes.

Fortunately the new system run on an updated processor, interface, and operating system.

03 February 2021, Bengaluru, India: As part of Thales’ Offsets commitments under the Rafale India contract, and in line with the Make in India policy, Navratna Defence PSU Bharat Electronics Ltd (BEL) has manufactured T/R (transmit/receive) modules for the RBE2 radar on the Dassault Aviation Rafale and delivered them to Thales.

Thales is demonstrating its commitment to the Make in India policy through transfers of technology and production, and associated training for BEL engineers in France. BEL has implemented a set of rigorous industrial processes and played an active role in the transfer programme.

Thales is an active stakeholder in the Make in India policy, promoted by the Indian Government, and in the Offsets

conditions included in the Rafale India programme. In November 2020, the first RBE2 AESA (active electronic scanning array) radar with a front end manufactured by BEL in India was delivered by Thales to Dassault Aviation. BEL implemented a set of rigorous processes at its Bangalore facility in order to achieve this key milestone.

Specifically developed for Rafale, the RBE2 is the first in-service European AESA radar and has been combat proven on Rafale aircraft operated by the French Air Force. It was developed in close partnership with Dassault Aviation and the French Defence Procurement Agency (DGA) to meet the requirements of air forces, and uses innovative technologies to combine advanced fire control radar functions and target tracking capabilities. The T/R (transmit/receive) modules are key to the RBE2 radar’s active electronic scanning performance, enabling it to steer the radar beam with the speed of an electronic chip.

Initiated at the end of 2017, the transfer of technology to BEL has included validation of the company’s technical capacity to deliver prototypes, qualify the various technologies involved in the wiring process, set up a dedicated SMC wiring production line with a preproduction run, train BEL engineers in France and install test benches for microwave characterisation at the BEL facility. The modules produced in India are then integrated with the RBE2 radar in France. BEL and Thales teams are, thus working closely to transfer advanced technological know-how.

Building on Thales’s 50+ years of expertise with earlier generationsof radars for combat aircraft, the RBE2 gives the Rafale a number of key advantages. Compared to radars with conventional antennas, the RBE2 delivers an unprecedented level of tactical situational awareness, faster detection and tracking of multiple targets, and can also implement several radar modes instantaneously.

“We’re delighted to see our collaboration with BEL delivering results, with the radar transmit/receive modules for the Rafale India programme being produced in Bangalore in line with the Make in India policy. The Thales teams are fully mobilised alongside our partners Dassault Aviation in France and BEL in India,” said Emmanuel De Roquefeuil, VP and Country director, Thales in India.

“We are happy to be associated with Thales in delivering the Transmit/Receive modules for the prestigious Rafale programme. The Thales and BEL teams ensured that the ToT happened seamlessly. We have augmented our facility in Bangalore to meet the requirements of manufacturing this state-of-the-art sub-system. We look forward to working together on many more such challenging assignments with Thales,” said Mr M V Gowtama, Chairman & Managing Director, BEL.

The Protector RS4 RWS and the Acusonic shot detection system, which is also part of the contract, will provide enhanced stabilization on the move improving first hit probability. It will also allow soldiers to view targets on a screen inside the vehicle, ensuring their protection by the vehicles armor.

The Acusonic shot detection system, a component part of the new addition, is designed to accurately sense and report the direction of incoming enemy fire. The system will give the Boxer vehicle’s crew the critical situational awareness to react to threats.

Acusonic was first supplied in 2018 to the British Army’s Ajax armored vehicle program and now, under this contract, will be fitted to Boxer as well.

The UK decided to re-join the Boxer program in 2018 and since then has committed £2.8bn to deliver over 500 vehicles to the British Army. The first vehicles are scheduled to be ready for service in 2023.

This was reported in a press release. This contract extension is the confirmation of the long-standing collaboration between the two companies, certifying the continued contribution of Thales Alenia Space to the success of the Cygnus missions, as well as its crucial role in future space exploration programs. Cygnus is made up of two main sections: the Northrop Grumman service module and the Pressurized Cargo Module Pcm, developed and built by Thales Alenia Space which has a leading role in the program from the very beginning. The first contract was signed by the company in 2009 for the delivery of nine modules and a second contract, in 2016, for a further nine modules. Since late 2015, the Cygnus spacecraft configuration has evolved with a more advanced design capable of supporting greater weight (over 3,500 kilograms) and volume. Fifteen operational PCMs in addition to a demonstration module have been launched to date, four in the original version and eleven in the enhanced version.





""Over the past decade we have been a highly valued partner in Northrop Grumman's Cygnus program, proposing innovative technologies that allow you to work and live on the International Space Station (ISS) and promoting scientific advances - he commented. Walter Cugno, VP Exploration and Science at Thales Alenia Space - “We are confident that this new contract will be an important milestone for future deep space cargo and exploration missions, and we would like to express our gratitude to Northrop Grumman for the trust he has shown in choosing the technology of pressurized modules made in Thales Alenia Space ”. The success story of the Cygnus spacecraft continues: the launch of the 15th mission to bring supplies to the ISS took place on February 20 from the island of Wallops with an Antares rocket. The mission, named after the NASA mathematician Katherine Johnson, a key figure in the history of human spaceflight, will provide scientific experiments in the fields of biology and biotechnology, earth and space science, physical science and technological development, including: a Spaceborne Computer-2 from Hewlett Packard , with the aim of demonstrating that the processing of experimental data of the stations currently carried out on Earth can be performed in orbit; an experiment that studies muscle strength in worms; an investigation on how microgravity can optimize the production of artificial retinas.

The Cygnus missions have been crucial to the safe refueling of the ISS since 2013, carrying a life-critical cargo on the ISS, including oxygen, water, equipment, science experiments and spare parts. The cutting-edge technology and experience of Thales Alenia Space in the design and production of pressurized modules is also the protagonist in 50 percent of the pressurized modules for the ISS. Thanks to the technological heritage of the Cygnus modules, Northrop Grumman and Thales Alenia Space are also able to provide other habitats of deep space, such as Halo - Habitation And Logistics Outpost, one of the first two elements of the Lunar Gateway, The future human outpost in lunar orbit, pillar of NASA's Artemis program.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9567832946777344}",positive,0.9567832946777344,1
S.Africa's Zuma arms deal corruption case to heard in May - FRANCE 24 English,"Tue, 23 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyYW5jZTI0LmNvbS9lbi9saXZlLW5ld3MvMjAyMTAyMjMtcy1hZnJpY2Etcy16dW1hLWFybXMtZGVhbC1jb3JydXB0aW9uLWNhc2UtdG8taGVhcmQtaW4tbWF50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Pietermaritzburg (South Africa) (AFP) –

South Africa's scandal-tainted former president Jacob Zuma and French arms dealer Thales, accused of graft in a case going back more than two decades, will go on trial in May, the High Court ruled Tuesday.

Zuma is facing 16 charges of fraud, graft and racketeering relating to the purchase of fighter jets, patrol boats and military equipment.

He allegedly took bribes of four million rand ($270,000 or 224,000 euros) over a $3.4-billion arms deal with French aerospace and defence giant Thales in 1999, when he was deputy president.

Judge Nkosinathi Chili at the High Court in Pietermaritzburg said the matter was certified as trial-ready and would be heard between May 17 and June 20, 2021.

Zuma was not present for the announcement.

The case was postponed last December, when Thales contested the racketeering charges linked to the arms deal.

But a court dismissed the challenge on January 22, a decision that Thales said it would not contest.

Both the state prosecution and defence attorneys had asked the pre-trial court for extra time.

They cited among other things Covid restrictions on international travel that could impede the availability of witnesses living abroad.

Zuma, 78, who was forced to step down in 2018 by the African National Congress (ANC) after nine years in power, is separately accused of enabling runaway looting of state assets during his tenure.

The judicial panel probing this alleged graft on Monday sought orders to jail Zuma for two years for defying a court order compelling him to testify.

The embattled ex-leader has repeatedly snubbed summonses by the commission, saying its chair, Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, is biased.

He testified only once, in July 2019, before staging a walkout days later.

The findings of the anti-corruption commission will not lead directly to indictments but may be handed to the prosecution for possible charges.

Nadia Johnson: why every student should consider an apprenticeship - Thales,"Wed, 10 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi91bml0ZWQta2luZ2RvbS9uZXdzL25hZGlhLWpvaG5zb24td2h5LWV2ZXJ5LXN0dWRlbnQtc2hvdWxkLWNvbnNpZGVyLWFwcHJlbnRpY2VzaGlw0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Nadia Johnson: why every student should consider an apprenticeship Apprenticeships National Apprentice Week Share this article

Nadia Johnson, Software Engineering Manager

Software Engineering Manager Nadia Johnson is a tireless advocate for the benefits and opportunities offered by apprenticeships, especially in the Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM) subjects. Here’s why:

There comes a time in Further Education when students are faced with what is probably their first momentous life decision. They could go on to university and get a degree. Or maybe abandon education and get a job. Or they could earn and learn by taking on an apprenticeship.

Of course, earning a living and not worrying about how to repay a £9,000+ per year loan is often touted as the headline benefit of an apprenticeship. But according to Thales’s Nadia Johnson, who took on her first management role just a year after completing her apprenticeship, the financials are only one part of a much bigger story.

“There’s nothing wrong with going the university route,” she said. “But you can’t expect to walk into a senior role with the ink still wet on your degree. You have to learn how a business works in real life. You have to get solid experience before you can make real progress. With an apprenticeship, you get that from day one.”

Nadia is convinced that as well as being financially advantageous and providing real work experience, an apprenticeship can open far more opportunities than it would appear at first glance. She graduated from her software engineering degree with a first class honours in 2019 and, by the end of the following year was appointed 22 engineers to lead on a submarine programme, developing software for the world’s most advanced submarine sonar systems.

“There has been steady progression from day one and the support and encouragement I’ve had has been wonderful,” she said. “You can talk to whoever you want, here. No one considers themselves too important to answer questions.”

“And we all share a passion for STEM in particular and apprenticeships in general, which is very nurturing. We’re a family. And you feel like you’re making a real contribution to something valuable, something our country can be proud of.”

Proud, indeed. A report by Centre for Economics and Businesses Research (CEBR) ‘Productivity Matters: the impact of Apprenticeships on the UK economy’, suggested that between 2012-13 and 2021-22, 3.8 million people will have completed an Apprenticeship, contributing £3.4 billion to the UK economy in net productivity gains by 2022.

And, of course, in Nadia’s case, there is the personal satisfaction of developing super-sophisticated sonar technology which the British Royal Navy depends upon to protect our national and international interests. It is genuinely the best in the world.

But she has never been content to leave things there and has been quick to take advantage of the many other opportunities that she has been presented with.

In her short but impressive career, Nadia was nominated as a finalist for the Institute of Engineering and Technology (IET) award in 2017, was a ‘Rising Star Winner’ (Defence 2018), has been voted one of the Top Ten Women in Defence in 2018 and has just been awarded Young Manager of the Year in the Made in Manchester Awards.

‘Young Manager of the Year’ is a new category, which recognises ‘young professionals from all sectors who have responsibility for managing others and have brought out the best from those they manage through an exceptional ability to support, motivate, and aid development’.

Nadia has also been an IET Young Professional Ambassador, has sat on Thales’s UK apprentice committee, is a champion for Thales’s ‘Your Employee Society’ (International) and ‘Employee Engagement’ teams (UK), is a Mental Health First Aider and Ambassador at Thales, as well as being a Thales STEM Ambassador.

Introducing students to the exciting career opportunities in STEM is a particular passion for Nadia. “I’ve been so fortunate to take on an apprenticeship at Thales. There are some incredible opportunities and it's becoming more diverse and inclusive every year. Plus, our national economy has an insatiable need for experts in STEM. I really want to help to get that message across.""

“Apprentices – certainly at Thales and I’m sure in other companies – don't just get a job, a salary and professional qualifications, they get the opportunities they want and the support they need to launch a successful rewarding and interesting career.”

“You can make the job as big as you want. And I decided from the very start that I wanted everything, all of it. I want to go all the way, inspiring as many young people to tread the same path as I am. It’s good for me, it’s good for them and great for the economy.”

"Northrop Grumman Green-Lights Two More Cygnus Missions, As NG-15 Arrives at Space Station - AmericaSpace","Tue, 23 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWVyaWNhc3BhY2UuY29tLzIwMjEvMDIvMjMvbm9ydGhyb3AtZ3J1bW1hbi1ncmVlbi1saWdodHMtdHdvLW1vcmUtY3lnbnVzLW1pc3Npb25zLWFzLW5nLTE1LWFycml2ZXMtYXQtc3BhY2Utc3RhdGlvbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Deftly manipulated by Expedition 64 astronaut Soichi Noguchi, Canadarm2 reaches out for the NG-15 Cygnus on Monday morning.

As Northrop Grumman Corp.’s NG-15 Cygnus spacecraft arrived safely at the International Space Station (ISS) on Monday morning, the Bethpage, N.Y.-headquartered firm has confirmed that Thales Alenia Space of Turin, Italy, will fabricate an additional two Pressurized Cargo Modules (PCMs) for a pair of forthcoming missions. Current plans are for the two additional Cygnuses—designated NG-18 and NG-19—to launch atop Antares 230+ boosters from Pad 0A at the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport (MARS) on Wallops Island, Va., no sooner than 2023.

They form part of an extension to Northrop Grumman’s second-phase Commercial Resupply Services (CRS2) contract with NASA, which originally called for “at least six” Cygnus missions to be launched by 2024, four of which have now been completed or are underway.

But Cygnus’ impressive history extends back more than a decade. In December 2008, Orbital Sciences Corp. finalized the first-phase CRS1 contract with NASA, totaling $1.9 billion, which required eight dedicated cargo missions to haul 44,000 pounds (20,000 kg) of payloads, equipment and supplies to the ISS through 2016.

The first “demonstration” mission (ORB-D) of Cygnus launched successfully to the station on 18 September 2013 and after a delay caused by a data-link anomaly the spacecraft and its 1,300 pounds (590 kg) of cargo was “berthed”—via the Canadarm2 robotic assets—at the Earth-facing (or “nadir”) port of the Harmony node on the 29th.

ORB-D spent three weeks berthed at the ISS, before being removed from the Harmony nadir interface on 22 October and cast adrift, to harmlessly burn up with 3,000 pounds (1,360 kg) of trash in Earth’s atmosphere a couple of days later.

The mission cleared a number of critical milestones which enabled Cygnus to move into “operational” cargo deliveries and in January and July of 2014 a pair of flights—designated “ORB-1” and “ORB-2”—were conducted with flawless perfection. Between them, they delivered 6,420 pounds (2,910 kg) of cargo to the ISS and removed 6,480 pounds (2,940 kg) of old and broken equipment and other no-longer-needed materials.

Interestingly, the first-ever grapple of a Cygnus with ORB-D was supported by newly-arrived Expedition 37 crewman Mike Hopkins, who was also on duty in the multi-windowed cupola more than seven years later for Monday’s successful capture of NG-15. And with Hopkins having also welcomed ORB-1 in January 2014, he becomes the only person to have participated in the capture and berthing of three discrete Cygnuses during his astronaut career.

But success and failure are alternate sides of the same coin and in October 2014 a liquid oxygen turbopump failure in the Antares booster resulted in the catastrophic loss of the ORB-3 Cygnus—and its entire ISS-bound cargo, totaling 4,880 pounds (2,200 kg)—only a few seconds after liftoff.

As Orbital Sciences Corp. dug into the cause and made requisite improvements to the launch vehicle, contracts were signed with United Launch Alliance (ULA) to fly at least two Cygnus missions atop its venerable Atlas V. And with Orbital having merged in February 2015 with Alliant TechSystems, Inc., to become Orbital ATK, the next mission drew a new nomenclature: “OA-4”.

Unlike its predecessors, OA-4, which launched in December 2015, marked the first flight of the “Enhanced” Cygnus, which benefits from a larger PCM—some 4 feet (1.2 meters) taller than earlier ones—and could deliver an 53-percent-larger haul of payloads, as well as boasting lightweight and higher-efficiency UltraFlex solar arrays.

The latter changed Cygnus’ appearance both figuratively and literally, as the UltraFlex arrays are fan-shaped, as opposed to the straight-wing design of the earlier version. And with a total payload upmass of over 7,300 pounds (3,350 kg), OA-4 marked the heaviest-ever Cygnus at that time, with 40 percent more cargo than earlier missions.

Cygnus flew 11 successful missions under the CRS1 contract between 2013-2019 and with the in-progress NG-15 flight has currently executed two-thirds of its baseline CRS2 requirement. Photo Credit: NASA

Longevity was an added bonus in the Enhanced Cygnus, for when OA-4 finally returned to Earth in February 2016 it logged over 75 days in space, of which more than 71 were spent berthed at the ISS. This was almost double the achievement of any of its predecessors.

A second Atlas V-boosted Cygnus (OA-6) followed in March 2016, before Antares returned to operational service the following October to fly the out-of-numerical-sequence OA-5 mission. A third (and so far last) launch atop an Atlas V followed in April 2017 with OA-7, which achieved the original CRS1 target of 44,000 pounds (20,000 kg) of cargo delivery after seven missions, rather than eight.

This was thanks principally to the increased uplift capacity of the mighty Atlas V and the expanded payload envelope of the Enhanced Cygnus. An “extension” program with two additional Cygnus flights—designated “OA-8E” and “OA-9E”—had been added to the CRS1 contract in August 2015 to bridge the gap before an anticipated second-phase CRS2 contract came online and these two missions flew in November 2017 and May 2018.

In the meantime, early in 2018 Northrop Grumman Corp. concluded its acquisition of Orbital ATK and from the tenth flight in November of that year—which incidentally marked the first Cygnus to log over a hundred days on a single mission—flights were correspondingly renamed with an “NG-xx” designator. An eleventh mission (NG-11) followed in April 2019 and formally closed out the CRS1 commitment.

By this stage, however, Cygnus had already won a slice of NASA’s CRS2 contract, with an expectation that it would provide “at least six” more missions between 2019 and 2024. It was one of three partners (alongside SpaceX and Sierra Nevada Corp.) in this second-phase ISS resupply contract, but was alone among them in achieving its first CRS2-contracted flight on schedule with the launch of NG-12 in November 2019.

Of those six baselined missions, three have already been completed. NG-12 was followed in February 2020 by NG-13 and, just last October, by NG-14, named in honor of fallen STS-107 astronaut Kalpana “K.C.” Chawla. A fourth was launched last week, with the NG-15 Cygnus robotically captured yesterday morning by Canadarm2 and Expedition 64 astronauts Soichi Noguchi and Mike Hopkins.

And looking ahead, the NG-16 hardware is on track to be launched this coming July, with an expectation that both the Northrop Grumman-built Service Module and the Thales Alenia Space-built PCM for the mission will be shipped to Wallops in May. After that, the NG-17 mission—the sixth and last CRS2-contracted Cygnus—will fly next year.

With Northrop Grumman having yesterday confirmed that Thales Alenia Space will provide PCMs for the NG-18 and NG-19 flights, this extends the CRS2 contract to at least eight missions for Cygnus alone.

“For the past decade, we have been a valued partner on Northrop Grumman’s Cygnus program, showcasing innovative technologies that allow work and life on the International Space Station (ISS), while fostering scientific breakthroughs,” said Walter Cugno, vice president of the Exploration and Science Domain at Thales. “We are confident that this new contract will be an important milestone for the future deep-space cargo and exploration missions.”

Indeed, Thales Alenia Space has contributed to no less than 50 percent of all pressurized modules on the space station and with Northrop Grumman is an integral partner in the development of the Habitation and Logistics Outpost (HALO) for the Lunar Gateway, which will be placed around the Moon later this decade.

Including this week’s arrival of the NG-15, Cygnus missions have delivered more than 90,000 pounds (40,000 kg) of equipment, payloads and supplies to dozens of ISS expedition crews and their voluminous PCMs have afforded ample room to “take out the trash” at the end of their missions.

Research investigations delivered via Cygnus have run the gamut from life sciences to technology and crew supplies have ranged from food, water and clothes to computer spares, space suit components and spare parts for the ISS toilet.

Paula Louise Stinson, age 30, was arrested Feb. 1 and charged with twelve counts of indecent liberties with a child.

Stinson was issued a $75,000 bond which she posted and was released. Records accessed on Feb. 14 list her custody status as unsupervised “home incarceration.”

“Investigators discovered that several text messages exchanged between Stinson and the juvenile male student were intercepted by the boy’s parents and turned over to authorities. During the investigation, it was also discovered that the suspect and student had engaged in inappropriate interactions at the school and boy’s home, over a two-week period,” the Wake County Sheriff’s Office said in a press release.

Stinson was the physical education teacher at the Thales campus in Rolesville. The school is a private school with eleven campuses across North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia.

Thales Academy issued a short statement, indicating she has been fired:

“Mrs. Stinson has been terminated as an employee of Thales Academy, effective immediately. Thales Leadership is actively communicating with the Wake County Sheriff’s Office and cooperating with their investigation.”

There is no teaching license on file with the state for Stinson.

A principal of a parochial school in Reidsville has also been charged in recent weeks.

Horace Branford Aldridge, Jr. age 50, was charged on Jan. 27 with five counts of taking indecent liberties with a child and one count of taking indecent liberties with a student.

Records show that Aldridge was issued a $400,000 secured bond which he has not posted and remains incarcerated at the Rockingham County Detention Center.

The arrest was the result of a joint effort by the Reidsville Police Department, the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigations, and the Rockingham County Sheriff’s Office.

This investigation is still ongoing. Anyone with relevant information is asked to call Investigator Santana Menard at 336-347-2305 or Lt. Dennis Haley at 336-347-2341. Citizens can also call Crime Stoppers at 336-349-9683.

Officials at the Community Baptist Church and School assisted law enforcement in their investigation. While the school has not yet issued a formal statement or responded to requests for comment, all reports of his arrest refer to Aldridge as a “former” principal.

There is no record of a teaching license on file with the state for Aldridge.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999438524246216}",neutral,0.9999438524246216,0

The French defence procurement agency (DGA) has awarded Thales and Airbus a contract for the new joint tactical signals intelligence (SIGINT) system, to upgrade the French forces’ critical signals monitoring, direction finding and spectrum analysis capabilities, Airbus said.

The 10-year contract will equip the three armed forces with a common information system and set of sensors and will provide French armed forces command with an expanded tactical electronic support measures (ESM) capability, it said.

The tactical SIGINT programme will upgrade the electronic warfare capabilities of front-line units, providing a set of high-performance portable or vehicle-mounted assets compatible with the latest communications technologies, Airbus said. The new system to monitor and localise enemy communications will support tactical manoeuvres and will equip the electronic support vehicles of the French Army’s 54th Signals Regiment (SCORPION program), the French Navy’s frontline warships and the Atlantique 2 maritime patrol aircraft. It could also be deployed to protect air bases on military operations overseas.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.6552959680557251}",neutral,0.6552959680557251,0

An award-winning teacher sneaked into a 14 year-old boy’s house to sexually abuse him, and molested the youngster 12 times, it is claimed. Paula Stinson, 30, allegedly molested the youngster over a two week period both at the private Thales Academy in Rolesville, North Carolina, and his nearby home.

Stinson married her husband last March, with the couple buying a home together in September. Her alleged molestation was uncovered after the boy’s parents found inappropriate texts Stinson is accused of sending to the child. Subsequent interviews uncovered the alleged sexual contact.

Stinson has been fired from her job, and faces 12 felony counts of indecent liberties with a child. She made her first appearance in court on Monday morning. The scandal-hit teacher had been working as athletic director at Thales Academy for six years at the time of her arrest.

She was honored for her work by the Wake Forest Chamber of commerce last May.

A spokesman for Thales Academy told WRAL: ‘Mrs. Paula Stinson is under investigation by the Wake County Sheriff’s Office for alleged misconduct. Mrs. Stinson has been terminated as an employee of Thales Academy effective immediately.

This week we’d like to introduce you to one of our brilliant Career Trackers, Michaela who is working in our Legal and Contracts team.

Michaela, Legal & Contracts

Hailing from sunny Darwin, Michaela’s family moved to Sydney when she was nine years old and now reside in Camden, a suburb located on the city’s fringe. She jokes that it took them a while to acclimatise to Sydney’s cooler climate but now when they head back up north, something they try to do each year, they struggle with the relentless heat.

Michaela’s Aboriginal heritage comes from her father, who originates from the Tiwi Islands, about 80km north of Darwin, and says she first learnt about CareerTrackers in her final year of high school. She signed up without giving it too much thought and CareerTrackers reached out to her after she began university. “I went to an information session and remember thinking ‘I don’t think I’ll get this amazing opportunity otherwise.’”

Fast forward to now and Michaela is in her second year of completing a Bachelor of Law/Bachelor of Psychology at the University of Wollongong and is in the final days of her internship at Thales. Positioned within the Legal & Contracts team based at Sydney Olympic Park, Michaela’s days are filled with writing memos for legislation and shadowing her colleagues – even accompanying Vice President Legal & Contracts James Couche to meetings. Although she says she didn’t know much about Thales beforehand, “I was immediately intrigued because of the defence and security aspects, which I find interesting.”

A recent visit to our Garden Island site offered the opportunity to see a Defence establishment first hand and Michaela credits this experience as the highlight of her internship. “I really enjoyed seeing the ships and chatting with people to get a grasp of what they do and hearing their career advice.” As Michaela points out, there are many career pathways available with a Law degree and, while she hasn’t landed on which direction she’ll head in, her time at Thales has been invaluable. Just before commencing, she’d completed a contracts subject and therefore being able to see it in a practical sense has delivered an improved learning experience.

Another pleasant surprise has been the type of work she’s been engaged in, such as drafting a guide to building code legislation. “The work given to me is interesting. Thales is really valuing my opinion and the work I’m doing, so I feel proactive. Everyone has been really welcoming too.”

With another internship on the horizon in winter, Michaela hopes she can return to Thales and continue learning more about our business. Either way, she’s extremely grateful for her CareerTrackers internship. “I 100% recommend it. What I’m getting out of this is something that’ll help me in the future and its actual, proper work experience. I’ve suggested to CareerTrackers that it’d be amazing to take their program out to Darwin, where people would actually thrive with this same opportunity.”

We agree Michaela and hope to welcome a CareerTrackers intern at our Darwin site in the future!","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999940395355225}",neutral,0.9999940395355225,0

BEL delivers transmit/receive modules to Thales for Rafale RBE2 Radar - Force Magazine,"Thu, 04 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiImh0dHBzOi8vZm9yY2VpbmRpYS5uZXQvZGVzaS12aWJlcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"BEL delivers transmit/receive modules to Thales for Rafale RBE2 Radar

As part of Thales’ Offsets commitments under the Rafale India contract, and in line with the ‘Make in India’ policy, Bharat Electronics Ltd (BEL) has manufactured transmit/receive (T/R) modules for the RBE2 radar on the Dassault Aviation Rafale and delivered them to Thales.

Thales is demonstrating its commitment to the ‘Make in India’ policy through transfers of technology and production, and associated training for BEL engineers in France. BEL has implemented a set of rigorous industrial processes and played an active role in the transfer programme.

Thales is an active stakeholder in the government’s ‘Make in India’ policy, and in the Offsets conditions included in the Rafale India programme. In November 2020, the first RBE2 AESA (active electronic scanning array) radar with a front end manufactured by BEL in India was delivered by Thales to Dassault Aviation. BEL implemented a set of rigorous processes at its Bangalore facility in order to achieve this key milestone.









Specifically developed for Rafale, the RBE2 is the first in-service European AESA radar and has been combat proven on Rafale aircraft operated by the French Air Force. It was developed in close partnership with Dassault Aviation and the French Defence Procurement Agency (DGA) to meet the requirements of air forces. It uses innovative technologies to combine advanced fire control radar functions and target tracking capabilities. The T/R modules are key to the RBE2 radar’s active electronic scanning performance, enabling it to steer the radar beam with the speed of an electronic chip.

Initiated at the end of 2017, the transfer of technology to BEL has included validation of the company’s technical capacity to deliver prototypes, qualify the various technologies involved in the wiring process, set up a dedicated SMC wiring production line with a preproduction run, train BEL engineers in France and install test benches for microwave characterisation at the BEL facility. The modules produced in India are then integrated with the RBE2 radar in France. BEL and Thales teams are, thus, working closely to transfer advanced technological know-how.

Building on Thales’s 50+ years of expertise with earlier generations of radars for combat aircraft, the RBE2 gives the Rafale a number of key advantages. Compared to radars with conventional antennas, the RBE2 delivers an unprecedented level of tactical situational awareness, faster detection and tracking of multiple targets, and can also implement several radar modes instantaneously.

“We’re delighted to see our collaboration with BEL delivering results, with the radar transmit/receive modules for the Rafale India programme being produced in Bangalore in line with the ‘Make in India; policy,” said Emmanuel De Roquefeuil, VP and Country director, Thales in India. M V Gowtama, Chairman & Managing Director, BEL, too, reiterated the importance of the partnership. He said: “We are happy to be associated with Thales in delivering the transmit/receive modules for the prestigious Rafale programme. The Thales and BEL teams ensured that the ToT happened seamlessly.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9949173927307129}",neutral,0.9949173927307129,0

“The 10-year contract will equip the three armed forces with a common information system and set of sensors and is designated a high-impact program (PEM[1]), alongside CONTACT and SCORPION, under France’s defense spending plan. This joint tactical SIGINT system will provide French armed forces command with an expanded tactical electronic support measures (ESM) capability.”

The tactical SIGINT programme will upgrade the electronic warfare capabilities of front-line units, providing a set of high-performance portable or vehicle-mounted assets compatible with the latest communications technologies.

The new system to monitor and localize enemy communications will support tactical manoeuvres in the theatre of operations, helping to keep our forces safe and secure.

It will equip the electronic support vehicles of the French Army’s 54th Signals Regiment, the French Navy’s front-line warships and the Atlantique 2 maritime patrol aircraft, and could be deployed to protect air bases on military operations overseas.

“The system will be the only one of its kind in service with the French forces. All three armed forces will rely on the same logistics infrastructure to simplify training of specialist operators and optimize through-life support delivery. The first phase of the program will provide the three armed forces with an initial operational capability for signals monitoring, with subsequent optional tranches to significantly increase the number of units in service.

New functions (new data analytics functions for the information system, expanded detection and technical analysis capabilities, etc.) will be added incrementally over the term of the contract to provide the French armed forces with a set of state-of-the-art electronic warfare systems and capabilities.”","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.5763079524040222}",positive,0.5763079524040222,1

It has more Engineering Competences Centres (ECC) like in Bengaluru specialises in defence, aerospace, and transportation another in Gurugram focused on cybersecurity, IoT, biometric and big data analytics solutions.

As India marches towards its goal of ‘Atmanirbharta’ or self-reliance, it opens up immense opportunities for local and global defence and aerospace sectors to work together and strengthen the industrial ecosystem in the country.

Backed by its strong presence in diverse verticals like defence, aerospace, transportation and digital identity and security, Thales has been working closely with Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) for the upgrade of the Mirage 2000, Bharat Electronics Ltd (BEL) dedicated to radars, Samtel dedicated to military avionics and Reliance Aerostructure Limited for electronic warfare and airborne radar as well as over 75 supply chain partners in India catering to the requirements of the Indian Air Force, Indian Navy and Indian Army.

According to Emmanuel de Roquefeuil, Vice-President and Country Director, Thales in India, “Since the inception of our operations in India, we are proudly supporting the modernisation efforts of the Indian armed forces and helping them to prepare, achieve and maintain tactical superiority over any form of threat.” Adding, “Thales will continue to develop capabilities for local engineering, procurement from India and strengthen its local partnerships. Building collaborations with the Indian industry and transforming the country into a defence manufacturing hub shall remain a priority of Thales’ focus for India”.

To push its agenda further, Thales showcases its cutting-edge defence platforms and advanced technology in the ongoing Aero India 2021 air show started on 3 February in Bangaluru. In the air show, the company is displaying its land and naval defence along with a special feature on its efforts towards ‘Make in India’. Thales has brought the latest addition to its family of airborne surveillance radars, the AirMaster C, to the air show including airborne optronic capability. With this new product, Thales offers an optimised surveillance solution for a broader array of platform types and operators, ensuring they benefit from the highest levels of mission performance as they face the new challenges ahead. Among the other demos for the tri-forces, systems like SYNAPS software-defined radios, armaments, small arms, counter-UAV measures and air defence solutions such as STARStreak for which a teaming agreement has been recently signed between Thales and Bharat Dynamics Limited will take the centre stage.

This will enable payments at point of sales (POS) machines, e-commerce transactions and cash withdrawals at local and international ATMs.

The digitized and fully customizable cards are compatible with Apple Pay and Mada Pay, providing secure payments for both iPhone and Android users. STC Pay customers will be able to order the card, activate, deactivate and set spending limits through their mobile application.

Ahmed Alenazi, STC Pay CEO, said that the cards would provide customers with digital payment solutions that were fast, convenient and, above all, secure.

“As the Kingdom progresses toward a cashless society, we are always looking for ways to provide new and innovative technologies and digital experiences to our customers,” he said.

Pascal Lesaulnier, CEO Thales Saudi Arabia, highlighted how the coronavirus pandemic had led to increased concern about the use of cash, and how the transformation to a contactless, cashless society had been “naturally accelerated.”

“It is only through the creation of novel, secure solutions, that we can build a future we can trust. We are very proud of the fruitful partnership developed over the years with STC Pay and we remain fully committed to supporting innovation in the Kingdom in line with Vision 2030. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has been at the forefront of smart cities, and STC Pay plays a key role in this remarkable journey,” he said.

Under the umbrella of Vision 2030, the Kingdom has set an ambitious target of achieving 70 percent non-cash transactions by 2030. Saudi Central Bank (SAMA) regulations have been supporting local banks to move toward contactless cards and mobile payment, which has led to an increase in demand for secure contactless solutions.

Digital payment transactions in the Kingdom jumped by 75 percent in 2020 as Saudi consumers embraced online shopping during the pandemic, while cash withdrawals from ATMs and other payment points fell 30 percent over the same period.

Additionally, as consumers turned to online and digital non-contact payments during the pandemic, the number of cash withdrawals carried out in 2020 across the Kingdom dropped by more than 318 million, or about 30 percent year-on-year.

STC Pay was launched in 2015, while Thales has had a presence in the Kingdom for more than 50 years, providing solutions, services and products in aeronautics, defense, space, transportation, and digital identity and security.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9962232112884521}",neutral,0.9962232112884521,0

It is also proposing to undertake a share purchase plan to raise a further $2.5 million from existing investors.

The funds will allow Micro-X to open a US office in Seattle to support its Airport Self Service Checkpoint project for the US Department for Homeland Security. The project involves the development of a mobile baggage scanner for airports.

Micro-X will also end its technical collaboration with French multinational Thales with a $5 million convertible loan to be repaid to Thales from the proceeds of the capital raise.

The company relocated from Victoria to South Australia in 2015 to establish a manufacturing hub at the Tonsley Innovation Precinct in Adelaide’s southern suburbs.

It launched its flagship lightweight x-ray, the Nano, in 2017 and last year announced it would take back sales and distribution control of the product from Carestream Health after sales figures failed to meet expectations.

The change means Micro-X will now be able to sell the machines through a range of distributors as well as directly to customers.

In its announcement to the ASX, Micro-X said the funds raised would also be used to expand sales and marketing teams to accelerate sales.

Micro-X is also developing a mobile backscatter imager (MBI) for the remote detection of improvised explosive devices.

Funds will also be used to bring the tube development and manufacture for its MBI in-house and establish a sales team to build sales demand ahead of the 2022 launch.

Managing director Peter Rowland said the capital raise would bring the company closer to its strategic goal of having four global production lines within five years.

“We are very pleased to have attracted this level of investor commitments to propel Micro-X in its expansion on multiple commercial and development fronts,” he said.

“We are also excited that the funding has enabled us to assume 100 per cent of the development of our breakthrough IED Camera technology by insourcing its x-ray tube to develop a prototype in 12 months.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998799562454224}",neutral,0.9998799562454224,0

All outstanding matters, including a review application by co-accused French arms company Thales to have the racketeering charges scrapped, have been put to bed.

Zuma was not in present in court and neither were his supporters.

Former president Jacob Zuma will finally have his day in court after the KwaZulu-Natal High Court in Pietermaritzburg heard on Tuesday that his corruption case was finally ready for trial.



Well over a decade in the making, the case overcame a final few hurdles, including a review application from Zuma's co-accused, French arms company Thales.

But eventually, the matter was certified trial ready for the period 17 May to 20 June. Further particulars were put to rest in the brief court session.

Zuma and Thales are accused of colluding in the now infamous arms deal. Zuma's financial advisor, Schabir Shaik, was convicted of soliciting a bribe for Zuma.

Both Zuma and Thales face charges of fraud, racketeering, corruption and money laundering relating to the controversial multibillion-rand arms deal.

Senior State advocate Billy Downer said all parties agreed to postpone the matter after Thales' review application to have the racketeering charges thrown out. The review was unsuccessful.

Downer said there were more than 200 witnesses on the State's list.

He added that there were Covid-19-related issues, but it was agreed that the matter could still move forward.

He said:

As far as the issue of holding the trial and the Covid-19 consequences, we know that with lockdown and travel restrictions to and from SA, it is affecting witnesses living overseas. It remains a consideration. We are not sure what is going to happen further. We all agree we are ready for trial.

""It is merely a question of setting the trial date.""



Downer said he spoke to representatives of the office of the KwaZulu-Natal Directorate of Public Prosecutions and was told that 17 May was an acceptable date.

Neither Zuma nor any of his usual supporters were in court on Tuesday. Bishop Vusi Dube, the chief organiser for supporters on the ground during the corruption matter, told News24 they would mobilise when the trial commenced.

This week, News24 reported further legal woes for Zuma when the Zondo commission sought an order that Zuma be found guilty of contempt and that he should be sentenced to two years behind bars.

They also want Police Minister Bheki Cele and national police commissioner Khehla Sitole to be ordered ""to take all steps as may be required to give effect"" to that order.

The commission turned to the Constitutional Court after Zuma defied its 28 January ruling which ordered him to appear before commission chairperson, Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, to answer questions that did not implicate him in specific criminal conduct.

Zuma refused and compared the Constitutional Court's ruling to the apartheid state's targeted persecution of PAC leader Robert Sobukwe, whose jail term was repeatedly and unlawfully extended under the so-called ""Sobukwe clause"".

News24 reported that when Zondo announced the inquiry would lodge a contempt of court application against him and seek his imprisonment after he defied a summons for him to appear before it from 15 to 19 February, Zuma effectively accused him and any judge who had ruled against him of bias or corruption – without any evidence.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998522996902466}",neutral,0.9998522996902466,0
