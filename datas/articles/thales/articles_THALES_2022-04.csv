Eco-friendly credit cards (2024 update) - Thales,"Fri, 15 Apr 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi9tYXJrZXRzL2RpZ2l0YWwtaWRlbnRpdHktYW5kLXNlY3VyaXR5L2JhbmtpbmctcGF5bWVudC9jYXJkcy9lY28tZnJpZW5kbHktY3JlZGl0LWNhcmTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales is committed to supporting banks to responsibly manage the disposal of payment cards. Its aim is to prioritise the environmental consequences of plastic card usage and so prevent microplastic pollution and reduce the use of virgin fossil materials.

The benefits of recycling are highlighted, including reduced waste going to landfill, energy conservation and job creation. Thales approach to end-of-life card recycling relies on the responsible collection, shredding, and processing of materials. Its recycling solutions include zero landfill waste, eco-friendly practices, and established partnerships for effective recycling.



What is Thales' commitment to the environment?

Thales' global environmental policy aims to manage our overall environmental impact.

So not only do we ensure eco-friendly delivery of our products, but we also embrace green manufacturing practices, as the ISO 14001 certifications of all our significant sites testify.

We also promote eco-friendly design at every stage, from product conception to re-engineering.

This process covers the product's environmental impact, such as resource consumption and emissions during manufacturing to waste and end-of-life disposal.



The way you manage a card's end-of-life disposal has an impact on environmental practices.

Many people wonder what to do with old credit cards, how to dispose of them, or even destroy them once they reach end-of-life or when they need to be renewed.

The good news is that we can help you find the right solution for your customers.

Thales' role is to facilitate your end-of-life card management by acting as an intermediary between you and our partner recycling companies.

We've started working with a long-term European partner to recycle banking cards. This involves recovering the energy from the plastic through incineration.

The metal in the cards is also recycled and then sent for use in other industries, such as jewellery and electrical circuit manufacturing.

This is hugely beneficial, as it means 0% of these materials end up in a landfill.

Additionally, we aim to recycle these materials in Europe to further mitigate the bank cards' carbon footprint. We've also developed next-generation products that put recycling at the heart of the design process.

This includes removing unnecessary components – such as the magnetic stripes or the signature panel – to make recycling possible. It also means working on a simplified colour design for the cards.

Swedish pioneer of sustainable payment cards, Doconomy, is again leading the way with a card that comes with mono colour printing, a light signature panel and no magnetic stripes. It's an eye-catching design and a way of putting recycling at the heart of card production.

Card recycling is undoubtedly a challenge for many banks, but with rapid advances happening across the sector, there's a real opportunity to drive change.

With consumers increasingly expecting companies to be environmentally friendly, Thales can provide you with a complete set of tools that enables you to build a consistent and sustainable card offering that proves your green credentials and counters any claims of greenwashing.

Thales implements processes to accelerate dematerialisation.

Our services help to reduce the excessive and unnecessary production of the bits of paper– such as personalised card carriers, inserts and PIN mailers – that usually go hand in hand with delivering and activating cards, as well as enabling you to share information with your cardholders and access comprehensive online reporting solutions.

The Thales Gemalto card carrier compiler tool lets banks manage advanced carrier design and implement frequent online content updates. Put simply; it enables you to scale down the number of leaflets you need to bundle with each card.

Thales also offers complete card PIN code management. Our innovative and secure solution provides an interactive experience for cardholders and a seamless move to digital. Choosing paperless PIN management and distribution lowers your carbon footprint and supports your corporate social responsibility (CSR) programme.

For EMV card issuance, you can monitor your card production and personalisation via Thales' web portal, with electronic invoicing available on request. The process is paperless and brings agility to managing card batches of any size.

For EMV card customisation, Thales offers an online personal picture service for your artwork. Cardholders can be issued a unique card while maintaining a paperless and environmentally friendly production chain.

Thales Sustainable payment cards are certified by major payment schemes and safety scientists.

Thales has its full portfolio of cards certified by the Mastercard Sustainable Card Program. Since 2019, 30 million of these eco-friendly cards have been issued based on bio-sourced materials or recycled plastic.

The global safety science leader UL tested and certified(PLA) card in March 2022. The 1st bio-sourced payment card in the world certified by UL** Precision on the RESULT is cited as +/- 3% (absolute), plus +/- 2% difference comes from the card structure tolerance.

Customer References

Thales has delivered millions of eco-friendly cards and services worldwide to over 25 customers.

Doconomy revisited the green credit card approach putting the user at the heart of the green payment strategy.

Mediolanum launched a new sustainable card made of PLA to reduce PVC use by more than 80% in payment cards.

Findomestic launches its more sustainable credit card, which uses PLA instead of PVC. They stated, ""As of 30 April 2021, we have put just over 100,000 PLA cards into circulation with a reduction of 600 kilos of PVC"". ""In February 2021, we started replacing our new and expiring cards and switched from PVC to PLA cards. We will conclude this cycle in 2024 when all our cards will be eco-sustainable"".

US Army picks L3Harris and Thales for radio modernization - C4ISRNET,"Fri, 01 Apr 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmM0aXNybmV0LmNvbS9iYXR0bGVmaWVsZC10ZWNoL2l0LW5ldHdvcmtzLzIwMjIvMDQvMDEvdXMtYXJteS1waWNrcy1sM2hhcnJpcy1hbmQtdGhhbGVzLWZvci1yYWRpby1tb2Rlcm5pemF0aW9uL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Army recently selected two companies to furnish voice and data radios as part of a broader effort to move away from aging assets and better secure military networks and communications.

L3Harris Technologies and Thales Defense and Security were selected for the potential $6.1 billion combat net radio contract March 25.

More than 1,100 radios — including those to be used for quality checks and preliminary testing — have been ordered, according to the Army’s Program Executive Office for Command, Control and Communications-Tactical.

L3Harris secured $20.6 million of the initial delivery order; Thales, $18.2 million. Orders can be made through March 2032, the networks office said in a statement.

The combat net radio is a single channel radio that will help phase out older Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System, or SINCGARS, radios that are widely used.

As U.S. competition against advanced adversaries — like Russia or China — heats up, so do concerns about the efficacy of legacy systems. The combat net radio will be able to handle SINCGARS waveform improvements, including enhancements to voice quality and electronic-warfare protection.

The new radio program supports Department of Defense and National Security Agency cryptographic goals, according to the Army, as well as a unified network strategy by providing assured command and control voice as well as limited fires and air defense data in compromised situations.

“Thanks to software-defined capabilities, the CNR effort will support the new, resilient waveforms that are either in development or under consideration as part of our efforts to prepare for future modernization,” said Lt. Col. Sherida Whindleton, a product manager for waveforms assigned to Project Manager Tactical Radios.

The Army hopes to field the first CNR units in fiscal year 2024, pending certifications.

“CNR is a critical enabler of multipath diversity and for continued network modernization at the tactical edge,” said Col. Garth Winterle, project manager for tactical radios. “The reprogrammable nature of CNR radios lends itself to the Army’s capability set approach and the ability to upgrade over time.”

The radio will be available on both mounted and dismounted missions, according to the Army.

In a 2020 request for information shared by the Program Executive Office for Command, Control and Communications-Tactical, the Army announced it was weighing a new radio solution or tech upgrades for its Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System.

The service wanted to know more about industry capabilities for upgrading the SINCGARS to include new frequency-hopping capabilities, among other things, C4ISRNET previously reported.

Colin Demarest is a reporter at C4ISRNET, where he covers military networks, cyber and IT. Colin previously covered the Department of Energy and its National Nuclear Security Administration — namely Cold War cleanup and nuclear weapons development — for a daily newspaper in South Carolina.

"Thales, CS Group team up to build new counter-drone systems for French military - Defense News","Thu, 28 Apr 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZWZlbnNlbmV3cy5jb20vZ2xvYmFsL2V1cm9wZS8yMDIyLzA0LzI4L3RoYWxlcy1jcy1ncm91cC10ZWFtLXRvLWJ1aWxkLW5ldy1jb3VudGVyLWRyb25lLXN5c3RlbXMtZm9yLWZyZW5jaC1taWxpdGFyeS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"STUTTGART, Germany — The French Armed Forces Ministry has chosen Thales and CS Group to build deployable anti-drone systems and have them in place by 2023, ahead of the nation’s hosting of two major international sports events.

The €350 million (U.S. $368 million) deal includes an initial six copies, with the option to acquire several dozen more at a later date. The ministry issued the procurement notification on April 26, spokesman Herve Grandjean told reporters during a Thursday press conference.

The program, dubbed PARADE for “protection déployable modulaire anti-drone,” was initiated in May 2021. Thales partnered with CS Group, a command-and-control information systems builder, to produce technology capable of detecting and neutralizing microdrones and small unmanned aerial system, Grandjean said. Microdrones are typically classified as having the dimensions of a large insect, while small UAS tend to measure between 50 centimeters and 2 meters long.

Each system will include a goniometer capable of detecting the drone’s angle of approach, a radar, an optronic system and a jamming system, Grandjean told reporters. The deployable counter-UAS systems will be capable of detecting and neutralizing drones, whether or not they emit electromagnetic waves, he added.

While the systems will be used for overall national security purposes, the intent is to have them in place ahead of “major international events on national territory,” Grandjean noted. France is scheduled to host the 2023 Rugby World Cup as well as the 2024 Summer Olympics.

The French program was designed to be “agile and evolving,” allowing the ministry to adapt to future threats, Grandjean said.

“If there is a need for new solutions because there are new drone technologies, then we will be capable … of contracting services to integrate these new solutions on the systems.”

He added that such new technologies include a laser weapon. “We can perfectly imagine … integrating this type of service.”

French media reports state that European consortium MBDA also competed for the PARADE program.

The global health crisis and the ongoing conflict in Eastern Europe underline the crucial role that our suppliers play in reaching our business objectives but also in meeting our environmental, social and governance (ESG) commitments. In fact, ESG was one of the central themes of the third Thales Suppliers' Conference at the end of March, as Thales Chief Procurement officer Roque Carmona explains.

© Light Ex Machina

Can you remind us how much we spend on procurement?

Last year, Thales spent 8.2 billion euros – 15% more than in 2020 and the equivalent of nearly half of our revenues – with a total of about 17,000 suppliers. So our supply chain is clearly crucial to our future growth and business success, because at the end of the day, we can only perform as well as our suppliers!

Operational excellence was one of the main topics at this third Suppliers' Conference. Can you tell us more?

Operational excellence is one of our top priorities, and it means delivering products and services on time and with the required level of quality. Our targets today are to achieve 95% on-time delivery and quality performance of less than 500 parts per million (ppm). Last year we were at 90% and 600 ppm, and we would probably have done better if the public health crisis hadn't disrupted our supply chain. Just for the record, a few years ago we were at 75% and more than 15,000 ppm, so the action plans we have drawn up with our suppliers are definitely taking us in the right direction. But we still need to do a little better.

What are your other priorities?

Competitiveness is also a clear priority. If we want to win new business with our customers, and if our suppliers want to win new business with us, we need to be more competitive than everyone else. The situation today is very tight, with demand outstripping supply and huge pressure on raw materials, logistics and energy. This year we are going to launch a competitiveness action plan, but more than anything, we expect our suppliers to anticipate problems ahead of time and to come to us with suggestions about how we can improve our competitive performance. Our suppliers are the experts in their respective fields, so we expect them to challenge us, even on the specifications in our requests for proposals.

This third Suppliers' Conference also had a strong focus on ESG. How do ESG criteria affect Thales's suppliers?

Meeting our environmental, social and governance commitments is a strategic priority for Thales because the Group has a particular role to play in overcoming the major challenges that the world faces today. Our technologies can help our customers to make the world safer, greener and more inclusive. But for this vision to become a reality, we need to embed ESG in all of our business processes, and make sure all of our stakeholders, and our suppliers in particular, are engaged in the fight.

How are we going to do that?

Obviously the first thing we need to do is to meet our own commitments, but we also need our suppliers to apply a number of principles and practices.

As you know, Thales has been engaged with these issues for a very long time. We are not just jumping on the bandwagon. The Group has been a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact for 20 years and has qualified for Advanced Level status every year for the last decade.

A strict policy on corruption prevention has also been in place for a number of years at Thales. This policy complies with the most stringent laws and regulations, and last year we became one of the few companies in the sector to achieve ISO 37000 certification for our anti-bribery management system.

And what are Thales's commitments to its suppliers?

First and foremost, we apply a policy of responsible procurement. We want our relationships with suppliers to be based on mutual loyalty and cooperation, and that means we have a commitment to transparency and fair treatment of suppliers in our tendering procedures, and a commitment to balanced supplier relations driven by trust and respect.

Based on this responsible procurement policy, Thales is one of the relatively small number of companies to have received Responsible Supplier Relations and Procurement certification, which rewards companies and public entities for maintaining balanced and sustainable relationships with their suppliers. This certification is fully aligned with ISO 20400, the international sustainable procurement standard, which integrates social responsibility into the procurement function.

"" To help to overcome the challenges that the world faces, companies like Thales need to propose comprehensive, coherent solutions that involve all of their stakeholders, and their suppliers in particular."" Roque Carmona, SVP, Group Chief Procurement Officer

You mentioned the demands that Thales makes on its suppliers. Can you tell us more?

Our first demands are for suppliers to work ethically and responsibly. That doesn't only mean complying with laws are regulations – it means applying our Integrity and Corporate Responsibility Charter, which includes putting measures in place to prevent corruption and influence peddling, and conducting due diligence. This due diligence (or ""duty of care"") requirement makes it mandatory for a major company like Thales to identify, prevent and mitigate the negative impact on human rights and the environment caused by its own activities but also by the activities of its entire supply chain.

Another of our demands is related to the fight against climate change. We want our suppliers to share our objective of reducing our direct operational CO2 emissions by 50%, and we expect them to take tangible steps to help us achieve it. In particular, we are working with the 100 or so suppliers in the procurement categories that generate the highest levels of greenhouse gas emissions to help them reduce their carbon footprint.

More broadly, a growing number of ESG criteria like emissions reduction and eco-design are going to be taken into account more explicitly in our supplier selection process.

To help to overcome the challenges that the world faces, companies like Thales need to propose comprehensive, coherent solutions that involve all of their stakeholders, and their suppliers in particular. Only by working together to achieve our targets will we be able to play our part in building a future we can all trust."
Are digital payments set to become mainstream? - Thales,"Mon, 25 Apr 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi93b3JsZHdpZGUtZGlnaXRhbC1pZGVudGl0eS1hbmQtc2VjdXJpdHkvYmFuay1wYXltZW50L21hZ2F6aW5lL2FyZS1kaWdpdGFsLXBheW1lbnRzLXNldC1iZWNvbWXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Estimated reading time: 5 minutes

The industry data all says the same thing: the COVID era sent digital payments rocketing. Let’s look more closely at the numbers – and consider what’s next for online commerce and consumer behaviours…

When contactless cards were introduced in 2007, everyone assumed that consumers would adopt them for reasons of convenience. They did, to a degree. But after 2020, a new factor emerged: hygiene. When the pandemic struck, some people thought touching a PIN pad might make them sick. They saw contactless cards as a safer way to make payments. In fact, 78 per cent of global consumers say they have adjusted the way they pay for items because of intensified safety concerns.

According to Mastercard, contactless transactions grew 40 percent during the first quarter of the pandemic. This was a larger shift to digital payment channels in 10 weeks than in the preceding five years.

In parallel, the use of cash declined. The total number of ATM cash withdrawals across EU countries fell by 24.41 per cent from 2019 to 2020.

Digital payment – it comes in many flavours

Contactless card payment is just one facet of a much wider transition away from physical cash as 'card not present' online shopping has become mainstream. The various forms of digital payment include:

• Mobile apps or web sites that store a customer’s card or bank account details in order to process payments in the background.

• Contactless payments made by a smartphone. Here, a mobile wallet – Apple Pay for example – stores multiple credit, debit and store cards. Users select the digital card before making the payment at the point of sale (POS). These digital cards are created by tokenizing a physical card, a technology standardized by EMVco and adopted worldwide.

• QR code payments that are scanned with a mobile camera. An app or mobile wallet identifies the code and opens a push notification that the user can click to complete the transaction. This method is widely used in China, but is also available via Western giants such as Square.



Has digital commerce saved nine in ten small businesses?

All of the above payment methods offer more convenience and less friction to consumers. But it's pretty clear that retailers favour these channels too. In fact, there is evidence that, during the pandemic, digital commerce saved many under-pressure vendors.

According to the 2022 Back to Business Study by Visa, 90 percent of small businesses with an online presence said their survival through the pandemic was due to increased efforts to sell via e-commerce. They added that, on average, just over half of their revenue (52 percent) came from online channels in the three months prior to the survey.

And even those retailers with a physical presence are migrating their businesses away from cash. 59 per cent said they plan to shift to using only digital payments within the next two years, or are already cashless. By contrast, just 16 percent said they will never make the shift to digital payments only.

These sentiments confirm that a huge transition is under way. Cash is declining. Physical retail is consolidating. We are close the point at which digital commerce stops being digital commerce and becomes, simply, commerce.

The key challenges to a flourishing digital payment future: fraud and friction

The following considerations are paramount to the adoption of new digital payment solutions

• Consumer protection. Consumers want reassurance that their personal payment data are protected

• Frictionless journeys. Retailers need to provide a frictionless payment journey to reduce abandoned checkouts

• Speedy transactions. Payment services providers want to be able to approve valid transactions instantly – and just as quickly identify and reject fraudulent ones

• Good UX. Fraud levels must be reduced, but not at the expense of a good user experience

The good news is that for in-store payments (using an EMV card with a secure chip), fraud levels are under control. Instead, most fraud now occurs online where the card’s chip cannot be used. Fraudsters devise elaborate methods – social engineering, phishing, identity theft – to acquire an individual's log in and account details.

Indeed, according to analysts, fraud attempts spiked upwards by almost 35 percent during the first half of 2020.

The payments industry is addressing these challenges. One of the key breakthroughs is the adoption of card tokenization. Here, the payment provider replaces the card's full number with an undecipherable token. This can be stored in the same size and format as the original data. EMV tokenization eliminates any 'man in the middle' attack. Only the bank/card scheme holds the full payment data; these details are never exposed even if the retailer experiences a data breach.

The process makes life easier for cardholders too. Tokens do not expire. Any existing token can simply be carried over to a new card when the old one expires.

Multi-factor, strong customer authentication solutions needed

The payment industry is now addressing the need for new thinking around customer authentication. So are governments. Regulations such as PSD2 in Europe mandate a strong, multi-factor approach. The factors can include biometrics (as the ‘inherence’ factor) combined with password (knowledge) and devices (possession). Used together they drastically improve security while preserving a good user experience.

In March 2022, the FIDO Alliance, an industry association for authentication specialists, published a white paper that outlined an alternative solution. Its concept puts the mobile phone at the centre of the process.

FIDO proposes that phone makers implement a “FIDO credential” manager in the handset, which stores unique cryptographic keys. The effect? To make the phone itself the ‘roaming authenticator’, with all secure information being stored locally and protected behind either a user's biometrics or unique PIN.

In practice, this means a user logs into a site and the company detects that a user’s device supports FIDO. A pop-up then asks if he or she would like to sign in via the device’s PIN or biometric from now on.

FIDO believes the process is safer, and also much more convenient. ""Users don’t need passwords anymore,” says the white paper. “As (people) move from device to device, their FIDO credentials are already there, ready to be used.”

Innovation is not just confined to the online payments space. In the area of in-store payments, there’s the biometric pre-paid debit card. Users can top it up without a bank account, and authenticate a payment with a simple fingerprint. The biometric element makes the card easier to use and harder to steal.

The inclusion factor – making digital payment available to everyone

While it's important to focus on technical improvements to digital payments, we should not forget social questions – not least, how can we ensure that marginalised groups can fully participate in the digital future too?

After all, there is evidence that new forms of payment can improve lives by reducing the risks of embezzlement, theft and extortion that come with cash.

One high profile scheme to support digital financial inclusion is the UN's Better than Cash Alliance. It helps countries without an established digital payments infrastructure to deliver digital payment concepts such as electronic vouchers, prepaid cards, mobile money, and direct bank transfers.



Mobile wallet transactions expected to explode

All over the world, online commerce and digital payment is exploding. The analysts’ projections are all pointing steeply up. According to Juniper Research, shoppers will spend $10 trillion via digital wallets by 2025.

The new consumer behaviours that emerged during the pandemic are here to stay. Retailers are embracing digital commerce – while also starting to understand that the way they ‘do’ payment is more than a utility; it is a reflection of their brand values.

“Payments are no longer about simply completing a sale,” says Jeni Mundy, Global Head Merchant Sales & Acquiring at Visa in the Back to Business Study. “It’s about creating a simple and secure experience that reflects one’s brand across channels –– and provides utility to both the business and its customer.”

The Rise of Passkeys in Regulated Industries (2023) - Thales,"Mon, 25 Apr 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGFsZXNncm91cC5jb20vZW4vbWFya2V0cy9kaWdpdGFsLWlkZW50aXR5LWFuZC1zZWN1cml0eS9iYW5raW5nLXBheW1lbnQvZGlnaXRhbC1iYW5raW5nL3Bhc3NrZXlzLWZvci1maW5hbmNpYWwtaW5zdGl0dXRpb25z0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This page examines passkeys, a new authentication method set to replace traditional passwords.

Passkeys – unveiled in 2022 by major tech companies including Apple, Google and Microsoft – are the result of 10 years of work by the FIDO Alliance.

As passkeys offer a more secure and convenient way to authenticate users, it is no surprise that industry experts agree that they will become the standard authentication method used worldwide. In fact, according to the business news channel CNBC, passkeys are already well on their way to become the industry norm.

For highly regulated industries, such as financial services, this means rethinking their approach to digital services to take full advantage of the benefits of passkeys.

Here we look at what passkeys are, how they differ from traditional passwords, and how Thales is leading the way in facilitating the seamless adoption of passkeys while maintaining the necessary security and compliance with standards demanded by regulated industries.

Let's jump right in.

""By implementing passkeys, financial institutions can lead the way in the transition to this technology, and they’re also an excellent opportunity to simplify and secure digital banking.”

Pedro Martinez, Thales



What are passkeys?

Passkeys are cryptographic credentials that meet FIDO Alliance specifications and are used to authenticate users for accessing digital services.

Passkeys’ passwordless authentication typically involves using facial recognition or fingerprint scanning to authenticate a user. This approach can reduce the risk of account takeover through password theft or social engineering attacks while making the login process faster and more user-friendly.

open standards for strong authentication that can reduce reliance on passwords and improve security for online transactions. FIDO specifications and protocols are designed to work across all devices, platforms, and online services. The FIDO Alliance also provides certification programs to ensure that products and services are interoperable and meet its standards. The FIDO (Fast Identity Online) Alliance , a cross-industry coalition established in 2013, aims to develop and promotefor strong authentication that can reduce reliance on passwords and improve security for online transactions. FIDO specifications and protocols are designed to work across all devices, platforms, and online services. The FIDO Alliance also provides certification programs to ensure that products and services are interoperable and meet its standards.

Passkeys: the future of digital services authentication

Nobody likes passwords

Passwords are an outdated method of authentication that often pose a security risk.

They can be forgotten, phished, hacked, or not strong enough, leading to compromised accounts, data breaches, and related costs.

This is where passkeys come to the rescue as a more secure and user-friendly alternative.

Enter passkeys

Passkeys are a replacement for passwords that provide faster, easier, and more secure sign-ins to websites and apps across a user’s devices. Unlike passwords, passkeys are phishing-resistant.

Passkeys represent the future of authentication for all digital services because they provide a more secure, convenient, and user-friendly authentication method.

How do we get there?

FIDO standard with industry support

Passkeys are based on FIDO authentication, an open standard that enables passwordless authentication across different devices and platforms. It uses public-key cryptography to secure user identity and protect against phishing attacks.

In essence, passkeys are easier to use than passwords and offer much better resistance to credential phishing, credential stuffing, and similar account takeover attacks.

Passkeys are already available on Apple platforms (IoS and MacOS), Android, Chrome and Windows massive support from the industry.

They are already changing access to digital services dramatically, bringing lots of benefits for end users and service providers:

Better UX . Passwordless at last.

. Passwordless at last. Enhanced security . Immune to phishing and server data leaks.

. Immune to phishing and server data leaks. Cost savings . Eliminates the most frequent and costly customer care incident: password reset.

. Eliminates the most frequent and costly customer care incident: password reset. Natively available on every device, through every browser or app.

How do passkeys work?

We don’t have to remember passkeys.

The smartphones, tablets and computers we use to access digital services will generate, store and manage our passkeys. We can use them to authenticate digital services whenever required simply by doing the same biometric verification we use to unlock our devices.

Passkeys created and managed by the device’s OS synchronise to the device’s cloud – Apple, Google, Microsoft – meaning that they can be quickly recovered if a device is lost.

This is how passkeys synchronisation works:

How can passkeys be used in regulated industries?

A passwordless future is finally within reach.

Adopting FIDO technology to replace passwords for basic login with passkeys is a no-brainer for any service provider, including in highly regulated industries.

But service providers need to understand both the benefits and limitations with passkeys to ensure that they are implemented in the right way for maximum security in their different ecosystems.

For example, although FIDO authentication can be used for Strong Customer Authentication (SCA), using passkeys for SCA need some consideration.

Passkeys synchronised over the cloud combine two authentication factors (biometrics plus possession), but they are not uniquely bound to a specific device since they are synced over the device ecosystem.

Many regulations, such as PSD2 for financial services, require device binding. So, financial institutions, and service providers in similar regulated industries, have to raise the bar on passkeys before implementing them for PSD2/SCA.

The synergy of passkeys and Thales

Our IdCloud platform enables service providers to implement passkeys in several different ways, to make sure they strike the best balance between security and user experience.

The result?

It ensures compliance with regulations and meets the security demands of regulated industries.

Passkeys offer a good foundational security layer, while the advanced security features of the IdCloud platform ensure regulatory compliance, effective risk management, and greater security for regulated industries and their customers.

Together, passkeys and IdCloud platform provide a robust and effective security solution to protect sensitive data and transactions from cyber threats and unauthorised access.

How can we help?

Naturally, IdCloud fully supports ‘synced passkeys’, ie the standard passkeys that are synchronised over the cloud.

But it also supports ‘device-bound passkeys’. These are passkeys that are uniquely bound to the device where they are generated, making them SCA compliant with strict regulations, such as PSD2, keeping the service provider in control.

Synced passkeys Device-bound passkeys GREAT FOR Password replacement Strong Customer Authentication MANAGED BY Device OS Mobile app PRIVATE KEY Uploaded to cloud Never leaves the device) DEVICE BINDING No Yes PSD2 COMPLIANCE No Yes

Our IdCloud platform is FIDO2 certified.

The platform offers fully scalable authentication as a service and supports the technology you use today (OTP) and the one you will use tomorrow (FIDO).

Mobilise our experts

While passkeys are great for regulated industries, it’s important to remember that their implementation needs to be considered carefully to ensure maximum security.

This is where Thales can provide invaluable advice and support.

We have extensive experience in helping service providers transition from legacy authentication to state-of-the-art solutions, attaining the best possible security and user experience demanded in their services while ensuring compliance, service continuity, reliability and scalability.

Implemented correctly, passkeys will increase security and ensure a better user experience. But it shouldn't stop there.

Service providers can further enhance their digital authentication security and the user experience by incorporating risk management technologies and risk based authentication (RBA).

When implemented effectively, such technologies can identify returning good users with high confidence and enable them to benefit from SCA exemption.

Additionally, complete session monitoring can be used to prevent account hijacking and social engineering attacks that can happen after login.

By adopting such measures, service providers can ensure their customers enjoy a secure and seamless digital experience.

Great young talents shape our future! That is why we are gladly supporting an ambitious team of aeronautics and aviation students from the FH Joanneum with a special challenge: the Design/Build/Fly (DBF) contest, organized by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA).

The challenge

Each team needs to design and build an unmanned air vehicle (UAV) to fly a mission. To reflect the current pandemic, a humanitarian mission is to be implemented this year. The UAV has to deliver medical material in order to successfully carry out a vaccination. One particular challenge: The vaccine doses have to be unloaded from the aircraft in an automated manner, without any manual assistance. This means, the UAV has to deliver the delicate cargo on the runway.

The design

The Austrian team ""joanneum Aeronautics"" has completed the design of their ""Hornet"" and is now in the fine-tuning phase.

An investment for the future

The use of professional drones will inevitably increase. That's why we support here as Gold Partners, so that the joanneum Aeronautics team can implement their creative ideas and present them at the competition in America.

During test flights, the team had the Thales ScaleFlyt solutions at their disposal, which were already used last year in a successful delivery of blood bags by drone, in cooperation with the Red Cross, FH Joanneum and EHang.

Using Thales ScaleFlyt Remote ID, the team was able to determine parameters such as airspeed, turn speed and approach speed. The digital ScaleFlyt service platform (formerly Soarizon) was also used to plan the flight route in America.

This excellent news confirms the robustness of Europe’s geostationary weather satellites. MSG-1 (also called Meteosat-8) has broken all records for longevity, logging 19 years, 7 months and 12 days in orbit to date. MSG-1 was launched back in August 2002, followed by MSG-2, MSG-3 and MSG-4 in December 2005, July 2012 and July 2015, respectively. All Meteosat satellites, from the first to the third generation, will have been built by Thales Alenia Space (joint venture between Thales 67% and Leonardo 33%) as prime contractor on behalf of the European Space Agency (ESA). Thales Alenia Space also provided orbital operation support for the first two generations of Meteosat satellites. They are operated by EUMETSAT, the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites.

About MSG

Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) satellites have significantly improved weather forecasting. Spin-stabilized at 100 RPM, they incorporate a number of technologies that make life easier for meteorologists: higher quality images due to a significant increase in the number of observation channels, better radiometric performance and shorter revisit cycles.

Making weather forecasts increasingly accurate

European meteorology has become increasingly accurate over the years. On first-generation Meteosat satellites, images were refreshed every 30 minutes. The second generation reduced this to 15 minutes and the advent of Meteosat Third Generation (MTG) will bring this delay down to 10 minutes, making weather forecasts even more reliable.

As for the first two generations, Meteosat Third Generation satellites are being built by Thales Alenia Space as prime, in partnership with OHB of Germany. Telespazio (joint venture between Leonardo 67% and Thales 33%) will provide EUMETSAT with launch and in-orbit services for two of the new MTG constellation satellites, with an option for a third. The MTG family comprises six satellites: four imaging and two atmospheric sounding satellites. All in all, Thales Alenia Space will have been prime contractor for 17 geostationary meteorological satellites: 7 first-generation, 4 second-generation and 6 third-generation.

Data provided by MTG will revolutionize weather forecasting and provide insights into changes in our atmosphere, oceans and land surfaces. Violent storms and other extreme phenomena are an increasing threat – one that MTG satellites should help mitigate by telling us when they’re expected. In addition to improving the accuracy of weather forecasts, the huge streams of data generated by the state-of-the-art sensors on these satellites will help us model the terrestrial ecosystem and better understand current climate change trends so we can take the appropriate actions. The six satellites in the MTG family, four imaging and two sounders, can provide a 3D map of the atmosphere – a technological breakthrough and a world first! The imaging satellites will have on board a sophisticated instrument, the Lightning Imager developed and supplied by Leonardo, the first and most advanced imager in Europe that will be able to “see” lightnings from space. The sounding satellites will be able to detect the advent of extreme climate events a full half-day earlier. By using the system as a whole, meteorologists will improve their weather forecasts a full week in advance. This will mark a major step forward in warning the populations concerned. MTG will help save lives and also pave the way for new services that will benefit people in both Europe and Africa. Once the full MTG fleet is in orbit, Eumetsat will offer the world’s best weather forecasts.

The first MTG imaging satellite will be shipped from Thales Alenia Space’s Cannes plant during the last quarter of 2022 for a launch planned by the end of the year."

APEX, N.C. (WTVD) -- Maintaining good grades while staying involved in numerous sports and extracurriculars is enough of an achievement for anyone, but student-athlete Haidyn Reinhardt is adding a broken record to her extended list of accomplishments.

The Thales Academy Apex student is finishing up her senior year having earned a whopping 21 varsity letters, breaking the school's record.

As a young child, Reinhardt was focused on another accomplishment: battling leukemia. Now, years later she is graduating high school after shattering this athletic record while maintaining a 4.05 GPA.

Despite her earnings, Reinhardt said they didn't initially stand out to her.

""It didn't mean anything to me for a long time until honestly last year when I realized that it was kind of an impressive number,"" Reinhardt said. ""And I think a lot of the students and teachers around me don't realize that I'm part of so many sports teams until they realize I'm always going to games and practices and I'm never available for anything. But it means a lot to me now.""

The senior plays multiple sports including volleyball, basketball and soccer in addition to managing the boys' soccer team. She's also a cheerleader. Reinhardt has been awarded the title of Thales Academy's Female Athlete of the Year for two consecutive years.

""I started to realize that these varsity letters were adding up, and I could do something with it,"" Reinhardt said. ""So I continued to play varsity all four years of high school.""

Reinhardt's soccer coach, McGeath Freeman, said she is the kind of player you wanted on a team.

""Haidyn is kind of the dream player you want. She will do whatever you ask her to do,"" Freeman said. ""Even if she doesn't think she can do it, she will get out there and try, and she will play whatever position you ask her to do. And then she will also take the leadership.""

Reinhardt's sports career began at Thales Academy when she transferred there in sixth grade, joining the basketball team at the suggestion of her mother. After enjoying basketball, she continued joining more sports teams for the school, building relationships and school involvement along the way.

""I think I was shocked at how much I enjoyed sports,"" Reinhardt said. ""I never considered myself an athletic person and then it just kind of escalated and I fell in love with the sports and being part of a team. I enjoyed making new friendships and connections with both the players and coaches- Just continued ever since.""

Though Freeman said Reinhardt's 21 varsity letters are an amazing achievement, what impresses him is the fact that her record did not mean much to her with her focus remaining on enjoying the sport.

""She was just out here to play and enjoy being a varsity player, being a high schooler, and build the relationships,"" Freeman said. ""And so to me, that's more important than the record. I mean, it's great. It's an amazing achievement that anybody can do, but it didn't mean a lot to her and that's really more impressive."""

Faces of Thales - Nick de Bont - Thales,"Wed, 13 Apr 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi9jb3VudHJpZXMtYXNpYS1wYWNpZmljL2F1c3RyYWxpYS9yZWZlcmVuY2VzL2ZhY2VzLXRoYWxlcy1uaWNrLWJvbnTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Born and raised in sunny Brisbane, Nick says he was never one to sit still. He did everything from rugby, swimming and water polo to debating and drama. He quickly figured out his strengths were in the humanities, not the technical subjects like maths and science.

“I thought that maybe Law was the way to go for me,” he says. “That was until my fourth year at uni when I had to do a work placement within a law firm and within two weeks I knew it wasn’t for me.”

Despite this Nick figured there was still plenty of other options apart from being a lawyer he could do with the degree, so he completed the five-year double degree in International Business and Law at the Queensland University of Technology.

“I always had an interest in working for the Government or the Army or Police. A role where I helped others. So, I joined the Army Reserves and did my Officer training as soon as I could when I was 18.”

At one point in his studies Nick spent seven months on exchange in Glasgow Law School, a period he absolutely loved even though his first thoughts aren’t with the schooling.

I got to work with the British Parachute Regiment,” he laughs. “Those guys are a bit crazy but I loved it. Actually, it was very eye opening for me. I went from the barracks in Brisbane where the main threat was people climbing the waist high fence to jump in our pool to my first night over there where they gave me my weapon, three soldiers and live ammunition and told me if I saw anyone climb the fence I was to shoot them. It was a bit surreal, but they had a very real threat at the time with the Irish Republican Army. It definitely opened my eyes.""

Apart from a previous backpacking trip around Europe, his time in Glasgow was the first real time Nick had spent an extended period away from home. The travel bug had set in and it would become a large part of his life in the future.

Back in Brisbane again Nick went and did a Postgraduate Degree in Law at Bond University and undertook work experience for some Brisbane based barristers.

“I was working with a floor full of criminal barristers pretty much as their gofer and learning more about the law,” he notes. “Actually, I was learning it was definitely not what I wanted to do. But it was ok while I was waiting for my application to go through with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.”

In 2004 the application was successful and Nick made the move to Canberra. Not long after, the war in Iraq erupted and Nick’s life would change forever.

Here and Back Again

I was originally asked to head to Iraq to cover for someone for a month,” he says. “I said yes and I flew over to Southern Iraq and ended up staying there for the next nine months.”

Nick’s role was diverse including engagement with local leaders, participating in patrols and travel throughout southern Iraq and to Baghdad. “It was an incredible learning experience for me and provided me with the knowledge and military foundations that set me up for success on my next deployment to Afghanistan”.

Deploying in support of the Special Operations Task Force in Tarin Khowt, Afghanistan Nick found himself in the thick of the action. It was very, very different to Iraq,” he says. “It was very full on. I was out on patrol regularly and there were contacts pretty much daily, so nothing like Iraq."" Following the six months in Afghanistan Nick returned to work in Sydney only to later redeploy back to Afghanistan and then to Timor-Leste. Deploying with the apprehension task force Nick was again supporting Australian special forces on the hunt for a rebel leader. “Unfortunately that mission was not successful but it was amazing to see this fledging nation building itself from the ground up and to hear the optimism of the locals and their journey to independence.”

After his deployments Nick returned to Australia and started a career working in a variety of security related areas within the Commonwealth Bank. His time at the bank was no less dynamic then his military commitments and included responding to terrorist attacks, protest activities and bank robberies. A highlight was being part of a small team led by Catherine Fitzpatrick to work across the bank to find ways to help customers suffering from domestic and family violence. “This was incredibly rewarding and we managed to implement a wide range of measures that made a real and tangible difference to both staff and customers who were affected by domestic and family violence”.

Moving to Thales

“I really enjoyed my time there with Comm Bank,” he says. “I travelled all around the world looking after our sites. I did the Royal Commission, and even a really interesting Close Protection Course in South Africa. It was fantastic. But I wanted to find something different.

I’ve always been passionate about defence technology, and the engineering aspect behind it all. The work Thales does really interests me, so when I saw the position here come up I applied and thankfully got the job two years ago. Doing work where you’re helping secure Australia, that’s exactly what I wanted to do, and doing it in the private sector means less of the red tape you come across in Government.""

Despite knowing about some of the areas Thales works in, Nick says he was blown away by how varied and large the company is.

“I’d driven around in Bushmasters and I loved them, and I was a huge fan of the rifle,” he says. “I knew about some of the Explosive Ordnance Services work and Munitions, but I couldn’t believe all the different types of work Thales does. Some of the things we build here, and globally, is so technically intricate and complex, but we can do it. It still fascinates me and I’m still finding more and more about our capabilities.”

Nick says his plan for the next few years is to develop our security to be the best it can be.“That’s my goal, to make sure our security is second to none, and make it a differentiating factor from our competitors,” he says. “I’d love to do that for us here in Australia and New Zealand, and if I can help Thales out as a Group that would be ideal.

Veterans Committee

Since joining Thales Nick has been able to devote time to his passion of helping Veterans and their families. “It was a real honour to become the first Chair of the Thales Veterans Committee established in July 2021”. Within Thales Australia over 260 current Thales staff members have identified as Veterans with numerous continuing to serve in a Reserve capacity. Thales actively supports a variety of Veterans related groups including Legacy Australia and the Navy Clearance Diver Trust. “I am immensely proud of where the Veterans Program is going with a new Reserve leave policy, specific employee assistance support for Veterans, an internal mentoring program and a range of engagements to help Defence members transition to meaningful employment after their service”. Nick has been actively involved with the NSW RSL serving on the committee of the North Bondi Sub Branch and Eastern Suburbs District Council and provided his tips for veterans transition in the first RSL NSW webcast.

Gavin shares with us his 17-year career in various Commonwealth militaries before transitioning into civilian life at Thales.

Military career

Gavin was born in the UK and remembers moving around various major ports due to his father’s job in the shipping industry. Perhaps it is this continuous theme of living near the water, coupled with his target-driven nature, that Gavin says it was a foregone conclusion he joined the Royal Navy (RN).

“I really thrive when operating in a team and having a common mission. That’s why the military was so appealing for me.""

Gavin joined the RN straight out of Manchester University and served on board various ships including HMS Invincible, during her Norwegian and Baltic exercises, as well as HMS Marlborough, deployed to the North Arabian Gulf in support of Operation Telic.

Late in 2003, after almost four years in the RN as a Warfare Officer, Gavin was selected for RN pilot training; finding fixed wing and helicopter flying both a challenging and hugely rewarding experience. However, the lengthy aircrew training pipeline and domestic aspirations led him to separate from the RN and decided to make the move to the Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN). An extended notice period from the Royal Navy gave him the opportunity to be part of the project team for the acclaimed Trafalgar 200 celebrations in 2005, as well as serve as a Battle Watch Captain on behalf of CTF 58; once again in the North Arabian Gulf.

After a short period of settling in to New Zealand and the RNZN in 2007, Gavin began the arduous process that is the RNZN clearance diver training. Although a continuation of his flying career was the intent, the embattled Super Seasprite project, put pay to that.

Successful completion of this training gave him valuable experience and knowledge of all RNZN diving techniques, equipment and capabilities, and subsequently led him to assume the role as the Operations Officer of the Operational Diving Team (ODT). This background proved invaluable when Gavin arrived in Sydney Australia, in February 2009, to embark on the Mine Warfare and Clearance Diving Officer’s (MCDO) course. After a demanding, yet thoroughly rewarding period of time with the Royal Australian Navy (RAN), he returned to New Zealand having been awarded Dux of the MCDO course.

On his return to NZ he was appointed as the Executive Officer of the ODT and was involved in a plethora of foreign and domestic exercises and operations. “A Navy Clearance Diver is involved in all sorts of different missions, from beach landings to natural disaster relief to explosive ordnance disposal.” Gavin explains. When asked what he loved about the role, he shares that he loved being part of a small, elite team who were all driven and focused on achieving a defined outcome.

The role pushed me to operate at the very edge of human potential – mentally, physically and psychologically. Every diver goes through intense training and it was very satisfying to be able to see the tangible outcomes of that training.""

In 2011, he served in the multinational Operation Render Safe in Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, where they were tasked with disposing of explosive ordnance remnants from WWII. “It was so rewarding to be able to support the local communities making their environment a safer place to live. Also, by working with our ‘like-minded’ allied partners, we complemented and learned from each other’s skillsets and procedures.

In 2012, Gavin was promoted to Commanding Officer of HMNZS Manawanui which he is proud to say was one of his career highlights. Gavin was recognised with the award of the Chatham Rose Bowl for his ship’s performance, as well as a Chief of Navy’s commendation for leadership and management during his tenure.

With fond memories of his family’s time in Sydney, Australia, when the RAN reached out to offer him the role as Executive Officer on HMAS Diamantia later that year, he just couldn’t refuse. Gavin was then appointed as the Officer in Charge of the Mine Warfare Faculty and embarked on a complete reinvigoration and modernisation of all core training courses, benefiting from his attendance on the RN’s Advanced Mine Warfare course in the UK. This knowledge proved advantageous in his next role as the Deputy Commander, Australian Mine Warfare and Clearance Diving Task Group (DCOMAUSMCDTG) managing the RANs engagement in all international mine warfare and clearance diving exercises, as well as driving the RAN’s collective training.

Joining Thales

In 2017, Gavin joined Thales as a Business Development Manager for Underwater Systems.

“The offer was unexpected but came at the right time personally. Ultimately it was my young family that made the decision for me however. The idea of stability at home was extremely attractive and I knew that I didn’t want to distance myself from Defence. It proved to be a great fit whereby I could utilise my skills and experience in mine warfare and clearance diving, as well as a network of allied Navies, to support the Commonwealth customer in the mine warfare domain.""

He is currently focused on SEA1095 - Maritime Mine Countermeasures and Military Survey Capability (MMCMMS) and working closely with the customer to translate their objectives. “Thales are taking all of our learnings from SEA1778 (Deployable Mine Counter Measures), which is the pre-cursor to SEA1905. We recognise that this is a huge step for the Commonwealth in terms of the future of mine warfare and Defence is commendably taking a long-sighted view. We want to ensure that the Navy gets the most applicable capability for its unique environment and requirements, that is not only value for money but also interoperable and embedded in Australian industry.”

Gavin feels very empowered and proud of the complete commitment and enthusiasm that is being channelled from the most senior levels within Thales towards the RAN’s autonomous journey. Notably, “being able to leverage and transfer the titanic efforts of my colleagues in Europe on the MMCM (Maritime MCM) program so as to establish a solid foundation here in Australia.

“Operators are going to face huge challenges because there will be a huge step-change to go from legacy systems and standard operating procedures to what is going to be brand new. They are currently having to deal with tsunami of data that comes in from the sensors, so Thales is committed to developing solutions to automate as much as possible. This will improve mission effectiveness and efficiency, and also build trust in the systems.""

When asked how his experience as a veteran has shaped the way he works at Thales, Gavin barely pauses when he says:

“I’ve always worked in environments and teams where collaboration was mandatory; I don’t know any other way. In my mind, there is just no way to succeed without it. So, when dealing with significant challenges, we need to make sure we collaborate otherwise we will miss something and not afford the customer core strategic advantage. Collaboration is in my DNA.""

Life outside of Thales

After spending most of his career focused on achievement at the highest level, Gavin feels like the days of driving towards relentless goals are gradually moving behind him. “I’ve become more grateful and comfortable with my professional and personal circumstances and am simply enjoying life and a refined focus. I enjoy my work, spending time with my three young children, close friends and my partner. I didn’t move to paradise to drive past it.”"

The application form to join the service was quite literally placed in his lap when his brother got a copy of the form and intended to apply himself but had 'never got around to it'. So, a 15-year-old Andy applied instead and was accepted. What followed was a 31-year Naval career serving in multiple war zones and a 14-year (and counting!) career with Thales supporting our Australian Defence Force (ADF) customer. Here is his story.

A distinguished military career spanning numerous ships and countries

After he was accepted into the Navy, Andy was given two days to pack his bags and move from country Queensland to Perth, where he completed his initial 12 months of Naval training before going to Melbourne to undertake category training for the specific job he was required to do.

Andy became a communications specialist – an area he stayed in whilst moving up the ranks within the military from Junior Recruit to Warrant Officer. The first ship he was posted on after finishing the communications training course was the HMAS Vampire, the only ship he served on that remains afloat to this day. He learnt Morse code to communicate silently with other ships using flashing flights and provided radio circuitry to allow the command team to communicate with other ships. Andy was also responsible for manoeuvring the ship around the ocean to avoid collision with others. Over the years, he has seen the communications systems evolve from largely manual based systems to more advanced information, communications and technology systems that are used today.

From HMAS Vampire, he was posted to various other locations around the world including to both the Gulf Wars, where he coordinated the logistics for all the Australian ships deployed to the Red Sea. It was during this time, while on HMAS Kanimbla, he developed and implemented a communications plan to allow the 14 Coalition countries (including the Five Eyes alliance that Australia belongs to and nine Gulf countries) to securely communicate with each other during a covert operation to ensure 108 civilian ships and small watercrafts in the area could be thoroughly inspected and then allowed safe passage out of the region before formal attacks against the Saddam Hussein regime started. The plan ensured HMAS Kanimbla maintained command and control over the other Coalition partners via data and voice. For these activities, Andy was awarded an Order of Australia Medal, an honour that confers the highest recognition of Australian citizens and other persons for achievement or meritorious service. His ship was recognised as having operated at the highest level of communications ability and awarded the Commodore Wardle Cup, named after the cup’s namesake, who had made significant contributions to the Royal Australian Navy.

Andy also spent three and a half years in Washington D.C. working with the other Five Eyes nations – United States of America, Canada, United Kingdom and New Zealand – to provide communication and Information Communication Technology capabilities to their Defence Forces.

Transitioning into civilian life by applying his communications expertise at Thales

After 31 years in the military, Andy says he reached an age where he needed to decide whether to stay in the navy or look for a new career. It just so happened that Andy was approached by Thales for a potential opportunity At the time, the Thales team were working on a project involving deployed ICT,where Thales ICT staff work alongside the ADF on operation). Andy was asked to join as the Project Manager for the Deployable Local Area Network program to help. One of the first challenges that Andy first tackled involved implementing permanent communications solutions in the ADF’s operations in East Timor, the Solomon Islands and the Middle East. The team worked tirelessly to successfully deliver 150 green cases containing ICT equipment for use in those operational areas earlier than expected and well below budget. Andy laughs when he recalls the cases being put through an unintentional stress test when the semi-trailer transporting the cases from Perth to Sydney rolled over on the Nullarbor Plains and the cases only suffering minor dents. “The design that Thales put into the cases certainty held up!”

Currently, Andy is the Sales Director for Digital Systems, providing communications, command, control and computers across Army, Navy and the Air Force.

“We are extremely customer focused and know their pain points. We’re very proud of being recognised by the customer as the people who are called in to resolve the hard stuff for the ADF,” Andy says before adding “Our goal is to make sure Defence can get the right information to the right people at the right time to make decisions.”

Two main projects that Andy is working on includes the LAND121 Phase 4 project, integral computer systems for the Hawkei vehicles so soldiers can use a single screen to do everything they need to rather than having to switch between screens, and SEA1442, providing maritime tactical wide-area network for the Navy that controls every satellite signal or phone call that goes on and off the ship. “In essence, digital systems provides the glue that brings all the technologies together,” Andy summarises.

When asked about his career highlights to date, Andy is quick to point out the delivering of “Hybrid Deployable Local Area Network (DLAN) into Defence operations in Iraq and Iran where our soldiers were at war. “We made a significant contribution to the ADF during their planning and operations, and to bringing soldiers home safely. Being involved in these activities is extremely satisfying,” says Andy. More recently, Thales was called to provide satellite terminals to assist with the Australian Government’s efforts in evacuating civilians out of Afghanistan. “We got the call at 10:30 PM to supply these terminals, which replaces the mobile phone network in times when the network is overwhelmed. We put them on the plane that same night at 3 AM and they arrive in Kabul 18 hours later,” Andy says and adds “We were also asked to urgently supply satellites to support the ADF in delivering humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations in Tonga!” Andy is very proud to be able to respond so quickly and proactively to these Defence requests and to fix issues that competitors struggle to resolve. The team have received a lot of positive feedback from the customer, praising the team for making the hard stuff look easy. This is quite an achievement considering the digital ecosystem is becoming more complex, having to integrate various systems into one.

A key reason why Thales is able to do such amazing things is because we have some very smart people. For Thales to continue to grow into the future, we need to leverage off the minds of our young people. This is the generation that has grown up with technology and so they look at things through a completely different lens. They’re constantly putting forward ideas that I would never have thought of myself. We have a real responsibility to grow the leaders of tomorrow.""

On the back of that sentiment, Andy encourages everyone to never stop learning and testing themselves, and be willing to participate and contribute. He also advises people to not be afraid of putting their point across and to be prepared to argue those points.

A passion for advocating for veteran issues as well as playing rugby union

Working on issues affecting veterans is something that Andy is very passionate about and he is a member of Thales Australia’s Veterans Committee. Thales’s Veteran’s Committee is focused on supporting veteran transition out of Defence into the private workforce and veteran safety with a particular focus on mental health issues – issues that have been made even more challenging during the COVID pandemic.

With the Australian Government’s Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide interim report due next year, and given the large number of veterans that make up Thales’s workforce Andy notes “We want to encourage people to talk openly about mental health issues, not just for veterans but for everyone. This will become a big focus for us in the new year.”

Something else that Thales is involved in is giving talks to people who are existing Defence members to inform them about the career opportunities that Thales can offer them. Andy says working for Thales after his military career has been very satisfying because he gets to stay in touch with his Defence networks. “You always run into someone that you served with and its always great to catch up with them to see what they are up to. Another great joy for me is being able to travel to Garden Island and taking people on tours of the ships to show them the capabilities available.”

During his time in the Navy, he represented both the Navy and the ADF in rugby union and went on numerous overseas tours. This is a pastime that Andy is still keenly involved in, playing for the Navy Old Salts Team in Canberra. “It keeps my mind active and my body fit. Though I must admit, it takes longer for me to recover from a game these days.” Andy laughs.

New train technology is being demonstrated to stakeholders that could make the UK rail network safer for track workers, train crews and passengers.

Thales is working with Network Rail and the West Somerset Railway (WSR) to run a live demonstration of its Train Protection and Warning System - Continuous Supervision (TPWS-CS). An audience representing Network Rail, RAIB, ORR, supply chain, train operating companies and rolling stock owners will observe the digital, in-cab system put through its paces in real world scenarios on the 7th of April.

TPWS-CS builds on radio-based limited supervision (RBLS) system, which is currently being defined by Network Rail and industry. The new system continuously updates a train’s position and warns the driver when approaching a stretch of track closed for maintenance or under speed restrictions, applying an emergency brake if necessary. The system enables the Person in Charge of Possession to apply specific permitted movements to trains within the possession, which will be automatically supervised by the TPWS-CS to warn the driver or apply the brake when necessary. The driver can receive updates in their cab constantly, without the need for trackside infrastructure.

Alex Stockill, Product Line Manager at Thales, said:

This is a proof-of-concept demonstration, to show that this is something that exists, not an unrealistic idea. When we tell engineers what we plan to do, their reaction is that it’s too good to be true but this demo will show that the technology does exist and it works.

He added: “We want to come out of the demonstration with the confidence of Network Rail and other potential customers. We think this system, if deployed across the UK, can make a big difference.”

The technology

The system consists of three core elements: continuous positioning sensors, including radar, a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and inertial measurement unit (IMU); an interface for communicating with the driver; and access to the emergency braking system through the existing Train Protection & Warning System.

TPWS-CS initially warns the driver if the train is approaching a track possession, an area of track taken over by a maintenance crew with restricted access or speed limit. If the train is in danger of breeching its movement authority, the system automatically applies a brake.

TPWS-CS gives controllers the ability to set movement rules around a possession, either a 0 mph rule at the boundary or allowing specified trains, for example an engineering train, to enter to a certain extent and at a fixed maximum speed. This enables controlled moves of engineering trains within worksites.

The demonstration

The equipment will be fitted in a day to a classic diesel cab owned by West Somerset Railway (WSR), a heritage railway company, which also manages the track being used for the demonstration. Display boards on the carriages will show guests the train’s position and speed and repeat the driver’s-eye view of the cab interface.

“It’s been really good working with WSR,” said Alex. “They’ve also given us access to their track so we could carry out testing in safe conditions.

“It’s taken very little time to arrange because they are in total control of their own track, so we’ve been able to react quickly and collaboratively with them.”

The first part of the demonstration will be a series of runs at various speeds under differing restrictions and movement authorities, testing the system’s response and how the train behaves as it approaches a possession applied to the track. The second half will be a presentation of other applications possible for the system.

Innovation and collaboration

Thales has also shown that the TPWS-CS system can be fitted and integrated quickly and cheaply into a cab. The system has been installed as part of Thales’s Robust Train Positioning System on an in-service GWR Class 150 cab, which is acting as a rolling laboratory to gather data.

“These demonstrations have been down to strong collaboration between all of the stakeholders,” said Alex. “To continue innovating for the future, we have to continue working collaboratively and quickly on projects like this, which we’ve been able to set up and demonstrate inside of six months.”"
"Thales, The First Group to Join The Campus Cyber in Paris, La Défense, And Lend Its Expertise to the Service of This ... - Business Wire","Thu, 14 Apr 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc3dpcmUuY29tL25ld3MvaG9tZS8yMDIyMDQxNDAwNTAyMi9lbi9UaGFsZXMtVGhlLUZpcnN0LUdyb3VwLXRvLUpvaW4tVGhlLUNhbXB1cy1DeWJlci1pbi1QYXJpcy1MYS1EJUMzJUE5ZmVuc2UtQW5kLUxlbmQtSXRzLUV4cGVydGlzZS10by10aGUtU2VydmljZS1vZi1UaGlzLU5ldy1FY29zeXN0ZW3SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Pierre-Yves Jolivet, VP CyberDefence Solution, Marc Darmon, EVP Secure Communications & Information Systems, Michel Van Den Berghe, President of the Campus Cyber and Patrice Caine, Chairman and CEO of Thales at the Campus Cyber.

PARIS LA DÉFENSE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 2022 saw the arrival of about sixty Thales employees, engineers, consultants, and cybersecurity project managers on the Cyber Campus. To mark the occasion, Patrice Caine underlined its role as a catalyst for international cyber excellence in a context of globalization and a sharp rise in threats.

The Thales teams will soon be joined by teams coming from public and private structures specializing in this field. Thales provides Cyber Campus members with its collaborative platform in the cloud, the first approved “Restricted Diffusion”, Cybels Hub, including Cryptobox (document management and sharing) and Citadel Team (screen sharing).

This project, which is a State initiative, is aligned with the structuring programs of a French Security Industries Committee dedicated to cybersecurity and IoT security, which works to instill confidence in the digital sector. This sector is driven by a strong dynamic of innovation and mobilizes skills in artificial intelligence and cryptography as well as talents from various sectors such as IT, telecoms, or defense.

This project is being implemented at a time when we are witnessing an upsurge in cyberattacks around the world, on account of the acceleration in digitalization of societies during the health crisis. Administrations, companies of all sizes and operators of vital importance are facing an explosion in the number of attacks, which quadrupled between 2019 and 2020. Among some of the recurring methods used are Ransomware and cyber espionage. The professionalization of cybercriminals combined with their imperative of profitability must now act as a wake-up call and mobilize security players to contribute to the improved training of future talents and the establishment of a robust ecosystem to fight these threats.

""Thales was one of the first companies to believe in and support this Campus Cyber project. We are very proud to welcome and host one of the European leaders in cyber."" Michel Van Den Berghe, President of the Campus Cyber.

“Thales reaffirms its commitment to an international cybersecurity center of excellence that can pool the know-how of its experts and more successfully counter the proliferation of threats. By becoming a part of this initiative, the Group’s teams will help contribute to projects that raise awareness and provide training on the challenges faced by cybersecurity, which our society so desperately needs today.” Patrice Caine, Chairman and CEO of Thales.

With more than 20 years of experience in cybersecurity, Thales is a major supplier of services and systems that help consolidate the sovereignty of its clients.

The Group oversees the cybersecurity of the critical information systems of more than 130 major clients, in particular through its six cybersecurity operational centers (COC) located around the world (Canada, France, Hong Kong, Netherlands, United Kingdom, Morocco), which guarantee that attacks are detected, analyzed and responded to 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

The Group is currently recruiting more than 1,000 talents in the field of cybersecurity to better arm itself and prepare for the hybrid conflicts of tomorrow.

The theme for Earth Day 2022 is “Invest In Our Planet” and this may be the most important Earth Day yet. It follows COP26, the largest climate change conference ever held, and the groundbreaking new IPCC reports that explain the science behind these latest discoveries.

Monitoring the Earth and climate change from space

Satellites offer global coverage, giving us a unique view of our planet. Information from space in incredibly useful because it can help improve agricultural yields, protect against habitat loss and stop deforestation. Satellites also discovered the hole in the ozone layer and their data is now a key to the fight against climate change.

This mesmerizing geometric pattern shows farm plots in the Santa Cruz region of Bolivia as seen by Sentinel-1.

To protect our planet from the consequences of global warming , we need precise information about how the natural environment is changing. Earth observation satellites in particular can give us highly accurate information on changes over long periods of time and on a global scale.

While weather forecasting was the first scientific discipline to use space capabilities in the 1960s, satellites are now able to help us monitor the overall health of our planet, based on a broad range of data including not only weather events, but also ocean color and temperature, and even measurements of the Earth’s gravity.

Some of the observation satellites circling the Earth are purpose-designed for environmental monitoring. Satellites allow scientists and decision-makers to better monitor the impact of climate change, and they can also be the only way to monitor parts of the world where ground systems are not deployable.

Their sensors keep a constant eye on our planet, capturing images that provide invaluable data to help us respond when nature goes wild, as well as to understand climate change, make better use of natural resources and protect populations at risk.

Thales Alenia Space is in charge of the entire COSMO-SkyMed second-generation program, including satellite design and development, as well as the design, integration and commissioning of the end-to-end system. Telespazio is responsible for the design and development of the CSG ground segment, while also providing integrated logistics and operations services (ILS and OPS).

Telespazio's Fucino-based Space Center, a joint venture between Leonardo (67%) and Thales (33%), will manage the satellite's launch and early orbit phase (LEOP), during which it will send the first telemetry data.

Leonardo is providing attitude control equipment, as well as state-of-the-art electrical power management and distribution units.

COSMO-SkyMed data is marketed worldwide by e-GEOS, a joint venture between Telespazio (80%) and ASI (20%) which develops applications and provides operational services using the same data.

Revolutionizing meteorology with MTG

Over the decades, European meteorology has become increasingly accurate. With the first generation of Meteosat, images were updated every 30 minutes, a rate that dropped to 15 minutes for the second generation. With Meteosat Third Generation (MTG), images will now be updated every ten minutes, making weather forecasts increasingly reliable. MTG promises to revolutionize weather forecasting, while providing more precise monitoring of our changing atmosphere, land surfaces and oceans.

Violent storms and other extreme phenomena are an increasing threat – one that MTG satellites should help mitigate by telling us when they’re expected. In addition to improving the accuracy of weather forecasts, the huge streams of data generated by the state-of-the-art sensors on these satellites will help us model the terrestrial ecosystem and better understand current climate change trends so we can take the appropriate actions. The MTG family comprises six satellites, four imaging and two sounders, which can provide a 3D map of the atmosphere – a world first! For instance, the sounding satellites will be able to detect the advent of extreme climate events a full half-day earlier. By using the system as a whole, meteorologists will improve their weather forecasts out to a full week in advance. This will mark a major step forward in giving people early warning of dangerous phenomena. MTG will help save lives and also pave the way for new services that will benefit populations in both Europe and Africa. Once the full MTG fleet is in orbit, Eumetsat will offer the world’s best weather forecasts.

Farming was one of the first business sectors to adopt satellite technology. Today, for instance, over 90% of all tractors in the European Union benefit from EGNOS, an augmentation system that enhances satellite positioning systems, allowing farmers to save fuel by making sure they don’t pass several times over the same parcels, and also reduce the use of pesticides and fertilizer by 20% via more specifically targeted applications. But agriculture is just one of the many sectors using space to become more eco-conscious. Europe’s own satellite navigation system, Galileo, also helps reduce the environmental impact of road traffic, since satellite navigation can reduce traffic jams to decrease our carbon footprint. Likewise, car-pooling and other sustainable mobility applications all depend on precision geolocation.

Europe’s Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) services, especially EGNOS, help make air travel more environmentally-friendly and accessible. Airport procedures calling on EGNOS result in fewer aborted landings, thus reducing fuel consumption and carbon emissions in general.

Thales Alenia Space will play a pivotal role in the Galileo Second Generation system by boosting the constellation’s performance and cybersecurity. ESA and the European Commission chose Thales Alenia Space to provide six of the 12 Galileo Second Generation satellites.

Environmental monitoring satellites to safeguard our planet

Thales Alenia Space is working hand in hand with the European Space Agency on the European Commission’s Copernicus environmental monitoring program, which encompasses 12 Sentinel satellite families developed by Europe’s space industry for ESA.

Sentinel-1 monitors land and sea in all weather conditions, day and night, with its radar capabilities; Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 acquire optical imagery at high resolution over land and coastal waters; Sentinel-4 and Sentinel-5 are dedicated to meteorology and climatology missions; and Sentinel-6 monitors the planet’s oceans. Thales Alenia Space is prime contractor for Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-3, in charge of the Sentinel-2 image ground segment and contributes to the imager-spectrometer on Sentinel-5P and the Poseidon-4 radar altimeter for Sentinel-6.

In 2020, we were also chosen for five of the six new Copernicus Expansion missions, three as prime contractor—CIMR, ROSE-L and CHIME—and payload supplier on two other missions—CO2M and CRISTAL. These new satellites will measure human-induced carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere, gauge the thickness of ice fields and snow cover, support advanced new services for the sustainable management of agriculture and biodiversity, observe sea-surface temperature and salinity and the density of ice fields, and bolster land-monitoring and emergency management services. All in all, we are involved in 11 of the 12 Copernicus missions.

As a world leader in altimetry and a major partner on the most iconic international oceanography missions, Thales Alenia Space teams are also working on the French-American oceanography satellite SWOT (Surface Water Ocean Topography), which will revolutionize modern oceanography and continental hydrology by detecting ocean features with 10 times better resolution than current technologies.

Satellite technologies and the space economy are two of today’s most important drivers to meet the United Nations’ 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) – and also achieve the objectives of the European Green Deal and PNRR. Hard to believe? Not at all, if you think about the wide range of applications, from the creation of land coverage maps to develop climate models, to multispectral and radar images to build predictive models on deforestation, to the creation of probability maps on landslide-prone areas and the monitoring of pollution levels or dune formation in the desert.

Space-based research could also play an important role in the digital and ecological transition, sustainable mobility, inclusion and health. New satcom infrastructures will in fact be central to the development of telecommunications, quantum cryptography and telemedicine. In addition, protecting our planet and the ecological transition require advanced space observation applications , while intelligent mobility and autonomous driving can only be developed with satellite positioning and geolocation systems.

""There can be no Plan B because there is no planet B""

Ban Ki-moon, the United Nations Secretary-General at the time, said this back in 2013 and it echoes even more strongly today.

Global warming continues to be everybody’s concern, as we strive to safeguard our one and only planet. There is hope, because we have the technological solutions needed to cope with the impact of global warming, while also protecting people across the world. And satellites are more than ever a critical part of this equation.

In a nutshell, Thales Alenia Space’s Space for Life vision inspires our actions in favor of a sustainable Earth and sustainable space. We are very proud to make an active contribution to the sustainable use of space and to be an integral part of this collective endeavor, in conjunction with partners from the space ecosystem and beyond."
Eve's Future Air Taxi Will Boast Thales' Cutting-Edge Avionics and Electrical System - autoevolution,"Thu, 21 Apr 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hdXRvZXZvbHV0aW9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL2V2ZXMtZnV0dXJlLWFpci10YXhpLXdpbGwtYm9hc3QtdGhhbGVzLWN1dHRpbmctZWRnZS1hdmlvbmljcy1hbmQtZWxlY3RyaWNhbC1zeXN0ZW0tMTg2OTQzLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The urban air mobility (UAM) “revolution” is closer to becoming a reality. For these past couple of years, we’ve been hearing about different kinds of innovative eVTOLs (electric take-off and landing) from all over the world, but soon it will be time to see them in action. One of the players aiming for a top position is Eve Air Mobility, which recently established a very important partnership.

Embraer is a well-known name in the global aviation industry with a strong legacy, so it’s not surprising that it decided to establish an entire subsidiary dedicated to UAM a couple of years ago. Unlike other eVTOL makers, Eve Air Mobility has revealed very little about its future aircraft but was focused more on establishing acquisition collaborations across the globe. Indeed, it was successful at it, and Eve air taxis will soon be operating in various parts of the world.But the company’s most recent partnership has to do with the aircraft’s development and is a major one. Thales, the reputable technology specialist, will provide its expertise for developing the Eve eVTOL ’s avionics, electrical system, flight control, navigation, and communication.The collaboration includes a complex series of joint studies related to the technical and economic feasibility of all-electric aircraft . The studies began in January this year and will continue over the course of 12 months. Eve’s team will work mainly with the Thales Technological Space Centre in Sao José dos Campos, as well as its avionics center in Sao Bernardo do Campo, which was recently established. But Thales engineers in other countries will also provide their support to the project.Eve has already secured hundreds of orders, including in the U.S., where the regional airline Republic Airlines is gearing up to operate these eVTOLs in Boston, New York, and Washington D.C. The airline will even provide training for future eVTOL specialists at its school for pilots and technicians, called the Leadership In Flight Training (LIFT) Academy, in Indianapolis."
Arabsat orders first fully software-defined satellite - SpaceNews,"Fri, 29 Apr 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9hcmFic2F0LW9yZGVycy1maXJzdC1mdWxseS1zb2Z0d2FyZS1kZWZpbmVkLXNhdGVsbGl0ZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"TAMPA, Fla. — Saudi Arabian fleet operator Arabsat has ordered its first fully software-defined geostationary satellite to provide flexible coverage across the Middle East, Africa and parts of Europe.

The company said April 29 it signed a contract for Arabsat 7A with Europe’s Thales Alenia Space, which will build the satellite based on its Space Inspire platform.

Although launch plans were not disclosed, the companies said Arabsat-7A will replace the bulk of the existing C and Ku-band capacity at 30.5 East on Arabsat 5A, which was launched in 2010 with 15-years of expected operational life.

Arabsat 7A will also have extra high-throughput Ku-band capacity to help the company expand services in markets including government and military, mobility, enterprise and oil and gas.

Arabsat currently operates 10 satellites across four orbital positions. Its Arabsat 6A satellite is co-located with Arabsat 5A at 30.5 East, which Arabsat describes as its “data hotspot.”

Unlike traditional “bent pipe” GEO satellites, software-defined communication payloads can be reprogrammed in orbit to adapt to different areas and markets as demand changes.

They are increasingly being ordered by GEO operators in response to industry uncertainty as existing and planned megaconstellations in low Earth orbit (LEO) disrupt the market.

Hadi Alhassani, Arabsat’s vice president and chief strategy officer, said March 21 during a Satellite 2022 panel that flexible GEO satellites are the answer to “the LEO constellation competition.”

“You’re going to see more and more ‘flex sat’ orders this year and the following years,” he said.

According to research from Euroconsult, software-defined satellites made up more than 80% of GEO high-throughput satellite orders in 2021.

Only one of the five GEO orders Thales Alenia Space announced in 2021 was for a fully software-defined satellite.

However, all four GEO orders the manufacturer has announced so far this year have been for software-defined satellites.

The latest was announced March 28 when SES ordered SES-26, which the operator expects will launch in 2024 or 2025 to extend content and connectivity services across Europe, Africa and Asia."

Successful live-fire demo of Rheinmetall Mission Master SP and Thales 70mm guided rockets - Defence Procurement International,"Thu, 07 Apr 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZWZlbmNlcHJvY3VyZW1lbnRpbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xhbmQvbGl2ZS1maXJlLWRlbW8tb2YtcmhlaW5tZXRhbGwtbWlzc2lvbi1tYXN0ZXItc3AtYW5kLXRoYWxlcy03MC1tbS1ndWlkZWQtcm9ja2V0c9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Rheinmetall’s Mission Master Autonomous Unmanned Ground Vehicle has successfully completed a live-fire demo using Thales 70mm guided rockets.

The demonstration for six European allies took place at the Trängslet base of the Swedish procurement agency Försvarets Materielverk (FMV) near Älvdalen. Delegations from Belgium, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, the Netherlands and Poland were present. The Rheinmetall Mission Master SP is part of the Autonomous Unmanned Ground Vehicle (A-UGV) family developed by Rheinmetall Canada.

The Rheinmetall Mission Master SP – Fire Support was equipped with a Rheinmetall Fieldranger Multi remotely controlled weapon station armed with two seven-tube 70mm rocket launchers from Thales Belgium.

For the demonstration, the A-UGV fired Thales' FZ275 70mm laser-guided rockets (LGRs) at a 4x4 vehicle located 4 km away from the firing point. The FZ275 LGR is the lightest and longest range 70 mm/2.75-inch LGR in its class, which Rheinmetall says delivers “metric precision and accuracy.”



The demonstration marked the culmination of the successful qualification process for the Fieldranger Multi equipped with the Thales 70 mm rocket launcher. Previously limited to aircraft, these area saturation and precise strike applications can engage stationary and mobile targets at ranges of up to 7 km with minimal collateral damage. They are now qualified for use with the Mission Master A-UGV. Moreover, the new configuration is now ready to be integrated into other types of platforms and armoured vehicles.



This only represents one of many possible configurations for the Mission Master SP – Fire Support. Featuring a fully modular architecture, the A-UGV can also be equipped with other weapon systems: 12.7 mm calibre machine guns, a Dillon Aero M134D gun, or 40 mm grenade launchers.



Rheinmetall and Thales both stressed the critical importance of the human-in-the-loop configuration, meaning that the operator has complete control of the weapon system from target acquisition to final fire authorisation.

"Wynn Audio with Thales, Kalista, Vimberg, Karan Acoustics: Stereo with Style - Stereophile Magazine","Sat, 23 Apr 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0ZXJlb3BoaWxlLmNvbS9jb250ZW50L3d5bm4tYXVkaW8tYXhwb25h0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It's showtime again! With a business and showroom in Toronto, Wynn Wong's Wynn Audio is a next-generation dealer and distributor for a number of luxe European high-design high-end brands, a few of which had new product introductions at AXPONA. Wynn's preferred equipment leans toward striking and colorful rather than gaudy or blingy.

Swiss analog manufacturer Thales has launched a new brand, X-Quisite. Here, the X-Quisite Fire MC cartridge ($11,400) with gold coils was introduced in the active setup. Its patented design uses a single piece of ceramicthey call it monobloc-ceramicfor the cantilever and coil body construction. Besides the ceramic's material properties, this approach also minimizes cantilever vibration by removing the jointthe point of highest load, according to Thalesthat's found in most stylus-cantilever assemblies made of other materials. The body is finished in a special heat-treated titanium for a cool-looking iridescent effect. The Swiss-made cartridge was fitted to a bright teal Thales Simplicity II tonearm on a Thales TTT-Compact II turntable (above).

Visitors were welcomed by an active-but-silent demo in a display case outside Wynn's large Utopia C exhibit room at the Renaissance Schaumberg: a Thales Slim II turntable with Simplicity II tonearm (below) moving back and forth in a special record's grooves to show how the headshell shifts to maintain the correct the correct angle/tangency as the stylus tracks across the record side. This results in more precise tracking for playbackthe reported tracking error is specified at a maximum of 0.006°. In the active system, LP playback sounded silky-smooth and steady.

On the digital side, Wynn debuted the shiny, new Kalista DreamPlay X CD/SACD transport (pictured at the top) and network streamer with wired (LAN/Ethernet) or wireless (Wi-Fi with antenna) connectivity. It has no DAC onboard but a second ""DreamPlay XC"" version with an onboard DAC and digital preamp is coming soon, Wynn said. Both ship with a large, vertical outboard power supply that looks more like a computer. The proprietary streaming platform is Audirvana-ready and offers optional upsampling for PCM up to 24/192 over AES3 and S/PDIF, and DSD 256 playback over HDMI/i2S output. Control is via an included remote or the round touchscreen on front. I only toyed with it a little, but its interface seemed intuitive and elegant, with rotary dial effects in digital. Alas, high design often comes with high pricing: The DreamPlay X retails for a cool $68,800.

The French company Métronome Technologie that makes Métronome modern-styled components also manufactures their high-design high-end Kalista brand's products. On static display in a case was another Kalista debut: their first turntable, which will retail for $54,000.

Silver-woven wires from Netherlands-based Crystal Cable graced another display casein this uh, case, the new Crystal Cable Art Series cables, which are replacing the Dream Series. The active demo system also featured that new Art Series cabling that contains a new conductive material called Infinite Crystal Silver (iCS). As always, they look as pretty as jewelryand it seems they sound pretty damn good too.

Karan Acoustics supplied the system's amplification: a LineA preamplifier ($41,000) and a pair of PowerA monoblocks ($106,000) outputting a mighty 2100W into 8 ohms; it comes with Critical Mass Systems' Center Stage footers. This much power needs some grounding (especially in hotel conditions). A new flagship from Sweden, the Entreq Olympus Hero ground box ($18,000), filled that niche. It looks like a basic wooden box but...There are 10 binding posts on the back to connect individual components for grounding. Its job is to provide some power conditioningas in removal of noisebut without interfering with or adding possible sonic effects to other components. And inside? It's rather mysterious but Wynn told me there are a mix of metals inside: copper, silver, gold, and tungsten.

Finally, at the end of the active system's chain were lime-green Vimberg Mino D speakersD stands for the diamond tweeter upgrade. (John Atkinson reviewed the same Vimberg Mino speakers, except with the regular ceramic tweeter.) Vimberg is a sub-brand under the Tidal loudspeaker marque; their products are made in Germany. I always remember the Vimberg cabinets' leaning-back slope. But they sounded anything but laid-back on some punchy jazz cornet and sax tracks. More expansive soundstaging sprung to life on a couple of cuts from my Portishead Roseland NYC Live LP. A fine demo that is bound to get even better with some settling in as the show goes on."

Omnispace and Thales Ale nia Space have announced that Omnispace Spark-1 was successfully delivered into orbit aboard the SpaceX Transporter-4.

The Omnispace Spark programme represents phase one in the development and delivery of the world’s first standards-based global hybrid network.

Thales Alenia Space designed and built the satellite, part of the initial two-satellite Omnispace Spark programme. The new-generation NGSO satellite in low-earth orbit (LEO) will operate in the 2 GHz S-band. Omnispace Spark will support the mobile industry 3GPP standard in-band n256, making connectivity possible direct to compatible devices. This programme will serve to advance the development and implementation of Omnispace’s global hybrid non-terrestrial (NTN) network.

Speaking about the launch, Ram Viswanathan, president and CEO of Omnispace LLC, said: “Omnispace is reinventing mobile communications by building a global hybrid network that will benefit users requiring true mobility, everywhere. We are pleased with the work that Thales Alenia Space, together with its world-class team of innovators, have done to design and build Omnispace Spark. With their help, we are making our vision of a single, ubiquitous, global hybrid network possible.”

Hervé Derrey, CEO of Thales Alenia Space, added: “I’m very excited about the successful launch of Spark-1, a nanosatellite we built in conjunction with NanoAvionics, Syrlinks & ANYWAVES. This achievement reflects our ability to develop new space solutions in partnership with innovative SMEs to address market needs. We are convinced that merging flight-proven expertise with agility is the key to successfully matching the evolving space demand.”

Spark-1 was delivered into orbit aboard a SpaceX Transporter. Exolaunch provided launch, mission management, integration and deployment services.

Led by prime contractor, Thales Alenia Space, the Omnispace Spark programme includes industry partners, NanoAvionics providing the satellites buses, launch support and in-orbit operations, ANYWAVES the payloads user antennas and Syrlinks the S-band instruments for the payloads.

Vytenis J. Buzas, founder and CEO of NanoAvionics, stated: “The successful launch of Omnispace Spark-1 also signifies a successful collaboration between the NewSpace and traditional space, resulting in our great technological exchange with Thales Alenia Space. It is fair to say that both companies had to adjust their processes and find a mutual middle ground. From working with a traditional satellite prime contractor, we gained valuable experience and were able to further improve our reliability assurance processes and our technical performance. On the other side, we hope that Thales Alenia Space was able to benefit from our modular technology and the agility levels we provide.”

Nicolas CAPET, CEO of ANYWAVES, commented: “After demonstrating our capacity to provide COTS antennas, we are today very proud to show our capability regarding payload ones. Supporting major space projects, such as Omnispace Spark, alongside with Thales Alenia Space, is also another source of great pride for ANYWAVES.”

Eric Pinson, Director of Space activity at Syrlinks, noted: “We are very proud to have been involved in the development of the first phase of this Internet Of Things (IoT) satellite constellation. We would like to thank Thales Alenia Space for having relied on Syrlinks for the design of a specific New-Space Radio-Frequency Payload equipment with the capability to receive, process and transmit IoT dedicated signals.”

5G capability from a single global network will serve as the communications infrastructure to support the economies of the 21st century. The network will empower mobile network operators and value-added resellers to fuel innovation, power industries, and connect billions of users."

In recognition of this, Thales Australia recently signed a second Galuwa Indigenous Engineering Scholarship with the University of Technology Sydney (UTS). The scholarship will provide one committed First Nations student with the opportunity to study engineering, gain industry exposure and realise their personal potential.

The UTS Galuwa program takes its name from the Gadigal language, in which Galuwa means ‘to climb.’ The program enables Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander secondary school students from across the country to gain an insight into life as a university student, the potential careers available and the support provided, whereas the scholarship focuses on providing mentoring, financial assistance and internships to students studying at UTS.

Our Avionics business within Digital Systems has been a key sponsor of the Galuwa program since 2018 and in 2021 we welcomed our first Thales Galuwa Indigenous Engineering scholarship recipient, Connor Higgins; a young Wiradjuri man. Connor has since completed an internship within our Australia Munitions business at Benalla and is fast on the way to realising his dream of becoming an engineer.

Both Phil Swadling, Technical Director – Avionics and Michael Otero, General Manager Avionics were at the recent Thales and UTS scholarship signing, and hope the next recipient is equally successful with their aspirations. As Phil points out, it’s not just the student who benefits from the scholarship – for Thales it’s a chance to attract future talent, build a more diverse and inclusive workplace culture and improve cultural awareness amongst our employees.

Thales’ participation in the program has seen us host Galuwa students to give them a view of the careers available. It’s also one of the many ways Thales is able to build links to indigenous communities and give our staff an opportunity to learn more about the issues facing indigenous people across Australia."" Philip Swadling, Technical Director - Avionics at Thales Australia & NZ.

Thales’ sponsorship of the Galuwa program is one of many important partnerships created to achieve our organisation’s Reconciliation Action Plan goal of creating meaningful change in the lives of First Nations peoples, businesses and communities.

To that end, the two companies will demonstrate and validate computing technologies and capabilities in orbit aboard the International Space Station (ISS) in 2023.

Thales Alenia Space architects design and deliver high-tech solutions for telecommunications, navigation, Earth observation, environmental management, exploration, science and orbital infrastructure. They have built modules for the International Space Station.

Just one year ago, on April 6, 2021, Thales Alenia Space and Microsoft announced their decision to innovate together in the field of satellite-based cloud technologies, by adding the DeeperVision automated image processing solution, developed by Thales Alenia Space, to Microsoft’s Azure Orbital platform. This partnership combined DeeperVision’s capabilities to process data streams and generate timely information with Azure Orbital’s cloud capabilities. The insights are powered by high-speed, high-volume artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML).

Demonstrating the benefits of Space Edge Computing

This new collaboration aims to provide advanced connectivity, analytics and computation in space through Space Edge Computing. In 2023, the companies will demonstrate and validate the technologies and computing capabilities in orbit on the ISS. Thales Alenia Space will deploy a powerful in-orbit computer, an in-orbit application framework, and high-performance Earth observation sensors to develop new applications for processing climate data in orbit to benefit the sustainability of our planet.

Researchers from Thales Alenia Space and Microsoft Research will work in the fields of remote sensing, computer vision and climate science to demonstrate the potential of next-generation on-orbit computing for Earth observation. With this edge-of-space computing capability, Earth observation information will be delivered directly and immediately applicable for monitoring, understanding and protecting our planet.

Space Edge Computing demonstration on the ISS



Thales Alenia Space will deploy an enhanced space edge computing payload running Azure onboard the International Space Station. Thales Alenia Space in Spain will be responsible for the development and delivery of the payload to the ISS, while Microsoft will be responsible for the on-orbit software framework and the Space Software Development Kit (SDK). The on-orbit testbed will include onboard hardware developed by Thales Alenia Space in Spain as well as data collection sensor systems. This demonstration will enable application developers to easily develop and deploy Earth observation data processing applications on a real working environment, at the crossroads of the space and cloud worlds.

Democratizing space observation

The electronic surveillance system is being delivered for the Joint Fire Support Team, schwer (JFSTsw), a new variant of the Boxer that will be built using the Boxer A2 drive module (in service with Bundeswehr) but with a new mission module.

One of the new sub-systems that will be integrated is the PAAG, which is remotely controlled from inside the Boxer and gives users a stabilized long-range ‘detection, recognition, identification’ (DRI) and weapon aiming ability on the move during daylight and night conditions.

Equipped with a thermal imaging device and high-resolution daylight color camera, the system can identify targets in the range of up to four kilometers, depending on their size. In continuous operation, the entire hemisphere around the vehicle can be covered.

A laser rangefinder offers measuring distances of up to ten kilometers, Thales says. It can also be raised above the vehicle roof to allow the monitoring of targets from behind a ridgeline without putting the user in a direct line of sight.

An automatic video tracking (AVT) and assisted target detection (ATD) is also included in the JFST PAAG system.

Another new system that will be featured on the vehicle is the NATO generic vehicle architecture (NGVA) network, which will allow a deeper integration level of the new sub systems. NGVA is a NATO standardization agreement based on open standards to design and integrate multiple electronic sub-systems onto military vehicles – intended to create standards for land systems vehicle architecture to become more sustainable and given a longer lifespan.

The JFST program in Germany will see the delivery of two prototype JFST-heavy vehicles.

JFSTsw will be joining over 400 Boxer vehicles already in German Army service either as armored personnel carriers, medical treatment vehicles, command vehicles, or driver training vehicles."

By Chris Jenkins, CEO Thales Australia

Covid has delivered a sobering reminder that industrial capability considered optional in a world of ‘just in time’ global supply chains can suddenly become essential to have in-country.

Put simply, borders matter. Whether it’s medical or military equipment, the ability to manufacture and maintain in Australia is the key to sovereign industrial capability.

The upside is that a renewed national appreciation of the value of deep in-country industrial capability underpinning essential services has been accelerated by the pandemic.

The benefits of identifying and developing these key capabilities will flow for generations to come.

This is as true in Defence industry as other critical areas of supply.

The Government’s focus on long range strike and deterrence is backed by the big ambition to develop a sovereign guided weapons manufacturing capability.

As with any sovereign capability it won’t be conjured from a glossy brochure – it requires a disciplined focus on real capability, collaboration across an industrial ecosystem and enterprise commitments over generations.

Australia can achieve a sovereign guided weapons manufacturing capability, and sooner than many think, precisely because there has been decades of research, development and industrialisation of key enabling capabilities, including in the domain of energetic materials.

Thales Australia and the Defence Science and Technology group recently marked 25 years of a Strategic Research and Development Alliance with a focus on munitions and energetic materials.

Under the Alliance DST scientists and Thales engineers have collaborated on state of the art developments in munitions, new manufacturing technology for energetic materials and new product concepts.

Recently the RAAF started using the first Australian-manufactured munitions for the Joint Strike Fighter – just one of the success stories from this long collaboration.

In fact there is a continuous story of Australian guided weapons manufacture stretching back 70 years, and including IKARA, Penguin and right to the present day, the Nulka decoy."

With a common ambition to deliver reliable and sustainable rail journeys, Thales and SMRT Trains recently inked a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to collaborate and leverage digital technologies such as data analytics to enhance rail maintenance and operations on the nation’s oldest MRT lines – the North-South and East-West lines, including the Tuas West Extension.

Under the MoU, both parties will share engineering knowledge and rail expertise in various areas, and leverage digital technologies such as data analytics and Artificial Intelligence to unleash the full potential of the diagnostic data readily available within the existing signalling and rail systems. By efficiently mining such data, including train control, supervision and radio communication diagnostic data, SMRT can benefit from greater efficiencies in the maintenance of the trains and systems: (1) The time needed to analyse and identify the root cause of potential faults will be reduced. (2) Automatic fault diagnosis will be enabled for accurate and timely data-driven maintenance. (3) Reliability can be enhanced with faults pre-empted.

To ensure that the collaboration remains focused on real challenges and pain points of the end-user, the SMRT engineering teams will bring common problem statements to be addressed from a rail operator’s perspective, which both teams can work on. Thales brings its expertise as a technology partner with its in-depth knowledge in Communications-Based Train Control (CBTC) signalling and rail control systems, and best practices in data analytics technologies.

Witnessed by the Chairmen of both organisations, Mr Patrice Caine of Thales Group and Mr Seah Moon Ming of SMRT, the signing ceremony also marked the 10th anniversary of the collaboration between Thales and SMRT Trains. Their decade-long journey saw the implementation of the renowned SelTracTM CBTC signalling system for the North-South and East-West line, and has forged a close understanding and cooperation between both organisations where they worked as a team to provide reliable journeys to Singapore’s rail commuters. This renewed collaboration underscores the strong partnership between Thales and SMRT Trains, and reaffirms Thales’ position as a world-leading rail solutions provider.

As well as other models of equipment and weapons that can strengthen our position. If you have the opportunity, Ukraine will be grateful to you.

Thales Bushmaster of the Australian Defence Force (Picture source: ADF)

On April 1, Brendan Nicholson and Marcus Hellyer report that Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Foreign Minister Marise Payne, representing Defence Minister Peter Dutton in a Senate estimate hearing, indicate that Bushmasters would be sent to Ukraine. A RAAF C-17 Globemaster II transport aircraft can carry four Bushmasters. An air bridge using the C-17s could get a meaningful number to Europe within a matter of weeks. The resourceful Ukrainians could master their operation very quickly, Brendan Nicholson and Marcus Hellyer write. Since the Netherlands already has nearly 100 Bushmasters, it’s a potential area for cooperation between two Western democracies eager to demonstrate their support for Ukraine. The Dutch, as Europe’s major Bushmaster operator, could potentially provide forward logistics and training support, for example.

In the role they were designed for, Bushmasters would be a useful, but not game-changing, capability for Ukraine. As protected mobility vehicles, they safeguard their occupants against mines, IEDs, small arms like machine guns, and artillery blast and fragmentation. They could move forces around rear areas, or potentially evacuate non-combatants from besieged cities. They won’t protect against a direct hit from a tank, howitzer or anti-tank missile, all of which Russia has in abundance.

The daily grind of war will take its toll on the vehicles. Australia will need to provide training in their maintenance and an ongoing, liberal supply of spares. How to sustain a logistics chain to Bushmasters scattered across Ukraine is anyone’s guess. But the Ukrainians have shown themselves to be adept at putting all kinds of equipment from around the world into service.

More than 1,000 Bushmasters have been delivered to the Australian Army and to Royal Australian Air Force airfield defence guards. In all, 116 Bushmasters have been sold to the Netherlands. Thirty were sold to the UK for its Special Air Service Regiment and it used some of those in Syria and Iraq.

If providing Bushmasters to Ukraine proves successful, the next step could be to provide Abrams tanks, as commentators quickly proposed in the wake of Zelensky’s speech to parliament, Brendan Nicholson and Marcus Hellyer report. Australia hasn’t deployed its tanks since the Vietnam War and, as Zelensky said, it’s better for equipment to be put into service against Russia than sit around in parks. Moreover, Australia has new Abrams tanks on order as replacements for its fleet of 59 older-generation Abrams. Certainly, providing a tank capability would be a major step up in terms of training and logistics requirements compared to Bushmasters and would need careful planning. So, rather than sending them straight to Ukraine, providing them to Poland (which has also ordered Abrams from the US) to free up its Soviet-era tanks for Ukraine could be an option, Brendan Nicholson and Marcus Hellyer comment."

“BMD-4s began to be produced and entered service with the Russian army in 2015-16. That is, about two years after the start of the war in Ukraine and the imposition of sanctions that prohibited the sale of military technology to the aggressor country … The most interesting thing here is the fire control system, which allows you to shoot accurately regardless of the weather and time of day. The components and technologies of this system were sold to the Russian Federation by French company Thales under license. That is, according to French drawings and components purchased from France.

Thales worked with partner companies in the French defence industrial and technological base (BITD) to develop this French-designed mini-UAS and contribute to France’s national sovereignty.

With the Spy’Ranger 330 system, the armed forces have access to the most innovative imaging technologies available on the market.

Spy’Ranger 330 @Thales

PARIS, France, 20 April 2022 -/African Media Agency(AMA)/- The Spy’Ranger 330 in service with the French Army as part of the SMDR programme has obtained its first type certification by the French defence procurement agency’s airworthiness authority, testifying to the system’s proven performance in combat situations. Type certification guarantees the airworthiness of the SMDR and enables the Army to use its mini-UAS systems for instruction, training and operational deployments without obtaining specific flight approvals.

“The Spy’Ranger 330 system was designed, developed and put into industrial production for the French defence procurement agency’s SMDR programme by an ecosystem of French companies specialising in light unmanned air systems for front-line forces. With three times the range capabilities of its predecessor, the DRAC the SMDR system brings the French Army a new, strategically important capability.

The Spy’Ranger 330 mini-UAS and the Spy’Ranger 550 tactical mini-UAS are part of the same family of systems and rely on many of the same building bricks. The Spy’Ranger family is designed to meet the requirements of front-line and reconnaissance units engaged in overseas theatres of operations, offering them a single system that combines a number of key sub-systems to support and provide an image intelligence capability for front-line units: a robust, long-endurance air vehicle designed to operate in difficult environmental conditions, an imaging system to contribute to tactical superiority, a secure datalink and an easy-to-operate command-and-control (C2) system.

The SMDR air vehicle can fly for nearly three hours in a radius of 30 km and the system brings the armed forces access to a number of major technological innovations. Key components of the SMDR system include a multi-sensor (EO and IR) high-definition optronics payload, which is mounted in the Spy’Ball gyrostabilised gimbal and uses high-performance image processing techniques developed for combat aircraft pods such as the Rafale’s TALIOS system, the Micro-TMA secure high-speed datalink, and the combat-proven Spy’C command-and-control system. The electrically powered Spy’Ranger 330 air vehicle has an innovative architecture and is made of carbon fibre for low weight and added robustness.The SMDR programme has demonstrated the complexity of developing a mini-UAS system for military requirements, in particular in terms of survivability, resistance to cyberattacks and electromagnetic threats, and the ability to operate in harsh environmental conditions (rain, wind, sand, dust, etc.).As programme prime contract, Thales guarantees a high level of safety, security and airworthiness for the SMDR system, which opens a new chapter in the sovereign unmanned flight capabilities of the French forces. Since December 2020, the French Army has operated the SMDR in Mali as part of Operation Barkhane and has been fully satisfied by its performance. Operating in daylight and at night, the SMDR system has contributed to the success of military operations on a routine basis, helping to provide force protection and keep soldiers safe, and consolidating Thales’s role as a key player in the French mini-UAS ecosystem.

“Thales and the members of the French mini-UAS ecosystem are trusted partners of the armed forces and the French defence procurement agency on the SMDR programme. To step up to the challenges of the return of high-intensity conflict, Thales is drawing on the innovative potential of this ecosystem, the technical and industrial capabilities it has developed for the SMDR programme, and other strategic partnerships to ensure that France secures its access to these critical technologies.” Benoit Plantier, Vice President, Optronics and Missile Electronics, Thales

~

Press Release, Paris,29 Apr 2022: Thales and CS GROUP are working with their partners in France and Europe’s defence industrial and technological base on developing PARADE (Programme de protection Protection déployAble modulaiRe Anti-DronEs / Deployable, Modular, Anti-Drone Countermeasures Protection Programme) capability to provide permanent deployable protection for critical infrastructure from drone threats. The programme [which] follows an open competition contract was awarded after a European competitive tendering process launched by the DGA in 2021 to strengthen the drone countermeasures (Counter-UAV) capabilities of the French armed forces.

Millions of new drones will enter the skies over the next 20 years, creating an extremely complex aviation ecosystem and raising significant safety and security challenges. To address this constantly evolving threat environment, the consortium led by Thales and CS GROUP will provide a scalable, modular, multi-mission drone countermeasures system to protect people, fixed military sites or facilities deployed abroad. The system can also be used by the armed forces to help protect events, people and civil and military infrastructure, in particular during large gatherings. PARADE will be a modular, multi-mission system that can be deployed by the armed forces on a temporary basis to protect a fixed site or as part of military operations overseas.

Drone countermeasures are a priority for the French government as the preparations for the Paris 2024 Olympics continue. The partnership between Thales, a recognised player in civil and military air operations for over 40 years, and CS GROUP, an integrator of critical drone countermeasures systems in France, is an integral part fully aligned with the missions conducted under the country’s special air security arrangements (DPSA – Dispositif Particulier de Sureté Aérienne / Special Air Security Arrangements) designed to provide enhanced protection during sensitive events. PARADE will provide additional detection and response capabilities for the DPSA, improving security for two forthcoming international sporting events due to take place in France: – the 2023 Rugby World Cup and the 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games – for which drone countermeasures are a government priority.

The contract initially first order calls for the acquisition of six PARADE drone countermeasures systems. With contributions from French SMEs such as CerbAir, Exavision and MC2 Technologies, as well as the Dutch company Robin, the PARADE system will provide decision support and, analysis of complex situations and the capability to neutralise micro-drones and mini-drones. The programme contract also includes operator training and system/ and equipment maintenance and upgrades.

The PARADE system provides permanent 360° site protection and is designed for easy transport from one site to another by road, air or sea, considerably increasing its scope of use and speed of deployment. This solution could also be used for combined civil-military operations, for example to protect critical infrastructure such as military bases in France or in overseas theatres of operations. The first PARADE systems will be delivered to the DGA within a year of the launch of the programme.

As an expert in air supremacy, Thales offers integrated solutions to protect airspace, citizens and infrastructure, and will draw on its experience as a systems integrator and its know-how in air defence, cybersecurity and digital architectures. CS GROUP is a pioneer in drone countermeasures and has deployed operational solutions to meet civilian as well as military requirements since 2016. The company develops modular, scalable, interoperable, cybersecure systems built around a command and control capability that uses artificial intelligence and data fusion technologies to provide a clearer understanding of this constantly evolving threat.

“Thales’s drone countermeasures solutions ensure safety and security at all levels of military and civil airspace. The expertise and experience of our industry ecosystem and our partnerships with French SMEs offer real opportunities for us to innovate and further enhance our value proposition. The consortium led by Thales and CS GROUP enables us to offer a drone countermeasures solution that meets the requirements of the DGA and the French armed forces and ensures the highest level of safety and security for people in large gatherings.” Thomas Got, Managing Director, Integrated Airspace Protection Systems, Thales.

“CS GROUP has been involved in drone countermeasures for over eight years and actively monitors the latest technological advances in order to respond effectively to the evolving drone threat and meet the related operational requirements, from large-scale event security to counter-terrorism and protection for troops on overseas deployments abroad. The partnership between CS GROUP and Thales provides a comprehensive vision of air security at all levels to guarantee permanent situational awareness and determine the best way to respond to threats. We are very proud that our consortium has been selected for the PARADE programme and that our solution will be helping to keep people safe at major events.” Marie de Saint Salvy, Deputy Chief Executive Officer, CS Group.

US Navy to End Raytheon VDS Sonar Development - The Defense Post,"Tue, 05 Apr 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRlZmVuc2Vwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzA0LzA1L3VzLW5hdnktcmF5dGhlb24tdmRzLXNvbmFyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The US Navy is ending work with Raytheon Technologies to develop a sonar for its littoral combat ships (LCS) and frigates. Instead, it will procure the Thales CAPTAS-4, a sonar used by navies worldwide.

Raytheon’s AN/SQS-62 variable depth sonar (VDS) or Dual-mode Array Transmitter was a final component of the LCS anti-submarine warfare mission package. It was to be equipped on all the service’s Constellation-class guided-missile frigates currently under development.

However, after years of testing, the navy could not incorporate the sonar onto its Freedom-class littoral combat ships as expected.

Though the sonar system successfully tracked a submarine during trials, it had hydrodynamic stability and transducer reliability problems. The navy worked with Raytheon to address the issues, but the system could not meet the service’s expectations.

CAPTAS-4 to Replace Raytheon’s Sonar

Set to replace Raytheon’s Sonar, Thales’ CAPTAS-4 is widely used by anti-submarine warfare frigates, including the Royal Navy Type 23 and Type 26 class, French Navy FREMM and FDI class, the Spanish F110s, and Italian FREMMs.

The sonar system was chosen because of its proven performance and superior technical readiness, which lowers the risk of integrating it into the navy’s undersea warfare combat system.

The Thales sonar system was integrated and tested from 2010 to 2012 as part of the Advanced Demonstration Model for the navy’s littoral combat ships program.

Currently, 80 CAPTAS systems are in service worldwide.

VDS Deal

The navy announced its acceptance of the Raytheon VDS in December 2018. The system is a modular, single-tow sonar that speeds detection, discrimination, and engagement of undersea threats.

Due to its small size and lightweight design, it frees up space and manpower aboard vessels.

Frigates need a VDS system to operate in challenging environments to detect, locate, and identify a broad range of submarines, unmanned underwater vehicles, and other underwater objects."
A broken embargo. How Russia circumvents sanctions on weapons imports - Ukrainska Pravda,"Mon, 25 Apr 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnByYXZkYS5jb20udWEvZW5nL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjIvMDQvMjUvNzM0MTk1Ni_SAUNodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcmF2ZGEuY29tLnVhL2VuZy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIyLzA0LzI1LzczNDE5NTYvaW5kZXguYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Sanctions against Russia and its military-industrial complex in 2014 turned out to be very weak. The Russians сircumvented them, and the United States and EU countries ""did not notice"" the loopholes and continued to cooperate with the aggressor.

For eight years, nothing prevented the occupier from equipping its tanks, planes, ships, and military vehicles with Western materiel and preparing for a new major massacre in central Europe.

Only now are Western countries beginning to take the first steps to close loopholes for Russia's military industry, which has already taken the lives of tens of thousands of Ukrainians.

Equipment with Western ""filling"" that kills Ukrainians

Russia's military-industrial complex (MIC) is not self-sufficient. Most of the occupying country’s military equipment contains components from ""unfriendly countries"". Russian drones would be a good example, as they are actually being built for Russia by the whole world.

Thus, the ""Orlan-10"" drone contains a GPS module made by the Swiss company U-blox, an engine by the Japanese SAITO, a starter-generator from American Texas Instruments Incorporated and a flight controller made by the French-Italian STMicroelectronics.

The ""Forpost"" drone is a copy of the Israeli IAI Searcher. ""Forposts"" are assembled at the ""Ural Civil Aviation Plant"" using Israeli technology and American and German spare parts.

Israeli IAI Searcher and its twin made in Russia

Cooperation with the French electronics manufacturer Thales was also important for the Russian military-industrial complex. By 2020, more than a thousand Russian tanks had been modified by this company’s equipment.

In particular, Thales' Catherine FC thermal imager was used to create ESSA, PLISSA and Sosna-U targeting systems. They are mounted on modified tanks T-80, T-90 and T-72 and other combat vehicles.

Since 2009, these thermal imagers have been assembled in Russia at the ""Volga Optical-Mechanical Plant"", under a licensing agreement with the French manufacturer. The thermal imagers allow the gunner to see the enemy from a few kilometres away, even at night.

Tanks with French equipment were used during the invasion of Donbas in 2014. This is evidenced by a video from the inside of a Russian T-72, which the militants of the [self-proclaimed] ""LDPR"" [Luhansk and Donetsk People’s Republic] tried to pass off as a trophy. Tanks with similar equipment were seized during the Russian invasion in 2022.

Furthermore, French thermal imagers were found on Russian BMD-4 amphibious infantry fighting vehicles, which shot at civilian cars in Bucha.

According to the investigative journalist publication Disclose, Thales has also equipped 60 Russian SU-30SM fighters with the navigation systems. Aircraft with this modification fired on Syrian cities several years ago. In March of this year, several were shot down in the sky over the Ukrainian cities of Vasylkiv and Brovary.

The equipment even comes from Russia's main enemy country, the United States. Even though the Russians officially deny buying American weapons, components from the United States are often found in Russian technology.

The Russians don’t hide the fact that they put American Flir thermal imagers on small warships. Components from the United States are also used in the Russian ""Forpost"", ""Zastava"", ""Granat"" and ""Orlan-10"" drones, according to the Russian publication ""Military Review"".

KamAZ-65225 tractors run on American Cummins engines and on German ZF Friedrichshafen gearboxes. These trucks from the Russian car industry are used to transport ""Pantsir"" missile systems, tanks and artillery systems.

The Russian ""Lynx"" armoured car is actually an Italian Iveco LMV. According to the publication ""Russia Beyond"", hundreds of these cars were delivered to Russia at least until 2016. The Italians also sold rifles, pistols and ammunition to the occupiers a few months before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, according to an ""Investigate Europe"" investigation.

Avionics and aircraft engines are other loopholes. The Russians have problems supplying their own aircraft with components. They repeatedly tried to establish smuggling routes from Finland and Ukraine to supply modern combat aircrafts with imported spare parts.

Russian factories also use machines and consumables from Germany, the United States and Switzerland to be able to produce modern weapons. There are no analogues of these tools in Russia.

Broken sanctions

After the annexation of Crimea and occupation of part of Donbas in 2014, the European Union imposed sanctions on Russia and banned the export of weapons and ""dual-use goods"" (optics, electronics and other spare parts that can be used in armaments).

However, EU countries did not stop supplying weapons and components to the occupier. There were loopholes used by European companies.

The first loophole is that the text of the 2014 EU Council decision on sanctions against Russia has the following exception: the embargo does not apply to contracts concluded before Russia's invasion of Ukraine. This allowed weapons manufacturers to conclude additional agreements to previous contracts with Russia.

The second loophole refers to ""dual-use"" goods. On paper, supplying these to Russian military enterprises was prohibited, but in reality European spare parts and machines were regularly delivered to Russian military-industrial complex plants.

The sanctions imposed by the European Union in Council Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 contained another exception: a member state can issue an authorisation to export goods if it is confident that these goods will not be used for military purposes.

This vague wording allowed dual-use goods to be supplied to Russian intermediaries or distributors, who later resold them to military companies.

The European Council on Conventional Arms Exports has estimated that between 2015 and 2020, ten European Union countries exported arms to Russia worth €346 million. Germany and France used this loophole the most, accounting for 80% of all deliveries.

How Russians circumvent sanctions: examples

Case 1. The Russian Lipetsk Mechanical Plant (LMP) produces tractors for the S-300 anti-aircraft missile system. This enterprise was not under Western sanctions in 2014 and was free to negotiate with foreign companies.

From correspondence by the plant's top managers, which became public after having been hacked by the hacker group Anonymous, it was revealed that representatives of the Russian company were negotiating with foreign manufacturers on behalf of the Kalashnikov Concern, which was under EU sanctions.

The correspondence showed that the commercial director of the Russian Lipetsk Mechanical Plant, Dmitry Belykh, helped the Kalashnikov Concern to find a line for bullet production and even received a commercial offer from the Belgian manufacturer New Lachaussée.

The fragments of correspondence between LMP and Kalashnikov Concern that attest to this are reproduced below.

On 29 November 2021, Kseniya Grashenkova, Adviser to the Kalashnikov Purchasing Director, asked Dmitry Belykh to send commercial requests for the purchase of a bullet production line to a number of foreign companies: Atech (Turkey), Invernizzi Presse (Italy), Manhurin K’MX (France), New Lachaussée s.a. (Belgium) and Vasini (Italy).

Belykh reports to Grashenkova that he sent requests to the mentioned addressees.

The further correspondence is conducted under the following scheme - ""Kalashnikov Concern'' - ""Lipetsk Mechanical Plant"" - an international manufacturer. Most companies did not respond. The Italian Invernizzi Presse began negotiations, but later stopped communication.

However, on 3 December 2021, Belykh received a letter from a representative of the Belgian company New Lachaussee s.a., Igor Pozhivil. His contacts were forwarded to the Kalashnikov Concern by the commercial director of LMP.

This is followed by active correspondence between Belykh and a representative of New Lachaussée s.a., as a result of which the latter sent a confidential commercial offer for the bullet production line.

The proposal is addressed to the Tula Arms Factory and signed by the Belgian directors. The Tula plant is also an indirect member of the Russian state company Rostech, as is the Kalashnikov Concern.

Belykh sent all the information to Grashenkova of the Kalashnikov Concern.

Case 2. Information on how the Russian military-industrial complex buys Western equipment and components can also be found on the official website of Russian public procurement.

The team led by the Ukrainian businessman Dmytro Dubilet presented a public list of foreign companies whose products appeared in the tenders of companies associated with the Almaz-Antey concern of the Russian military-industrial complex.

The Russian Almaz-Antey concern has been producing anti-aircraft missiles and radar equipment for the Russian army, including the infamous ""Buk"" missile systems (C300, C400 and C500), and has also been under sanctions since 2014. Europeans are forbidden to trade with this company directly and indirectly, even through dealers.

However, the enterprises of this concern issue calls for tender for foreign manufacturers' products. Probably, the goods are first delivered to ""peaceful"" Russian companies, through which they are then delivered to the military.

For example, the concern needed a lubricating coolant for metalworking from the leading German manufacturer Techlube GmbH. According to public procurement, the call for tender by the concern was won by the little-known Russian limited company Quarta, which is not related to the military sector.

This is how Almaz-Antey closed tenders for equipment from the Swiss Blaser Swisslube, American Nvidia and Indium, German Zoller, Walter, and Techlube GmbH, and the British GARANT, and no sanctions prevented this happening.

Exports of dual-use goods in Russia are quite extensive. According to the publication Welt am Sonntag, in 2020, Germany alone issued 673 export licences to Russia for 366 million euros.

Some companies supplied goods for military use even without obtaining special licences. For example, the German Bosch company insisted that it had sold car equipment exclusively for peaceful purposes, but then its equipment was found on Russian infantry combat vehicles seized by the Ukrainian army.

Also, Russian military experts say that the gearbox from the German ZF Friedrichshafen has long been an indispensable component for the KamAZ-65225 military tractors, which transport heavy weapons.

What has been changed

Some of the mistakes made in 2014 were fixed during a new wave of sanctions. The EU has removed the loophole which allowed supplying weapons to Russia under old contracts, which was used by European manufacturers.

The list of companies associated with the Russian military-industrial complex has been expanded, sanctions have been tightened against them, and a number of manufacturers have stopped supplying spare parts to Russia.

However, the problem with dual-use goods remains. The second package of EU sanctions, adopted on 25 February, provides a broader ban on exports of these goods to Russia, but again there are some exceptions.

First, export restrictions did not affect contracts that had been concluded before the war. Secondly, the EU has left a short list of conditions under which dual-use goods can still be delivered to Russia.

The official list of dual-use goods from the EU probably needs to be supplemented, as it does not include some of the components used by the Russian army. First of all, there are car parts.

Any export of dual-use goods to Russia can be used in the military-industrial complex. This means that the ban on trade in technology must be comprehensive and without any exceptions.

The Rheinmetall Mission Master SP – Fire Support was equipped with a Rheinmetall Fieldranger Multi remotely controlled weapon station armed with two seven-tube 70mm rocket launchers from Thales Belgium, an important partner of Rheinmetall. For the demonstration, the A-UGV fired Thales FZ275 70 mm laser-guided rockets (LGRs) at a 4×4 vehicle located 4 km away from the firing point. The FZ275 LGR is the lightest and longest range 70 mm/2.75-inch LGR in its class, delivering metric precision and accuracy, hence providing unfailing fire support to armed forces.

The demonstration marked the culmination of the successful qualification process for the Fieldranger Multi equipped with the Thales 70mm rocket launcher. Previously limited to aircraft, these area saturation and precise strike applications can engage stationary and mobile targets at ranges of up to 7 km with minimal collateral damage. They are now qualified for use with the Mission Master A-UGV. Moreover, this new configuration is now ready to be integrated into other types of platforms and armoured vehicles.

This only represents one of many possible configurations for the Mission Master SP – Fire Support. Featuring a fully modular architecture, this A-UGV can also be equipped with other weapon systems: 12.7 mm calibre machine guns, a Dillon Aero M134D gun, or 40mm grenade launchers.

The demonstration at Trängslet was performed using a secure, customized, remotely controlled tablet operating in a fully digitized scenario. Firing was controlled using Rheinmetall command and control software. Rheinmetall and Thales both stressed the critical importance of the human-in-the-loop configuration, meaning that the operator has complete control of the weapon system from target acquisition to final fire authorization."

Thales Australia's Technical Director - Avionics, Philip Swadling and Director Australian Industry Capability, Sharon Tuminello, recently attended a Clontarf Foundation event at Brisbane Parliament House to celebrate the not-for-profit organisation's journey in Queensland. It's been two years since Thales first partnered with the Clontarf Foundation to support their mission of improving the education, discipline, life skills, self-esteem and employment prospects of young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander men.

Thales has signed a further two-year partnership with the Clontarf Foundation and was joined at the event by their other industry partners - including Boeing, BHP, Australian League Commissions, Brisbane Lions and many others.

‘From little things, big things grow’ is the title of a well-known song by Australian singer and songwriter Paul Kelly. However, it’s also the motto for the Clontarf Foundation, an organisation established in 2000 in Perth, with the aim of encouraging Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander boys to finish high school and find their way into meaningful careers.

The night was attended by Clontarf students, both past and present

The foundation launched in Queensland in 2015, and by 2021 had grown to support 2,652 boys in 24 schools. The foundation has very strong support from the Queensland government, and this was evident at the event in a number of ways; the guest list included no less than 18 MPs out of the 93 seat Queensland Parliament, the Master of Ceremonies was the Speaker, Clive Pitt, and the event itself was held in the Premier’s and Speaker’s Rooms in Parliament House.

However, the most honourable guests by far were the boys involved in the Clontarf program, past and present, and the Clontarf staff, including founder and CEO Gerard Neesham OAM. Phil and Sharon had the pleasure of having Year 12 student Tanu at their table. Supported by Clontarf and his loving family, he is driven, focused and confident. Although he was on crutches from a football league injury, it was evident this young man is destined for success. When asked on what he might do after his HSC, he said “I will see how I get through with injury and where footy takes me, but I’m keeping my studies up as I would like to do something maybe in science or law.” Tanu’s journey with Clontarf was one of many shared with guests at the event.

Real success stories from Clontarf alumni

On the night, guests heard from four Clontarf Alumni young men about their journey and experiences during and post graduating from high school. Their stories were authentic and inspiring, including one from a young boy who used to turn up to school less than 50 per cent of the time. When he was at school he sat in the back corner of the classroom under his hoodie, and was unable to look people in the eye. After joining the Clontarf program, his attendance jumped to 99 per cent, he graduated high school and had the confidence to present to a room of 200 guest in Parliament House. He mentioned the strength of the bonds engendered by the Clontarf program, and how it gives these boys the drive to be the best person they can be. A couple of the parents also shared their stories of the Clontarf program’s positive impact to their families – there were some very emotional moments!

The closing statement and thanks to industry supporters came from a 12-year-old student, who took to the podium and delivered a sincere and confident acknowledgement of the difference it has made to so many young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander boys. The dinner event concluded with a tour of Parliament House.

Thales’ positive contribution

Sharon and Phil had the opportunity to meet a Clontarf Employment Officer from Cairns who had recently accompanied a group of Clontarf students on a visit to the Thales facility at Eagle Farm. He recalled the group’s amazement on seeing the workshop areas and their excitement at being able to sit in a Bushmaster. This was one of many visits hosted by Thales; with our Garden Island, Myambat and West Leederville sites all welcoming Clontarf students to our facilities in recent times.

Visits like this are an importance element of industry support – showing Clontarf students the careers options that are available, and then following up by providing work experience opportunities and apprenticeships gives students a reason to continue their studies when many would otherwise drop out before graduating.

While walking back to our hotel, we thanked the Clontarf representative for the evening, to which they responded “thank you for your support, you are one of our villagers!” – it was a proud moment to see how Thales is contributing to making a difference.""

The Australian defence contractor, Thales Australia, will collaborate with Deakin University and the Innovative Manufacturing Cooperative Research Centre (IMCRC) to develop a lightweight composite overwrap for gun barrels.

The six-month, $234,023 research and development project will deliver a carbon fibre overwrap to reduce the thickness of the gun barrel, resulting in a lighter product with increased precision.

Commenting on the project, Graham Evenden, Thales Australia’s director Integrated Weapons & Sensors, said the research collaboration would advance Thales’ in-country composite manufacturing capabilities.

“Currently, the intermediate modulus carbon fibres suited to the overwrap are only available from overseas supply chains that face frequent disruptions. By developing these fibres on Australian soil, Thales is establishing an innovative capability that can be applied to other small arms products across civil and defence sectors,” Evenden said.

“Thales will also work hand in glove with Deakin to train and upskill staff at our Lithgow Arms facility to work with composites, further contributing to sustainable growth within Australia’s manufacturing sector.”

According to Deakin University Professor of Composite Materials, Russell Varley, the IMCRC activate collaboration would draw on local knowledge and expertise to meet the growing global demand for lightweight, high-performance components.

“Deakin, through its Carbon Nexus research centre, is excited to support Thales in the development of new carbon fibre materials which, once approved, will be used to produce a composite demonstrator at Thales Australia’s Lithgow manufacturing facility,” Varley said.

Thales and Deakin’s R&D will act as a testbed for future developments of Australian manufactured bespoke carbon fibres, IMCRC Manufacturing Innovation manager Dr Matthew Young said.

“This collaboration will develop a niche, high-quality product with significant export opportunities,” he said.

“By partnering with an Australian world-class research facility on composite materials, this project will directly support growth within a key national manufacturing priority area. It’s a prime example of the role shorter-term R&D collaborations can play in strengthening the future of defence manufacturing within Australia.”

This announcement follows Thales Australia’s recent $6.5 million commitment to transform its Lithgow Arms facility into a modern manufacturing and integration hub for the design, development and precision manufacture of next generation weapons systems."

The Australian government has announced the transfer of 20 Bushmaster protected mobility vehicles to Ukraine. The first three vehicles were loaded onto a Royal Australian Air Force C-17A Globemaster III at RAAF Amberley in Queensland.

The transfer comes after President Zelensky’s direct plea for armored vehicles during his address to the Australian Parliament on 31 March 2022. In response Prime Minister Scott Morrison said “not just sending our prayers… we’re going to be sending our armoured vehicles, our bushmasters as well, and we’ll be flying them over on our C-17s”.

Built in Australia by Thales Australia, over 1,000 of the vehicles have been ordered since 2005. Variants include command vehicles, ambulances, an assault pioneer version, a mortar carrier and an air defense variant as well as the standard troop carrier which can transport 9 troops. It is unclear which variants beyond the standard troop and ambulance vehicles might be sent.

The Bushmasters were refitted in Brisbane and have been painted flat olive green. Small Ukrainian flags have also been added to the sides of the vehicles. In a release the Department of Defence said ‘United with Ukraine’ had also been “stencilled in English and Ukrainian to acknowledge our commitment and support to the government and people of Ukraine.”

Two of the vehicles are ambulance variants of the Bushmaster and rather than Ukrainian flags they have red crosses painted on all sides. The Department of Defence said the “Bushmaster is well suited to provide protection to the Ukrainian Armed Forces soldiers and Ukrainian civilians against mines and improvised explosive devices, shrapnel from artillery and small arms fire.”

The Department of Defence said that the Bushmasters will be fitted with radios, a global positioning system and “additional bolt-on armour to increase their protection.” The vehicles have a mine resistant monocoque hull and as standard are rated to protect against STANAG 4569 level 1 ballistic threats (small arms fire) while additional protection for level 3 or 5 threats can be added. The announcement did not mention if the vehicles will be armed, photographs released did not show armament. Weapons may be fitted on arrival, the vehicles have remote weapon stations for mounting heavy machine guns or automatic grenade launchers.

NileSat to Launch NileSat-301 in May - Space in Africa,"Sat, 16 Apr 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vYWZyaWNhbmV3cy5zcGFjZS9uaWxlc2F0LXRvLWxhdW5jaC1uaWxlc2F0LTMwMS1pbi1tYXkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Egypt’s publicly-traded satellite operator NileSat will be launching its fourth, Egypt’s tenth, and Africa’s 48th satellite, NileSat-301 sometime in May. According to Thales Alenia Space, the satellite manufacturer, Nilesat-301 has recently been placed inside its transport container and is now ready for departure. It will leave Cannes’ plant in the upcoming weeks, heading for Fos Sur Mer to take the ship to Cape Canaveral.

NileSat signed the contract with Thales Alenia Space back in December 2019, and the project had a development timeline of 25 months. However, the project timeline has extended four more months from January 2022, which was the previous deadline. NileSat also signed a launch contract with SpaceX for the in-orbit delivery of the satellite.

The satellite will have a minimum lifespan of 15 years in orbit and will deliver communications and satellite broadband services to Egypt and neighbouring countries in North Africa and the Middle East.

Furthermore, NileSat-301 will be NileSat’s fourth satellite in space. The first, NileSat 101, was launched into space in 1998, followed by NileSat 102 which was launched two years later. Both satellites were built by the defunct French aerospace company Matra Marconi, now Airbus Defence and Space. NileSat’s third satellite, NileSat 201, was built by Thales Alenia Space.

Nilesat’s other satellites were all launched by European launch provider Arianespace and from Europe’s Spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana."

Citing sources close to the inquiry, AFP reported on Tuesday (April 26) that the long-running case investigating alleged kickbacks was opened in 2010 and eventually caught up with former Malaysian prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak.

Najib was the defence minister when the deal was signed to buy two Scorpene-class submarines and one Agosta submarine from French naval dockyard unit DCN, now part of Thales, in a deal worth US$1.2 billion.

Najib’s close associate Abdul Razak Baginda allegedly acted as an adviser on the deal, and was accused of disguising the kickback of more than €114 million as “consulting work” by a firm in which he was the largest shareholder.

The money was then said to have been given to Najib, who has faced a series of graft cases since he was voted out as Malaysia’s prime minister in 2018.

Razak Baginda was charged in France in 2017, while Najib has been questioned by Malaysian anti-graft investigators.

AFP said that in total nine defendants, including Thales, have been charged in France and the investigations were closed in January 2022."

The loading of the three vehicles was carried out during a media opportunity at the base, attended by Defence Minister Peter Dutton and Ukraine’s Ambassador to Australia Vasyl Myroshnychenko.

The three vehicles are part of an initial batch of four Bushmasters prepared at short notice by defence industry for their impending transfer to Ukraine. Two of the four are configured for troop carrying operations and two as field ambulances.

Thales Australia performed preparation of the four Bushmasters, after which they were painted from their overall white colours scheme to an olive-green scheme – complete with Ukrainian flag.

“Thales Australia is proud to support the donation of Australian Bushmasters to Ukraine. Built by Thales in Bendigo, our team in Brisbane has worked around the clock to have them ready for airlift to Ukraine today,” the company commented on social media on 8 April.

Two of the four Bushmasters were painted over a 24-hour period by north Queensland-based small to medium enterprise RGM Maintenance under contract to Thales Australia.

“RGM is privileged to support ADF and Thales Australia Bushmaster here in Australia and as required by the Australian Government,” RGM Director Russell Newman commented.

The 20 Bushmasters have been gifted to Kyiv in response to a personal request from Ukraine’s Prime Minister Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a televised address to Parliament on 31 March. In a statement released on 8 April, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Australia had already committed Defence aid valued at $116 million to Ukraine and the Bushmaster vehicles will increase this figure to $165 million.

“In addition, Australia is delivering 70,000 tonnes of coal to power Ukraine’s resistance, on top of $65 million in humanitarian assistance for the people of Ukraine, with a focus on protecting women, children and the elderly, including for food, shelter and emergency medical supplies,” Morrison said.

ADM understands the next batch of six vehicles are currently being prepared for delivery to Ukraine in the near future, however in his statement to the media the PM said “The Government will not disclose further specific details of [Bushmaster] delivery arrangements at the direct request of the Ukrainian officials and our other partners.”"
Belfast-built tank-buster beating the Russians - Reaction,"Tue, 19 Apr 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vcmVhY3Rpb24ubGlmZS9iZWxmYXN0LWJ1aWx0LXRhbmstYnVzdGVyLWJlYXRpbmctdGhlLXJ1c3NpYW5zL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The key role played by Belfast in the defence of Ukraine from its Russian invaders has received only limited publicity. But it is no exaggeration to say that without the next generation light anti-tank weapon (NLAW) made available by the British Government to the Ukrainian Army, Russia might now be in command of the battlefield not only in the eastern Donbass region but in Kiev, Kharkiv and Odessa.

Some 5,000 of the lightweight weapons will have been delivered by the end of this month, with more on the way subject only to availability.

Developed and built in Belfast by Thales UK, from an original design by the Swedish defence giant Saab-Bofors, the shoulder-launched NLAW has destroyed more Russian tanks and other armoured vehicles than all of its rivals combined. The Russians fear it, the Ukrainians swear by it. So successful has it proved in the current conflict that it has even raised questions around the world about the future viability of the tank itself.

Adding to Putin’s discomfort, the Belfast-built Starstreak surface-to-air missile – the fastest and most lethal of its kind in existence – has helped even the war in the air that was widely supposed to go Russia’s way. Achieving a speed of more than 3,000 mph before discharging laser-guided submunitions at the target, Starstreak has already brought down a number of Russian aircraft and is being dispatched to Ukraine from Northern Ireland in increased numbers as a matter of urgency.

But we shouldn’t get too cocky. Thales UK is a subsidiary of the Thales Group, a defence systems and aerospace multinational, 25 per cent owned by the French state, that employs more that 80,000 people in 63 countries. Pronounced Talez, the group is headquartered, appropriately enough, in Paris’s La Défense district and listed on the Euronext Exchange, formerly the Paris Bourse. Its CEO, Patrice Caine, moonlights as a director of the beauty products firm L’Oréal.

It was in 1993 that Thales, then known as Thomson-CSF, first took a stake in a Belfast company, Shorts Missile Systems (SMS), that found itelf somewhat adrift following its separation from the planemaker Short Brothers, newly acquired by Bombardier of Canada. Shorts had an impressive pedigree in the missile business but, after years of decline, was in sore need of cash and fresh entrepreneurial energy. Thales provided both, working first with Bombardier, then, in 2000 – the same year that it bought Racal UK – acquiring full control. As Thales Air Defence Ltd, the Belfast plant has prospered not only in the highly competitive missile field, but, since 2016, as the home of the group’s Space Propulsion Integration Centre, providing state-of-the-art electric propulsion systems for orbital satellites.

In 2019, the Belfast site came up with a pioneering power unit for satellites, known as the Spacebus Neo Xenon Propulsion System (XPS), that was the first of its kind to be designed and built in the UK. Now at the heart of the French and European space programme, it provides the structural backbone of the latest generation of satellites, enabling them to reach their operational position and keep them functioning over a 15-year lifetime.

The company is the first prime contractor to have moved into the space sector in Northern Ireland and has acted as a catalyst to promote the development of space capability among suppliers, most of which are small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Some 30 firms have now set up a Space Special Interest Group to grow the sector locally.

If it all feels like a long way from the Sunderland Flying Boat – a stalwart of the Second World War – or the 1980s Skyvan, both made by Short Bros, the real descent is from the Seacat, Tigercat and Blowpipe missiles designed and manufactured by SMS in the 1960s and ’70s. A tradition had been established on which Bombardier and Thales were able to build.

The role of Bofors – now owned by BAE Systems – in the development of the NLAW weapon should not be overlooked. Sweden, historically neutral but now actively considering membership of Nato, has been a force in weapons production for more than 350 years. When Britain’s Ministry of Defence turned to Bofors in the late 1990s, looking for a new type of weapon that attacked the turrets of tanks rather than their heavily protected fronts, the result was a world-beater. Thales UK secured the manufacturing rights for the UK and devolved the work to its Belfast plant, which has continued to refine and upgrade the product ever since.

Starstreak started life as a joint product of BAe and SMS under the name Thunderbolt. Much of the development took place in Belfast, which, as part of Thales, now offers the improved Starstreak II as well as an air-launched version and a naval variant known as Seastreak. Should Starstreak, in competition with the less advanced US Javelin missile, continue to prove itself in Ukraine, there can be little doubt that armed forces round the world will step up their interest.

At the same time, Bombardier’s former Belfast operation, since bought by Spirit Aerosystems of the US, does most of its business with Airbus, providing wings and nacelles for the company’s A220 and 320 series as well as for the revolutionary Cityairbus, an unmanned air taxi scheduled to make its first flight in 2023. The Belfast plant has some 2,700 workers and is Northern Ireland’s fourth-largest private sector employer. Its parent company is registered as a societas europaea – which means it answers to EU corporate law – with its main manufacturing base in Toulouse and its corporate headquarters in the Dutch city of Leiden.

Exports to the EU from both Thales and Spirit are regulated by the terms of the Northern Ireland Protocol, which keeps the province in the Single Market for goods. The Protocol is politically controversial but allows both companies free and frictionless access to the UK and Europe. At Spirit, there has been talk of strike action related not to the protocol but to the fact that wages are falling behind at a time of worsening inflation. At Thales, by contrast, a further 22 jobs have been advertised this month, including one for a “missile architect.” Shares in the group have risen by more than 40 per cent since the start of the conflict in Ukraine."
French defence firm charged with bribery over Najib-era submarine deal - MalaysiaNow,"Tue, 26 Apr 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hbGF5c2lhbm93LmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjIvMDQvMjcvZnJlbmNoLWRlZmVuY2UtZmlybS1jaGFyZ2VkLXdpdGgtYnJpYmVyeS1vdmVyLW5hamliLWVyYS1zdWJtYXJpbmUtZGVhbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A French judge has charged the defence group Thales with complicity in bribery over a 2002 sale of submarines to Malaysia, sources close to the inquiry told AFP on Tuesday.

They also include Philippe Japiot, former chairman of the French naval dockyards unit DCN International, and Jean-Paul Perrier, a former Thales chief executive, along with two other former executives.

All four deny any wrongdoing and Putrajaya has said the contract was free of corruption.

Contacted by AFP, Thales said “it strongly contests these allegations.”

Prosecutors from France’s PNF financial crimes office will now consider any further requests to the judge, who will have a final say on whether the case goes to trial, though an appeal was already filed in May 2021."
