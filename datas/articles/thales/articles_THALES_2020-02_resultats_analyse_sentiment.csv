LinkedIn

Ten years ago to the day, the Space Shuttle Endeavour lifted off with two new modules for the International Space Station: Node 3, dubbed Tranquility, and the Cupola. Both were designed, integrated and tested by Thales Alenia Space in Turin, Italy. The two modules were docked to the ISS a few days after the launch, to the great satisfaction of all astronauts involved.

Supporting life with Tranquility

Node 3, named Tranquility in honor of the first human landing on the Moon in July 1969, in the Sea of Tranquility, is the third connecting module on the Space Station. It joined two similar modules, Unity and Harmony, already part of the ISS from the outset. Tranquility, which also serves as a berthing location for the Cupola, not only provides crew members with additional room, but also includes life support systems such as water recycling and oxygen generation. It also houses a treadmill and a waste and lavatory compartment. It is definitely a “one-stop shop” for the astronauts, allowing them to go to the bathroom, exercise and relax.

Cupola, the real rock star module

Why is the Cupola so special? ESA astronaut Luca Parmitano, who recently returned to Earth after serving as commander of the “Beyond” mission on the International Space Station, wrote in his blog “This window on the world has fascinated and charmed all astronauts and cosmonauts who have had the privilege of looking at our planet from up here. Its seven windows allow a 360 degree view of the horizon and offer a spectacle of unparalleled beauty...”.

These are the largest windows ever installed on a manned space station. The Cupola, as its name suggests, is fully outfitted for astronauts to observe the Earth, including a variety of cameras. By design, the module always faces the Earth, allowing astronauts to observe day or night. They can also set up cameras to automatically shoot photos while they perform other tasks. Once published, these exceptional shots burnished the Space Station's reputation as an ideal spaceborne observatory.

40% of the ISS built by Thales Alenia Space

Everybody at Thales Alenia Space is justifiably proud of the ISS. The company has provided fully half of the pressurized volume on the International Space Station, including Nodes 2 and 3, the Leonardo Permanent Multipurpose Module (PMM), the Multipurpose Logistics Modules (MPLM), the Cupola and the Columbus lab structure, along with cargo modules for the ATV resupply vessels and the structure for the Bishop commercial airlock from NanoRacks. Thales Alenia Space also builds, on behalf of Northrop Grumman, the pressurized cargo modules (PCM) for the Cygnus resupply vessels. Thales Alenia Space has capitalized on its expertise in low Earth orbit (LEO) technologies, orbital infrastructures and reusable space transport technologies to develop innovative solutions for future human exploration of the Moon, Mars and perhaps even deep space.

Thales UK to Supply Sonars & Periscopes for Royal Navy Dreadnought SSBNs - Naval News,"Fri, 28 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdmFsbmV3cy5jb20vbmF2YWwtbmV3cy8yMDIwLzAyL3RoYWxlcy11ay10by1zdXBwbHktc29uYXJzLXBlcmlzY29wZXMtZm9yLXJveWFsLW5hdnktZHJlYWRub3VnaHQtc3NibnMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales UK to Supply Sonars & Periscopes for Royal Navy Dreadnought SSBNs Contracts to develop the ‘eyes and ears’ of Dreadnought submarines will create 170 jobs and secure 350 more across the UK. BAE Systems Submarines, which is building four nuclear submarines for the Royal Navy, has awarded work worth around £330 million to Thales UK.

UK MoD press release

The Dreadnought sonar system will be developed at the global technology firm’s sites in Templecombe, Somerset, and Stockport. The periscope – known as the ‘Combat System Mast’ – will be developed and manufactured in Govan with technical input from the workforce in Crawley.

Thales UK has been a trusted Continuous at-Sea Deterrence (CASD) partner with the MOD and Royal Navy since the first operation in 1969.

Jeremy Quin, Minister for Defence Procurement, said:

“I am delighted to continue our 50-year strong partnership with Thales. With over 500 jobs created or secured by this contract, we are clearly acting on the government’s commitment to level-up across the UK. These next-generation sonars and sensors will ensure our nuclear deterrent retains a stealth and detection advantage over adversaries.”

The fleet will also be equipped with Thales Sonar 2076; providing them with the latest in acoustic detection capability. The visual and situational awareness sensor will combine electronic warfare technology with cameras to provide the Dreadnought crew with a visual link to the sea surface.

The next-generation Dreadnought submarines will be the Royal Navy’s most advanced submarines ever when they enter service from the early 2030s and will be vital in providing the UK’s nuclear deterrent, as they replace the Vanguard class of ballistic missile submarines.

Most of the jobs being created by the sub-contract to Thales UK are highly-skilled and in manufacturing, engineering and design. There will be 30 new posts in both Templecombe and Cheadle Heath, where 50 jobs will be secured at each site respectively.

In Govan, 35 jobs will be secured while another 30 will be maintained in Crawley. Thales directly employs more than 7,000 people in the UK across ten sites.

Thales Chief Executive Victor Chavez said: “Thales is immensely proud of our contribution to the Continuous at-Sea Deterrent over the last 50 years. This announcement represents a £330m investment in world-class sonar and optronics systems; providing the battle-winning edge for the Royal Navy.

“Having supported the deterrent since its inception, and with over a century of supplying periscopes to the Royal Navy, I am proud that our engineers continue to deliver cutting edge innovative technology at sites across the UK.”

Steve Lloyd, BAE Systems Submarines’ Dreadnought programme director, said: “This major step, reflecting collaborative working between the Dreadnought Alliance and Thales UK, will make a direct contribution to the sustainment of Continuous at-Sea Deterrence through the delivery of the next generation of the UK’s ballistic missile carrying submarines.”

The £31 billion Dreadnought programme is one of the most complex engineering projects ever undertaken by the UK Government and remains on schedule and within budget.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9901037216186523}",neutral,0.9901037216186523,0
South Korea relies on Thales’ systems to avoid friendly fire incidents - EDR Magazine,"Mon, 03 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVkcm1hZ2F6aW5lLmV1L3NvdXRoLWtvcmVhLXJlbGllcy1vbi10aGFsZXMtc3lzdGVtcy10by1hdm9pZC1mcmllbmRseS1maXJlLWluY2lkZW50c9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"3 February 2020 – At the heart of coalition missions in the theatre of operations, it is essential for the forces to distinguish between friendly and enemy targets in order to avoid friendly fire incidents.

South Korea’s Defense Acquisition Programme Administration (DAPA) has awarded a contract to LIG Nex1 who is Thales’ local partner for the supply of IFF (Identification Friend or Foe) systems to replace Mode 4 with Mode 5 for enhancement capability.

Short range TSA 1412 interrogators will be produced by local partners based on license production supported by Thales and will be Mode 5 compliant and certified to the latest NATO standard, which will soon be mandatory on coalition operations. The mid-range TSA 2522 interrogators will be upgraded.

Thales IFF systems will be integrated by LIG Nex1 who has been selected by DAPA, South Korea’s Defense Acquisition Program Administration, to supply TSA 1412 IFF (identification Friend or Foe) interrogators for integration with man-portable missile systems and TSA 2522 for air defence vehicles. For this contract, Thales has teamed with a South Korean partner, LIG Nex1 and will transfer production to local SMEs. This is the third major order for the TSA 1412, which is the most compact Mode 5 IFF interrogator on the market and has also been sold to the United States and Japan as well as several European countries including the United Kingdom and Sweden.

Thales and South Korean partner LIG Nex1 were selected after a request for proposals to support the country’s air defence capabilities. The key success factor was Thales’s capacity to work with South Korean industry, and in particular with smaller partner companies that will produce the equipment locally.

IFF systems identify friendly platforms in the theatre of operations to prevent incidents of friendly fire and contribute to air traffic surveillance. The TSA 1412 is part of Thales’s BlueGate family of IFF systems. This short-range/very short-range interrogator is the most lightweight on the market (less than 2 kg) and is ideally suited to man-portable weapon systems and short range air defence systems (SHORADS). It will be integrated with South Korea’s K-SAM, Biho-hybrid, TPS-830K and KP-SAM defence systems.

The TSA 1412 implements Mode 5 certification, which is mandatory for NATO-led coalition forces from 2020. Certification was awarded by AIMS (1), the United States body that guarantees interoperability of US and NATO systems.

Thales is a world leader in the IFF market and offers a complete range of systems designed to meet the full spectrum of current and future IFF requirements for the armed forces. More than 20,000 Thales IFF systems are in service on more than 100 types of air, land and naval platforms in 70 countries.

Thales’s IFF solutions have also been selected by South Korea for Land, Air and Naval forces.

“This latest contract award is a strong endorsement of our partnership with LIG Nex1 and the benefits of technical and commercial cooperation with local industry, and in particular with the South Korean SMEs that will produce our systems, which will support the South Korean defence industry’s moves to scale up production of high-end products.” Sandy Gillio, Thales Country Director in South Korea.

Graduate Engineer

Post Graduate Diploma in Engineering Competence

Cranfield University

Tell us a little about yourself

After leaving sixth form, I took a gap year and travelled around Australia until the following September when I started at Swansea University to study BSc Physics with Particle Physics and Cosmology. I didn’t know what I wanted to do after graduation, so I took another gap year and did a ski season in Austria. When I got home, I decided that I wasn’t done with education yet, so returned to the University of Birmingham to study MSc Physics and Technology of Nuclear Reactors. I followed my hobbies for a little while (gigging with my band and working as a race mechanic for our Formula 3 team) before joining Thales on the Graduate Engineering scheme in September 2019. The first module for our post graduate diploma (PgDip) at Cranfield University took place at the end of October.

What was your motivation for joining the programme?

The PgDip in Engineering Competence covers a whole range of topics that will make me a better engineer overall. It also addresses competencies that contribute towards my Chartership, providing me opportunities to develop not only professionally, but personally as well. I am always looking to learn new things and the broad range of information provided by the training will be very beneficial in the long run.

How is the programme benefiting you and Thales

The broad range of learning material in the PgDip allows me to explore different areas I wouldn’t normally be a direct part of, for example operations management and finance. All the skills and information learnt from the course make me a better engineer, giving me different perspectives and knowledge to draw from in my everyday work with Thales. The course also provides me with a level of business acumen that will be helpful when I start rotating to other areas of the business and dealing with clients.

What would you say to people considering this programme?

Get involved as much as you can, take every opportunity that comes your way and work hard. Think of it as an investment into your future self; it’s never too late to learn something new.

Why are you proud to be an apprentice?

I’m proud to be an apprentice because I am bettering myself both professionally and personally, providing the tools to accelerate my learning and become a better engineer now and in the future.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9923784732818604}",neutral,0.9923784732818604,0
Embracing TACTICOS – the Royal Navy’s new combat management system - Navy Lookout,"Wed, 12 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdnlsb29rb3V0LmNvbS9lbWJyYWNpbmctdGFjdGljb3MtdGhlLXJveWFsLW5hdnlzLW5ldy1jb21iYXQtbWFuYWdlbWVudC1zeXN0ZW0v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Thales TACTICOS Combat Management System (CMS) will be a critical aspect of the Type 31 programme. In this article, we look at the project to develop and integrate the fighting heart of the frigate.



As mission systems integrator for Type 31, Thales will supply the CMS, the communications, navigation and bridge systems for the ship. From an RN perspective, TACTICOS has been seen as something of an outsider, with BAES supplying the CMS throughout the fleet until now. This dominance was recently eroded when Thales won the Oceanographic Reconnaissance Combat Architecture (ORCA) contract to fit its TACTICOS-based M-Cube command & control system on the Hunt & Sandown class minehunters.

Made in Britain

Although a French-owned multi-national, Thales operates in 68 countries with a large footprint in Britain, having acquired many UK defence technology manufacturers over the years. Their communications and sensor systems are widely used throughout the fleet but the selection of TACTICOS is a source of particular satisfaction for one of the RN’s largest suppliers. Around 6,500 people are employed by Thales in the UK, and in line with their involvement in Type 31, are moving their TACTICOS development from the Netherlands to their sites at Crawley and Bristol. This will create a significant number of new high-tech jobs in Britain and in the wider supply chain.

Thales have invested in a new Naval Combat Management Centre in Crawley that will be used to refine the system for Type 31 and other users around the world. This includes a mock-up operations room used to test new software, conduct simulations and allow customers and end-users to give feedback. Effectively the UK has acquired a sovereign capability within the TACTICOS product line that can directly support the RN and potential Type 31 exports. An important aspect of the arrangement is that within the open architecture of TACTICOS, sensitive elements of the code that are RN-specific can be restricted in their release. (Incidentally, until reconfigured for its new role, the facility at the Crawley site housed a complete replica of the Thales-supplied QEC aircraft carrier communications system for testing and development purposes, prior to installation.)

Thales involvement has recently led to some absurd claims that the Type 31 was being “built by the French”. Like nearly all UK defence projects, the supply chain will involve companies in Europe and beyond but the vast majority of expenditure and people employed on Type 31 will be in Britain. Type 31 is directly contributing to the ‘prosperity agenda’, with companies all over the UK involved in the project. TACTICOS may have begun life in the Netherlands but is now a global product with many nations participating in its development. (The word “TACTICOS” sounds particularly pleasing when pronounced with a Dutch accent.)

Speaking recently at Thales’ Crawley facility, Rear Admiral Paul Marshal, SRO Type 31, said: “TACTICOS offers an opportunity to think differently about fighting the ship… The RN is delighted with the result of the Type 31 competition but it is now up to industry to build, integrate and deliver on schedule”

A global ecosystem

The RN is the 27th navy to adopt TACTICOS which is now fitted to around 200 warships worldwide. Buying into such an established ecosystem has the benefits of accumulated experience of integrating the CMS with a very wide range of naval weapons and sensors. Essentially some of the costs and technical hurdles have already been surmounted by overseas navies, saving time and money. The RN can also decide to share costs with others or request bespoke integration for new systems. There will also be some potential new interoperability benefits with allies and TACTICOS can, of course, share data with any other RN or NATO platform through standard protocols. Some years ago Thales changed their development cycle from project-driven to product-driven. Instead of tailoring the CMS for each warship, the core product is continuously updated on a 6-monthly basis with customers free to install the latest software release as frequently as they wish.

Through-life support of equipment is not included as part of the Type 31 contract Babcock has with the MoD and will be subject to a separate arrangement. However, Thales will supply a single TACTICOS reference set to the RN for land-based use. Negotiations for equipment and plans for the cross-training of warfare personnel on TACTICOS, presumably at HMS Collingwood, have yet to be concluded.

Type-31-Ops-Room-1



In the ‘gloom room’

The TACTICOS consoles fitted in the operations room do not appear especially futuristic but consist of standard screen, keyboard and trackball mouse. Each console is multi-purpose and can be configured for anyone to use. This allows for flexible positioning of personnel in the space so specialists may be moved around depending on the task. For example, the gun controller may be seated next to the Principle Warfare Officer (PWO) for a particular mission while on another mission he might be replaced by the Electronic Warfare operator. A series of individual consoles are supplemented by much larger screens on the bulkheads that may be used to present a general tactical picture for the command team.

TACTICOS can be easily tailored to suit the requirement and warfare doctrine of any Navy. A great deal of investment has gone into making the Human Machine Interface (HMI) as simple and user-friendly as possible. Many of the principles and functions are common to other CMS and an operator experienced on other platforms should be able to understand TACTICOS without difficulty. An operator can pre-set a series of rules that will allow the system to monitor potentially hundreds of contacts simultaneously but will only alert him to threats within certain range, aspect or speed parameters or if something departs from usual behaviour. In complex environments such as the Gulf where friend or foe may be hard to distinguish and threats may materialise rapidly, to an increasing degree, the code and data processing software that underpin the CMS are as important as the weapon systems. The quality of the people is still the biggest single factor in success but equipping them with the tools to make rapid decisions may be the difference between life and death.

In lean-manned warships, it is exhausting and difficult to keep the crew closed up at high readiness at extended periods. Greater automation and instant readiness weapons offer a way of reducing the personnel needed in the operations room and new models for manning and operating the ship are under consideration. Like BAE Systems’ CMS development teams, Thales is looking at ways to counter swarm attack by unmanned aircraft or small craft and how autonomy and artificial intelligence may be harnessed. There is a big difference between automated systems that retain a human decision-maker in the loop and entirely autonomous systems. Hypersonic missiles, swarm or saturation attacks present the kind of scenario where a human can not react or decide on a solution in time and further automation is a certainty for the future. TACTICOS provides many autonomous capabilities, but human authorisation is still required to open fire from the CO who retains master weapon release control on his console.

The relatively light (initial) armament of Type 31 has led to criticism that they are just “glorified OPVs”. The capability of a warship should never be judged purely on its weapons. Besides the basic platform design, the sensor, electronic warfare and communication fit is just as critical. The primary sensor will be the NS110, a highly capable AESA radar which offers especially good situational awareness in littoral environments and in many aspects is superior to the Artisan radar that will equip the Type 26 frigate. The two MIRADOR Mk2 Electro-Optical mounts are also key observation systems for distant optical investigation, as well as providing laser-range finding and gunnery fire control. Collating and managing the ever-increasing volume of data and intelligence received by the ship is a vital part of its effectiveness. At its heart, Type 31 will be equipped with a first-class frigate-grade operations room, providing the decision making tools and controls needed to operate a modern warship.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999924898147583}",neutral,0.9999924898147583,0
More Griffon MEPAC 120mm Mortar Carriers for French Army - Overt Defense - Overt Defense -,"Thu, 06 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm92ZXJ0ZGVmZW5zZS5jb20vMjAyMC8wMi8wNi9tb3JlLWdyaWZmb24tbW9ydGFyLWNhcnJpZXJzLWZvci1mcmVuY2gtYXJteS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Pin 0 Shares

A contract amendment to the French Army Scorpion program will see the procurement of an additional 54 VBMR (véhicule blindé multi-rôles or Multi-role Armoured Vehicle) Griffons mounting Thales’ 120mm Rifled Recoiled Mounted Mortar (2R2M) in the MEPAC (mortier embarqué pour l’appui au contact) or Embedded Mortar for Contact Support configuration.

The Direction Générale de l’Armement (DGA) amendment will double the initial order for the French Army as detailed here at Overt Defense last year. The additional MEPACs will bring total VBMR Griffon orders to a reported 1,872 vehicles. The first deliveries are scheduled for 2023 with the order to be completed by 2027.

The Thales 2R2M 120mm mortar is well regarded due to its semi-automated action with the fire control system taking over once the mortar bomb and appropriate charge are loaded by the crew. It can fire up to 10 rounds per minute and is considered more accurate than its competitors such as the current French issue MO-120-RT mortar largely due to its proprietary recoil brake.

Courtesy Thales

The MEPACs will be built by a consortium of Arquus, Nexter and Thales. The contract amendment also sees Arquus receiving an additional order for more than 250 T1 and T2 remote weapons systems (RWS) mounts for 7.62mm medium machine guns, .50 heavy machine guns or 40mm automatic grenade launchers. Originally only the infantry carrier variant, the VPB (véhicule de patrouille blindé or Armoured Patrol Vehicle), was planned to be equipped with an RWS platform.

The Griffon procurement will see as many as 12 variants eventually purchased including ISR (intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance), engineer, artillery forward observer and armoured logistics resupply platforms. The MEPAC version is designed to be as visually similar as possible to the other variants to avoid enemy forces targeting organic indirect fire support – for example, the 2R2M will be concealed under hatches when not firing and the platform will be equipped with an Arquus RWS both to provide anti-personnel defense and to aid in concealing the vehicle from precise identification.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999920129776001}",neutral,0.9999920129776001,0

The contract was for an initial three-year term with the option of a further three-year extension thereafter. Much to their credit, the Thales EO Services bid team were successfully able to demonstrate the benefits of a new type of Australian Qualification framework to the Singaporeans.



As well as providing in-country EO training for the safe storage, warehousing and transportation of military ordnance to SAF, there was also the requirement to deliver training to government agencies such as the Police, and also the Defence Science & Technology Agency, who are required to monitor compliance of pyrotechnics use for firework displays and testing facilities.

Sydney based Howards Fireworks agreed to partner with EO Services for this phase of the course program and now work closely alongside us. With three to four courses scheduled per year, our collaboration with other industry partners has been a great way of exporting Australian knowledge and skills. Indeed, our existing partners at Toll are providing us with the training location at their regional Loyang Offshore Facility.



Feedback from our customer to date has been first rate and they will soon be further supported by EO Services domestically when they commence military exercises in far North Queensland under the Australia-Singapore Military Training Initiative (ASMTI).

Well done to everyone involved in this exciting program.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999994039535522}",positive,0.9999994039535522,1

The 3GPP standardization organization has recently approved features enabling 5G to support satellite communications. By mid-2021, a set of global technical specifications will be available to seamlessly integrate communications satellites in 5G networks. Thales Alenia Space has led this 3GPP effort over the past three years, with support from the European Space Agency and the European Commission.

This is a joint effort between the satellite communications industry and the 5G ecosystem. By combining terrestrial and satellite coverage, networks will offer higher availability and global coverage. They will be capable of meeting latent demand for digital broadband and IoT (Internet of Things) connectivity, not only for the consumer market, but also for sectors such as public safety, agriculture and logistics.

Mutual benefits for the cellular and satellite industries

The new 3GPP technical specifications will ensure the seamless integration of satellite networks in 5G, while minimizing the impact on user equipment and mobile network operator infrastructures. Satellite networks will enjoy easier access to a unified global market, marking a clear break with today’s isolated niche markets. At the same time, by integrating satellite capability, the 5G system will feature greater accessibility, reliability and resiliency to support a wider range of applications.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999723434448242}",positive,0.9999723434448242,1

The IXV (Intermediate Experimental Vehicle) was launched five year ago to demonstrate critical atmospheric reentry technologies under real conditions, including aerodynamic and aerothermodynamic performance, plus the thermal protection, navigation and control systems. Its flawless suborbital flight lasted 100 minutes and covered some 25,000 kilometers, including 8,000 in a searing atmospheric descent and safe splashdown at the targeted spot in the Pacific Ocean. Thales Alenia Space was chosen as prime contractor for this demonstrator, based on its acknowledged expertise in orbital infrastructures.

Building on the success of the IXV atmospheric reentry demonstrator, Thales Alenia Space is now developing Space Rider, Europe’s new-generation reusable space transport system. Space Rider is an autonomous orbital platform, capable of remaining two months or more in orbit and then returning to Earth in a safe atmospheric reentry landing automatically on a runway. It can be recovered, reconfigured and reused for up to six missions. Operating in low Earth orbit (LEO), it can carry out experiments in microgravity, test science and exploration technologies in orbit, and automatically return payloads to Earth for analysis and further testing. The first launch of Space Rider is slated for early 2022.

""This program is crucial for Europe,”

said Walter Cugno, Vice President, Exploration and Science domain at Thales Alenia Space in Italy, and Managing Director of the Turin plant.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999499320983887}",neutral,0.9999499320983887,0

The company began working on the CMS in the early 1990s, describing it as ‘an integrated and highly automated multi-warfare CMS to manage command and weapon control functions’ on surface ships.

Babcock wins £1.25bn Type 31 frigate contract

Currently being developed for the Royal Navy’s requirements at Thales’ new naval combat management centre in Crawley, the CMS for the T31 will be fully integrated with the vessel’s lead NS100 radar and other sensors and weapons to help navy warfare teams rapidly assess whether threats are present in the air or sea.

Already in service with 24 navies globally and on 182 different ships, TACTICOS is fully configurable for rules-based engagement with current and emerging threats.

Speaking in Crawley, Mark Harvey, Team 31 Deputy Programme Director said: “The introduction of TACTICOS and new mission system capabilities to the RN delivers a truly open-architecture CMS and a sovereign capability that the UK MoD will utilize on the globally deployed T31 general purpose frigates. Not only will the RN benefit from joining the TACTICOS user community with 24 other navies around the world they’ll be able to develop their TACTICOS system further, ensuring the sovereign capability of their CMS remains within the UK.”

Pascale Sourisse, senior executive vice president, International Development, Thales, said creation of theatre commands will fuel the need for radars, electronic warfare systems and weapons and the firm is ready to meet the huge demands, including through joint production of military hardware.

The first batch of RBE2 air defence radar systems will roll out from the joint venture between Thales and Reliance Defence Limited next month, Sourisse told PTI in an interview.



The Nagpur-based manufacturing facility of the joint venture is going to produce SPECTRA electronic warfare systems, which are going to be part of Rafale fighter jets. Initially, the RBE2 radars will be integrated in the facility.

The JV was set up to develop Indian capabilities to integrate and maintain radars and manufacture high performance airborne electronics, leveraging Thales' offset commitment as part of a deal to supply 36 Rafale fighter jets to the Indian Air Force.

India plans to reorganise the existing military commands into common theatre commands comprising the Army, Navy and Air Force on the lines of similar structures in leading western powers.

Chief of Defence Staff Gen Bipin Rawat last month announced that work on establishing theatre commands will be completed within three years and that the new model will significantly enhance India's combat capabilities.

""The Indian market is a very important market for Thales. We are investing in this market considering future growth opportunities,"" Sourisse said.

Thales, a vendor of Dassault Aviation, has already almost tripled its head count in India to 1,150. Sourisse also said Thales will be able to boost technology transfer to India if the Rafale aircraft is chosen by the Indian Air Force in its hunt to procure 114 fighter jets at a cost of $18 billion.

The top contenders for the deal include Lockheed's F-21, Boeing's F/A-18, Dassault Aviation's Rafale, the Eurofighter Typhoon, Russian aircraft MiG 35 and Saab's Gripen.

In 2016, India inked a Euro 7.87 billion (approx Rs 59,000 crore) deal with France for the purchase of 36 Rafale fighter jets. The first four aircraft will arrive in India in May.

""Thales is part of the Rafale team. We hope that Dassault Aviation will get the future orders. Our resolve to share critical technologies with India is fully supported by the French government. There is a clear commitment to transfer critical technology to India,"" Sourisse said. She said Thales has offered to produce F90 assault rifles in India.

Thales has also announced joining hands with MKU, an Indian company, to co-develop night vision devices for the armed forces in India and across the world.

Sourisse said Thales has also offered Indian armed forces a new generation radio solution which could enhance interoperability among the Air Force, the Navy and the Army in a collaborative combat scenario.

Thales, which has been in India since 1953, provides solutions, services and products to customers in the aeronautics, space, transport, digital identity and security, and defence markets in 68 countries.

In the last couple of years, Thales has been investing in digital innovations with a focus on big data, artificial intelligence and cybersecurity.

Last year, Thales launched its Global Engineering Competence Centre in Bengaluru with an aim to accelerate innovation and digital transformation to serve the needs of the Indian market and the group's global markets.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.6325839161872864}",neutral,0.6325839161872864,0

The Thales Reality H Full Flight Simulator level ‘D’, which is one of the world’s most advanced commercial helicopter simulator, will be used to provide superior scenario-based flight and mission training to AW139 helicopter operators across the African continent as well as Caverton’s pilots and crew.

With this simulator, Caverton will deliver state-of-the-art training: including Initial Type Rating, Recurrent Training and Proficiency Checks for both Visual Flight Rules (VFR) and Instrument Flight Rules (IFR), offshore and onshore missions as well as VIP operations to unprepared landing sites.

This simulator will enable pilots become certified to fly the AW139 under various Civil aviation Authority approvals. It will be one of the most popular helicopter platforms in Nigeria and in the region to be fully immersed in a realistic virtual environment representing Nigerian operational locations and learn to handle a multitude of system failures and overcome very complex malfunctions should they arise in the real world. Pilots can thus train safely in high-risk mission scenarios in a range of adverse weather conditions.

Caverton is a leading indigenous aviation and marine logistics player for the Nigerian oil and gas industry. The company aims to provide an accessible platform for advanced training and create opportunities for the sector in Africa. This move is a major step forward in Caverton’s strategy to diversify its portfolio of services to include flight simulation training services and thereby support safer helicopter logistics operations.

Rotimi Makanjuola, MD Caverton Helicopters Ltd remarks “This is an important milestone, not just for Caverton as an indigenous company, but for Nigeria and the African continent. We pride ourselves in being pioneers in safety innovation and are committed to providing enhanced training opportunities for our pilots in-country as well as to third party operators across Africa.

With this significant investment and with the support from Thales, a globally renowned company, we believe that the simulator will ultimately benefit our customers and increase accessibility to world class flight simulation training services.”

Engineers Australia CEO Dr Bronwyn Evans recognised those who received their EngExec credential, saying it’s important to highlight the role engineers take as leaders in organisations and communities.

“EngExec recognises engineers working at the highest level of industry, defence, academia and government – people whose decisions affect engineers, the engineering industry and the Australian community more broadly,” she said.

The dual recipients of the 1000th EngExec credential exemplify these values in spades.

Jenkins graduated with a mechanical engineering degree from UNSW in 1980 and quickly made a name for himself in the defence sector. Over the course of his career, he has contributed to a variety of interesting and technical projects, including sonar and underwater systems, the Collins-class submarines, air traffic control systems, and Thales’ Bushmaster and Hawkei combat vehicles.

He became the CEO of Thales Australia in January 2008, but he has held roles at Thales in Australia and internationally for more than two decades. In his current role, he oversees the work of nearly 4000 domestic employees, and coordinates with his international counterparts comprising a workforce of 80,000.

One of his favourite things about his job is he feels like he contributes to something positive every day.

“I have a line that I say to our people: we don’t build toasters,” he told create.

“The things you do in a company like this is you’re working on projects that make a huge difference to the way the world works.”

Shuttleworth echoed this sentiment, and said her past and present roles within the mining industry have created opportunities to make positive impacts on communities in Australia and around the world.

Her career in mining spans 25 years, and she has worked at Fortescue since 2013. During her career, she has travelled to far-flung places to set up mining projects and train local workforces.

Some highlights include: seeing a new mine and process plant in Tanzania from feasibility study through to operation; working as the general manager for Fortescue’s Cloudbreak and Solomon mines in Western Australia; and being promoted to her current role as Deputy CEO at Fortescue, which has allowed her to travel to places like Ecuador and Argentina to see firsthand the impacts of her company’s work on local communities.

She called these experiences “empowering”, and said it was great to work in roles that provide opportunities to make a direct difference to people’s lives and whole communities.

Engineers as leaders

Making a difference through the engineering profession is part of the reason both Shuttleworth and Jenkins wanted to pursue the EngExec credential.

Shuttleworth said two things that encouraged her to pursue the credential are that it aligns with her values and elevates the status of engineering.

“It shows professionalism and commitment to the industry, and is also a good opportunity to be a role model for young engineers,” she told create.

Jenkins agreed, saying it elevates the position of engineers – a good thing for the future of the profession.

“[As an engineer] you’re getting to create incredible change in the country, so it seemed to me a way to advertise that,” he said.

“I think the EngExec credential provides a profile to the engineering career path that hasn’t been there previously.”

Having engineers in leadership positions also helps bring new thinking to decision-making, Shuttleworth said.

“It brings diversity of thought and engineering thinking to companies, which helps drive results, and you have opportunities to help develop others within the business” she said.

The path here

Jenkins said the credentialing process was helpful in his position as a company leader, as it required him to think more about non-technical skills.

“I felt when I was designing as an engineer, you’re dealing with a problem, it’s technical and it resolves through technical effort; and while it might take longer, you work at it,” he said.

“When you’re dealing with managerial positions, with people’s livelihoods and wellbeing and safety, there are new stressors that are not technical. And dealing with or working out how to handle stress in that area was quite new.”

Shuttleworth found it useful to reflect on her experiences so far, and the EngExec credentialing process helped her home in on the type of leader she wants to be.

“I think the three traits good leaders share is having a positive attitude, being authentic and being approachable,” she said.

“My goal is to continue developing as an executive and be able to be a role model for others. I also want to help grow Fortescue so we can continue to have a positive impact on communities and maintain a strong focus on sustainability.”

Both Jenkins and Shuttleworth are looking forward to being part of the EngExec cohort and learning from others who share this prestigious post-nominal.

Shuttleworth said she was most looking forward to the networking opportunities, as well as the recognition that comes with the credential.

“Going through the credentialing process made me realise the high-calibre of the program,” she said.

For Jenkins, it’s a chance to not only share his experiences from 20 years in the defence sector, but it’s also a chance to learn new tricks of the trade and see what others are doing well.

“From this you can build a few extra skills, a few extra bits of knowledge that say, ‘You know, someone else has actually solved this problem before’,” he said.

The credential recognises Engineers Australia members who have played a significant role in leadership and management positions, and is open to professionals in the private and public sector.

Other prominent engineers who were recognised with their EngExec credential at the ceremony include: Roberts Pizzarotti CEO Alison Mirams; Downer COO Corporate Services Brendan Petersen; and WSP President and CEO – Australia and New Zealand Guy Templeton.

Chris Jenkins was recognised for his credential at a ceremony earlier this week. Julie Shuttleworth will be recognised for her credential at a ceremony to be held later this month.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.775868833065033}",positive,0.775868833065033,1

A French defence contractor has announced it will deliver the ""digital heart"" that powers the Royal Navy's next generation Type 31 Frigates.

Thales - a French multinational company that designs and builds electrical systems and provides services for the aerospace, defence, transportation and security markets - says it will provide the RN ""with the most advanced mission systems to protect UK maritime interests globally"".

A spokesperson for Thales said: ""Thales, as part of Babcock Team 31, has been selected to deliver the digital heart of the UK’s next generation frigates.

""Thales will be the mission systems integrator for the Type 31 programme, delivering the combat system, communications systems and the navigation and bridge system. The T31 general purpose frigate programme will provide the UK Government with a fleet of five ships, at an average production cost of £250 million per ship.

""Following a comprehensive competitive process, T31, a capable, adaptable and technology-enabled global frigate will be the UK Royal Navy’s newest class of warships, with the first ship scheduled in the water in 2023.

""At its height, the programme will maximise a workforce of around 1250 highly- skilled roles in multiple locations throughout the UK, with around 150 new technical apprenticeships likely to be developed. The work is expected to support an additional 1250 roles within the wider UK supply chain.

""Building on our global successes Thales is expanding its capabilities in mission systems delivery in the UK. This will generate new jobs and technical skills in Crawley, West Sussex where the new team has been established.

""A new naval combat management centre has also been developed to provide a space for customers, employees and end-users to train, test and see how our solutions deliver operational benefits and to continuously gain customer feedback.""

The new Type 31s were unveiled at the Defence and Security Equipment International (DSEI) 'arms fair' in London this week - with Babcock's Arrowhead 140 design selected.

Craig Lockhart, Babcock’s Managing Director, Naval Marine said: “Arrowhead 140 is a proven, capable, and adaptable general purpose frigate design that, if selected, will meet the UK Royal Navy’s and global customers’ expectations both now and in the future.”

""At almost 140m the platform will optimise operational flexibility. This ‘wide beam’ ship is easier to design, easier to build and easier to maintain due to its slightly larger size. And with embedded iFrigate TM technology able to deliver digitally enabled through life support, it offers extensive value for money – all within the same budget.

“Arrowhead 140 will provide increased survivability, operability and capability – compared to a standard 120m design. When you consider that this ship can be delivered at no extra cost and that it will support improved radar performance, increase platform stability and facilitate better helicopter operations in bad weather, whilst enhancing crew comfort. We believe it will bring a significant edge to modern naval capability.”

“More than just building a ship, Babcock Team 31 offers a unique opportunity for global navies to tap into the complete design, build and support capability for the T31e frigate. Individually all of the Babcock Team 31 members have exceptionally strong portfolios of activity and collectively we are able to introduce to the market Arrowhead 140; a general purpose light frigate package that we believe is second to none.”

Babcock's website says: ""Incorporating the latest iteration of Thales’ TACTICOS combat management system with fully open architecture sets Arrowhead 140 combat systems apart. Currently in service for 25 years and exported to 24 navies globally, this system and equipment in-service support package is flexible to customers’ needs over the lifetime of the platform and will maximise the combat system capability for customers. It is a system that has time and time again proven to be a leading edge solution for navies fighting tomorrow’s war.

""With extensive procurement required throughout the lifetime of the project, opportunities predominantly for UK based small to medium sized enterprises will be available to help to meet time, costs and quality standards. Interest is already strong in Team 31’s bid with more than 100 supply companies meeting Team 31 representatives at a Society of Maritime Industries facilitated supplier’s conference in Fife.

LATEST ROYAL NAVY AND ROYAL MARINE NEWS HERE

""Based on Arrowhead 140, Team 31 can build modern platforms that navies can use to tailor to their own specifications and when you add world leading experience in naval platform in-service support with a deep understanding of support cost drivers, Babcock Team 31 offers a glimpse into an exciting new world of UK and international ship build delivery and intelligent ship support with Arrowhead 140.""","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9767683744430542}",neutral,0.9767683744430542,0
Ministry of Defence gives £330m contract to Thales firm based in Templecombe in huge boost to village - Somerset Live,"Fri, 28 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNvbWVyc2V0bGl2ZS5jby51ay9uZXdzL3NvbWVyc2V0LW5ld3MvdGhhbGVzLWpvYnMtdGVtcGxlY29tYmUtbW9kLXNvbWVyc2V0LTM4OTY1MDDSAWJodHRwczovL3d3dy5zb21lcnNldGxpdmUuY28udWsvbmV3cy9zb21lcnNldC1uZXdzL3RoYWxlcy1qb2JzLXRlbXBsZWNvbWJlLW1vZC1zb21lcnNldC0zODk2NTAwLmFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Something went wrong, please try again later.

New jobs will be created in a Somerset village following an announcement by the Ministry of Defence (MoD).

Thales has been awarded a £330M contract by the MoD to supply and maintain next-generation sonar systems for the Royal Navy.

The sonar systems will be installed on the navy's new Dreadnought class submarines, which will enter service in the early-2030s.

The contract will protect 50 existing jobs within Thales' base in Templecombe and will create up to 30 more over the life of the contract.

Jeremy Quin MP, minister for defence procurement, made the announcement on a visit to Templecombe on Thursday morning (Febraury 27).

He said: ""This is a very good news story for the south west.

""We will be buying the world's most advanced sonar system to go into our Dreadnought class submarines.

""This is a 15-year, £330M contract, and the great thing is that this world-beating, most advanced sonar system in the world is made in the UK - and particularly here at Templecombe, so it's also a good news story for jobs.""

A total of 350 existing jobs at Thales are being secured by the new contract, with 170 new jobs being created across four of the company's UK sites.

Templecombe and the company's Stockport site will see up to 30 new jobs created, with the remainder being split between Thales' bases in Crawley and Glasgow.

The majority of the jobs will be in the highly-skilled manufacturing, engineering and design sectors.

Mr Quin said: ""We don't micro-manage job numbers year by year, but it's a 15-year contract and there's a lot of work to be done over the course of it.""

The Dreadnought fleet forms part of the UK's continuous at sea nuclear deterrent - with Mr Quin describing it as ""an absolutely critical component of our national security.""

He added: ""We don't want to have to have nuclear weapons, but for as long as they exist, we believe that as a country we are safer to have that independent, at-sea nuclear deterrent.

""Parliament voted in 2016 to maintain that deterrent - that's why we're having the Dreadnought class submarines coming into service in the 2030s to replace our existing craft.

""What's important is to have the most advanced sonar in the world so we can keep that deterrent safe at sea - and that's what this company will be providing.""

Thales is currently constructing an extension to its Templecombe base on Slades Hill, after planning permission was granted by South Somerset District Council in December 2018.

The site will also include up to 70 houses, despite concerns from local residents about noise from the site and increased traffic on the A347.

Mr Quin said the government could pour more investment into Somerset in the coming years following a review of the UK's wider defence needs.

He said: ""We will always need to upgrade and improve our defence capabilities. That will take on a whole range of forms.

""Defence is changing incredibly rapidly.

""We have an integrated review which is looking at all aspects of Britain's place in the world, and what we need to maintain our position and enhance it in areas with key technology.

French Army Issues New THALES O-NYX Night Vision Goggles - - The Firearm Blog,"Thu, 06 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZpcmVhcm1ibG9nLmNvbS9ibG9nLzIwMjAvMDIvMDYvZnJlbmNoLWFybXktaXNzdWVzLW5ldy10aGFsZXMtby1ueXgtbmlnaHQtdmlzaW9uLWdvZ2dsZXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In recent news, the French Army is adopting the THALES O-NYX night vision goggles (NVGs). According to the recent press release they will be getting 3,179 units out of 3,519 that were ordered.

2020’s objective is to field 3179 Onyx NVGs out of the 3519 ordered.

The remaining ones will be delivered in 2021.

Several thousand more units will be ordered until 2025 in order to equip the three branches of the military. Characteristics of the ONYX NVG device:

Length: 112 mm

Width: 75 mm

Hight: 74 mm

Weight: 340gr

Technology: Light Intensification

Autonomy: more than 40 hours with batteries or 25 hours with AA 1.5V batteries.

Profile: extra flat, close to the face, very compact and lightweight allowing comfort during long use.

Field of View: 51 degrees Florence Parly, Minister of the Armed Forces, welcomes the delivery of the first O-NYX night vision binoculars (JVN) to the 21st Marine Infantry Regiment (21st RIMa) of Fréjus: “This delivery of new equipment is part of the law of military programming (LPM) designed at breast height: in 2020, a deployed soldier is a better protected soldier. ” Designed by Thales, these binoculars benefit from improved resolution and a wider field of vision. They will allow Army soldiers to progress better in the dark and will replace the Lucie binoculars currently in use. The delivery of the O-NYX binoculars is part of a larger effort to renew the “small equipment” of the armed forces. This desire is at the heart of the 2019-2025 LPM “at breast height”. Designed to maintain the operational superiority of the French armies, the 2019-2025 LPM focuses on improving the equipment and protection of our soldiers, sailors and airmen engaged in theaters of operations. These new night vision binoculars will equip infantrymen of the 21st RIMa and the 2nd Foreign Infantry Regiment (2nd REI) of Nîmes as part of the mission of the units of the 6th light armored brigade in early 2020 in the Sahelo-Saharan strip (BSS) ). The objective for 2020 is the supply to the Army of 3,179 ONYX night vision binoculars out of the 3,519 ordered by the General Directorate of Armament (DGA) for the benefit of the armies; the rest of the order will be delivered in 2021. Several thousand additional copies should be delivered by 2025. These night vision binoculars will eventually equip the three armies. The adoption of these O-NYX binoculars is part of a broader desire for new “small equipment” intended for the French forces as part of a 2019-2025 LPM at breast height: · The delivery, by 2022, of 74,596 Glock 17 GEN5 semi-automatic pistols (PSA).

· The continuation of the delivery of the HK416 assault rifle started in 2017. In 2020, 12,000 new rifles will arrive in the units.

· The delivery, by 2022, of 2,620 new SCAR (Special Combat Assault Riffle) sniper rifles for French snipers.

· The equipment of the forces with new trellises in 2020. 85,000 F3 flame retardant trellises will be perceived within the units, thus making it possible to equip the soldiers deployed in OPEX as from this year.

· The delivery of 9mm composite burst and bulletproof helmets: in 2020, 25,000 helmets will be delivered.

· Finally, 37,000 new generation bullet-proof vests have already been delivered between 2018 and 2019, the objective by 2025 being 96,800 deliveries within the forces.

These deliveries are essential to the mission of deployed soldiers, whose equipment must meet the best standards.

For those not familiar with THALES they are more commonly known for their LUCIE NVG.

The THALES LUCIE looks like something out of an Anime. However, outside of the unique aesthetics the LUCIE goggles are nothing special. Take a look at the photo below. The housing is still rather thick. Sure it is shorter in OAL compared to the PVS-14 and PVS-7 but the system functions like a PVS-7.

Both the LUCIE and now the O-NYX only have a single image intensifying tube. Then the image is split into two eyepieces. So you do not gain true 3D stereoscopic vision like you do with true dual tube bino NVGs. The other problem with the LUCIE/O-NYX design is the position of the objective lens. It is high and to the right. While passively aiming with a set of PVS-7s is difficult, the THALES goggles would be worse. Your optic needs to be even higher for the objective lens to look through it and if you are a left-handed shooter, it would be impossible to look through your optic with the O-NYX covering your face.

Sure the French Army can use IR lasers but with the increasing problem of peer-forces (enemy forces with the ability to see infrared lasers and lights), they need to practice passive aiming and engagement.

The specs don’t mean much. No specs on the tubes they are using. Most likely they are using Photonis tubes since they are French as well. The French Army went with 51° FOV lenses and for some that is not an issue. For others, they see some distortion and a little bit of fisheye effect to the image. Weight-wise at 340g, these are lightweight goggles but they could achieve more with a PVS-14 than this goggle design. There is no benefit to bleaching both eyes with the same image. In fact, the person that filmed the promotional video above does not know how to use night vision. They had the soldier flip the eyecups over his eyes. While eye cups certainly are a thing, most night vision users opt not to use them. While there is a slight glow splashed onto your eye sockets, you have a better peripheral vision by not covering up your eyes.

Don’t get me wrong, I want a set of LUCIEs for my NVG collection. But I would not want to use it for battle.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9862237572669983}",neutral,0.9862237572669983,0
