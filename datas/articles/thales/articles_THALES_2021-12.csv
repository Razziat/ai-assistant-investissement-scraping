American Airlines (AA) is to install Thales’ latest AVANT in-flight entertainment (IFE) solution on its incoming Airbus A321XLR and Boeing 787-9 fleets, which are scheduled to enter service on transcontinental and international flights in 2023.



This announcement will see AA become the launch customer for Thales’ new line of high-performance Optiq displays, which will give passengers access to 4K high dynamic range (HDR) seatback screens enhanced with Samsung’s proprietary QLED technology.



Premium-class travelers will enjoy 17-inch displays alongside a five-inch touchscreen handset that will offer a true second-screen experience. Screens in premium economy and economy class will feature 13.3-inch displays and 11.6-inch displays, respectively.



The system is capable of providing a Bluetooth audio connection at each seat, and will include high-power 60-watt USB type C and AC outlets at each seat across all classes. Furthermore, premium-class passengers will also benefit from AA’s high-speed in-flight connectivity system, which will provide the airline with real-time health monitoring and reporting on its performance.



Yannick Assouad, EVP Avionics at Thales, commented, “American Airlines has trusted Thales as an in-flight entertainment supplier for more than a decade and is now to equip its new A321XLR and Boeing 787-9 aircraft with the latest AVANT IFE solution. As air travel begins to recover, Thales continues to invest in digital innovations that create value for our customers. We’re truly excited to provide these solutions to American and its customers.”



Thales revealed details of its AVANT Up IFE solution in June 2021, a big selling point of which is that the 4K HDR displays are also 30% lighter than previous models thanks to the use of polycarbonate material instead of glass.



AA placed an order for up to 50 A321XLR aircraft at the Paris Air Show in 2019. This included a conversion of 30 A321neo orders to A321XLRs. The carrier also converted five of its Boeing 787-8 aircraft orders to the larger 787-9 variant in April this year."

The new Thales chip form factor will leverage Tappy Technologies’ holistic payment solution to Axis Bank, to further enhance customer outreach by offering innovative purchase methods, according to Thales.

This range of wearable contactless payment devices is easy to carry around and blend seamlessly into the users’ daily lives with minimum intrusion, the company said.

Thales said it managed to condense the technology of a contactless payment card into a tiny piece of secure payment technology – Thales Gemalto FlexiTag – that can be invisibly integrated into a vast range of wearable shapes and sizes, it said.

Axis Bank customers can therefore enjoy payment bands, key fobs, or loops to process fast contactless transactions - without having to take a wallet out, according to Thales.

The wearable is directly linked to the customers’ bank account and functions like a debit card. This allows purchases to be done at any merchant that accepts contactless transactions.

Also, to ease accessibility, the Axis wearables can be purchased via phone banking or at Axis Bank branches.

“With the increasing number of digital payments users, we see a huge opportunity in contactless payments, which will continue to grow, given the post-pandemic situation and the need for social distancing. Contactless payments are the future of the payments industry in India,"" said Sanjeev Moghe, executive VP & head-Cards & Payments, Axis Bank. ""To tap into this market, our Wear ‘N’ Pay program brings convenience in contactless payments at a budget friendly price point, offering a safe budget-friendly of payments on the go. Not only are these devices contemporary looking, but are also designed in a way that it becomes a part of our daily lives, thus increasing adoption of cashless transactions for everyday requirements.""

“The current time is apt to discover new secure payment methods and here contactless wearables arise as an optimal alternative,"" said Emmanuel de Roquefeuil, VP and country director, Thales in India.

Added Suboor Ahmed, VP of Strategic Partnerships & Operations at Tappy Technologies: “The Indian mass market potential for contactless-enabled wearables is significant and we see this expanding into use on India’s public transport systems in the future."""

Becker wrote that agencies should consider raising the required authentication level as users seek to gain access to higher-level data and applications.

“The key is to manage those activities via one pane of glass or one platform that supports the entire risk-based and continuous authentication process,” he noted.

He said there are new technology platforms agencies can adopt to better understand users’ online behavior and make informed authentication decisions.

Becker also cited several government policies and guidelines aimed at helping agencies better secure their information technology environments. These include the Department of Defense’s Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification program, Federal Information Processing Standard 140 and the recent cybersecurity executive order that requires zero trust architecture, multifactor authentication, supply chain security and encryption for data at rest and in transit.

“Complying with government mandates and policies is essential for helping agencies discover the resources they need to protect, protecting the data itself and also controlling access to the data,” he added."

LinkedIn

If we were to lay just one accusation at humanity’s door, it would be that we don’t take care of our planet. Some fear we might one day treat space with the same reckless abandon – and see innovation as the solution. One such person is Sabrina Andiappane, who heads new business initiatives and space robotics projects at Thales Alenia Space.

Let’s start with an observation: without satellites, our daily lives would be drastically different.

© Thales

Satellites enrich our lives in obvious ways. They allow us to forecast the weather, find our way around, and communicate with one another across continents and oceans, day and night.

But we often forget that satellites save lives – literally. When natural disasters knock out ground telecommunications networks, satellites take over the heavy lifting. They also give us the technological capability to monitor climate change and the environment, helping us to protect the planet.

It’s no longer possible to imagine life without satellites. But as the potential of space technology has grown, so has the number of satellites in space. Since the Space Age began in 1957, we’ve launched thousands of rockets, satellites and instruments of all kinds into orbit. There are currently around 5,400 satellites circling above our heads, and the number is set to grow by more than 10,000 in the next decade. And in the medium to long term future, all those orbiters are going to generate a huge amount of space debris.

What can we do about it?

We already have international laws and standards on sustainable space exploration. For instance, design rules state that rockets and space vehicles should shed as little debris as possible during take-off and operation. And when a satellite reaches the end of its useful life, it can be shunted into a significantly higher ""graveyard"" orbit.

At Thales Alenia Space, we’re developing new space vehicles for precisely this purpose – what we call “On-Orbit Servicing”. These vehicles will be able to carry out a wide range of operations in orbit, including inspection, extending a satellite’s service life, refuelling, maintenance and repair, and de-orbiting space debris.

There are other promising initiatives for cleaning up space junk. The European Space Agency’s ClearSpace-1 project1 is one example. But we’re taking a different approach, drawing on our experience on several European H2020 projects (I3DS, EROSS and the ongoing EROSS+ project). For us, the answer lies in preventive on-orbit servicing.

The average satellite has a lifespan of 5 to 15 years, depending on its mission. But what do you do if something happens while your satellite is in service – say, the batteries die or it runs out of propellant?2 Sending an astronaut up there to fix the problem is out of the question. It simply isn’t worth the cost, or, more importantly, the risk. Normally, if something breaks, you pick up the phone to customer services. We’re merely applying that same thinking to space!

How does it work in practice?

The plan is to send up specially designed space vehicles with robotic arms, grippers and various other tools. They will analyse the satellite’s environment, set a course, dock and carry out whatever tasks they’ve been set – servicing, refuelling, repairs or updates, for example.

© Thales Alenia Space/Master Image Programmes

The benefit of this approach is that it would extend the satellite’s service life to delay the date when it needs to be replaced. And when satellites do reach the end of their life, we could use our vehicles to shunt them into a cemetery orbit or push them down towards Earth, where they’d burn up on re-entry.

Isn’t this the stuff of science fiction?

Not at all. At Thales Alenia Space, we’ve been developing innovative systems and technologies for robotic space missions for the past 15 years. And we’ll be deploying these technologies in our forthcoming projects.

Can you give us some examples?

We’re currently developing an on-orbit refuelling system for ESA’s Esprit programme. The module – the only one of its kind in Europe – will form part of the Lunar Gateway orbiter programme, which kicked off in 2020.3 This new system is critically important because, more often than not, satellites run out of fuel long before other systems and components reach the end of their life.

Can you tell us about Space Rider?

In 2020, Thales Alenia Space and its co-contractor, Italian aerospace company Avio, signed a contract with ESA to develop the automated reusable Space Rider transportation system.4

© ESA

Space Rider is Europe’s solution for its own affordable and reusable end-to-end integrated space transportation system for unmanned missions and for routine access and return from low orbit. It will be used to transport a variety of payloads into different low Earth orbit (LEO) altitudes and inclinations. For instance, Space Rider could capture and return components to Earth, where they could be recycled and reused on future missions.

Are there any other innovative projects in the pipeline?

Yes. We’re also planning an On-Orbit Servicing proof-of-concept mission using the Servicer for Transportation And Robotic OperaTions (START) robotic vehicle, which builds on our work on the EROSS and EROSS+ projects. In fact, the key technologies for these kinds of missions were successfully ground-tested during the EROSS project.

The Space Rider programme and our On-Orbit Servicing offering embody our company’s vision: Space for Life. At Thales Alenia Space, we see space as a new horizon – a way to harness the power of technology to help to build a better, more sustainable life on Earth, and a future we can all trust.

ANGELS nanosatellite celebrates 2nd anniversary in orbit - Thales,"Tue, 21 Dec 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi93b3JsZHdpZGUvc3BhY2UvbmV3cy9hbmdlbHMtbmFub3NhdGVsbGl0ZS1jZWxlYnJhdGVzLTJuZC1hbm5pdmVyc2FyeS1vcmJpdNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"ANGELS nanosatellite celebrates 2nd anniversary in orbit Thales Alenia Space Satellite Navigation System Share this article

On December 18, 2019, Arianespace launched a Soyuz rocket from the Guiana Space Center, Europe’s Spaceport in French Guiana (South America). It was carrying no less than five satellites: Italy’s first second-generation COSMO-SkyMed radar observation satellite, CHEOPS, an ESA science mission to characterize exoplanets, and three smallsats, including ANGELS, the first nanosatellite built by French industry for an Internet of Things (IoT) mission.

ANGELS recently celebrated its second anniversary in orbit and is fully operational. It has already exceeded its initial design life and is still going strong.

About ANGELS

The ANGELS IoT satellite, featuring a new-generation native geolocation function, has exceeded initial expectations and will join the Argos fleet operated by Kineis. This is a French space agency CNES mission, coordinated by Hemeria, which is also responsible for the nanosat platform (a 12U CubeSat). The Argos Neo payload was developed by Thales Alenia Space as prime, working with Syrlinks, a manufacturer of radio communications and geolocation equipment, as lead partner. Syrlinks produced the data collection instruments that receive data sent from emergency beacons to the satellites, and then send this data back to ground stations. These instruments feature powerful computers to process all the data received.

Argos Neo: a miniaturized instrument tailored for “new space” requirements

Argos Neo is the first in a new generation of Argos instruments. It sets the global standard for spaceborne IoT, in particular with native geolocation to support the monitoring and protection of our planet’s environment. Thales Alenia Space and Syrlinks rose to the challenge by miniaturizing the instrument’s components so that this payload would be compatible with the nanosat-sized platform of ANGELS.

Argos Neo weighs one-tenth as much (2 kg) and is three times more energy-efficient than previous generations, while providing the same functions and extended capabilities. It also incorporated components and subassemblies that reduced production time and cost. ANGELS was developed and deployed in less than 24 months. The successful launch and operation of Argos Neo clearly demonstrates Thales Alenia Space’s ability to miniaturize this type of sophisticated instrument.

From Argos Neo to Kinéis

Thales Alenia Space is justifiably proud of this instrument, since it heralds a new-generation system comprising 25 French-built nanosatellites for the Internet of Things. Thales Alenia Space plays a lead role in this constellation, which will be operated by Kinéis. Within the consortium, Thales Alenia Space is system architect, with responsibility for the ground segment and payload. Syrlinks is the lead partner, while Hemeria is in charge of the payload. The payload itself comprises two instruments, one for IoT and the other for maritime surveillance applications.

In other words, the Kinéis constellation will cover a broad range of applications: tracking of ships at sea, management of natural resources (detection of fishing zones), helping the “Blue Economy”, ensuring personal safety and security, environmental management, collecting meteorological data and much more.

Thales Alenia Space and Kinéis are taking an approach that matches the needs of the evolving “new space” environment. This approach complements Europe’s vast Copernicus environmental monitoring program, in which Thales Alenia Space is also the lead industrial partner.

The anniversary being celebrated today confirms Thales Alenia Space’s growing footprint in new space and the burgeoning IoT market.

Julie Grollier, you have just been selected to receive the Irène Joliot-Curie Prize, which is awarded each year to recognise outstanding research and engagement by women scientists. How do you feel about this latest endorsement of your career and talents?

© Ph. Klinge

Of course I'm very honoured to receive this prize. First and foremost, it sets a seal of approval on the quality of the research conducted by our team at the joint CNRS/Thales physics lab. But it also celebrates the contributions of women to science, and I am proud to be part of this growing recognition, which I consider extremely important.

You are a pioneer of neuromorphic computing and one of the world's leading experts in the field. Can you tell us about the type of work you do?

I work in artificial intelligence. Most AI people today are concentrating on algorithms, or the lines of code that help to solve a particular problem or achieve a particular outcome. AI algorithms may be inspired by the workings of the human brain and its neural networks, but they are based on virtual neural networks running on conventional computer chips.

A neuromorphic chip, on the other hand, is a physical reproduction of a neural network. What we are attempting to do is to create zones of physical neurons connected by synapses. In my work, we are taking inspiration from the organisation and structure of the brain — and in particular from the way neural networks are organised as successive layers of neurons in the cortex — to develop processors that can run these algorithms very efficiently and with much less energy.

Digital technologies consume large amounts of energy. Could your work lead to real breakthrough in energy-efficiency?

That's what we hope. One day, we think it will be possible to run these artificial intelligence tasks with 1,000 times less electricity than they need today.

As things stand today, most artificial intelligence isn't installed on our mobile devices but in the cloud. And the cloud is made up of supercomputers installed in giant datacentres that use huge amounts of energy. Our objective is to develop very low-energy chips that could be installed directly in phones and cars, for example.

Your lab is part of the CNRS/Thales joint physics unit, which is seen as the gold standard of public-private research collaboration. How does the unit help you in your work?

It helps us in various ways. The unit was initially set up as a partnership between Thales and the French national research centre (CNRS) so the two organisations could share access to high-value research equipment and work together to develop disruptive technologies. It's an amazing laboratory that provides a perfect scientific setting for advanced research projects.

The Thales research centre is also multi-disciplinary, which is an added bonus. It has been extremely rewarding for me, with my background in physics and nanoscience, to interact with specialists in other fields. Learning more about the potential applications of my work is truly fascinating and it gives our research a more tangible dimension.

Talking of tangible dimensions, how long do you think it will take to transform your ideas and concepts into actual products?

That's very difficult to say. We're a fundamental research lab, and it took us several years to conduct our first cognitive experiment with a single neuron. We have come a long way in the four years since then, and now we have managed to connect several neurons together. Today we are working on synapses, which will be another major step forward. But how long will it take to develop a real-world application? Five to ten years, maybe. That's not very long in the world of science!

Not far from your laboratory, there's another research unit called the III-V Lab1, which was set up by Thales, the CEA and Nokia. Is there any interaction between the two?

Not for the time being, because we are working on nano-scale magnetic components, which are quite different from the components being developed at the III-V Lab. But sooner or later, when we need to develop the chips, their expertise will be extremely valuable to us.

On a more personal level, you mentioned earlier how proud you are to be part of a growing recognition of women in science. We know that female talent is woefully scarce in scientific circles. What message would you have for young women who are tempted by a scientific career but are hesitant about taking the plunge?

My message would be ""Go for it!"" A scientific career is incredibly exciting and rewarding. It's a far cry from the stereotype of a female researcher stuck in a room with a whole array of complex machinery. That may be one part of the job, but there are so many other aspects that are really very stimulating.

Personally, I manage a team of researchers working on collaborative French and European projects with multiple other players who need to communicate with each other about the results of their research. It is a collective, multi-disciplinary effort and it's very international.

Things are getting better for women scientists. When I completed my doctoral thesis at the joint research unit in 2003, female students were a real rarity. Today there are many more women in research. And companies like Thales are making a real effort to attract dynamic, professional young women as research engineers. The more women there are in these roles, the more attractive it will be for other women to join them.

Being a researcher, male or female, requires a high level of personal engagement. Do you ever have doubts? Do you ever say to yourself ""I'm a woman, I'll never make it""?

Fortunately for me, I never do! I have to say that my father, a doctor, really motivated me to pursue a scientific career and had unshakeable confidence in my ability to succeed. I think it made me impervious to that kind of attitude.

Apart from your father, did any other figures inspire you to become a scientist?

I had icons, of course, like Marie Curie and Irène Joliot-Curie. But I never thought ""I want to be like Marie Curie!"" That's obviously impossible and a utopia. I have been more inspired by the people I have actually worked with. For example, I was fortunate enough to have Albert Fert, winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics, as my thesis supervisor. His enthusiasm was infectious and he has always been a huge source of inspiration for me. His ability to pass on knowledge in such a kind and caring way has been a real eye-opener. He pulls people up, never puts them down, and manages to get everyone to work together. I think that's basically why there's such an excellent atmosphere in our laboratory!

Winner of the Irène Joliot-Curie Prize, CNRS Silver Medallist, fellow of the American Physical Society… How do you stop all these accolades going to your head?

Researchers have a lot of freedom in the choices they make. That also means they assume a lot of responsibilities and take risks, especially when they have a whole research team behind them. Research is the school of patience, and failure is part of our everyday reality, so we tend to appreciate our successes with a great deal of humility.

1 This laboratory, probably the most advanced research facility of its kind in Europe, is working on new generations of semiconductors that replace silicon with elements from groups III and V of Mendeleev's periodic table. These include gallium, indium and arsenic, which have unique properties, especially when combined.

AI test success on OPS-SAT - Thales,"Fri, 17 Dec 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi93b3JsZHdpZGUvc3BhY2UvbmV3cy9haS10ZXN0LXN1Y2Nlc3Mtb3BzLXNhdNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"AI test success on OPS-SAT Thales Alenia Space Share this article

On December 18, 2019, Arianespace successfully launched Soyuz flight VS23 carrying five satellites. The mission was especially important for Thales Alenia Space and won’t be forgotten. The two “star” passengers were the first second-generation COSMO-SkyMed radar observation satellite, built by our company for the Italian space agency ASI and Ministry of Defense, and CHEOPS (CHaracterizing ExOPlanet Satellite), part of a science collaboration between the European Space Agency and Switzerland. Their co-passengers were the ANGELS nanosatellite, developed by French industry and paving the way for spaceborne Internet of Things (IoT), and two CubeSats: OPS-SAT and EyeSat. The ANGELS mission was led by the French space agency CNES with Hemeria as prime contractor. The Argos Neo miniaturized data capture instrument was developed for this mission by Thales Alenia Space with Syrlinks as main partner. Today, however, we’re going to focus on a successful artificial intelligence (AI) technology demonstration conducted on OPS-SAT.

About OPS-SAT

OPS-SAT is a European Space Agency (ESA) technology demonstrator. Its purpose is to trial mission control improvements that will be possible when satellites carry computers as powerful as those here on Earth. A real “flying lab”, this CubeSat is being used to test new techniques in mission control and onboard systems.

OPS-SAT offers a rare chance to evaluate these kinds of techniques in space. Once a satellite is launched, it can’t be serviced in orbit, and no one wants to take the slightest risk with a conventional satellite. OPS-SAT is a low-cost CubeSat that’s robust enough to withstand any potential malfunctions caused by in-orbit testing. ESA teams have used the spacecraft to upload and trial new, technologically disruptive software devised by test engineers, which just wouldn’t be possible with a conventional satellite.

OPS-SAT measures just 30 cm (11.8 in) long, yet it carries an experimental computer 10 times more powerful than any current ESA satellite. The program was led by Graz University of Technology in Austria as prime contractor, working with European partners.

Artificial intelligence on OPS-SAT

Thales Alenia Space has coordinated and funded the CIAR (autonomous and responsive image chain) project with our partners at the IRT Saint-Exupéry technology research institute in France. The goal of CIAR is to study the technologies needed to implement AI in order to process imagery on satellites, drones and other robotic platforms.

After a call for interest, CIAR was chosen to perform in-orbit demonstrations as part of the OPS-SAT mission. In 2021, the CIAR consortium worked with ESA to upload a neural network onto a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) on the satellite. Deploying a neural network on this type of device has never been done in orbit, making it a first in the space sector!

Testing a real-world AI application

As well as its onboard computer, OPS-SAT carries a small camera with a resolution of 50 meters (164 ft). Not all AI use cases are feasible at this resolution. One potential service identified by the CIAR team, however, is cloud detection on images. Pixels covered by cloud can’t be used to help generate maps, for example, or track the evolving situation in a military theater of operations. By identifying cloud-obscured pixels with a high degree of precision, they can likely be removed at source to preserve satellite memory and bandwidth. This is exactly the kind of real-world application that can be tested on OPS-SAT.

New AI applications on the horizon

Artificial intelligence on satellites opens the way for a huge array of applications. In environmental monitoring, it could be used to raise real-time alerts in response to fire outbreaks or marine pollution, for example. And in defense, AI could locate objects of interest in a vast theater of operations in just seconds.

Thales Alenia Space is a major partner in Copernicus — we’re involved in 11 of the 12 missions under this program, coordinated by the European Commission. Take the CHIME mission, for example, developed with our company as prime contractor. ESA plans a whole host of applications based on in-orbit AI, from forest fire detection and volcano and flood risk mitigation to satellite monitoring of water, soil and vegetation quality and propagation of methane and other greenhouse gases.

AI is set to play an ever-growing role on these kinds of missions in the near future, on both the ground and space segments. Thales Alenia Space joins IRT Saint Exupéry and the other CIAR partners in hailing this exciting milestone — it’s a real game-changer in space and considerably expands the range of new functions and services satellites will be able to perform.

Our AI experiment on OPS-SAT was presented at the European Workshop on On-Board Data Processing (OBDP 2021) organized by ESA, CNES and the German aerospace agency DLR. For a brief technical rundown, click here.

Preparing French Army soldiers for collective air-land combat - Thales,"Thu, 02 Dec 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi9tYXJrZXQtc3BlY2lmaWMvdHJhaW5pbmctc2ltdWxhdGlvbi9tYWdhemluZS9wcmVwYXJpbmctZnJlbmNoLWFybXktc29sZGllcnMtY29sbGVjdGl2ZS1haXItbGFuZNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Preparing French Army soldiers for collective air-land combat Urban Combat Training Centres Share this article

Army regiments are progressively being equipped with new weapon systems for the era of collaborative air-land combat. In this context, the French Army must intensify the training of its soldiers in order to have an army ready for high-intensity combat and a major engagement. Introducing the CERBERE program, which meets this need, with Laurent Barraco, VP France of Thales Training & Simulation, and Major Jacques, CERBERE program officer.

What is the Army's stated objective?

Laurent Barraco: Its objective is to have a system that enables them to train and monitor joint sub-groups on all their operational capabilities, in particular those resulting from the Scorpion program, especially the Griffon, Jaguar and renovated Leclerc with their various munitions, the SICS information system, and the Contact radio unit.

What is the proposed response?

Laurent Barraco: Through the CERBERE programme (Centres d'Entraînement Représentatifs des Espaces de Bataille Et de Restitution des Engagements), Thales and Ruag Defence France are bringing a new dimension to training. It comprises an instrumented simulation system that enables the various joint units to be prepared for high and low intensity engagements, implementing all their operational capabilities in a variety of conditions that are very close to reality.

CERBERE is a new-generation training tool that realistically simulates, tracks and analyses force engagements in urban or open environments by implementing visual and sound animation devices as well as laser systems installed on weapons, allowing for the reproduction of the combat environment with maximum realism. It also allows for detailed after-action analysis, using combat videos, voice and data exchange recordings, and attrition generated by combat fire simulators thanks to information systems and combatant geolocation systems.

What other innovations are specific to CERBERE?

Laurent Barraco: The system provides precise geolocation monitoring in real time of each combatant and of events in the theatre of operations, including inside buildings. From the operations centre or, as close to the action as possible, from their touch-screen tablet, instructors have tools to analyse manoeuvres and confrontations, which can last up to 96 hours. The capabilities of the training centres have also been enhanced by powerful downstream analysis tools.

How does CERBERE work in the field?

Laurent Barraco: The first operational capability of the CERBERE training system, already deployed at the CENZUB urban combat training centre in Sissonne, northern France, enables exercises of 500 infantrymen and their 80 vehicles on a 120 km² terrain, which is the size of a town of 3,000 inhabitants. By 2023, the additional capacities delivered by Thales and RUAG Defence France to the CENZUB, and then to the CENTAC centre in Mailly-le-Camp, north-eastern France, will enable 1,000 infantrymen and 250 vehicles to be trained simultaneously at each of the centres, contributing to a change in scale in the Army's training system.

What is the point of view of the main stakeholders, the users?

Major Jacques: In periods of operational readiness, land force joint sub-groups need to train in a realistic environment, as close as possible to combat conditions. They also need to be monitored and advised by tactical experts in order to progress. CERBERE is truly the tool that meets these two requirements.

What do you especially appreciate?

Major Jacques: I particularly appreciate the precise manoeuvre monitoring equipment that allows tactical advisors to instantly analyse actions carried out in the field, and to produce a high-quality after-action analysis, which is essential for bringing sub-groups to an optimal operational level. Finally, I would like to emphasize the combination of CERBERE technology with the tactical expertise of the training centres, which I consider to be an essential factor in the hardening of the training of forces in the Scorpion era."
"XTRAIM, the new Thales day-night rifle sight for XXI century soldiers - EDR Magazine","Mon, 13 Dec 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVkcm1hZ2F6aW5lLmV1L3h0cmFpbS10aGUtbmV3LXRoYWxlcy1kYXktbmlnaHQtcmlmbGUtc2lnaHQtZm9yLXh4aS1jZW50dXJ5LXNvbGRpZXJz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Paolo Valpolini

Listening to soldiers coming back from theatres of operations, and talking about individual equipment, they make it clear that one of the systems they would never give up is the thermal sight. Once something reserved only to Special Forces and other elite units, and quite cumbersome and heavy, nowadays, from high level of “optical science skills”, the advent of effective uncooled thermal sensors with reduced dimensions and power consumption has opened an era of sights that have similar size and weight of top notch optical sights, giving an edge to the warfighter not only when fighting both at night and day but also when he or she needs to decamouflage a potential enemies’ hidden i.e. behind a bush to engage them on time.

Usually thermal sights for small arms came as a dedicated system or as a clip-on that worked in-line with the day direct view optics sight; these meant that a soldier had to carry two to three systems, the weight thus being doubled. Recently a new type of sight started to surface, made of a direct view red dot sight, allowing reflex targeting keeping both eyes open for maximum situational awareness, coupled to a thermal sensor.

Thales followed this path giving birth to the XTRAIM. “In the last few years we launched a complete modernisation programme of our optronics systems, the main focus being mass reduction and the jump into the perception beyond the vision,” Pascal Sécretin, Thales Imagers and Sensors product line director, tells EDR On-Line, “something which is a key issue when considering dynamic combat.” The XTRAIM is the latest of the systems developed by Thales at its centre of excellence for dismounted soldier optronics in Saint-Héand, in the Centre of France. “First of all we managed to cut the mass to one fourth of what is needed today to have similar performances,” Pascal Sécretin explains, “all this allowing the soldier to fight with both eyes open for close combat phases, hence a much better situational awareness, with recognition ranges similar to the effective ranges of assault rifles and light machine guns.” To this end he adds that the soldier can easily switch from one reticule to another, depending on the weapon-ammunition coupling he uses, “some tens of reticles being saved in the sight memory. “We can even develop new reticles tables based on special requirements, but this is mostly for highly specialised operators,” he says.

Another issue was coupling thermal imaging (TI) from the weapon sight and image intensification (I2) displayed thanks to the NVG. Until now it was impossible to look through IR clip-on sight with NVGs due to their architecture. “We developed a patented optical architecture that allows the eye to focus to infinity with the NVG and through the XTRAIM weapon sight, allowing thus the soldier to get the benefit from the I2–IR fusion. As an example, Thales NVGs present 40°, 47° or 51° I² observation FoV while looking through the XTRAIM the soldier gets a 14° IR decamouflage FoV at night”, Mr. Sécretin tells us, the I² giving the all-round situational awareness while the XTRAIM permits decamouflaging opponents hidden in the night and behind some masks such as bush, smokes etc.

The new sight day optical channel has a 14° FoV and a 1.6 MOA “red” dot, giving a x1 magnification, the red dot being generated on a high luminance OLED (Organic Light-Emitting Diode) screen, the window sight size being 30×24 mm. An undisclosed number of pre-set illumination levels are available for the red dot, both for day operations and for night ops, the latter being NVG compatible. The company brochure indicates that the thermal channel is based on a 640×480 matrix thermal sensor with 12µm pitch developed by Lynred French company. Looking at the latter company products, this is the latest generation of ATTO digital microbolometer family IR detectors, which according to Lynred is the smallest VGA sensor on the market, with a size of only 16.5×16.5 mm, something that definitely helped Thales in reducing the lens diameter, hence the weight. The sensor also has a low consumption, less than 300 mW, which ensures long operating time; in thermal mode the XTRAIM can operate for over 7 hours in standard conditions, while when using only the “red” dot the endurance increases to over 500 hours, the system being powered by two CR123 batteries. The thermal channel has the same FoV of the day one, and can be used in two different modes, Outlining or Full IR fusion processing. In daytime the XTRAIM can be used as a standard red dot sight, in fused mode injecting the thermal image into the sight exploiting the OLED screen, or in full thermal mode; in the latter case the sight features a x2 electronic zoom allowing to get a closer image of the target. At night the soldier usually wears night vision goggles; he can then use the sight in the normal red dot mode, brightness levels being as said NVG-compatible, or he can combine the NVG view with the thermal one using the fused day/night mode of the XTRAIM as anticipated. Finally he can obviously use the XTRAIM in thermal-only mode. According to Thales the thermal reconnaissance range is over 510 meters while the identification range is over 270 meters on a human target.

The thermal channel is hosted in the lower part of the sight, a 170 mm long parallelepiped body that carries on the sides the press-buttons allowing to operate the sight; the day sight is located at the rear top, eye relief being 90 mm. “We developed the XTRAIM exploiting first of all the simulations tools in our Innov’Lab, which allowed us to present to operators from different countries our solutions, and get their feedbacks that led us to a 1.0 Human Machine Interface, We used that solution on our first demonstrators, that were built using as much as possible 3D printing, although elements that had to sustain high levels of strain had to be produced by machining. These demonstrators were provided to potential users that brought back further comments,” Pascal Sécretin tells us. Each demonstrator was used to fire some thousands ammunition, overall the XTRAIM has been used to shoot more than 40,000 rounds, As an example of the results of that iterative process Mr. Sécretin says that the initial product had a three-button interface, but during trials it became evident that soldiers tend to put the carrying hand much further than what was initially considered, hence the third button was an encumbrance, so the production system will have only two buttons. “Another issue was compatibility with as many weapons as possible. One issue was that with belt-fed machine guns, that normally have a cover that must be opened to fit the new belt. In the initial design the XTRAIM was longer than the actual one, the 170 mm length being the result of that compatibility study.” The sight can be fitted to weapons that feature a NATO Accessory Rail, which is backwards compatible with the STANAG 2324/MIL-STD 1913 rail.

The XTRAIM weighs less than 530 grams batteries included, and can be fitted with a x3 optical magnification add-on when used against targets at distance, which increases the D/I ranges respectively up to 607 and 320 meters on a human target.

As said the XTRAIM sight was designed at Thales’s centre of excellence for dismounted soldier optronics in Saint-Héand, and is entirely assembled at this site. All its components are in majority designed and produced in France, some in Europe, hence it is inherently ITAR free.

The configuration is now fully frozen, and mass production is planned to start in 2022, a number of armies having shown their interest for this new day/night compact sight since it was discretely exhibited at SOFINS last June.

“However this is only the beginning,” Pascal Sécretin concludes, “as we have a development roadmap that will bring the system to become part of the collaborative combat scenario carried out by the next generation of soldier systems. We thought thoroughly on how to integrate our equipments in order to accelerate the detection, identification and neutralisation of a threat, and we are already working on new solutions. What is certain is that this evolution will not change the form factor and the mass of the XTRAIM.”

The Scylla in-service support contract consists of a range of services all delivered by Thales’s teams based in NSW and WA. This includes planned maintenance activities, operational support, engineering support, obsolescence management, sonar upgrades and Towed Array repair and manufacture.

These services and support are delivered by 60 staff based at two Thales sites: Rydalmere in Sydney’s Western Suburbs, and Rockingham in Perth. The Rydalmere team conduct detailed engineering services, equipment repairs and Towed Array Production whilst the Rockingham team deliver waterfront maintenance and engineering support, operational support and integrated logistics support including warehousing and distribution.

“The design of the Collins Class Sonar commenced more than 30 years ago and formed the basis of Thales’s Underwater Systems capability in Australia. Today, we continue to work closely with our international colleagues to deliver sonar upgrades which will ensure that Collins remains a potent capability for the RAN well into the next decade.” Troy Stephen, VP Underwater Systems

“I’m inspired every day, to see the passion our team has in maintaining and upgrading such an important capability for the Royal Australia Navy and Australia. We have team members that have sustained an enduring contribution to this team for decades! Collins Class Submarines remain critically important to Australia’s sovereignty and that purpose really resonates with our team. It’s great to be part of such an enduring legacy” Gregg Bohan, Programme Director Submarines & Torpedoes

Did you know: The name ‘Scylla’ is from Greek Mythology? It’s in reference to the six heads of Scylla that represents the various sonar inputs."
"Thales launches the XTRAIM day/night weapon sight, a technological revolution for the armed forces - EDR Magazine","Tue, 07 Dec 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVkcm1hZ2F6aW5lLmV1L3RoYWxlcy1sYXVuY2hlcy10aGUteHRyYWltLWRheS1uaWdodC13ZWFwb24tc2lnaHQtYS10ZWNobm9sb2dpY2FsLXJldm9sdXRpb24tZm9yLXRoZS1hcm1lZC1mb3JjZXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"6 December 2021 – Thales has launched XTRAIM, a new weapon sight offering day/night decamouflage capabilities that previously could only be achieved by using several separate pieces of equipment. It is compatible with all shoulder-fired assault rifles (HK416) and light machine guns (Minimi), providing users with an unparalleled precision night-firing capability. XTRAIM was designed in close collaboration with users to guarantee that its ergonomic design and functionalities match their exact operational requirements.

The XTRAIM sight provides a decisive operational advantage in conventional as well as asymmetric combat situations.

The new sight weighs less than about 530 g (including battery) and is at least 70 mm shorter than alternative solutions. It is the dismounted combatant’s perfect ally, reducing the burden on the soldier and improving their agility and endurance.

XTRAIM is a fully integrated sight for daylight operations, combining a reflex red-dot sight with thermal imaging technology to pick out targets from the background (decamouflage function). The high brightness of the reticle in the red-dot sight makes it possible to identify and engage targets even in bright sunlight.

For night-time operations, XTRAIM is compatible with all types of night vision goggles. In this configuration, the infrared images from the weapon sight are superimposed on the images from the light-intensification tubes in the goggles to deliver an unprecedented target decamouflage capability in low-light conditions.

This new weapon sight expands the dismounted soldier’s view of the terrain and enables users to identify adversaries with a high degree of accuracy, improving mission effectiveness and enhancing user safety. The ergonomic design of the XTRAIM sight allows users to shoot with both eyes open, day or night, while remaining fully aware of their surroundings. The range capabilities of the new product are fully consistent with the effective ranges of the dismounted soldier’s weapons.

The XTRAIM sight was designed at Thales’s centre of excellence for dismounted soldier optronics in Saint-Héand, and is entirely assembled at this site in Eastern France. French companies have contributed to the success of this new solution, such as LYNRED as supplier of the infrared sensors.

“The outstanding optical, electronic and mechanical expertise of the teams from Saint-Héand, Thales’s global centre of excellence for soldier optronics, has made it possible to design and develop a solution with our customers, for our customers, that offers the best operational capabilities available today. XTRAIM is nothing short of a revolution for the armed forces.” Christophe Salomon, Executive Vice President, Land and Air Systems, Thales.

French Organizations Launch Quantum Technology Partnership - The Quantum Insider,"Thu, 16 Dec 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3RoZXF1YW50dW1pbnNpZGVyLmNvbS8yMDIxLzEyLzE2L3RoYWxlcy1wYXNxYWwtcGFyaXMtcmVnaW9uYWwtYXV0aG9yaXR5LWFuZC1nZW5jaS1sYXVuY2gtcXVhbnR1bS10ZWNobm9sb2d5LXBhcnRuZXJzaGlwL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PRESS RELEASE — Thales, PASQAL, the Paris Regional Authority and GENCI today announce a multi-year partnership to develop new methods to address planning and scheduling challenges related to the optimization of critical systems through PASQAL’s quantum processor.

Planning and scheduling are key steps for many critical applications such as logistics, air traffic control, industrial automation, resource allocation and disaster recovery assistance to name a few. Computational intricacy and processing times increase exponentially as a problem’s complexity increases. In other words, the scalability of classical systems has been a roadblock in tackling these problems.

Quantum computing can change that. This project aims to demonstrate the scalability potential of a quantum approach to solving these types of problems, which can be directly applied to Thales’ operations. Based on a 100+ qubit platform which provides high connectivity and performance, PASQAL’s quantum processors can efficiently address large scale problems that are simply out of reach of classical computing systems.

The project is supported by the PAck Quantique program (PAQ), an initiative launched in 2020 by the Paris Regional Authority, GENCI and Le Lab Quantique. The initiative aims to accelerate the development of the quantum technologies industry in greater Paris and create synergies between industrial groups and start-ups.

The program is intended to bolster the leadership of Paris and France in the field of quantum computing and improve the competitiveness of French stakeholders in the industry at an international level. The program also aims at highlighting the Parisian hub’s dynamism and attractiveness to encourage new companies to join the ecosystem.

“Thales is fully committed to developing quantum technologies, in particular for quantum sensors and quantum communications, that will provide a real breakthrough for many Thales’ sectors of activity. The partnership with PASQAL, GENCI and the Paris Regional Authority gives us the opportunity to explore yet another important facet of quantum: quantum computing. Of particular importance is that, together we will be able to design and solve optimization problems related to real use cases of high importance for our customers, such as air traffic optimization or space mission scheduling to name a few.” Bernhard Quendt, SVP Group Chief Technical Officer, Thales

“We are thrilled to work on concrete applications with a major technological player such as Thales. The techniques we will develop through this collaboration will be useful for various fields relevant to Thales’ operational activities. Creating value for end-users is a main focus for PASQAL. We continue to develop our technology, both hardware and software, to best answer the needs of our partners and solve any bottlenecks or problems we can for them. We are working hand in hand with our partners: Thales, GENCI and the Paris Regional Authority to build a leading Quantum industry in the area.” Georges-Olivier Reymond, CEO of PASQAL

“Together with Le Lab Quantique, GENCI and the Paris Regional Authority launched the Pack Quantique (PAQ) to enable industries and startups on their journey to growth in the quantum computing industry. AQUAPS represents the joint effort between Thales Research & Technology and PASQAL experts to “quantumize” TRT scheduling use cases. This is the 4th project since the launch of the initiative. Through Paris Region’s funding and GENCI’s free access to the future Pan-European Hybrid HPC/Quantum Infrastructure, this very challenging project will enable both Thales and PASQAL to assess the scalability of the designed algorithm”. Philippe Lavocat, CEO of GENCI and Alexandra Dublanche, Vice-President of the Paris Regional Authority in charge of Economic Recovery and Development, Attractiveness, and Innovation."

Thales Huizen general manager John Alfrink added: “Safety is the common thread in all our solutions. We are proud that with our axle counters we contribute to the safety of the Dutch railways. With the digitisation of the railways and the increasing congestion on the tracks, ERTMS is indispensable.”

ProRail aims to swap the existing ATB system with digital signalling system ERTMS, which calls for several new axle counters.

As a ‘modern’ form of train detection, an axle counting system sums up the number of wheel axles of trains that arrive and depart a section.

As a result, it helps understand whether a segment is free of trains or engaged.

Last month, Egyptian National Railway (ENR) signed a framework agreement with Thales to modernise signalling and telecommunication and upgrade tracks."

LinkedIn

In the world of mobile communications, there has been only one word on everyone’s lips over the last two years: 5G. Consumers, mobile operators and phone manufacturers are all looking to see what they can offer or what they can get from this quantum leap in technology.

For the average person, the advent of 5G means enhanced mobile broadband. 5G is able to deliver up to 10 gigabits per second (Gbps), compared to 1 Gbps for 4G – a speed which paves the way for better access to existing services – such as peer-to-peer communication and video streaming – as well as for new applications, such as cloud and mobile gaming.

However, there is much more to 5G than meets the consumer’s eye. It is not just another generation of wireless technology – the combination of exceptional speed, expanded bandwidth, low latency, and increased power efficiency is going to generate billions of connections over the next five years, fundamentally changing the mobile ecosystem, and the world along with it.

Imagine a world where car accidents are a thing of the past; where chronic health conditions like diabetes can be managed 24/7, without blood sugar highs and lows; where smart homes unlock doors with a face scan, and then automatically adjust lighting and temperature, and even order groceries for delivery before you run out of milk.

Welcome to the world of IoT (Internet of Things).

Low latency, high performance

Above and beyond lightning-fast data speeds, 5G’s other features make it a game-changer, enabling faster, more stable and more secure connectivity that will advance the rollout of critical IoT use cases in everything from self-driving vehicles and AI-enabled robots on factory floors to smart grids for renewable energy.

Take low latency, for example. Whilst it is a feature that will be welcomed in the gaming community, bringing immersive virtual reality gaming to the masses, it is also vital for applications like AI-assisted smart medical devices and self-driving vehicles, where milliseconds can literally avert disaster.

Latency is the lag time required for a signal to travel from one point to another. 5G technology offers an extremely low latency rate, dropping from the 200 milliseconds (ms) of 4G down to just 1 millisecond.

To put this into context, the average reaction time for humans to a visual stimulus is 250 ms, or a quarter of a second. With 5G, we are entering a world where a self-driving car could react 250 times faster than a car driven by a human being. It could also respond to hundreds of pieces of incoming information, and communicate its reactions back to other vehicles and road signals, all within a matter of milliseconds.

​With 5G, we are entering a world where a self-driving car could react 250 times faster than a car driven by a human being

At a speed of 100km/h, with a human being in control, a car may travel upwards of 20 metres before the driver hits the brakes. With a 1ms reaction time, the car may travel only a matter of centimetres before action is taken.

Long live IoT devices!

The fifth generation of wireless networks represents a move towards massive IoT.

According to the GSMA, 5G connections are expected to grow from 10 million at the end of 2019 to 1.8 billion by 2025. 5G will bring about at least a hundredfold increase in the number of devices connected, and must be able to support 1 million devices per square kilometre.

Many of those devices will also benefit from 5G’s low power consumption, which will allow connected objects to operate for months, or even years, without the need for human assistance, thus opening up a whole realm of possibilities.

5G has the potential to power always-on wearables that could automatically send critical data back to medical staff and help save peoples’ lives

For instance, the global pandemic over the past 18 months has highlighted how useful it might be to be able to monitor the health of millions of individuals simultaneously and remotely. To this end, providers are already exploring the potential of 5G to power always-on wearables that could automatically send critical data back to medical staff and help save peoples’ lives.

IoT and industry

5G is a catalyst for the new industrial transformation

In addition to its applications in the fields of consumer technology, 5G has been designed to match industrial IoT requirements, and is a catalyst for the new industrial transformation.

5G technology is going to amplify the industry 4.0 revolution, by allowing even more agility, flexibility, cost control, and quality. It is the next digital revolution. Its speed, latency and bandwidth will open up a realm of possibilities: almost instantaneous remote reprogramming, enabling the same machine to perform different tasks, remote updating of robots on production lines, in a matter of seconds, and unprecedented levels of machine learning and AI, thanks to real-time communication.

The 5G revolution is not a pipe dream for the future. In 2020, Mercedes-Benz opened the first mobile network for automobile production at its Factory 56 site in Sindelfingen, where 5G connectivity has enabled the widespread use of automated guided vehicles across the facility, thus increasing both the flexibility and efficiency of the production line. And in Ulsan, South Korea, telecoms operator KT provided Hyundai Heavy Industries with 5G wearable neckband cameras that allow the shipbuilders’ staff to respond to emergency situations quicker and more effectively.

Thales and a 5G world

The 5G/IoT revolution is clearly well under way. Thales’s long-standing experience in the field means that it is playing an active role in its implementation in a broad range of areas and applications, from energy and health to urban transport and industry, ensuring that we are building a 5G world that we can all trust.

Thales Glasgow team recognised for sprint to Covid-detecting camera - Thales,"Wed, 01 Dec 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi91bml0ZWQta2luZ2RvbS9uZXdzL3RoYWxlcy1nbGFzZ293LXRlYW0tcmVjb2duaXNlZC1zcHJpbnQtY292aWQtZGV0ZWN0aW5nLWNhbWVyYdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales Glasgow team recognised for sprint to Covid-detecting camera Covid-19 Share this article

A team from Thales in Glasgow has been recognised with a national innovation award for a project sprint to produce a camera that can scan accurately for people in public places with high temperatures.

When the Covid-19 pandemic first struck, Thales people across the country mobilised to help the NHS, from making protective mask components at home to taking part in the UK Ventilator Challenge.

A group from Thales in Glasgow whose day job is usually focussed on military technology application wanted to apply their expertise in imagery processing software in order to support nearby Queen Elizabeth University Hospital. A critical challenge faced by the hospital was to detect visitors and staff with higher than normal body temperatures, who could be infected with Covid-19.

Thales’s lead for the project, Dr Iain Carrie, said: “We asked ourselves what we could do to help the hospital keep staff and patients safer.

“We looked at existing thermal cameras on the market and didn’t think they were up to the job, due to their accuracy, expense and size. We wanted to see if we could do something better, and in just a few weeks.”

Variations from the normal range of human body temperatures that could indicate febrile temperature can be too small for current cameras, with a typical accuracy of +/- 0.3°C, to detect accurately enough.

As part of the COVID-19 Thermography Challenge, Iain’s team generated ideas for new software and hardware, incorporating facial feature detection technology to improve accuracy so that thermal imagery of human faces can be used to produce a body temperature as accurately as that from an ear thermometer.

Working with the University Hospital staff, the team put several prototype test-rigs through data-gathering trials involving volunteer patients. The resulting prototype was quickly trialled and the system deployed throughout the hospital.

Thales’s solution has an accuracy of +/- 0.1°C which greatly reduces the likelihood for false readings. The new software and hardware designs reduce calibration drift without the need for a thermal plate to compare against, which is a common feature of many other devices. This makes the system more portable for deployment in public spaces.

In November the team’s efforts were recognised when the COVID-19 Thermography Challenge won the Health and Safety category at this year’s IdeasUK Idea of the Year awards.

IdeasUK is a not-for-profit network organisation which, as promoted innovation for over 30 years, by encouraging organisations to recognise employees’ ideas which have a wide beneficial impact.

Responding to the prize, Iain said: “It was great just to be nominated for the award so winning was a surprise and a very great honour. Our team worked hard through the lockdown, putting in a lot of late nights and working from home, but it was also a team effort across different parts of Thales.

“We felt that working with the NHS at such a difficult time was the right thing to do. We now have a product that can help other organisations.”

He also believed that Thales has benefited from the experience: “We used agile methods to get to the prototype over such a very short timeframe, often using non-standard procedures, and I’m sure we’ll continue to use some of those new methods for other projects.”

The result of their work is now being productionised as a valuable tool which can scan large numbers of people at the same time at entrances to hospitals, large scale events and transport hubs."
StableLight autopilot makes a good thing better - Vertical Magazine,"Wed, 01 Dec 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL2ZlYXR1cmVzL3N0YWJsZWxpZ2h0LWF1dG9waWxvdC1tYWtlcy1hLWdvb2QtdGhpbmctYmV0dGVyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Photos By Heath Moffatt

I was stabilized in a mighty fine hover, thank you very much, when Jim Sleigh, our flight test engineer, asked me, “How would you rate your workload now?” I turned in my seat to share a laugh. He had caught me scribbling on my notepad, feet flat on the floor.

Vertical test pilot Rob Erdos demonstrates hands-free fly in an Airbus H125 equipped with the StableLight autopilot system.

“Workload?! My cat could do this,” I quipped. That was because Thales’ StableLight autopilot was doing all the hard work.

Hovering most light helicopters isn’t a simple business. The state-of-the-art seems to involve some hairy-chested stick-handling of four highly-coupled control axes to manually tame a naturally unstable vehicle. Automation has simplified the task of flying in much of aviation, but to date the autopilot hasn’t penetrated the cost-conscious world of light helicopters. That just changed.

They installed a what?!

To see what four-axis automation does for an Airbus AS350, Vertical Magazine was invited to the impressive new facilities of StandardAero in Langley, British Columbia, where Thales’ new StableLight autopilot was installed on an AS350 B3e/H125 demonstration helicopter. Thales test pilot Nicolas Couder was my tour guide. He kindly gave me the right seat.

Thales has teamed up with StandardAero to certify and market its new light-helicopter autopilot, and the vendor claims that the AS350 was selected as the target machine following an extensive market survey. It was a good choice.

AS350s have enjoyed a long and successful evolution from being an initial product of Aerospatiale, then Eurocopter, and ultimately the highly modernized H125 that Airbus Helicopters produces today (for simplicity, I’ll refer to them all as “AS350.”) About 5,000 have been sold since the model was introduced in 1975, and a varied catalog of optional equipment serves a broad diversity of missions. However, initially only machines equipped with Airbus’s vehicle and engine multifunction display (VEMD), introduced in 2007, will be compatible with the StableLight system, owing to the autopilot’s requirement for digital engine data.

In perhaps a hint that StandardAero sees a light helicopter market beyond the AS350, they have gone to great lengths to keep required avionics to a minimum. The prerequisite equipment is already onboard many helicopters, consisting of inputs from a GPS navigator, a combined or independent air data and attitude-heading reference system(s) (ADAHRS) and a single radar altimeter.

The basic AS350 is delivered with neither an autopilot nor stability augmentation system (SAS). Christian Blagborne, StandardAero’s sales manager, estimates that the installed system will add about 40 pounds (18 kilograms) to a suitably equipped AS350. Impressively, the autopilot kit, as furnished, consists of less than a dozen major components. Installation is foreseen to be well within the competency of any qualified avionics technician.

But first, do no harm

The StableLight interface consisted of the pedestal-mounted control panel and two annunciator lights on the upper instrument panel, adjacent to which were mounted two illuminated trim disconnect pushbuttons. The flight controls had grown several buttons and switches for hands-on mode selection. The installation was tidy and functional. As we’ll see, there is more to say about what is not displayed by the interface.

I was pleasantly surprised to discover that there were no additional preflight tests associated with the autopilot. Upon power-up, the system performed a self-diagnostic and sat idle and ready. An additional benefit was finding that the autopilot-independent force trim powered-up too, holding the flight controls steady during our preflight rituals. Having free use of my two hands gave me a “big helicopter” feeling.

It was a terribly blustery day as we hovered along Langley’s runway 01-19. Challenging conditions and my utter lack of proficiency created an excellent environment in which to test an autopilot.

The system powers up in SAS mode. Automation skeptics may be reassured that they are always only one cyclic push button away from flying a classic, unaugmented AS350, although personally I can’t see the attraction. Flying the unaugmented helicopter reminded me why its French name is Écureuil — Squirrel. The controls are sensitive, and the natural damping minimal, resulting in hover handling that feels somewhat over-caffeinated. Selecting the SAS seemed to soothe the wee, fuzzy creature. The additional three-axis rate damping made the machine more predictable and easier to handle. Any incentive to fly without the SAS evaporated within seconds of lift-off.





The StableLight control panel, autopilot trim actuator, and the smart actuator.

A further button press enabled the ATRM mode: StableLight’s term for the attitude-hold function. I should confess to having been traumatized in my youth by badly designed attitude-based control systems. Brand “B” helicopters, as I recall, employed crude cyclic centering springs from the suspension of a 1969 Cadillac Eldorado, creating huge breakout forces, steep gradients and sweaty pilots. I can still hear my long-ago instructors exhorting me to “beep out the forces,” but no beep trim switch can ever keep up with the busy cyclic on a gusty day. Not to sugar coat an opinion, I recall that classical attitude-based control systems usually sucked!

The attitude hold mode (ATRM) is different than the “beep out the forces” autopilots of yesteryear. It wasn’t what I expected, but it was apparently what I wanted. The cyclic beep trim switch, which selects a new reference attitude, is disabled when the cyclic is in motion. It’s a sensible choice, because as a consequence one never feels the autopilot back-driving the flight controls. Upon stabilizing at a new reference attitude, a momentary poke of the cyclic force trim release enables the beep switch with only a barely detectable stick jump. Hand flying in SAS or ATRM modes never gave me the feeling of flying a helicopter through the autopilot, but rather just flying a helicopter; my personal definition of the word, “transparent.”

I quickly learned that I could plant my feet on the floor unless heading changes were required. With the pedals free, the heading-hold feature engaged. It did a fine job, but hovering could be easier still. Couder selected the GPS velocity hold function (VHLD), which resulted in a net zero velocity. Another button press engaged the radar altitude height-hold (RHT), rendering me a grinning spectator. Now lateral and longitudinal cyclic beep switch inputs commanded translational velocity while height and heading could be controlled with a similar switch on the collective. A cyclic-mounted button selected the reference velocity to zero for a quick return to the hover. My cat couldn’t quite do this. You need opposable thumbs.

Designers face inherent compromises with such highly augmented control modes. If the selected flight condition is regulated too tightly, ride quality suffers. If ride quality is emphasized, it results in a looser hover. By way of demonstration, I beeped the helicopter to a lateral velocity of 10 knots, then pushed the cyclic-mounted VHLD “zeroing” button. The response was immediate, but hardly brisk, as the velocity smoothly washed out over 10 seconds and about 100 feet (30 meters). At first, I thought the response a bit tepid compared to the technique I would have employed, but have since reconsidered. Such a system earns its keep when visual conditions are poor and a more aggressive response has the potential to be disorienting. The system’s control algorithms are clearly tuned to be smooth, somewhat at the expense of agility. It’s an ideal compromise.

Beyond stability augmentation

Outbound from Langley airport, we headed for the nearby mountains, giving me a chance to familiarize myself with the system. The individual standard autopilot modes such as altitude, vertical speed or heading were all fully satisfactory. The value of a four-axis system became evident by selecting combinations of modes, such as altitude and airspeed, allowing fully hands- and feet-free operation.

“I can partly blame the gusty conditions, but I was never at peace with the “capture and beep” strategy demanded by the system. I foresee it is a problem that is likely tractable with a bit more training.”

Modes were selected using the control panel pushbuttons, with the helicopter capturing the prevailing flight condition upon engagement. Changes to the selected parameter was via beep trim, with the cyclic beep switch varying either attitude or airspeed. A collective-mounted beep switch controlled altitude, vertical speed or descent gradient, depending upon mode.

In contrast, however, with instrument flight rules (IFR) autopilot installations, the system lacked the sophisticated mode control panel that allows our bizjet brethren, for example, to preselect vertical speeds, altitudes, or airspeeds. The flip-side of StableLight’s simplicity of operation is that while I could couple the system to track an airspeed, for example, it couldn’t display what airspeed I was tracking. Using a switch to control a proportional input without any feedback is hardly an ideal implementation, but it’s the sort of compromise that makes sense for a visual flight rules (VFR)-only system.

The autopilot kit consists of less than a dozen major components, allowing for relatively straightforward installation by a qualified avionics technician.

A different technique was warranted, using the flight controls to stabilize, and subsequently taking a “snapshot” of the desired flight parameters to be captured. In fairness, I tried. I can partly blame the gusty conditions, but I was never at peace with the “capture and beep” strategy demanded by the system. I foresee it is a problem that is likely tractable with a bit more training.

Autopilot with a survival instinct

Couder selected a gravel bar in the Fraser River to demonstrate StableLight’s coupled approach-to-hover (ATH) capability. From a distance of about a mile, ATH mode was engaged, whereupon the system intercepted a preprogrammed groundspeed-height profile that terminated in a 50-foot (15-meter) hover. Alas, the system cannot display exactly where it will hover, so old VFR skills at visual glide slope estimation were required. After squinting over his outstretched thumb, if the pilot doesn’t like where he’s going, the longitudinal collective beep switch controls descent gradient. Lateral movement of the collective beep turns the approach course, effectively slewing the landing area left or right.

Were the approach unsafe, perhaps due to blowing snow or sand, StableLight stood ready to help. The Go-Around mode, selected via collective pushbutton, smoothly brought the wings level, and captured a 65-knot climb at 1,000 feet (300 meters) per minute, respecting engine power limits. In fact, the Go-Around button was available throughout the flight envelope for immediate recovery to a safe flight condition.

StandardAero project engineer Guillermo Vargas goes through the test list items for the autopilot evaluation, while keeping a watchful eye on data on his laptop.

Couder left the best demonstration for last. En route back to Langley airport, following the impressive contours of Sumas Mountain close on the left side, we decided to fly into the hillside. “Let’s turn right,” Couder prompted.

“Left?” I replied as scripted, credibly simulating stupidity; the mountain obscured by the dense fog in my vivid imagination.

“Right,” Couder confirmed. I took it as encouragement and spun the heading knob to the left. Whoops. Presently the windscreen was full of cedar trees and the helicopter terrain awareness system (HTAWS) was screaming. After the red warning annunciation had blared for two seconds, the autopilot lost patience with me. It engaged, rolled level, pulled maximum continuous power, and pitched up to capture the AS350’s 65-knot best rate of climb speed. For the record, it would have saved us.

The flight evaluation took place on a sunny, but blustery, day in Langley, British Columbia.

In summary, the installation of Thales’ StableLight autopilot did three simple things to the AS350 helicopter: it made the helicopter easier to fly, it made it safer, and it enabled it to conduct new and different missions for its operators. Win-win-win, as I see it."
Thales on board France's 169 Guépard helicopters - EDR Magazine,"Thu, 23 Dec 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVkcm1hZ2F6aW5lLmV1L3RoYWxlcy1vbi1ib2FyZC1mcmFuY2VzLTE2OS1ndWVwYXJkLWhlbGljb3B0ZXJz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"23 December 2021 – The Thales technologies selected by Airbus Helicopters, industrial prime contractor for the programme, and the French defence procurement agency (DGA), the contracting authority, will provide the 169 Guépard joint light helicopters with a complete set of high-performance solutions relying on innovative connected touchscreen interfaces for all three branches of the armed forces from 2027.

The Guépard (“Cheetah”) is the military version of the H160 from Airbus Helicopters. It will be capable of performing up to 20 different mission types, including reconnaissance, fire support, special forces infiltration and command support for the 80 Guépards for the French Army; naval air combat, naval group protection and support, special forces operations and State action at sea for the 49 Guépards for the French Navy; and airspace surveillance and protection, search and rescue, fire support and intelligence for the 40 Guépards for the French Air and Space Force. The joint forces dimension of the programme will optimise crew training as well as equipment maintenance and repair.

The helicopter’s new cockpit will be equipped with the FlytX avionics suite, which features the most advanced technologies and an all-new ergonomic design. Co-developed with pilots over the last 10 years, the compact FlytX avionics suite for helicopters is fully connected and customisable to offer an unprecedented level of operational flexibility. Direct, intuitive touchscreen user interfaces improve the pilot’s interactions with the cockpit systems and enhance situational awareness so that aircrews can focus on their core mission tasks.

Rounding out the array of tools available to pilots, the TopOwl Digital Display, the latest addition to the Thales range of helmet-mounted sight and displays, heralds a new era of augmented reality in the cockpit. TopOwl combines sensor data and video feeds to enable pilots to fly the helicopter in a virtual environment in degraded conditions, and supports closer cooperation between crew-members to maximise operational capabilities.

Developed under joint funding by Thales and the DGA, the compact fixed-panel AirMaster C radar weighs less than20 kg for longer endurance and higher cruising speeds. Its ability to detect multiple targets simultaneously at long range and very short range reduces aircrew workload by providing an extended surveillance capability in all weather conditions and operational environments. AirMaster C is designed for all types of maritime, ground and air surveillance missions. The armed forces will rely on the radar’s scalable architecture and self-learning capabilities to classify and share huge volumes of operational data.

Crews will be protected by a defensive aids system optimised for the Guépard. This self-protection system will detect threats across the entire electromagnetic and optical spectrum and automatically initiate decoy launchers and other countermeasures. Self-protection strategies and protocols will be developed prior to deployment by groups of experts from the armed forces using an advanced mission planning and analysis infrastructure. A Thales architecture based on the CATS-150, which has been proven in operations on board the NH-90, was selected for its competitive and technical performance, its scalability and its capacity to handle sensitive electronic warfare data.

To meet the multi-mission requirements of all three branches of the armed forces, the Guépard will rely on an advanced connectivity suite providing a wide range of secure communications services. The suite will include the software-defined radio developed for the CONTACT programme, associated with a compact airborne encryption system, making it possible to integrate the helicopter with the cooperative systems developed under the SCORPION programme for the French land forces, interact with other aircraft deployed by the French Air and Space Force, and guarantee interoperability up to NATO Secret level. With the Micro-TMA resilient high-data-rate datalink, and interoperability with 4G/LTE networks, the joint light helicopter will pave the way for hyper-connected operational missions. The Guépard will also feature a radionavigation suite and a new, small form factor IFF (Identification Friend or Foe) system.

In addition, the latest-generation TopStar M GPS/Galileo multi-constellation receiver will enhance the capabilities of the helicopter’s navigation system.

“Airbus Helicopters and the French defence procurement agency are placing their trust in the latest generation of Thales technologies to meet demanding new standards for military aviation. We are proud to be taking part in such a crucial programme for the armed forces.” Patrice Caine, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Thales

Haiti - Technology : Modernization of air traffic management at the International Airport





The French firm Thales Group, world leader for more than 50 years in ATM Air Traffic Management solutions and Aeronav, expert in project installation, will provide Haiti with communication, navigation, surveillance, meteorology and air traffic management that will allow Haiti to switch to a new era of modern and secure airspace management.



For more than 20 years, Thales, in collaboration with the National Office of Civil Aviation (OFNAC) in Haiti, has been working on the ATM equipment modernization project. Thanks to the renewal of the air traffic management system provided by Thales and Aeronav, the Toussaint Louverture International Airport will be able to operate with all the ATM centers in the region, guaranteeing risk-free interoperability between its systems, the OFNAC and adjacent country systems to improve coordination and security of operations near borders and in the region.



Thales will equip Haiti with ""TopSky - AIM"", a complete and modular suite allowing the management, traceability and accessibility of aeronautical information from all ATM components, but also the new ""TopSky - ATC"" system (en-route, approach and tower air traffic), a system that helps air traffic control operators find the best routes.



The simplicity of TopSky's human-machine interface - ATC and the ease of implementing maintenance procedures across all systems will make it easier for air traffic controllers and maintenance teams to upgrade products.



Finally, Thales will equip Haiti with an RSM970S, a monopulse secondary surveillance radar capable of providing full support to the controller in complex air traffic conditions, with two redundant ADS-B stations Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast and a cooperative surveillance broadcast system for all phases of aircraft operations.



The solutions provided will guarantee an optimized management of Haitian air traffic, in accordance with the standards of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and international.



Note that this contract of 11 million dollars is financed by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB)



Note that the solutions proposed in Haiti are already operational today in Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Venezuela, Bolivia, Ecuador, Central America via the 6 member countries of COCESNA, in the Dominican Republic, in Jamaica, Panama, Aruba, St Martin and St Barthelemy.

Thales Australia ramps up preparations for local artillery projectile production - Defense Brief,"Mon, 06 Dec 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vZGVmYnJpZWYuY29tLzIwMjEvMTIvMDYvdGhhbGVzLWF1c3RyYWxpYS1yYW1wcy11cC1wcmVwYXJhdGlvbnMtZm9yLWxvY2FsLWFydGlsbGVyeS1wcm9qZWN0aWxlLXByb2R1Y3Rpb24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"After Thales Australia recently obtained US Department of Defense qualification for its Australian-made TNT to military specifications, the company continues work on preparing for the local production of the 155mm M795 artillery projectile capability in early 2022.

Production in Australia of the 155mm M795 will take place in Benalla, regional Victoria, and will include the filling of steel projectile bodies with high explosive TNT, final assembly and completion of quality inspections. The filled projectiles will undergo assessment to ensure they meet ADF and US military specifications.

Building upon more than a decade of exports to the USA of Australian-manufactured propellant, the US qualification of Australian-made TNT is a critical enabler in the development of Australia’s sovereign munitions capability.

The Australian TNT qualification follows announcements made earlier this year between Thales Australia and the US Army’s Development Command Armaments Center establishing a sovereign manufacturing capability for 155mm M795 HE projectiles in Australia.

These agreements with the US have facilitated the technology transfer to Australia of US intellectual property, enabling the manufacture of critical munitions products to support the ADF including substantial work already achieved establishing a sovereign manufacturing capability for BLU-126 and BLU-111 aerial ordnance.

The Australian-made TNT includes toluene supplied by Australian SME Viva Energy located in Geelong, Victoria.

“I am immensely proud of our highly skilled Australia team who have worked for over three years, working through the rigorous certification processes that have enabled the creation of a true sovereign manufactured munitions capability in Australia,” Dion Habner, general manager of Thales Australia’s sovereign munitions business said."

Leanne Connor, Business Manager at Thales Ebbw Vale and the National Digital Exploitation Centre (NDEC) explains how the cyber industry is bringing prosperity back to an underrepresented area of Wales

Before joining Thales, Leanne Connor worked as regeneration manager at Blaenau Gwent Council, where she developed and implemented interventions and incentives to kickstart investment and generate opportunities for people in the local area.

Today, as business manager for the Thales Ebbw Vale site which is host to the National Digital Exploitation Centre (NDEC), an innovative partnership between Thales, the Welsh Government and the University of South Wales, Leanne continues to play a pivotal role in addressing the social and economic needs of the region.

Here, she explains how the NDEC is helping to cement the Ebbw Vale site as a global player in the cyber industry and represents a once in a generation opportunity to bring prosperity to South-East Wales.

Leanne Connor

Why does the work being carried out by Thales represent such an overwhelming opportunity for Wales?

If 15 years ago I could have described the type of business that we would ideally like to attract as part of The Works regeneration investment Thales and the NDEC would have been it.

As someone who is local, has worked in regeneration for a long time and was involved in the reclamation of the Ebbw Vale site, this project is the type of initiative that I have always dreamed of. Supporting businesses, stimulating innovation, creating jobs for the future and boosting national digital security – the remit of the project is vast. Yet, due to our unique partnership with academia and the Welsh government, it represents an enormous opportunity to make these ambitions a reality.

Why is Ebbw Vale such a significant location?

The NDEC is situated where the former Ebbw Vale Steel, Iron and Coal Company once proudly stood. Built in 1789, the steel mill played a major role in the industrial revolution, employing 34,000 people at its peak.

As its success grew, so did the town around it, but after the great depression hit, liquidations and layoffs took their toll and the steelworks was eventually closed in 2002.

This had a devastating impact on the town, with its main reason for existence extinguished along with the last amber glow of its blast furnaces.

Since then, the Welsh Government and local government has worked hard to transform the desolate site into a location bustling with opportunity through initiatives such as the £100m ten year Vision for the Tech Valleys, which has NDEC at its heart."

The TNT contains toluene supplied by Australian SME Viva Energy. After undergoing two years of rigorous testing and evaluation, the TNT is then qualified for use by the US authorities.

Thales noted that the Australian TNT qualification followed earlier announcements this year regarding Thales Australia and the US Army’s Development Command Armaments Centre establishing a ‘sovereign manufacturing capability’ for 155mm M795 HE projectiles in the country.

Thales Australia sovereign Munitions business general manager Dion Habner said: “I am immensely proud of our highly skilled Australia team who have worked for over three years, working through the rigorous certification processes that have enabled the creation of a true sovereign-manufactured munitions capability in Australia.

“This is an essential step in increasing Australia’s industrial capability in advanced manufacturing and self-reliance, which is vital to delivering a capability advantage to the Australian Defence Force.”

Last month, Thales Australia revealed plans to invest in advanced manufacturing equipment to increase the country’s capability to produce guided weapons."
Royal Navy Takes Delivery of First Anglo-French Minehunting Drone Boat - The Maritime Executive,"Tue, 14 Dec 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vbWFyaXRpbWUtZXhlY3V0aXZlLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3JveWFsLW5hdnktdGFrZXMtZGVsaXZlcnktb2YtZmlyc3QtYW5nbG8tZnJlbmNoLW1pbmVodW50aW5nLWRyb25lLWJvYXTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Royal Navy has taken delivery of a new autonomous mine hunting system from a joint Anglo-French consortium.

The system includes a new unmanned surface vessel, a towed sonar array and a portable control center, and it is now undergoing advanced trials.

The delivery is the first from the joint Maritime Mine Counter Measures program, contracted by France and the UK using the OCCAR (Organisation Conjointe de Coopération en matière d'Armement) procurement treaty. The development of the system began in 2010, and after a demonstration phase, the final contract was awarded to Thales UK, BAE and L3Harris in late 2020.

“It is exciting to see the first delivery to the Royal Navy from the Maritime Mine Counter Measures,” said Commodore Steve Prest, the Royal Navy’s Deputy Director Acquisition. “The future of mine warfare is here: the Royal Navy’s minehunting capability programme is real; it’s happening; it’s delivering. We have a lot to learn about this transformational approach to mine warfare, but there is much, much more to come.”

The service's hope is that a remote-controlled or autonomous family of systems will be able to fully take over the mine countermeasures role of the Royal Navy's manned minehunting vessels. Under a sweeping integrated defense review released earlier this year, the UK Ministry of Defence announced plans to decommission the Sandown- and Hunt-class MCM vessels and replace them with unmanned systems. This will reduce cost of operation and remove the service's sailors from harm's way.

""The new systems find mines, even in the worst conditions, five to 10 times faster than our current ships do,"" said First Sea Lord Admiral Tony Radakin in a speech after the review. ""We will stay the best minehunters in the world by starting to swap ships for drones. First the Sandown and then the Hunt-class.""

The Royal Navy already has three autonomous minehunting systems operating out of Faslane under the name of Project Wilton - RNMB Harrier, Hebe and Hazard - and has transitioned one of its existing MCM crews to full-time autonomous vessel duty. The newly delivered demonstrator will undergo operational testing alongside these platforms."

Thales has launched XTRAIM, a new weapon sight offering day/night decamouflage capabilities that previously could only be achieved by using several separate pieces of equipment. It is compatible with all shoulder-fired assault rifles (HK416) and light machine guns (Minimi), providing users with an unparalleled precision night-firing capability.

The XTRAIM sight provides a decisive operational advantage in conventional as well as asymmetric combat situations. The new sight weighs less than about 530 g (including battery) and is at least 70 mm shorter than alternative solutions. It is the dismounted combatant's perfect ally, reducing the burden on the soldier and improving their agility and endurance. XTRAIM is a fully integrated sight for daylight operations, combining a reflex red-dot sight with thermal imaging technology to pick out targets from the background (decamouflage function). The high brightness of the reticle in the red-dot sight makes it possible to identify and engage targets even in bright sunlight."

Thales to make 155mm artillery shells at Benalla - @AuManufacturing,"Mon, 06 Dec 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1bWFudWZhY3R1cmluZy5jb20uYXUvdGhhbGVzLXRvLW1ha2UtMTU1bW0tYXJ0aWxsZXJ5LXNoZWxscy1hdC1iZW5hbGxh0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales Australia is on schedule to begin production of the 155mm M795 Artillery Projectile at its Benalla, Victoria manufacturing facility in early 2022.

The development closely follows Thales Australia’s recent US Department of Defense qualification of its Australian-made TNT to military specifications.

Production in Australia will include the filling of steel projectile bodies with high explosive TNT, final assembly and completion of rigorous quality inspections.

The filled projectiles will then undergo assessment to ensure they meet ADF and US military specifications.

Thales has more than a decade of export experience to the USA of Australian-manufactured propellant, with the US qualification of Australian-made TNT a critical enabler in the development of Australia’s sovereign munitions capability, according to the company.

“It is an important step in building confidence in the USA that Australia has both the security and the industrial capability to handle both guided and non-guided munitions manufacturing.”

The Australian TNT qualification follows announcements made earlier this year between Thales Australia and the US Army’s Development Command Armaments Center establishing a sovereign manufacturing capability for 155mm M795 HE projectiles in Australia.

These agreements with the US have facilitated the technology transfer to Australia of US Intellectual Property, enabling the manufacture of critical munitions products to support the ADF including substantial work already achieved establishing a sovereign manufacturing capability for BLU-126 and BLU-111 aerial ordnance.

It also provides an alternative source of TNT supply for the United States.

The 100 per cent Australian-made TNT includes toluene supplied by Australian SME Viva Energy

located in Geelong, Victoria.

General manager of Thales Australia’s sovereign Munitions business Dion Habner said: “I am immensely proud of our highly skilled Australia team who have worked for over three years, working through the rigorous certification processes that have enabled the creation of a true

sovereign manufactured munitions capability in Australia.

“This is an essential step in increasing Australia’s industrial capability in advanced manufacturing and self-reliance which is vital to delivering a capability advantage to the Australian Defence Force.”

Thales employs 3,800 directly in Australia and purchases from 1,841 Australian suppliers, 82 per cent of which are SMEs. Exports have earned $1.6 billion in the past ten years.

On Tuesday 30 November, our Thales Eagle Farm site hosted a special visit from the graduating class of Clontarf Academy, Trinity Bay State High School in Cairns. Thales has an ongoing partnership with the Clontarf Foundation, which is a not-for-profit organisation with a mission to improve the education, discipline, life skills, self-esteem and employment prospects of young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander men. With academies located across Australia, this latest Clontarf visit follows a series of similar tours hosted at Thales sites in Western Australia and New South Wales.

The visit to Thales at Eagle Farm, which is home to the Vehicle Support Centre and where we manage the full life-cycle capability of protected vehicles, showed the students how their interest in Mechanics and associated trades can translate into real world opportunities within the defence industry.

The day began with a presentation given by the students, to showcase the excellent work being performed by Clontarf Academies Australia-wide. The mentors and students explained how their school’s Clontarf Academy had supported and mentored them throughout their high school years, building a stronger sense of self within their community as well as achieving better outcomes with graduating high school and setting career goals for the future.

The presentation was followed by a tour of Thales workshops and production areas, where students had the opportunity to see how the Eagle Farm repair centre operates to a demanding schedule with safety always the priority. Thales staff shared their career journeys, described their Thales job and answered plenty of questions from the students as they also prepare to enter the workforce.

The final highlight of the tour was when students were able to climb aboard a Bushmaster Protected Mobility Vehicle and experience for themselves the end result of a multi-disciplinary team effort.

To close out the visit, our local Thales hosts had a chat with the students explaining the different career pathways for mechanics in the defence industry. Some students expressed their interest in defence force careers and staff were excited to share their experience and advice.

Our Thales Eagle Farm team were very proud to show the boys what we do and are excited to kick off our partner site relationship with Clontarf Foundation for many opportunities to support into the future! Well done to all involved in arranging and hosting this special event."

Thales Australia has confirmed it is on track to commence production of the 155mm M795 Artillery Projectile capability early next year after receiving qualification of its Australian-made TNT to military specifications from the US Department of Defense.

The production process — set to take place in Benalla, regional Victoria — is set to include the filling of steel projectile bodies with high explosive TNT, final assembly, and completion of the quality inspections.

============== ==============

The filled projectiles will be further assessed, and undergo a certification process to ensure they meet ADF and US military specifications.

The production of the 155mm M795 Artillery Projectiles are expected to support the broader push to build sovereign munitions capability for the Australian Defence Force and international partners.

The Australian-made TNT to be produced in Victoria includes toluene supplied by Geelong-based SME Viva Energy.

The qualification of Australian TNT follows the partnership established between Thales Australia and the US Army’s Development Command Armaments Center, aimed at establishing a sovereign manufacturing capability for 155mm M795 HE projectiles in Australia.

The deal has enabled technology transfer of US intellectual property to Australia, supporting the local development of a range of munitions, including the establishment of sovereign capability for BLU-126 and BLU-111 aerial ordnance.

“I am immensely proud of our highly skilled Australia team who have worked for over three years, working through the rigorous certification processes that have enabled the creation of a true sovereign manufactured munitions capability in Australia,” Dion Habner, general manager of Thales Australia’s sovereign munitions business, said.

“This is an essential step in increasing Australia’s industrial capability in advanced manufacturing and self-reliance, which is vital to delivering a capability advantage to the Australian Defence Force.”

Thales Australia has been ramping up investment in its local manufacturing capability.

The company recently announced a $6 million investment in the Commonwealth-owned Mulwala facility in regional NSW, aimed at supporting the development of sovereign guided weapons manufacturing capability.

The funds will be used for new large-scale preparation and mixing equipment, expected to deliver a 500 per cent increase in the size of rocket motors that could be manufactured at Mulwala.

This is in addition to Thales Australia’s $6.5 million investment in the first phase of an industrial plan to upgrade its Lithgow Arms facility in NSW.

This is set to include the establishment of a modern manufacturing and integration hub for the design, development and precision manufacture of weapons systems for the ADF, industrial partners and export customers.

Working with multiple interfaces for maximum outcome - Rail Express,"Mon, 06 Dec 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJhaWxleHByZXNzLmNvbS5hdS93b3JraW5nLXdpdGgtbXVsdGlwbGUtaW50ZXJmYWNlcy1mb3ItbWF4aW11bS1vdXRjb21lL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In Australia, the Thales name is everywhere. Sydney Metro, Sydney Trains and Parramatta Light Rail are some of the key projects within the transportation sector.

Thales works with a multitude of external contractors and agencies to achieve its goals. This requires a systematic and organised approach to ensure all participants work from a common page.

The person tasked with ensuring this is Julien Terrochaire, Ground Transportation Systems Engineering Manager for Thales Australia.

Terrochaire, with about 14 years of experience in the metro industry, specialises in Signalling and Integrated Communication and Supervision (ICS).

“In mega transportation projects, the challenges are diverse and lay demand on all parts/functions of an organisation – engineering, procurement, project management, documentation, legal and finance,” Terrochaire told Rail Express.

“The challenge for providers such as Thales is to successfully deliver systems on complex projects that have multiple external interfaces to other systems which are not necessarily aligned in terms of schedule and requirements.”

As an example, Terrochaire put forward the Thales signalling CCS (Central Control System, also named as SCADA) and communication systems used in both greenfield and brownfield environments.

“Thales has significant, diverse experiences in this domain as a provider of integrated turnkey mission critical systems for rail,” he said.

The systems provided by Thales comprise signalling, communications and supervision, and are used all over the world – the Middle East, North America, many countries in South America, Europe and Asia. But for the purpose of discussion, Terrochaire focussed on a project closer to home – the ongoing extension of the Sydney Metro with the City (greenfield) and South West (brownfield) sections.

“Thales systems are installed in every area of the metro right from the OCC (Operations Control Centre) to the stations, the tracks and corridors. Thales is one of the few companies that can lay claim to this within the Sydney Metro project,” he said.

“On a daily basis, Thales deals with and co-ordinates between 19 external interfaces and 17 external contractors – each focussed on different aspects of the project. It takes tremendous effort, flexibility and adaptation skills to operate successfully in such a complex, dynamic environment.”

Dealing with multiple contractors, almost naturally, means dealing with multiple new interfaces. Every new interface must be uniquely defined and managed (even if this new interface is from the same contractor).

Terrochaire emphasises this means that the same type of interface is redefined at least 17 times (sometimes even more) because one external contractor can own a specific interface for multiple locations and Thales must deal with a different person or entity within this contractor company.

“This management of interfaces introduces complexity not just in the interface itself but also in configuration management, installation, testing and commissioning of each of these interfaces,” he said.

While challenges are aplenty in a situation like this, Terrochaire has identified three key considerations.

Challenge 1 – Schedule Misalignment

Terrochaire cites technical debt as the most unfortunate consequence of not doing it right in the first instance due to misalignment of the schedules of different contractors, the tendency to base design on assumptions and not signing off as per design review process.

“The technical debt generates a series of events that results in a difficult and challenging relationship between all parties – mismatched priorities, frustrations for the contractors, additional pressure on the engineering and design teams and of course, pressure on the scheduling team to constantly rework, update and baseline the delivery program,” he said.

Challenge 2 – Design Consistency

Maintaining system design consistency and compliance across all interfacing parties is key and critical to ease the design certification process, installation and system acceptance. Each difference represents complexity and risk.

While small adaptations may seem legitimate to undertake, in reality, it is almost impossible given the number of factors involved.

Challenge 3 – Overhead Management

Multiple coordination meetings, tools to exchange information, efforts to avoid technical debt, implementation and facilitating adequate stakeholder engagement add up quickly. Overhead management becomes critical.

“It takes tremendous resilience from the configuration officers and a strong commercial effort to keep across the numerous revisions in documentation, changes and variations which, if unresolved, lead to commercial disputes and tension between the various stakeholders,” Terrochaire said.

The secret to success

How then does Thales consistently achieve project success and excellence in such a complex and dynamically evolving environment?

Terrochaire will reveal all in a presentation at the forthcoming AusRAIL PLUS conference, the major rail sector business event for Australasia and the largest combined rail sector conference/exhibition within the Southern Hemisphere.

“This will be my first time attending an AusRAIL PLUS and I am honoured to be speaking on Thales’ extraordinary ability to deliver quality outcomes in complex projects”, said Terrochaire, who only recently moved to Australia along with his wife and kids.

“I look forward to presenting an in-depth look into the challenges Thales faces and the various solutions we employ to minimise disruption, resolve these challenges and manage all the external factors implicated in this multi-layered, multi-interface environment.”

AusRAIL PLUS will be held at the ICC Sydney, from 28 February to 2 March, 2022.

Thales who are based in both the UK and Germany are set to develop and supply Az LX which is a new electronic treadle.

The new contract with Network Rail and will see an eight-year framework that will allow application of the treadle throughout the network including level crossings bringing improved reliability and cutting passenger delays.

The global technology leaders Az LM axle counter has already become an essential and dependable part of Network Rail's train positioning strategy throughout the UK over the past twenty years.

However, due to issues with the reliability of the aging system, which includes 11,000 trackside electronic and mechanical treadles especially on approaches to level and user works crossings, Network Rail has seen a high number of track closures causing passenger service delays, which are caused by the treadles failing to trigger barriers at level crossings.

In 2020 Network Rail put out a tender specification and framework contract for suppliers to design and supply an improved replacement system.

Treadles use an electromagnetic field across a track to register a passing train and which direction it is heading at a single point in time. Thales solution to use its tried and tested high fid high-fidelity Az LM unit system, which is made at their Arnstadt site in Germany, and re-work a number of its internal boards to achieve the specification.

Tancred Porteous, Head of Operations for Main Line Signalling at Thales in the UK said: “This contract will make a big impact on Network Rail because we're tackling a major thorn in their side that prevents passengers from reaching their destinations on time.”

“This is an exciting opportunity for us too. The contract not only confirms Thales's position as a partner and supplier of train detection systems to Network Rail, but it also adds a new product to our portfolio that potentially has wider applications for European railways.”

Sales Manager at Thales Germany, Sabrina Naussedat said: “To develop a new system would have been complex, expensive and time consuming,”

“Taking an existing product, rather than starting from scratch, reduces development cost and retraining needs for operators and installers. As well as being maintenance free, the majority of its spare parts are common to Az LM, which subsequently reduces through-life costs.

“However, there were challenges; it wasn't easy to take a high-fidelity system and strip it back for repurposing without changing the underlying performance and reliability of the product.”

Thales will see its UK and German sites collaborate on working trials for the system, financed by Network Rail, ahead of the Az LX's production and rolled out across the network."
