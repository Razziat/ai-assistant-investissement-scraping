Thales Alenia Space to build four radar satellites for South Korea - SpaceNews,"Wed, 05 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS90aGFsZXMtYWxlbmlhLXNwYWNlLXRvLWJ1aWxkLWZvdXItcmFkYXItc2F0ZWxsaXRlcy1mb3Itc291dGgta29yZWEv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"WASHINGTON — European satellite manufacturer Thales Alenia Space said Dec. 5 it signed separate contracts with Korean Aerospace Industries (KAI) and Hanwha Systems Corp. to develop four high-resolution radar satellites for South Korea’s Agency for Defence Development.

Under the deal, Thales Alenia Space will share information with its South Korean partners on building remote sensing satellites with synthetic aperture (SAR) radar payloads capable of imaging the Earth in the day, at night and through cloud cover. Thales Alenia Space, a joint venture between Thales Group of France and Leonardo of Italy, said the SAR satellites will use a specialized 5-meter antenna folded as 24 “petals” that will open in space.

Donato Amoroso, Thales Alenia Space senior vice president of observation, exploration and navigation, said the company will leverage its experience with Cosmo-SkyMed, a four-satellite constellation funded by the Italian Space Agency and the Italian Ministry of Defence that launched between 2007 and 2010. Thales Alenia Space is also building the second-generation Cosmo-Skymed system, which will consist of two satellites.



In a LinkedIn post, Thales Alenia Space CEO Jean-Loic Galle said the satellites will benefit from the miniaturization of space hardware to be half the size of earlier generations of radar satellites the company has built. The Thales Alenia Space team in Italy secured the contract against “tough international competition,” he said.

The Korean government plans to use the satellites for “surveillance, intelligence and control of specific areas of interest,” Thales Alenia Space said in a press release.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999188184738159}",neutral,0.9999188184738159,0

Two contracts signed with South Korea, for “Dancing Satellites” featuring high performance and shorter revisit times



Seoul, Daejeon – December 5th, 2018 - Thales Alenia Space, a joint venture between Thales (67%) and Leonardo (33%), today announced that it has signed two contracts with Korea, one with Aerospace Industries, LTD. (KAI) and one with Hanwha Systems Corporation (HSC) to develop a constellation of high-resolution observation radar satellites for the Agency for Defence Development (ADD), known as Korea “425 Project”, so serve South Korea.

Korean Aerospace Industries leads a consortium including South Korea’s Hanwha System and Thales Alenia Space. All three companies have been involved in developing satellites and related technologies for a number of years. Technical cooperation and several know-hows required for the SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) Satellites development will be transferred to Korean companies, up to a maximum involvement in the production of the last satellite of the Constellation, providing them with an outstanding growth in the field of design and development of Earth Observation Systems.

For the 4 satellites, Thales Alenia Space will provide the SAR Payloads and the platform elements (especially for Control Momentum Gyro and sensors) derived from the HE-R1000 product (High Efficiency Radar), part of the Thales Alenia Space Observation product family that includes both radar and optical satellites. This technology will enable short revisit times for each of the satellites, and support all-weather operation, with a very high global revisit frequency. The constellation will be used by the Korean authorities for surveillance, intelligence and control of specific areas of interest thanks to the acquisition of high resolution images.

Agility is one of the primary assets for advanced missions entrusted to this new generation of high-resolution surveillance satellites. Based on an active feed array and reflector antenna innovative solution, the satellites ensure superior quality images, while unique agility capability is provided thanks to the adaptation of a control momentum gyro: a spinning rotor and one motorized gimbal tilt the rotor’s angular momentum. As the rotor tilts, the changing angular momentum causes a gyroscopic torque that rotates the spacecraft. Moving around the three axes, these “dancing satellites”, will be fitted with a special antenna developed within the scope of the Thales Alenia Space Reseach & Development program. With a diameter of 5 meters, the new-generation antenna will open its 24 petals once in space.

“Thales Alenia Space is honored to have earned the confidence of the Korean Ministry of Defence and other authorities involved in this project, who recognized our proven track record in delivering state-of-the-art observation satellites,” said Donato Amoroso, Senior Vice-President, Observation, Exploration and Navigation at Thales Alenia Space. “The contract signed today is a superb opportunity for cooperation between Italy and Korea. It confirms the new global trend in the space business and the ‘new space’ transformation strategy being implemented by Thales Alenia Space, with the ultimate aim of becoming a major manufacturer of small satellite constellations featuring short revisit times. This business win confirms Thales Alenia Space’s long-standing expertise and unique global position in the design, development and construction of radar Earth observation satellites, as well as the development of satellite constellations. It is also based on the heritage of the excellent performance of the COSMO-SkyMed program, the world’s most advanced spaceborne radar system.”

Thales Alenia Space’s participation in the 425 Project is the latest milestone in its long-standing collaboration with South Korea on a number of space programs, including KOMPSAT-5, the Koreasat telecommunications satellite family, GEO-KOMPSAT-2, KASS, etc.

About COSMO-SkyMed

COSMO-SkyMed, funded by the Italian space agency ASI, the Italian Ministry of Defence and the Italian Ministry of Education, Universities and Scientific Research, is the first “dual use” Earth observation system, spanning both civil and military applications. Its four identical satellites “watch” our planet from space day and night under all atmospheric conditions, using high resolution X-band radars. Thales Alenia Space is the program prime contractor, responsible for the entire system, including the ground and space segments, and leading a consortium of companies from throughout the space industry. Telespazio developed the ground segment and hosts the Constellation Control Center at the Fucino Space Center. e-GEOS (ASI/Telespazio) is the world-wide exclusive distributor of COSMO-SkyMed data.

Thales Alenia Space is currently involved in the development of the COSMO Second Generation (CSG) constellation, which represents a major generational leap in terms of technology, performance and operational life. It will provide new application possibilities, in particular for risk management and damage assessment of natural and man-made disasters. CSG Earth observation spacecraft feature state-of-the-art technologies and engineering solutions, further bolstering Italian leadership in this sector. This second-generation system, including its ground segment, will set a new performance standard for space-based radar observation systems in terms of precision, image quality and the flexibility of user services. Satellites and instruments designed and developed by Thales Alenia Space, including Meteosat Third Generation (MTG) weather satellites and the COSMO-SkyMed radar constellation, have already made a pivotal contribution to damage assessment following natural disasters, such as earthquakes, landslides and flooding, the monitoring of critical infrastructures, tracking the movement of glaciers, and monitoring illegal activities such as oil spills and the trafficking of goods or people.

Thales and French Army are boosting land forces equipment maintenance - EDR Magazine,"Wed, 05 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVkcm1hZ2F6aW5lLmV1L3RoYWxlcy1hbmQtZnJlbmNoLWFybXktYXJlLWJvb3N0aW5nLWxhbmQtZm9yY2VzLWVxdWlwbWVudC1tYWludGVuYW5jZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The MCO-Terre[1] 2025 through-life support transformation plan is one of the mainstays of efforts by the French Ministry for the Armed Forces to improve the availability of high-value defence systems in increasingly complex environments, in particular by developing innovative digital services. The plan aims to improve support services for hardware, software and security management, and the SIMMT[2] is relying on Thales to help it achieve that goal as part of a strategic partnership signed at the Eurosatory exhibition in June 2018.

At the request of the land forces equipment and systems (SIMMT), Thales and other French industry partners will conduct at least 40% of all maintenance activities. Thales has played a thought leadership role in developing government/industry cooperation on the SIMMT’s MCO-Terre plan with a view to improving system availability, optimising costs, capitalising on the defence ministry’s own resources and sharing knowledge and know-how. The joint support platform is being set up by the land forces industrial maintenance service (SIMTER[3]) and Thales in order to increase overall performance as the roles of the French armed forces evolve. The platform is located at the 14th equipment support base (BSMAT[4]) in Nouâtre in Central France.

The ultimate aim of Thales’s strategy of innovation in service provision is to enable customers to make the best decisions at every decisive moment. Automated interconnection of the information systems in service with the defence ministry and its industry partners, and the use of RFID technology to store and retrieve data remotely, provide all stakeholders with a shared, comprehensive view of the overall support chain. The solution saves time, improves traceability and boosts reliability to optimise equipment fleet management.

“With the new organisation and secure access to innovative services, the armed forces are stepping up to the challenges of the digital transformation to offer a customised support solution for operational units. The joint support management platform ensures that high-value systems are available at the right time and in the right place so that the French land forces can conduct their decisive missions effectively and efficiently.” Florence Gourgeon, Thales Vice President for Customer Support and Services activities, Secure Co

Singapore Airlines’ focus on personalization and surfacing more relevant content is not new. The carrier allows travelers to define playlists in an app prior to the flight or to bookmark movies to continue watching on a future trip. This system integrated into the Panasonic eX3 entertainment system on board most of the company’s planes. The new regional layout A350s match and extend these options.

KrisFlyer members and passengers traveling in premium classes gain access to additional content. Recommendations for what to watch next are tuned based on prior behavior on board. Bringing those features to the Thales AVANT platform keeps the experience (relatively) consistent for passengers. The complexity in delivering that across multiple providers should not be underestimated.

For inflight wifi connectivity Singapore Airlines and Thales chose the Inmarsat GX solution on the new sub-fleet. Singapore Airlines is one of many carriers today flying a mixed fleet of connectivity solutions. The new A350ULR planes serving the nonstop flights to the United States carry the Panasonic Avionics entertainment and connectivity kit on board.

The aircraft also flew a turn to Jakarta after returning from Adelaide and before returning to Australia on its second day of service. Expect similar routings for the foreseeable future. Singapore Airlines expects Brisbane to be added as the second regional destination as more new aircraft are delivered. The second frame (9V-SHA) was delivered this week.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9981827735900879}",positive,0.9981827735900879,1

Thales gets green light from ACCC to buy Gemalto - iTnews,"Thu, 20 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lml0bmV3cy5jb20uYXUvbmV3cy90aGFsZXMtZ2V0cy1ncmVlbi1saWdodC1mcm9tLWFjY2MtdG8tYnV5LWdlbWFsdG8tNTE3MTYz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission said it will allow Thales to buy Dutch security company Gemalto, on condition that the French technology multinational divests overlapping business in which the two compete with each other.

Both companies sell general-purpose hardware security modules and are the largest suppliers of the data encryption and decryption technology worldwide and in Australia.

Thales' $7.7 billion buy of Gemalto that was mooted in April this year raised concerns with anti-trust watchdogs worldwide that feared it would result in substantially lessened competition.

However, Thales supplied a court-enforceable undertaking to the European Commission that it would sell its global nShield GP HSM business and the ACCC has now accepted this.

The purchaser of the relatively small GP HSM business which in 2017 had revenues of $144 million must be approved by the ACCC.

Thales will be allowed ot keep its payments HSM business. These devices are used by retail banks and payments processors.

Gemalto's local operations are based in Sydney and Melbourne whereas Thales is active throughout the country.

Pushing through the deal between the two global companies has been a long slog that required them to woo competition watchdogs around the world, and saw Thales miss its August 15 deadline for the acquisition offer by a wide margin.

Prior to the ACCC approval, the acquisition of Gemalto had been approved by the European Commission, and the New Zealand Commerce Commission.

In September, the merger was given the go-ahead by the United States Committee on Foreign Investment, after Canada, China, Israel and Turkey said yes as well.

Gemalto was also chased by Atos, also headquartered in France, which bid $7.1 billion for the Dutch company a year ago, saying it wanted to create the world's largest cyber security conglomerate.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9494773745536804}",neutral,0.9494773745536804,0
ComCom tells Thales to sell security module business for Gemalto buyout - Reseller News,"Thu, 13 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Mi5yZXNlbGxlci5jby5uei9hcnRpY2xlLzY1MDgwOC90aGFsZXMtc2VsbC1wYXltZW50LXNlY3VyaXR5LW1vZHVsZS1idXNpbmVzcy1nZW1hbHRvLWJ1eW91dC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"No issues around payment security modules as competitors keep the market honest

The Commerce Commission has granted clearance for French firm Thales to acquire Gemalto provided it sells its entire general-purpose hardware security module (HSM) business.

Thales applied to the Commission for clearance to acquire Gemalto in August as part of a global transaction requiring approval from a number of international competition authorities.

In making its decision, the Commission primarily focused on the products that both parties supply in New Zealand – the supply of payment HSMs and general purpose HSMs.

The decision also appears to have been made across other jurisdictions.

These are dedicated hardware appliances running on encryption software to generate, protect and manage encryption keys used to protect data in a secure, tamper-resistant module.

“We believe the combination of the two largest suppliers of general purpose HSMs in New Zealand would be likely to result in a substantial lessening of competition, with customers having limited alternatives to the merged entity when selecting a new general purpose HSM,"" Commission deputy chair Sue Begg said.

“However, we consider the divestment offered by Thales is sufficient to remedy the competitive harm the acquisition would cause in New Zealand and have granted clearance subject to this undertaking.""

Any purchaser of the HSM business will need to be approved by the Commission.

The Commission is satisfied there are no competition concerns in the market for the supply of payment HSMs in New Zealand due to the low level of overlap in New Zealand and the presence of other suppliers.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998376369476318}",neutral,0.9998376369476318,0
Himani SINGH - Thales,"Wed, 12 Dec 2018 06:45:27 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi9pbmRpYS9tZWV0LW91ci1wZW9wbGUtaW5kaWEvaGltYW5pLXNpbmdo0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In the professional world, I have total work experience of 6 years. I have been working as a Purchase Manager for bids & projects in Thales in India.

Why did you choose this career path?

I always wanted to do unconventional roles. I did mechanical engineering where even today the women students are less as compared to men. During the last year of my engineering, I got placed in 3 companies, one was IT based, second one offered a graduate engineer trainee role in my core branch and third one was with which I am pursuing my career, i.e. Thales.

Instead of going first into technical field, I started my professional life in procurement & supply chain team. Here, to add an interesting fact, in India, women employees are rarely seen in procurement field whereas in Europe or US, the situation is completely opposite. Thales Group is the best example to showcase this scenario.

Having said that, my engineering skills always enables me to do a deep down analysis in terms of understanding the technicalities.

Tell us about the highlights in your career with Thales.

I started the journey with a small but eternally vigilant profile of order management & supply chain of XRII tubes. By this, I was able to understand the modalities in existing processes & identify the bottlenecks associated. This experience helped me in the implementation of new ERP in 2015.

In 2016, my work got recognized & I was awarded the “Outstanding Employee of the Year”.

In the same year, I got the new challenge as an Acquisition Procurement Manager for Hyderabad Metro Signalling Project. Since then, I am supported at each step by Thales team in India and overseas to enhance my skill sets as a Purchase Manager for bids & projects.

What are the major challenges you face in your job today?

Unplanned procurement is one of the major challenges I face, today. However, challenges are an integral part of a PPM’s job. Every day, I come across a new challenge that I am committed to find a solution for.

What’s next?

I am focusing towards becoming a competent Purchasing professional in all aspects and ready for implementing the better version of my skillset in the upcoming assignments.

Why should one consider a career with Thales?

Thales recognizes exemplary work done by employees. It is open to giving ample opportunities to enhance one’s skillset. Moreover, one gets to maintain work life balance here.

Most importantly, the company’s rewards & recognition policies are pretty good and encouraging.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9866940975189209}",neutral,0.9866940975189209,0

In September the Australian National Audit Office released a report into Defence's $2.2 billion procurement of the Hawkei light protected vehicles, but with sections of the conclusion redacted after Attorney-General Christian Porter issued a certificate suppressing the information on the request of contractor Thales.

Thales requested that the Attorney-General enact the never-before-used clause of the Auditor-General's Act to ensure information that would damage the company's commercial interests wouldn't be made public. The certificate issued cited both commercial and national security reasons for suppressing the information.

In the ensuing parliamentary inquiry over the use of the certificate has resulted in the redacted information being tabled at Senate estimates, showing that it included a cost comparison between Thales' Hawkei vehicle and a similar US Joint Light Tactical Vehicle.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9996665716171265}",neutral,0.9996665716171265,0
