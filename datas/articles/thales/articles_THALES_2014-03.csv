The StratoBus project may immediately call to mind Google's Project Loon. But the advantage of StratoBus is that it offers long endurance and complete autonomy from a fixed position, while the high-altitude balloons in Loon move around the Earth and will offer only limited autonomy. StratoBus, a surprising vehicle halfway between a drone and a satellite, will be able to carry out a wide range of missions, including observation, security, telecommunications, broadcasting and navigation… and it offers a lifespan of five year.



The StratoBus project is led by Thales Alenia Space, along with partners, Zodiac Marine and CEA-Liten.This is in the lower reaches of the stratosphere, but well above air traffic and jet streams. StratoBus will beThe project is part of the creation of an airship company by the Pégase competitiveness cluster in southern France.

Stratobus: the autonomous, stationary stratospheric platform

StratoBus covers a wide range of potential applications, including border and maritime surveillance, boosting GSM network capacity for public events and GPS augmentation over areas of dense traffic.

The platform itself is a high-altitude airship measuring 70 to 100 meters long and 20 to 30 meters in diameter. It will feature a number of technological innovations, in particular to make sure it captures the Sun's rays in all seasons: a power generation system (coupling the solar panels to a solar power amplification system patented by Thales), an ultra-light reversible fuel cell for energy storage, etc.

The StratoBus platform will require continuous significant energy input to offset the wind: two electric motors will automatically adjust their output power depending on wind speed (up to 90 km/h).



The first prototype should be rolled out within the next five years."
"The Business Model of Thales Australia: Transfer Technology, Grow Indigenously and Export Globally - Second Line of ... - Second Line of Defense","Tue, 25 Mar 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vc2xkaW5mby5jb20vMjAxNC8wMy90aGUtYnVzaW5lc3MtbW9kZWwtb2YtdGhhbGVzLWF1c3RyYWxpYS10cmFuc2Zlci10ZWNobm9sb2d5LWdyb3ctaW5kaWdlbm91c2x5LWFuZC1leHBvcnQtZ2xvYmFsbHkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"2014-03-25 By Robbin Laird

Earlier I wrote about the role of European firms in the augmentation of allied Pacific defense capabilities.

In American discussions of the re-shaping of Pacific defense, naturally the primary focus is upon the American role and contribution. Lost in such a focus often is how the Asian allies are shaping their defense and security futures and shaping those futures in part by building upon evolving European systems. European defense industry plays a growing role in Asian defense and security. And they are doing so by offering core products of interest in the region and being congruent with core demands of the 21st century Asian customers. The larger Asian customers clearly wish to expand their capabilities to produce their “own” equipment. What this means in a global age is that industrial partnerships between European and Asian firms are a key part of the growing European presence. This means as well that “re-export” of European systems from Asia will be part of the 21st century reality of the global market.

During my visit to Australia in early March 2014, I had a chance to talk with the CEO of Thales Australia, Chris Jenkins. We focused on the Thales engagement in Australia and highlighted the Thales business model in the country.

The basic dynamic for Thales in Australia has been as follows: transfer of technology from Europe to Australia, the shaping of indigenous capabilities which grow the ability to support and upgrade the product, and the export FROM Australia of maturing products into the global market served by Thales, with Thales providing a global support framework within which to insert exports from Australia.

According to the Thales website, Jenkins has a long history of working in Australia and with Department of Defence there.

Chris Jenkins is a defense industry leader, a passionate believer in local skills, and a strong advocate for Australian manufacturing.

He has held senior roles in Thales locally and internationally for over 17 years, playing a crucial role in transforming the company from five separate businesses into one of Australia’s largest suppliers of mission critical products and services.

His appointment as Thales Australia CEO in January 2008 followed two years as Vice President Operations, and before that three years as CEO of a Thales consortium in the Netherlands, delivering that country’s national public transport smartcard program. Prior to this, Chris was Managing Director of Thales Underwater Systems in Australia from 1999 to 2003. He previously held senior marketing, sales and project director roles in the business, and was also a key player in its creation as a Thales/GEC joint venture in 1996. Chris started in the defense industry as a mechanical engineer with Racal in 1981, Plessey in 1983, and then GEC Marconi in 1990 heading up its Underwater Systems business in Australia. Chris is currently Chairman of the Board of Directors for the International Centre for Complex Project Management and Chairman of the AIG Defence Council. He is also a member of the AIG NSW Executive and the AIG National Executive. He was a member of the Prime Minister’s Manufacturing Taskforce and is a member of the Manufacturing Leaders Group.

In the discussion with Jenkins, he highlighted the sonar business as an example of the Thales approach in Australia.The business started with the transfer of French technology to Australia in the early 1980s. The technology was used by the Australians to support their submarine program, and as the sonar systems were integrated into Aussie platforms, a team was created to support the technology, which basically meant, an ability to upgrade the system and to develop intellectual property along the way to shape the course of the modernization of the capability.

As indigenous capability was forged, the evolving technology was Australian and available for export, and has been done so in the UK Astute submarine program as well as in support of oil and gas platform support systems.

Thales started with a small team of French engineers working in Australia to transfer sonar technology and by the 1990s had nearly 500 people, mostly Australians, working on the program and exporting from Australia.

As Jenkins put it:

Australia is a long way away from major defense industrial centers in the West. This means that indigenous support is crucial to the effectiveness of any program sold and then developed within Australia. It is not just a ‘nice to have’ capability; it is crucial to the success of any technology imported into Australia. This means as well that implanting the technology and supporting it leads to the real possibility of further development of the technology for global export. We generate local engineering expertise through transfer of knowledge in the country. Then we generate the right solutions and agile responses to the nation’s evolving needs.

In the sonar related business areas, according to Jenkins, Thales has exported $300 million (Australian) dollars worth of sonar systems and $150 million (Australian) dollars worth of mine sweeping equipment.

This has meant that the further development of Australian-based sonar systems is paid for in part by exports and not simply by Australian defense programs.

According to Jenkins:

If you look at our sonar transducers, we’ve exported them to France for a wide variety of applications. Our mine-hunting sonars are exported into the wider Thales organization both into the UK and France. The mine-sweeping gear we jointly developed with the Defence Science and Technology Organisation (DSTO). We have a very close and important knowledge relationship with the DTSO. And we have sold the minesweeping systems to a number of navies, including the US Navy, and the UK, South Korean and Japanese navies. A very large number of navies have bought our minesweeping gear. It’s quite a breakthrough technology.

Jenkins focused throughout the interview on the importance of the sustainment of a product. By sustainment, he meant both maintainability and upgradeability of the product.

“It is about keeping the technology at the level the end user needs to meet whatever challenges the platform is meeting in its operational life.”

He underscored that the approach taken with regard to sonars has been followed in other business areas in Australia, such as air traffic management, protected mobility vehicles and simulation.

He discussed as well the vehicles area as one where Thales has played a significant role for the Australian Army.

The Bushmaster vehicle was designed in Australia, and we worked with the Australian Army to evolve the system over time as needs were identified. We have exported a number of these vehicles to the Netherlands and Jamaica, and are currently pursuing other export opportunities.

Jenkins highlighted the basic approach being followed by the company in Australia as follows:

Thales was one of the first international investors to really embrace the idea of intellectual property exchange into Australia, with the expertise then further developed through training within Australia itself. We built upon this approach with the acquisition of ADI Limited, which gave the company an important offering into Australian defense.

We concluded the discussion by focusing on the emergent role of unmanned maritime vehicles in the mine sweeping mission.

We see the emergence of robotic vehicles at sea as a key element of the changing business area for mine sweeping technologies, and are positioning ourselves to be in the forefront of the relevant technologies.

Thales Alenia Space Delivers Iridium Simulators to SpaceX - Via Satellite,"Wed, 05 Mar 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhdGVsbGl0ZXRvZGF5LmNvbS9maW5hbmNlLzIwMTQvMDMvMDUvdGhhbGVzLWFsZW5pYS1zcGFjZS1kZWxpdmVycy1pcmlkaXVtLXNpbXVsYXRvcnMtdG8tc3BhY2V4L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"[Via Satellite 03-05-2014] Thales Alenia Space has delivered two complete Iridium high-fidelity satellite simulators and several low-fidelity simulators to SpaceX. The simulators have the same mechanical interface and mass properties of actual satellites, and will be used in a variety of launch tests to ensure structural integrity and functionality, vibration testing for durability, and deployment testing to confirm that the satellites will release from the dispenser correctly when in space.

Ten satellite simulators have been constructed and will be used in tests by launch partners Kosmotras, which will launch the first two satellites with its Dnepr rocket, and SpaceX, which will launch the remaining satellites on its Falcon 9 rocket. Iridium is SpaceX’s largest commercial customer, and its $453.1 million investment represents the largest single commercial launch contract in history.

The Iridium Next satellite network will offer improved bandwidth, data speeds and global coverage for its customers. It will also serve as a platform for the new Iridium Prime offering; a turnkey solution for hosted payloads that will offer all elements of a successful mission at an estimated cost savings of 50 percent compared to current stand-alone solutions.

“We continue to break space industry records with Iridium,” stated Jean-Loïc Galle, CEO of Thales Alenia Space. “Typically, we produce one or two simulators per satellite program, but due to the size of the Iridium Next constellation and rigorous testing built into this launch plan, it requires 10 simulators to ensure full testing with the launch platform.”"
Thales Alenia Space Exec Identifies Ways To Save on Next Cygnus Order - SpaceNews,"Fri, 21 Mar 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS8zOTkzNHRoYWxlcy1hbGVuaWEtc3BhY2UtZXhlYy1pZGVudGlmaWVzLXdheXMtdG8tc2F2ZS1vbi1uZXh0LWN5Z251cy1vcmRlci_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"TURIN, Italy — The builder of the pressurized cargo modules launched aboard Orbital Sciences Corp.’s Antares rocket to carry supplies to the international space station says it would need a follow-on contract this year to provide maximum cost advantage to Orbital and its customer, NASA.

Thales Alenia Space’s 2009 contract with Dulles, Va.-based Orbital, valued at 180 million euros ($247 million), called for the delivery of nine Cygnus cargo modules by 2015.

Two of these have been launch successfully, and two more are scheduled for launch this year. Three more launches in 2015 and two in 2016 will complete the $1.9 billion Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) contract Orbital has with NASA, assuming that the flights carry the contracted amount of payload.

NASA in February issued a request for information for a planned CRS 2 program, but it remains unclear when the agency will be ready to enter into formal contract negotiations, presumably with Orbital and with Space Exploration Technologies Corp. of Hawthorne, Calif. SpaceX has a separate CRS contract with NASA.

In a March 21 interview at Thales Alenia Space’s facility here, Luigi Maria Quaglino, the company’s senior vice president for exploration and science, said the firm presumes that Orbital and NASA will demand price reductions in a second order. He said there are multiple avenues to pursue to squeeze efficiencies from the current CRS production line for a second order, but that the scale of economies depends on the timing and size of the order.

“To go down on price we of course need to reduce in our costs,” Quaglino said. “To get our costs down we need to organize ourselves with our subcontractors in advance, and our negotiations with them will depend on what CRS 2 looks like.”

To achieve the maximum reduction in cost, he said, the company needs to know this year how many modules will be ordered in the CRS 2 contract. Given that the ninth and final vehicle under the current order is now in full assembly and slated for delivery in 2015, production line elements will begin to shut down this year.

As with most industrial production lines, follow-on orders can be processed most efficiently if they arrive before the original contract work is completed to assure a continuous flow of work for the factory.

“There has been talk of a follow-on order for two to four modules, but with NASA having decided to extend the station’s life to 2024, there are eight years of operations beyond our last delivery, and it is eight years that, unlike the past years, will not have ATV deliveries,” Quaglino said. “So we would expect an order at least as large as the original CRS.”

Europe’s Automated Transfer Vehicle, ATV, is a much larger freighter than the Russian Progress, the Japanese HTV or either of the two U.S. supply vessels. The European Space Agency has ordered just five ATVs, with the fifth scheduled for launch this summer.

The ATV production line in Germany is being shut down, with some of the work being transferred to Europe’s production of a service module for NASA’s Orion crew-transport vehicle. Removing the ATV from the cargo-supply rotation could increase the cargo requirements for CRS 2.

Quaglino said one promising scenario for cutting costs in a CRS 2 order — assuming it is at least as large as the original contract — is to strip out components that are needed for a permanent space-station module but unnecessary for a vehicle that will be launched and then destroyed on atmospheric re-entry within a month or two.

Because Thales Alenia Space had already been building multiple modules for the space station, the company’s Cygnus program borrowed most of this work and applied it to the CRS hardware. At the time, with all the nonrecurring engineering costs amortized by the work on the permanent station modules, the decision was justified, he said.

But with a little advance planning and a sizable order, Quaglino said, a CRS 2 batch could do without some of the cabling and other components that were required for units that would spend years attached to the space station.

British Watchkeeper UAV Finally Cleared to Enter Military Service - Defense Update,"Wed, 05 Mar 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vZGVmZW5zZS11cGRhdGUuY29tLzIwMTQwMzA1X3dhdGNoa2VlcGVyX3J0cy5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The British Army is expected to induct the long awaited Watchkeeper UAV system with its field units, following Release To Service (RTS) by the UK’s Ministry of Defence (MOD). Unfortunately, this milestone is achieved three years behind schedule.

Certified to the same safety standard as manned aircraft, Watchkeeper is the first UAS to be awarded a full (RTS) and is the only UAS of its type allowed to fly in UK airspace. Although 26 air vehicles and 14 ground systems already produced, lack of the formal safety clearance prevented the full induction of the drone with Army units. Thales UK is on contract to deliver 28 additional systems and one additional ground system.

Cleared for operations in the UK, the RTS will allow army crews to fly Watchkeeper sorties in segregated airspace, integrating with the military exercises taking place on Salisbury Plain. The RTS follows the announcement (24 February) that the British Army will begin training flights from Boscombe Down, Wiltshire. Sofar the drone operations were restricted to testing and evaluation – nearly 1000 flight hours were performed by the operators of the prime contractor, Thales UK, 600 of these flights were performed in the approved test airspace near Parc Aberporth, West Wales.

Lt Col Craig Palmer of the British Army commended the high safety levels demonstrated by the new system, “The safety bar for Watchkeeper has been set very high. The detailed reviews and testing of the whole system have provided significant evidence that the system is maturing rapidly; sufficiently enough to support an RTS recommendation.” Over the coming weeks the pilots and support crews of 1st Artillery Brigade will be trained to fly the drones in a restricted airspace over the Salisbury Plain Training Area. The flights, which will take place between 8,000 and 16,000 feet, will be overseen by military air traffic controllers.

“The process of achieving RTS and the other certifications required for Watchkeeper has been ground-breaking, not only for Thales but also for the MOD and the CAA”, said Victor Chavez, CEO of Thales UK. “Much painstaking work has been required by all parties to deliver the comprehensive and rigorous certification, but our collective achievement is a great one: the first tactical UAS allowed to fly in UK airspace.”

An RTS is the formal statement, on behalf of the Chief of General Staff, that an acceptable safety case has been prepared for the aircraft and its equipment. An RTS is required for all aircraft (manned and unmanned) subject to Military Aviation Authority (MAA) regulated service flying, and is written for the aircrew and engineers responsible for the day-to-day supervision of flying operations and the desk officers responsible for developing policy and procedures.

Watchkeeper is a high-performance, multi-sensor, all-weather UAS that can remain airborne for more than 16 hours in a single mission. These unarmed tactical UAS will be deployed by the British Army surveillance, reconnaissance, intelligence gathering and target acquisition missions, in support of military operations at supporting brigade-level and below. Watchkeeper is expected to remain in service at least until 2040.

Watchkeeper has been developed by Thales with strong support from its supply chain, including UAV Tactical Systems Limited (U-TacS), which was established at contract award as a joint venture company between Thales and Elbit Systems."
JetBlue to Spin-Off IFE Provider LiveTV - NYCAviation - NYCAviation,"Fri, 14 Mar 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55Y2F2aWF0aW9uLmNvbS8yMDE0LzAzL2pldGJsdWUtc3Bpbi1pZmUtcHJvdmlkZXItbGl2ZXR2LzMzMDk20gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"New York City based JetBlue Airways announced on Thursday that they have reached an agreement to sell their LiveTV subsidiary to Thales Group for a cash price of $400 million. LiveTV is the provider of the live in-flight entertainment and connectivity systems used by JetBlue and several other carriers. The sale is expected to close by mid-2014. JetBlue CFO Mark Powers said in a statement, “This transaction, once completed, preserves JetBlue’s access to the most innovative inflight entertainment. At the same time, we believe JetBlue will benefit from the reduced operating costs and capital expenditures related to running LiveTV as a subsidiary.”

Robin Hayes, President of JetBlue also said in a statement “LiveTV has been an important part of building the JetBlue experience. Their ability to combine market leadership and drive technological advances has given JetBlue a market advantage in the onboard experience.” JetBlue purchased LiveTV in September of 2002 in order to gain control of what has become one of JetBlue’s signature in-flight offerings. LiveTV is installed in all of JetBlue’s aircraft, and currently provides passengers with live television through DirecTV, in addition to satellite radio through SiriusXM.

JetBlue is in the process of rolling out their new in-flight wi-fi service, called Fly-Fi. JetBlue promises that Fly-Fi will provide passengers with internet speeds that are comparable to their broadband speed at home, which will be on the order of eight times faster than inflight products offered by other airlines. The faster speeds and increased bandwidth are made possible by utilizing high-speed Ka-band satellite connectivity provided by LiveTV and satellite provider ViaSat.

Thales Group, a French aerospace and defense company, is purchasing LiveTV to bolster its position in a rapidly growing sector. Jean-Bernard Levy, the Chairman and CEO of Thales said in a statement, “LiveTV is a great strategic fit for Thales. It will improve our positioning in the high growth business of in-flight entertainment and connectivity.” Levy went on to say, “Our aim is to offer the highest performance, and most competitive and flexible connectivity solution to airlines regardless of their fleet size, aircraft type or route structure.”

As this transaction closes, JetBlue will enter into long term agreements with LiveTV to continue providing support for its live television and internet services. LiveTV was founded in Melbourne, Florida in 1998. Originally a joint venture between Harris Corporation and BE Aerospace, Thales later purchased BE’s stake. JetBlue purchased LiveTV from Thales and Harris in 2002 for approximately $80 million. LiveTV’s systems are installed in over 700 aircraft around the world, not only for JetBlue, but also Frontier, AirTran, Alitalia, Virgin Blue, WestJet, United and Azul. LiveTV has maintenance and support facilities around the globe, employing around 450 people.

Dirigible Drones Will Watch the World From 13 Miles Up - WIRED,"Thu, 20 Mar 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiKGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS8yMDE0LzAzL2RpcmdpYmxlcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"With UAVs crowding navigable airspace and plans underway to put giant mega-satellites into orbit, it was just a matter of time before a drone-satellite hybrid was developed to fit between the two spaces.

StratoBus, a new project out of France, is conceptualized to do just that. Designed to be about the length of a football field and 25 yards in diameter, the blimp-shaped vehicle's shell will be made of carbon fiber.

Without a launcher, StratoBus floats to the lower stratosphere at an altitude of about 13 miles where developers say it will be in a perfect position to carry out a range of functions, including surveillance, border security monitoring, communications reinforcement and facilitating navigation — all from a stationary position with the help of two self-adjusting electric motors. The StratoBus will be able to endure missions of up to a year with a total lifetime of five years.

The ultra-lightweight design allows for a plug-and-play payload on the nacelle that can accommodate up to 450 pounds. And because the drone-tellite stays closer to earth, it will be able to take higher resolution images and maintain a stronger communications system. It might even be used to boost GSM network capacity during high traffic periods.

StratoBus will have a state-of-the-art solar power system with panels that rotate to maximize sun access coupled with a power amplification system to handle any surges in expended power.

The StratoBus project is led by Thales Alenia Space with Airbus Defence & Space, Zodiac Marine and CEA-Liten, who say they expect the first prototype within five years."
StratoBus seeks to occupy the midpoint between airship and satellite - New Atlas,"Thu, 27 Mar 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3YXRsYXMuY29tL3RoYWxlcy1hbGVuaWEtc3BhY2Utc3RyYXRvYnVzLWFpcnNoaXAvMzEzOTUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Satellites may be very useful for communications, navigation and other applications, but they're awfully expensive to build and launch, and once they're in orbit ... well, there's no reusing them. That's why a consortium led by Thales Alenia Space is developing the StratoBus. It's a planned autonomous airship that can be launched like a regular blimp, but that will be able to hover at an altitude of 20 km (12 miles) – that's up in the stratosphere, hence the name.

According to the company, the StratoBus will be 70 to 100 meters long (230 to 328 ft), and 20 to 30 meters (66 to 98 ft) in width. Its envelope will be made mainly of UV-resistant woven carbon fiber, and its two fuel cell-powered prop motors will allow it to maintain its position, even when subjected to winds blowing at up to 90 km/h (56 mph).

The fuel cell will be located in its nacelle (the bottom part, that sits where the gondola would be on a manned airship), along with an electrolyzer for obtaining hydrogen from an onboard water supply, plus its communications and other electronics. Different nacelles will be swapped on and off of one airship body between missions, as each one will be specially outfitted for its intended purpose. Payloads of up to 200 lb (91 kg) will be possible.

The electrolyzer will be solar-powered. Sunlight will stream into the airship's ""balloon"" through a transparent section of the envelope, then reflect off an internal concentrating mirror, and onto a row of solar panels. That section will be able to stay aligned with the sun, as the balloon will rotate relative to the rest of the vehicle.

Suggested applications for the StratoBus are much the same as those currently served by satellites, including observation, security, telecommunications, broadcasting and navigation. It is estimated that each airship should have a lifespan of about five years, which is also the amount of time that Thales Alenia Space believes it will take to build the first prototype. The company is collaborating on the project with Airbus Defence & Space, Zodiac Marine and CEA-Liten.

The whole thing sounds not unlike Google's Project Loon, which is aimed at getting high-speed internet to underserved parts of the world via radio-equipped balloons. According to Thales Alenia, though, ""The advantage of StratoBus is that it offers long endurance and complete autonomy from a fixed position, while the high-altitude balloons in Loon move around the Earth and will offer only limited autonomy.""

It also, however, brings to mind Lockheed Martin’s HALE-D airship, and Titan Aerospace's fixed-wing Solara ""atmospheric satellite.""

StratoBus airship prototype targeted within next five years (w/ video) - Phys.org,"Sat, 22 Mar 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vcGh5cy5vcmcvbmV3cy8yMDE0LTAzLXN0cmF0b2J1cy1haXJzaGlwLXByb3RvdHlwZS15ZWFycy12aWRlby5odG1s0gFJaHR0cHM6Ly9waHlzLm9yZy9uZXdzLzIwMTQtMDMtc3RyYXRvYnVzLWFpcnNoaXAtcHJvdG90eXBlLXllYXJzLXZpZGVvLmFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Credit: Thales

(Phys.org) —A project that presents a concept of something between drone and satellite is under way. The vehicle is called StratoBus, developed in Europe. The StratoBus will be able to carry out missions such as border and maritime surveillance, telecommunications, broadcasting and navigation. Potential applications include boosting GSM network capacity for public events and GPS augmentation over dense traffic areas. The shell fabric is made of braided carbon fiber. The StratoBus will be able to carry payloads up to 200 kg. The first prototype is planned for rollout within the next five years. StratoBus is described as an autonomous stationary platform and the company emphasized its two notable features, the ability to carry out long endurance observation and complete autonomy from a fixed position.

The StratoBus project is led by Thales Alenia Space, which is focused on space telecommunications and navigation. ""We design, integrate, test and operate high-performance satellite technologies in both civil and defense sectors,"" according to the company notes. Airbus Defence & Space, Zodiac Marine and CEA-Liten are partners. The project is part of the creation of an airship company by the Pégase competitiveness cluster in southern France. The Pégase cluster is a network of major players in the aeronautics and space industry of the Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region, pooling those involved with UAVs, balloons and stratospheric aircrafts for specific missions. (The Cote d'Azur is a crossroads in Europe for aerospace research, where there is a network of subcontractors and specialist companies working closely with research laboratories.)

StratoBus will be operating at an altitude of about 20 kilometers, the lower reaches of the stratosphere but above air traffic and jet streams. The airship measures 70 to 100 meters long and 20 to 30 meters in diameter. The company said its design carries ""technological innovations,"" in particular to make sure it captures the sun's rays in all seasons; a power generation system coupling solar panels to a solar power amplification system; and a light reversible fuel cell for energy storage.

The company said the StratoBus platform will require continuous, significant energy input to offset the wind. Two electric motors will automatically adjust their output power depending on wind speed, up to 90 km/h.

For about the past quarter-century, since the self-inflicted demise of the once-dominant Singer-Link in the late 1980s, the commercial aviation Level D full-flight simulator business has been a story of CAE and the dwarfs. It still is, for the time being; however, the dwarfs have now almost all joined forces with well-heeled new friends, seeking to cash in on the perceived profit mine of airline expansion.

Unwilling to concede any of the roughly 75 per cent market share they have enjoyed for the past several years, Montreal-based CAE has been aggressively signing new deals with customers – a record-shattering 43 full-flight simulators (FFSs) announced through late January (the previous high mark was 38) with two full months remaining in the company’s fiscal year.

Among the former dwarfs who intend to challenge CAE’s near-monopoly in the coming years is Montreal neighbour Mechtronix, acquired by Bell Helicopter owner Textron in November, along with another small but equally persistent entrepreneurial simulation firm, Opinicus, based in the Tampa, Fla. area.

A year earlier, traditional CAE nemesis Thales sold its civil simulation and training business to L-3 Communications. U.S. defence giant Lockheed Martin acquired Netherlands-based simulator manufacturer Sim-Industries in 2011. Aircraft avionics specialist Rockwell Collins amalgamated NLX, Evans & Sutherland, and SEOS Displays into an integrated FFS operation in 2003-08. And FlightSafety International, founded six decades ago by industry legend A.L. Ueltschi, became part of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway holdings in 1996.

Buffett’s Berkshire is No. 5 on the Fortune 500 list with more than US$160 billion in annual sales. Lockheed Martin (No. 59) is approaching $50 billion in annual sales. L-3 (No. 197) and Textron (No. 225) are both above $12 billion. Rockwell Collins is just outside the elite list with about $5 billion. By comparison, CAE’s yearly revenue is slightly under $2 billion (over $2 billion in Canadian dollars).

Other than the family-run Frasca International, CAE is the only “pure play” remaining in the niche industry of flight simulation; their only focus is on training. Their competitors, though now with different brand names on the business cards, are many of the same leaders and engineers they have successfully competed with over the years. And historically, training business units, which are part of large, bureaucratic conglomerates risk being neglected in terms of investment and overburdened with corporate overhead cost and paperwork. This appeared to be the case with Thales’ training unit (elements of the former Rediffusion Simulation and Singer Link-Miles in the U.K.), which had been in steady decline, at least in commercial simulator sales, before being rescued by L-3. In 2006, for example, Thales sold 16 FFSs to CAE’s 28, but in recent years Thales’ sales had dropped to the mid-single digits.

But the X factor in the full-flight simulator mix is the potentially deep pockets of CAE’s new challengers. The capability to sustain investment in new technology concepts – or to buy market share with loss-leader bids.

With the Fortune 500 businesses, it is sometimes difficult to know the true revenues and profitability of their simulation units; the numbers are buried among layers of other groups and divisions. In 2011, the year before it was sold to L-3, Thales pegged its fixed-wing civil simulation revenues at €97million (US$132 million, Canadian $152 million). Textron reportedly paid about US$125 million for both Mechtronix and Opinicus. L-3 bought the Thales business, which included some training centre assets, for about $132 million. CAE’s revenues for the segment they label “Simulation Products/Civil,” were Cdn $402.4 million (US$361.2 million) for its FY2013.

Despite the buyer’s-market pricing pressures, CAE margins have held up remarkably well. In the most recent quarter reported (in November), Q2 of FY 2014, civil simulator sales represented about 30 per cent of the company’s operating income and a 19 per cent profit margin, compared with 13.4 per cent operating profit overall.

CAE also has a strong base of long-time customers, including joint venture training centres with traditional carriers such as Emirates, China Southern, LAM-TAN, Iberia, and ambitious low-fare airlines such as AirAsia and Cebu Pacific.

Simulation is not a huge market, certainly not compared with aircraft and avionics. With Airbus, ATR, Boeing, Bombardier, Embraer, and others delivering about 1,500 new aircraft per year that translates to roughly 60 new full-flight simulators based on a rule-of-thumb of 25 aircraft per FFS. An airline’s training requirement varies, of course, according to how much a simulator is used for longer initial type-rating or transition courses and shorter recurrent training courses. Also, one significant training trend is shifting some training tasks away from the $10 to 20 million FFSs to considerably cheaper non-motion simulators or monitor-based procedures trainers.

So, with CAE snatching up nearly 50 sales worldwide, the rest of the industry is left with a handful of deals each. Deploying two or three simulators a year is not a viable business model, so we can expect some of the diversified conglomerates to abandon the civil simulator domain in due course. Or perhaps one of them, or another aerospace megacorp, will buy CAE itself.

In a sense, the new era in this domain is just ramping up. It will take Textron-Mechtronix-Opinicus some time to sort out their new organization and determine which technologies they will keep and expand. L-3 Link has only recently integrated Thales and is gaining traction. Rockwell was relatively dormant in this space for some years but has recently become very active, especially in China. Lockheed replaced the original Sim-Industries leadership last summer. And at CAE, there’s also a new team at the top; civil group president Jeff Roberts, who had directed that business for more than a decade, was replaced by supersalesman Nick Leontidis.

Here’s an overview of CAE’s well-funded foes and some of their technologies and recent market activities:

FlightSafety International

New York City-based FlightSafety is a strong No. 1 to CAE’s No. 2 in the business aviation training sector, a market for which both companies build their own simulators.

The two rivals are about equal in the rapidly growing civil helicopter market. FlightSafety has S-92 FFSs in operation at its Farnborough, U.K., West Palm Beach, Florida, and Lafayette, La., centres. In March, Sikorsky and FSI announced orders for four more S92 FFSs – to be positioned in Lafayette, Brazil, Norway and Southeast Asia.

In commercial aviation, FlightSafety’s strength is with regional airlines, particularly in North America. It offers simulators for Bombardier’s CRJ and Dash 8 series at multiple locations in Canada and the U.S., as well as the U.K. They’ve also built an ATR 42/72 turboprop FFS for Azul Airlines in Brazil, as well as a couple of Embraer E-jet trainers. In 2013, FlightSafety delivered a Beechcraft 1900D SIM to Air New Zealand.

FlightSafety’s latest visual system, VITAL 1100, is now being fielded on both fixed-wing and helicopter simulators. The first were on a Sikorsky S-92 device in Stavanger, Norway, an S-92 and AgustaWestland AW-139 in Lafayette, a Eurocopter EC-135 (with night vision goggle capability in Dallas, Tex. and an Embraer 190 in St. Louis, Mo. The computational performance of VITAL 1100 is claimed to be up to five times greater than that of its predecessor. Since its 2009 acquisition of Glass Mountain Optics, FlightSafety has implemented glass mirror displays, said to be free of visible distortions and artifacts out to the mirror edge.

L-3 Link/Thales

Link Simulation & Training, based in Crawley U.K., won a contract in December for a Boeing 787 FFS for KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. They also received Level D certification on a 787 Reality Seven device for a Middle Eastern customer. The former Thales operation has been Boeing Alteon’s designated Dreamliner simulator provider, but a majority of 787 FFSs openly competed by airlines had been won by CAE.

Link also won 777-300ER simulator contracts from China Airlines for installation in Taipei, and from EVA Airways, also in Taiwan. Both are scheduled for 2014 delivery. In January, Link received certification for an Airbus A320 FFS for EVA.

In June 2013, Link announced expansion of the Asian Aviation Training Centre (AATC) it inherited from Thales in Bangkok, Thailand, adding an A330 FFS.

Lockheed/Sim-Industries

Sim-Industries has been relatively quiet since the Lockheed takeover and the subsequent reorganization in 2012, when it became Lockheed Martin Mission Systems and Training. Last summer, Sim-Industries founder Frank Uit den Bogaard stepped down as CEO, succeeded by Jeffrey Wood, who was previously in charge of airlines and fleets for StandardAero.

In September, Lockheed signed a contract with Lufthansa Flight Training, one of the industry’s most demanding customers, for a Boeing 777-300 FFS. Sim-Industries also won a contract with another industry benchmark,

FedEx, for a pair of 767 FFSs. Other Sim-Industries customers have included Sri Lankan Airlines, Jakarta Aviation in Indonesia, Japan’s Panda Flight Academy, and even CAE (indirectly) in an A320 for Oxford Aviation Academy, which CAE acquired in 2012.

Lockheed opened a flight training facility in Brazil last February, serving GOL and other South American airlines.

Rockwell Collins

Banking on a 30-year history of doing business in China, Rockwell Collins formed a joint venture company – ACCEL (Tianjin) Flight Simulation – with Beijing Bluesky Aviation Technology, a subsidiary of the Aviation Industry Corporation in China (AVIC). Its training centre southeast of Beijing will focus on commercial flight training and is expected to open in May. ACCEL will be managed by Rockwell’s Andrew Morris, who spent 24 years with CAE, including a role as VP, marketing.

Colin Mahoney, Rockwell SVP, International, said the JV will develop Level D simulators for single-aisle aircraft, initially for Chinese airlines “and ultimately for the rest of the world.”

Rockwell and Beijing Bluesky have previously worked together on China’s C919, MA60, and MA600 programs. Mahoney regards their open systems architecture design as the strength of the strategy, applicable both to simulation and flight decks. The open architecture approach incorporated in Rockwell’s Pro Line Fusion avionics is featured in the Bombardier CSeries commercial aircraft, which is in flight test phase in Montreal, as well as in the Mitsubishi Regional Jet being developed in Japan.

Textron/Mechtronix/Opinicus

Mechtronix was innovative and bold to the point of brash in challenging the simulation status quo when the Concordia University graduates launched the company in 2004. And though their sales were infrequent, Mechtronix represented the proverbial gnat on the elephant’s behind. Positioning its headquarters within walking distance from CAE down the Cote de Liesse near Pierre Trudeau airport, Mechtronix claimed it could reduce the cost of simulation by 50 per cent.

In commercial aviation, FlightSafety Internatonal’s strength is with regional airlines, particularly in North America.

Mechtronix targeted second- and third-tier airlines such as Copa in Panama and schools like the Civil Aviation Flight University of China (CAFUC). Sales of high-end simulators hovered around three to five per year.

There were periodic rumblings that the upstart would go out of business, but then Mechtronix would receive an infusion of survival cash – $18.6 million in 2010 from the federal government’s Strategic Aerospace and Defence Initiative and $7 million from the Business Development Bank of Canada in 2009, as examples.

Around 2008, a representative of Richardson Capital called to solicit my thoughts on the flight simulation market as a potential investment. The rep didn’t mention which company they were interested in, but not long after, the Calgary-based private equity firm, part of James Richardson & Sons, Winnipeg (found in 1857), purchased a sizeable stake in Mechtronix for $39 million.

Textron’s new training business will be led by Opinicus co-founder Jim Takats, a BEEE electrical engineering graduate of McGill University in Montreal who in the early ’80s worked a stretch at CAE as an avionics engineer. Takats is regarded as one of the foremost experts in the science of motion cueing for flight simulators, and was team leader for the Royal Aeronautical Society’s international working group on the topic. Mechtronix, on the other hand, has been a vocal advocates for eliminating the motion requirement for fixed-wing flight simulation.

“We are already seeing the opportunities for customers that come with such deep compatibility between the established AAI, Mechtronix, and Opinicus offerings and capabilities,” Takats told Wings. Textron Simulation & Training Systems has the right team in place, the right capabilities and a proven history of high-performance products and industry-leading expertise.”"
UK's Watchkeeper UAV cleared for military flight training - New Atlas,"Thu, 06 Mar 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3YXRsYXMuY29tL3dhdGhja2VlcGVyLXVhdi1yZWxlYXNlLXRvLXNlcnZpY2UvMzExMjMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Since first taking to the air in June 2009, trials of the UK's homegrown Watchkeeper tactical unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) have been conducted by industry partners including QinetiQ. The UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) has now announced the aircraft has been awarded a Release To Service, clearing the way for flight training to begin with the Royal Artillery.

The Watchkeeper WK450, which was developed and built for the British Army by Thales UK after being awarded an £800 million contract in 2005, is based on the Elbit Hermes 450 UAV. With the ability to stay in the air for more than 16 hours at a time, the Watchkeeper is designed to support ground troops with its surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities. Although it is currently unarmed, the Royal Artillery may weaponize the Watchkeeper in the future.

To this end, the all-weather aircraft with a wingspan of 35 ft (10.6 m) boasts dual payload capabilities and carries a synthetic aperture radar/ground moving target indicator (SAR/GMTI) and either a datalink relay or electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) sensor, with the option of a laser target designator (LTD). Although unmanned, Thales says the Watchkeeper is certified to the same safety standards as a manned aircraft.

It is designed for automatic take-off and landing and is operated by a crew of two from a ground control station. One operator controls the mission, while the other tracks the information gathered by the UAV's sensors. Thales says the information gathered will allow commanders to detect, identify and track targets without putting troops in harm's way.

The Watchkeeper is the first UAV to be granted a Release To Service by the MoD and the only UAV of its type allowed to be flown in UK airspace. With Thales test pilots having already completed over 600 hours of flight tests from West Wales Airport, the British Army will now begin test flights at the MoD's Boscombe Down aircraft testing site in Wiltshire, England, with 1st Artillery Brigade pilots trained to fly the aircraft in a restricted airspace over the Salisbury Plain Training Area at altitudes of between 8,000 and 16,000 ft (2,440 and 4,880 m).

Originally slated to enter service from late 2010, the Release To Service puts the aircraft on track to achieve this goal sometime this year.
