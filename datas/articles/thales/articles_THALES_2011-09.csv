DSEi: Thales outlines Sea King 7 replacement proposal | News | Flight Global - Flightglobal,"Thu, 15 Sep 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vZHNlaS10aGFsZXMtb3V0bGluZXMtc2VhLWtpbmctNy1yZXBsYWNlbWVudC1wcm9wb3NhbC8xMDIwNzkuYXJ0aWNsZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales UK hopes to secure a deal to provide the mission equipment for the Royal Navy's replacement organic airborne early warning system, with its proposal based on the re-use of Cerberus equipment installed on the service's current Westland Sea King 7s.

Being used in Afghanistan and also recently employed over Libya, the navy's operational airborne surveillance and control system (ASaC) aircraft will have to be replaced soon, as the Ministry of Defence plans to retire its last Sea Kings by around 2016.

Under current plans, the ASaC mission should be assumed by some of the 30 navy AgustaWestland AW101 Merlins, which will be upgraded to the HM2 multi-mission standard under a deal led by prime contractor Lockheed Martin UK.

Thales UK's idea is to adapt the Sea King's current Cerberus fit, with its Searchwater 2000 radar to be installed on the Merlin and deployed using elevator rails attached to the aircraft's fuselage. Roughly one-third of the fleet could be equipped with airborne early-warning sensors at any one time, with all capable of carrying it.

""The MoD has bought the equipment, and it's doing a great job in Afghanistan,"" said Nick Marks, head of ASaC development for Thales UK.

""Our sensor is fully multi-role over water, air-to-air and overland. We are the only system of the kind already in operational use for the role required.""

Lockheed is also understood to be pursuing the RN requirement. Material displayed on its stand at the Defence & Security Equipment International (DSEi) exhibition in London included an airborne surveillance-and-control data sheet depicting a Merlin fitted with a pod-housed active electronically scanned array radar.

This would feature synthetic aperture radar and ground moving-target indication modes and be suitable for tasks such as fighter control and maritime and battlefield surveillance.

Also incorporating a gimballed radar and electronic support measures and identification friend-or-foe equipment, each pylon-mounted pod would weigh roughly 280kg (617lb), with the system to provide 360° coverage.

Lockheed said the design represents ""a role-fit solution which can be mounted on any fixed-wing transport/surveillance aircraft or medium-sized helicopter"".

First Galileo satellite touches down in French Guiana - Phys.org,"Fri, 09 Sep 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vcGh5cy5vcmcvbmV3cy8yMDExLTA5LWdhbGlsZW8tc2F0ZWxsaXRlLWZyZW5jaC1ndWlhbmEuaHRtbNIBQWh0dHBzOi8vcGh5cy5vcmcvbmV3cy8yMDExLTA5LWdhbGlsZW8tc2F0ZWxsaXRlLWZyZW5jaC1ndWlhbmEuYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The first Galileo In-Orbit Validation satellite landed at Cayenne Rochambeau Airport in French Guiana on 7 September 2011. Known as Flight Model 2, FM2, it took off by Antonov transport from Thales Alenia Space Italy's Rome facility where it was built.

The first Galileo navigation satellite has arrived in Europe’s Spaceport in French Guiana, ready to begin preparations for launch on 20 October.

Packed within its protective, air-conditioned container, the satellite landed at Cayenne Rochambeau Airport aboard an Antonov aircraft at 06:45 local time on Wednesday 7 September, having departed from Thales Alenia Space Italy’s Rome facility, where it was built.

A Thales and ESA team stood ready to receive it, having flown into French Guiana the previous week, along with all the testing and support equipment.

The team loaded the satellite container on a lorry for transport to the Guiana Space Center, where it arrived at 10:00 local time and was moved into the preparation facility.

It stayed there overnight for the temperature to settle before it was taken out of its container the following morning.

The satellite is due to be launched aboard a Soyuz ST-B vehicle on 20 October, together with a second Galileo that is now being readied for its own flight to French Guiana.



This will be the first launch of Russia’s workhorse Soyuz rocket from French Guiana. It will take place from a new facility 13 km northwest of the Ariane 5 launch site.

The Galileo In-Orbit Validation (IOV) ProtoFlight Model (PFM) and Flight Models (FM-2, FM-3 and FM-4) undergoing assembly and testing at Thales Alenia Space’s facility in Rome during May 2011. The launch of the first two satellites of Europe's global navigation satellite system is planned to take place on 20 October 2011. This will be the first of a series of Galileo satellite launches by Arianespace from Europe's Spaceport in French Guiana. The first two Galileo IOV satellites will be deployed using a Soyuz launcher. The October launch will mark the inaugural Soyuz flight from its new launch facilities in French Guiana, built in the framework of a European Space Agency programme. Galileo is Europe's state-of-the-art global satellite navigation system, providing a highly accurate, guaranteed global positioning service under civil control. Its definition, development and In-Orbit Validation phases were carried out by ESA and co-funded by ESA and the European Community. The Full Operational Capability phase of the Galileo programme is managed and fully funded by the European Commission. The Commission and ESA have signed a delegation agreement by which ESA acts as design and procurement agent on behalf of the Commission. Credits: ESA - S. Corvaja, 2011

Next year, the second pair of satellites will join them in orbits at 23 222 km altitude, proving the design of the Galileo system in advance of the other 26 satellites destined to join them.

The two Soyuz ST-B launchers – the more powerful variant of the two configurations of the upgraded Soyuz-ST launcher operated by Arianespace from the CSG – plus the reignitable Fregat-MT upper stages that will guide the satellites into their final orbits reached French Guiana from Russia in June.

Final assembly of the three-stage Soyuz ST-B and the fuelling of the Fregat-MT upper stage will start next week, well in time for the launch date.

Soyuz from French Guiana



October’s launch will be historic: the first Soyuz launch from a spaceport outside of Baikonur in Kazakhstan or Plesetsk in Russia.

French Guiana is much closer to the equator, so each launch will benefit from Earth’s spin, increasing the maximum payload into geostationary transfer orbit from 1.7 tonnes to 3 tonnes.



As a medium-class launcher, Soyuz will complement Ariane and Vega to increase the flexibility and competitiveness of Europe’s launcher family.

Each three-stage rocket will be assembled horizontally in the traditional Russian manner, transferred to the pad and moved to the vertical so that its payload can be added from above.

The new mobile gantry also protects the satellites and the vehicle from the humid tropical environment.

Galileo



These first four Galileo satellites, built by a consortium led by EADS Astrium Germany, will form the operational nucleus of the full Galileo satnav constellation.

They combine the best atomic clock ever flown for navigation – accurate to one second in three million years – with a powerful transmitter to broadcast precise navigation data worldwide."
Supacat’s Introduces a Military Version of the Wildcat Race Car - Defense Update,"Mon, 12 Sep 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vZGVmZW5zZS11cGRhdGUuY29tLzIwMTEwOTEyX3N1cGFjYXQlRTIlODAlOTlzLWludHJvZHVjZXMtYS1taWxpdGFyeS12ZXJzaW9uLW9mLXRoZS13aWxkY2F0LXJhY2UtY2FyLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Supacat have added a new, lightweight, super agile military variant of the Rally Raid proven Wildcat into its military, special purpose vehicle family. The new Wildcat offers a high performance, off road vehicle for special forces, border patrol, reconnaissance, rapid intervention and strike roles.

“Compared to other ‘Modified Off The Shelf’ vehicles, the Wildcat is on a different level in terms of performance and durability” said Jamie Clarke, Sales and Marketing Manager, Supacat. ”It has the race results to prove it can perform in the desert and other environments, it is light and agile yet big enough to carry the sub-systems required on operations. As military vehicles have become heavier and more expensive due to increased protection requirements, we perceive that there is a gap in the market for a platform like the Wildcat.

According to Supacat, the new vehicle is filling a significant gap that currently exists between lightweight and less expensive high mobility platforms such as quad bikes and the heavier, more specialist and well renowned Jackal. The company teamed with Wildcat Design Authority, QT Services, the developer of the vehicle to transform the race car into an affordable, off-road military variant of the Wildcat 500 DKR which was proved highly effective in off-road races such as the Paris-Dakar race. Beyond the prototype phase, Supacat will be responsible for militarizing the vehicle, including systems integration and volume production. As other Supacat specialized vehicles such as the Jackal and SPV400, the Wildcat will be offered with lightweight armor protection, weapons and communications systems, to meet specific requirements.

According to Clarke, Supacat has a history of successfully using the motorsport industry to enhance its vehicles, for example, the Jackal has over 14 motorsport companies in its supply chain. However, the Wildcat represents a new level of integration of motorsport solutions for military use as it is the first time an entire platform is adapted into a military vehicle.

The Wildcat has a tubular space-frame chassis and state of the art suspension with an outstanding reputation for rugged reliability. With a Gross Vehicle Weight of 2580kg and size (3800mm x 1755mm) it is easily air portable. Maximum speed is 106 mph (170km/h) and range is 2000km. The Wildcat is available with specially developed air conditioning to greatly reduce crew fatigue. It also shares some parts with Land Rover so the logistic footprint is reduced for any military customer who already has Land Rovers in service. Supacat will be displaying a militarized variant of Wildcat at DSEi in September."
Five bid for Special Ops vehicle - Australian Defence Magazine,"Fri, 02 Sep 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1c3RyYWxpYW5kZWZlbmNlLmNvbS5hdS9uZXdzL2ZpdmUtYmlkLWZvci1zcGVjaWFsLW9wcy12ZWhpY2xl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"ADM believes there are five (or possibly four and a half) contenders for JP2097 1B, Special Operations Vehicle – Commando, (SOV-Cdo) bids for which closed recently.

They were: BAE Systems (RG41); GD Land Systems (Eagle); Force Protection (Ocelot WMIK); Supacat (Nary) and Thales Australia (Hawkei).

Defence’s intention was to acquire MOTS vehicles for the SOV-Cdo requirement which suggests that Thales’ Hawkei bid may have been accepted as a part offer only.

The SOV-Cdo requirement is for between 40-80 vehicles with considerable speed and agility and able to carry up to eight personnel.

The vehicles would require crew ballistic and mine blast protection.

Proposals would need to include an integrated logistic support (ILS) package covering operating, engineering, maintenance, supply and training support.

The SOV-Cdo will require integration of a range of electronic systems, radios and a Battle Management System (BMS) in the form of a Networked Special Operations Capability - Mounted (NSOC-M).The successful tenderer must be able to work with the NSOC-MContractor (Elbit Systems), who will be responsible for systems integration, design and installation of the NSOC-M on the SOV-Cdo Prototype.

The RFT also sought an option for a SOV Remote Weapon Station (RWS) for possible assessment as a costed option. One assumes that both EOS and Kongsberg have approached all primes with RWS costings’ and integration offers."
German frigates set for Cape missile tests - defenceWeb,"Thu, 08 Sep 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuY2V3ZWIuY28uemEvc2VhL3NlYS1zZWEvZ2VybWFuLWZyaWdhdGVzLXNldC1mb3ItY2FwZS1taXNzaWxlLXRlc3RzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Two German frigates are in port at Simon’s Town ahead of a missile firing exercise off the southern Cape. The air defence frigate FGS Sachsen (F219, pictured) and the general purpose frigate FGS Schleswig-Holstein (F216) arrived earlier this week.

The ships will conduct the firing exercises in the waters of the Overberg Test Range, a subsidiary of the state arsenal Denel. It is understood the undertaking is codenamed Exercise Cutlass. It is further understood that a supply/replenishment vessel, FGS Berlin, will join the frigates. No South African forces are scheduled to take part in the endeavour.

The Sachsen is lead-ship of the F124 class. She was laid down on February 1, 1999 at the Blohm + Voss yard in Hamburg and commissioned into the Deutsche Marine on December 31, 2003. The design is based on that of the preceding F123 Brandenburg class but with enhanced stealth features, a Thales Nederland APAR multifunction radar as well as a Thales Nederland SMART-L long-range radar claimed to be capable of detecting stealth aircraft and stealth missiles.

In common with the Dutch De Zeven Provinciën class frigates, the Sachsen has an anti-air warfare system built around the APAR and SMART-L radars and the Raytheon SM-2 Block IIIA Standard medium-range area defence as well as Raytheon RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM) point defence surface-to-air missiles. The class is fitted with a 32-cell US Mk41 vertical launch system (VLS). Of the cells, 24 are allocated to the Standard and eight to the smaller ESSM. The latter is fitted four per cell, giving a total of 32 missiles. In addition, the frigate is fitted with two Raytheon Mk49 close-in weapon systems (CIWS) launchers, with 21 Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM) each. Its surface warfare capability lies in two quadruple Harpoon anti-ship missile launchers, a OTO-Melara 76 mm dual-purpose gun and two Mauser MLG 27 27mm autocannons while its anti-submarine ability rests in two triple torpedo launchers with EuroTorp MU90 Impact torpedoes and two AgustaWestland Sea Lynx Mk.88A or two NH90 helicopters equipped with torpedoes or depth charges. The helicopters can also carry MBDA Sea Skua air-to-surface missiles and/or a machine gun.

The Schleswig-Holstein is an example of the Brandenburg class. The wikipedia records they were ordered by the German navy from June 1989 and completed and commissioned between 1994 and 1996. They are currently being upgraded with a new combat management system, a version of the Thales Nederland Tacticos system, being fitted. This will integrate wih the current primary radars – the Thales Nederland LW08 long-range 2D search radar and the Thales Nederland SMART-S medium-range 3D surveillance radar. The class carries an OTO-Melara 76 mm/62 Mk-75 multi-purpose naval gun and two Rheinmetall Rh202 rapid-fire 20mm cannon (to be replaced by the Mauser BK-27). Air defence is provided by a Mk41 Mod 3 VLS fitted with 16 Raytheon RIM7 Sea Sparrow point defence missiles, with plans to upgrade this to ESSM. This is augmented by two RAM CIWS. Four MBDA MM38 Exocet antiship missiles are carried for surface warfare (scheduled to be replaced by the Saab RBS15 Mk3) and four 324mm torpedo launchers for Mk46 antisubmarine torpedoes. The air component consists of two Sea Lynx.

Meanwhile, HMS Edinburgh, a Royal Navy Type 42 (Batch 3) air defence destroyer, is also in port for rest and relaxation. The ship deployed in May 2011 on an eight month voyage that was scheduled to see her visit the Cape Verde and Falkland Islands."
