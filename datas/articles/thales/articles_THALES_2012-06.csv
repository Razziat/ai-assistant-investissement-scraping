Thales-Globalstar Compromise Could Lead to Contract for More Satellites - SpaceNews,"Thu, 28 Jun 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS90aGFsZXMtZ2xvYmFsc3Rhci1jb21wcm9taXNlLWNvdWxkLWxlYWQtY29udHJhY3QtbW9yZS1zYXRlbGxpdGVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Satellite builder Thales Alenia Space has agreed to waive two-thirds of an arbitration award it won against customer Globalstar if the two companies sign a $200 million contract for six new Globalstar satellites by Feb. 28, Globalstar announced June 28.

The agreement was reached just hours before a June 23 deadline that would have permitted Thales Alenia Space to lay down its tools and stop final work on six nearly completed Globalstar mobile communications satellites scheduled for launch this autumn.

Covington, La.-based Globalstar must raise additional cash, and agree to other terms, before Thales Alenia Space will sign the contract for six new satellites, Globalstar said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Once the funds are raised and the other conditions are met, the two companies will sign a contract for six new spacecraft for a total cost of 150 million euros ($200 million), or 25 million euros per satellite.

Globalstar had asked an American Arbitration Association panel to force Cannes, France-based Thales Alenia Space to build at least six new satellites at prices from an earlier contract. The panel ruled against Globalstar, saying the previous contract was no longer in force, and also ruled that Globalstar owed Thales Alenia Space 53 million euros ($69 million) in contract termination fees.

Under the terms of Globalstar’s financing backed by the French export-credit agency, Coface, Thales Alenia Space was obligated to inform Coface of the arbitration award. That notification, on May 23, set in motion a 30-day countdown at the end of which Globalstar would have been forced to pay the award or stand by and watch Thales Alenia Space stop work on the six nearly completed satellites.

Globalstar said that this scenario, if it played out, would force the company to consider strategic alternatives including filing for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

The agreement detailed in the June 28 SEC filing suggests that Thales Alenia Space, which has already built 18 second-generation Globalstar satellites and is finishing six more, sees its greater interest in nursing Globalstar along instead of trying to extract an arbitration award that, given Globalstar’s cash position, would be difficult to secure.

Industry officials had speculated that a de facto payment of the arbitration award, or a portion of it, would be embedded in any new contract between Thales Alenia Space and Globalstar. Both companies declined to comment on their new relationship.

One industry official said the two companies’ agreement to suspend a proceeding in a U.S. District Court to collect the arbitration award until July 16 did not stop the Coface countdown. This could have led the export-credit agency to find Globalstar in default on its Coface-backed financing agreement and forced a stop-work order by Thales Alenia Space.

The six satellites in final preparation at Thales Alenia Space’s Rome facility are the last of 24 that Globalstar ordered with the Coface-backed bank loan. The lenders had said they would consider financing a second batch of 24 satellites only after Globalstar had proved its business case with the first batch.

Globalstar has agreed to pay one-third of the arbitration award once it secures the needed funding for the six new satellites and signs the new construction contract. Globalstar said the new contract would be payable over a three-year period once manufacturing begins.

Thales Alenia Space officials say they have analyzed the Globalstar constellation and have concluded, as has Globalstar, that the company’s business plan could be realized with 30 satellites in orbit, not the 48 originally ordered.

A successful Globalstar, they said, could be only six new satellites away. Globalstar’s success is in the satellite builder’s interests, which is why it has continued to work with Globalstar despite the occasionally strained relations between the manufacturer and the customer — especially after Globalstar instigated the arbitration process.

The Thales international group, founded in France in the year 2000 and world leader in the defense industry sector ever since, started its small arms program in 2006 after purchasing from the Australian government the majority shareholding of ADI ‒ Australian Defence Industries, Ltd., the Countryʼs own military industries corporation, which had been manufacturing guns for the military since World War 1 at the Small Arms Factory in Lithgow (New South Wales) ‒ the same establishment that signed in the 1980s a license agreement with the Austrian Steyr-Mannlicher GmbH company to manufacture a variant of the Steyr AUG, dubbed the “F-88 AuSTEYR”, for the armed forces of Australia and New Zealand. Lithgow/ADI engineers first, and more recently the Thales Australia researchers, have put great effort in modernizing the Steyr AUG platform to meet the ever-increasing needs and requirements of the Australian Defence Forces as their deployment in Afghanistan and Iraq became more and more challenging. Between 2011 and 2012, a new and greatly enhanced version of the F-88 “AuSTEYR”, dubbed the EF-88, was developed by Thales Australia under the LAND 125 Soldier Combat System (formerly “Project WUNDURRA”), the Australian future soldier project; the EF-88 was developed in a joint-venture with Steyr-Mannlicher, which allowed to overcome the contract limitations of the first licensing agreements and to push the capabilities of the Steyr AUG to levels of modernity and effectiveness never met since it was first launched in 1977. Thus, by the 2012 edition of the EUROSATORY defence expo that took place during the second week of June in Paris, France, the Thales group was ready to showcase the commercial/export version of the EF-88."
Thales Australia Sends a Hawkei Prototype to Paris - Defense Update,"Mon, 11 Jun 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vZGVmZW5zZS11cGRhdGUuY29tLzIwMTIwNjExX3RoYWxlcy1hdXN0cmFsaWEtaGF3a2VpLXBhcmlzLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales Australia is displaying at Eurosatory the latest version of the Hawkei , selected by the Australian defense for the LAND 121 Phase 4 program. Earlier this month the Australian MOD allocated over $38 million for further development and testing of the new vehicle. Thales is currently contracted to deliver six prototype vehicles for testing within 15 months. The first vehicle will be delivered later in 2012. Through 2013 these prototypes will undergo a range of testing and evaluation including user assessments, capability and reliability testing to evaluate the ability of the vehicle to deliver the capability required by the Australian troops. Following these tests the prime contractor will also have to meet technical and cost criteria. The Australian government will decide on the procurement of up to 1,300 such vehicles in the forthcoming second phase, expected in 2015.

According to Thales Australia CEO Chris Jenkins, the Hawkeye at seven ton weight will deliver a protection level equivalent to that of the much heavier Bushmaster, while deliver payloads of 1.8 tonns. At this weight level (Seven tons without applique armor) the Hawkei can be delivered by air with Chinook helicopter. The crew can then install the B-Kit add-on armor within 30 minutes, without the need for special tools, as each of the applique armor components is designed to be carried by one or two soldiers. Overall the vehicle is designed for a Gross vehicle weight of up to ten tons although some adaptations will be required to meet these weight levels.

This straightforward and effective approach has been developed with Plasan, the protection system designer and integrator for Hawkei. Boeing Defence Australia is also part of the team, providing overall vehicle through life support.

According to Paul Harris, Director of strategy, sales and marketing at Thales Australia, unique dimension of the Hawkei protection architecture is its ‘shallow V hull’, enabling the vehicle to maintain a high level of mine and IED protection without increasing the height of the floor. He also mentioned the applique armor architecture enables the vehicle to adapt to evolving threats with new armor technology.

According to Harris, modularity has been implemented throughout the design. For example, the bolted steel hull can be modified if necessary, to adapt for new configurations; the drive train is compartmentalized entirely from the firewall forward, eliminating the channel that usually contains the driveshaft and exhaust pipe. Inside, the cabin floor is flat, there is no driveshaft protruding the floor, leaving ample cabin space to seat three fully equipped soldiers at the back and two at the front.

The crewmembers have individual multipurpose screens that link to all the vehicle’s systems and sensors, including new ones that may come along in the future, including radios, command and control (BMS), weapon control and recon sensors. This architecture simplifies the integration of new systems on board. Thales plans to integrate a Health and Usage Monitoring Systems (HUMS) driven through the individual touch screens, displaying the vehicle’s performance, engine, electrical supply, power management, weapons and sensors for the crew and maintenance operators.

Trial by vacuum brings next Galileo satellites closer to launch - Phys.org,"Fri, 15 Jun 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vcGh5cy5vcmcvbmV3cy8yMDEyLTA2LXRyaWFsLXZhY3V1bS1nYWxpbGVvLXNhdGVsbGl0ZXMtY2xvc2VyLmh0bWzSAUhodHRwczovL3BoeXMub3JnL25ld3MvMjAxMi0wNi10cmlhbC12YWN1dW0tZ2FsaWxlby1zYXRlbGxpdGVzLWNsb3Nlci5hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The fourth Galileo In-Orbit Validation flight model satellite, FM4, pictured at the start of thermal vacuum testing at Thales Alenia Space Italy's facility in Rome in May 2012.

(Phys.org) -- The next two Galileo navigation satellites have now endured the harsh vacuum and temperature extremes of space on the way to their scheduled 28 September launch.

The fourth satellite completed 20 days of thermal vacuum testing at Thales Alenia Space Italy’s plant in Rome at the start of June. The third satellite completed the same tests the previous month.

“These two satellites are almost identical to the first two Galileo satellites that were launched last 21 October,” explained ESA’s Nigel Watts.

“So we don’t need to carry out full-scale qualification tests because we already know from our in-orbit test campaign that the design performs to our expectations.

“Instead, what we are carrying out is acceptance testing: checking the workmanship, performance and readiness to launch of these new satellites.”

Thermal vacuum testing involves placing each satellite into a vacuum chamber and pumping out all the air. Its external surfaces are then variously heated and cooled while the satellite is operated.

With no air in orbit to moderate temperatures, any part of a satellite in sunlight can become extremely hot, while those parts in shadow or facing deep space grow extremely cold. Critical systems must be kept within a set temperature range, however.

“To give an idea, Galileo’s laser retroreflector on its exterior reached –110°C during the cold phase of testing,” said Guido Barbagallo, Galileo thermal engineer.

“Meanwhile, the navigation high-power amplifiers could be driven to more than +40°C during the hot phase.”

Like most satellites, Galileo’s uses a variety of methods to maintain its temperature range, including multi-layer insulation, heaters, heat pipes relying on evaporating ammonia to shift heat, and radiators to dump waste heat out to space.

Galileo’s passive hydrogen maser atomic clock at the heart of its navigation services is precise to a second in three million years.

But it requires extremely stable thermal conditions to achieve this. Its operating temperature needs to be regulated within a single degree, though in practice a tenth of that can be achieved.

“The passive hydrogen maser is mounted on a 3 mm-thick aluminium plate to help hold a uniform temperature, with waste heat finally radiated to space from the external satellite surface,” added Guido.

The atomic clock and the mounting plate are wrapped in multi-layer insulation and attached to the top panel of the satellite, which is itself kept permanently out of the Sun."
Altantuya and Malaysia's 13th general elections - New Mandala,"Sat, 09 Jun 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld21hbmRhbGEub3JnL2FsdGFudHV5YS1hbmQtbWFsYXlzaWFzLTEzdGgtZ2VuZXJhbC1lbGVjdGlvbnMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"As Malaysia’s thirteenth general elections draw near, the ghost of Altantuya appears to haunt the Prime Minister.

On 19 April, 2012, a Paris court began inquiry into the Scorpene submarine deal from when Najib Razak was the Defense Minister:

Suaram (Malaysia’s leading human rights organisation) has announced that an inquiry into the alleged corruption linked to the purchase of the two Scorpene class submarines, back in 2002 will commence on Thursday, 19 April 2012, at the Paris Tribunal de Grande Instance (TGI), a court that deals with civil litigation matters.

John Berthelsen, the editor of Asia Sentinel, has extensive coverage of the intricasies of this case in this article:

French investigating magistrates probing the US$1.2 billion sale of submarines to the Malaysian Defense Ministry are targeting, among other things, a Hong Kong-based company called Terasasi (Hong Kong) Ltd., whose principal officers are Prime Minister Najib Tun Razak’s close friend and the friend’s father. Investigators believe that at least some of the тВм36 million funneled through Terasasi ended up in the pockets of Najib, who was Malaysia’s defense minister and deputy prime minister when the two Scorpene submarines were purchased from Thales International or Thint Asia. The state-owned defense giant DCN, later known as DCNS, and Thales established a joint company named Armaris to manufacture the submarines in 2002.

Most shocking to date has been this article by Roger Mitton in the Phnom Penh Post:

Soon after meeting her in Hong Kong, Razak took her off to tour Europe in his red Ferrari, wining and dining at all the best spots and finally ending up in Paris where they met Najib. Multilingual Tuya, as well as being drop-dead gorgeous, was also smart and quickly learned about the huge bribe for the sub deal and doubtless envisaged a handsome cut for herself. But succumbing to “fatal attraction syndrome”, she clung relentlessly to Razak, and he, fearing that her indiscretions might bring him down, tried to end the affair. She would not have it, and in desperation, he spoke to Najib and the police were called in to keep her away. Two aggressive Special Branch officers took their assignment literally and kidnapped her. Then they raped her, shot her in the head and blew up her body with C4 explosives from Najib’s defence ministry — and for good measure, erased her entry into Malaysia from immigration records.

While it is unlikely that the court case in Paris and the media reports will have much influence on the United Malays National Organisation’s (UMNO) hard core supporters as well as large traction of rural poor and indigenous people at the coming general elections, the case itself will have far reaching implications for Malaysia’s leadership and its international relations, if Prime Minister Najib Razak is ultimately found guilty."
RAPIDFire – An Air Defense Application for the Cased Telescoped Cannon - Defense Update,"Mon, 11 Jun 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vZGVmZW5zZS11cGRhdGUuY29tLzIwMTIwNjExX3RoYWxlcy1yYXBpZGZpcmUuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Air defense guns have been a controversial weapon in the past, as the guns could not cope effectively with fast, highly maneuvering targets. Yet, with the introduction of slow but illusive UAVs, military forces are wiping the dust from their old cannons, in hope they will be effective against this new threat. Merging trends including new types ammunition, cannons with higher firing accuracy and better command and control are turning these evolving trends into reality.





Thales is developing a new air defense cannon designed to counter small targets including fighter aircraft, helicopters, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), cruise missiles and aerial guided munitions. The self-propelled gun is part of a comprehensive family of products addressing five different pillars of the air defense domain. The new gun dubbed ‘RAPIDFire’ is developed by Thales, Nexter and the Anglo-French joint venture company CTA, providing the 40mm cannon and its unique cased telescoped ammunition. Nexter is developing a dedicated Anti-Aerial Air Burst (AA-AB) projectile designed specifically for the air-defense application, adding to existing armor piercing and high explosive rounds. The new gun went through French Air Force testing in 2011, demonstrating good results. The new ammunition is currently in development, with follow-on testing scheduled for later in 2012.

The new projectile contains a load of tungsten pellets dispersed by a time fuse few seconds after firing (equivalent to range). The scattered pellets create a lethal cloud of steel likely to destroy the target as it flies into it. The unmanned turret mounts the gun, ammunition feed and electro-optical multi-sensor payload providing the target acquisition for RAPIDFire. This system can spot a fighter size aircraft at a distance of 30 km and a helicopter target at half that range.

The system receives target information and intercept assignments from an associated CONTROL Master 60 surveillance radar and CONTROL View command and control module, both provided by Thales. This C2 system controls up to six RAPIDFire units simultaneously. To enter firing mode the RAPIDFire vehicle stops and sets up communications link with the control, a task that generally takes about one minute. According to Thales, the gun can open fire within 4.5 seconds from the target detection by the radar.

The gun has an effective range of 4000 meters against aerial targets and 2,500 m against ground targets. While the gun can fire up to 200 rounds per minute, only one to ten rounds would be required to take out a target. Augmenting the gun, the turret can also carry up to six Starstreak air defense missiles.

New Thales F90 5.56mm Assault Rifle (Next Gen Steyr AUG) - - The Firearm Blog,"Tue, 12 Jun 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZpcmVhcm1ibG9nLmNvbS9ibG9nLzIwMTIvMDYvMTIvbmV3LXRoYWxlcy1mOTAtNS01Nm1tLWFzc2F1bHQtcmlmbGUtbmV4dC1nZW4tc3RleXItYXVnL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales Australia has unveiled the new F90, their latest version of the Steyr AUG. Steyr may have given up development of their AUG, but the Australians continue to evolve the design. The F90 is the commercial/export version of the EF-88 which Thales have been developing for the Australia’s LAND 125 upgrade program. Thales and Steyr will be entering the F90 in the French FAMAS replacement competition.

F90 Carbine

The F90 will be available in 5 versions, all of them chambered in 5.56mm NATO …

F90 Carbine : 16″ barrel, 27.5″ overall length, 7.1 lbs

F90(G) Grenade Carbine : F90 Carbine with 40x46mm grenade launcher, 9 lbs

F90M Marksman : 20″ barrel length, 31.5″ overall length, 7.5 lbs.

F90M(G) Grenade Marksman : F90M Marksman with 40x46mm grenade launcher, 9.57 lbs

F90CQB Close Quarters Carbine: 14.17″ barrel, 25.7″ overall length, 6.9 lbs.

Thales is bucking the barrel length trend. Most new rifle designs are featuring 14″ barrels as the carbine/standard length, 16″ as the marksman length and 10″ as the Close Quarters/PDW length. The extra length may be because of the need to attach a grenade launcher. I don’t think that the F90CQB would only expose the flash hider and the two or three inch forward picatinny rail is not enough on its own to securely mount the launcher.

It looks like a decent, mature modern design to fill the bullpup niche abandoned by many manufacturers.

Thales/Steyr F90 and EF-88 AUG Rifle Review - - The Firearm Blog,"Fri, 15 Jun 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZpcmVhcm1ibG9nLmNvbS9ibG9nLzIwMTIvMDYvMTUvdGhhbGVzc3RleXItZjkwLWFuZC1lZi04OC1hdWctcmlmbGUtcmV2aWV3L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Lusaka, our man in Paris, had the opportunity to closely examine and review the brand new Thales/Steyr F90 rifle.

[ Just to avoid confusion: the EF-88 is an experimental designation for the next-gen rifle being developed by Thales Australia for the Australian Army. The F90 is the export version of the EF-88 and includes some features which have not yet been merged into the EF88. The F88 is the current Australian service rifle. ]

Lusaka says …

I got around to the Thales stand and had a demonstration of the Enhanced F88SA2 and the F90.

In essence the F90 took the benefits of the EF88SA2 and added a few builds including a bolt release button (rather than manually releasing the bolt action which seems rather cumbersome. The company thinks that the Aussies may wish to adopt this feature too into EF88), a 3 stage safety which basically adds a single shot semi-auto function as well as the pre-existing safety stage where it transition from single shot to full auto through the trigger pull. Thales is also offering an option of adding a three round burst selector on the stock if requested.

F90 improvements over F88A2 (Australian Army’s Current Service Rifle)

EF-88 with Grenade Launcher Open

EF-88 with Grenade Launcher Closed

The sight they mention is what they supplied to the Australian’s for what the Aussies’ term Tier 3 troops i.e. non-front line (Tier 1 being special ops types, Tier 2 infantry). It is a low magnification Trijicon as you can see.

The EF-88 seemed to be a substantial improvement in functionality and, critically, weight over the F88 for any poor infantry man. The integration of the grenade launcher was a simple case of sliding it on until the catches engage and with the trigger position and ease of opening and closing it was simplicity itself. The F90 enjoys all those benefits too.

F90 Stripped with Blank Firing Adapter

They did have a F90 with a open prong flash hider (rather than the bird cage in most photos) on to which you could screw a moderator/silencer. They were proud of their blank firing attachment which has a mechanism to release the gases should a real round by accident be inserted and fired but this is Intellectual Property they did not want to discuss. It is the red tubular attachment to the side in one of the photos.

The EF88 is currently undergoing qualification process with the Australians. All the barrels keep the same 1:7 twist to maintain compatibility with NATO ammo.

The Thales company that has designed the EF88 and F90 is Lithgow arms who was acquired by Thales and this is their first modern major design activity as they have a history primarily of manufacturer according the spokesman – this year is Lithgow’s 100 year anniversary.

Another unusually feature was the thread along the length of the barrel of the original F88. Apparently it is for locating the bayonet lug along the length of the barrel depending on the length of the blade!

From a personal perspective of just picking it up, its handling, weight, functionality, I preferred it over the SA80 or Tavor. Shame there is not a range here to try them all!"
