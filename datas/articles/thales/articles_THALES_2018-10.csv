Thales Group reports boost in space revenue - SpaceNews,"Mon, 22 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS90aGFsZXMtZ3JvdXAtcmVwb3J0cy1ib29zdC1pbi1zcGFjZS1yZXZlbnVlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"WASHINGTON — Government demand for space systems drove a “recovery of space orders” for Thales Group this year, offsetting a slump in commercial telecom satellites, Chief Financial Officer Pascal Bouchiat said Oct. 18.

In a call with analysts, Bouchiat said it is too early to determine if demand for commercial telecom satellites will rebound. However, government demand — what in Europe is referred to as “institutional” demand — remains strong, he said.

“By the end of the year, we expect to book several other space contracts, in particular in the institutional market,” he said.

Thales Alenia Space, a joint venture with Italian aerospace company Leonardo in which Thales Group of Paris has a 67 percent stake, received a 324 million euro ($373 million) contract from the European Space Agency Oct. 18 to develop new ground segment and security systems for Galileo, Europe’s global satellite navigation system. That deal follows a 250 million euro Galileo contract GMV of Spain received last month for other parts of the Galileo ground segment focused on satellite controls.

Thales Group reported 3.04 billion euros in aerospace revenue for the nine months ending Sept. 30, roughly flat with the same period last year. Aerospace, which includes aeronautics, satellites and inflight entertainment and connectivity, comprises just under a third of Thales Group’s overall revenue.

Bouchiat did not break out what fraction of Thales Group’s aerospace revenue came specifically from space projects.

Thales Group highlighted an amendment to a 2010 contract with the European Space Agency and the European meteorological organization Eumetsat for six Meteosat Third Generation satellites, for which Thales Alenia Space is the prime contractor, as one of the company’s significant new orders during its most recent financial quarter. Those geostationary satellites start launching in 2021.

Thales Group also highlighted the success of Thales Alenia Space in winning one of the six large commercial geostationary satellite orders booked this year. Eutelsat Communications of Paris ordered a powerful high-throughput satellite called Konnect VHTS from the company in April. The 6.3 ton, 500 Gigabit-per-second satellite is planned for a 2021 in-service date, and is tied with Hughes Network Systems’ Jupiter-3 satellite (ordered from SSL) as the fifth highest-capacity satellite in the world that is currently under construction. Only the two, 1-terabit-per-second ViaSat-3 satellites and SES’s seven-satellite, 10-terabit O3b mPower system, both under construction by Boeing, are projected to be more powerful.

Bouchiat hesitated to give any predictions for telecom satellite demand in 2019, saying the market remains “soft,” but expressed optimism about the remaining two and a half months of 2018.

“It is true that we face a drop in the specific telco [satellite] business, but we believe that this will be manageable for Thales,” he said. “What we see in 2018, we believe in this business, is a significant increase in terms of ordering intake as compared to the low level that we got in 2017.”

Last year Thales Alenia Space booked one geostationary telecom satellite, Inmarsat’s Global Xpress-5, which is scheduled to launch in 2019 on an Ariane 5 rocket.

Thales Group has seen “a number of requests for proposal” circulating, Bouchiat said, but said it’s anyone’s guess how long those might take to convert to satellite orders.

Thales Alenia Space is part of a team with Maxar Technologies of the U.S. and Canada to build small telecom satellites for fleet operator Telesat’s low-Earth-orbit broadband constellation, competing against Airbus for a 2019 contract with an estimated worth of $3 billion. Thales Alenia Space is also the preferred manufacturer for startup LeoSat’s constellation of 78 satellites.

Speaking during World Satellite Business Week in Paris this September, Thales Alenia Space CEO Jean-Loïc Galle estimated satellite operators will solicit bids for 10 to 15 geostationary communications satellites next year, a range considerably lower than the 20 to 25 manufacturers had grown accustomed to over the past 15 years.

Bouchiat said Thales Group is closely watching the L3 Technologies and Harris Corp. merger announced Oct. 14 to see if it results in any opportunities for Thales Group. L3 and Harris are mainly focused on the U.S. defense market where Thales Group is a small player, he said, but the company would like to see “whether we could take advantage of some assets being put for sale,” if the merger results in any divestitures. Whether that will happen is too early to tell, he said."

With a total of 43 companies, 31 exhibitors and 3 business rooms, 4 scientific meetings and more than 120 meetings took place over the two days; La France au CERN was a complete success.

As such, Thales Microwave & Imaging Sub-Systems (MIS) had the opportunity to talk with scientists, students, engineers and suppliers from all over the world. The event was also, of course, a perfect way to interact with our historical and trusted partner in the field of radio frequency technologies, CERN.

CERN and Thales MIS: a historic partnership

CERN is one of the most prestigious scientific laboratories in the world and one of the first international organisations in Europe. Internationally recognised for its discoveries, it has become a well-known reference in the world of applied and fundamental research. Thales Microwave & Imaging Sub-Systems (MIS) has collaborated with CERN for many years across a number of domains relative to radio frequency sources. In the early 2000's, Thales MIS became the sole supplier of these sources used by CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Thales's high-power RF solutions – klystrons, tetrodes, IoT, multi-beam klystrons – remain today CERN's preferred solutions to supply the RF energy required for particle accelerators.

Thales and Leonardo demonstrate new aircraft protection system - Airforce Technology,"Wed, 10 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmZvcmNlLXRlY2hub2xvZ3kuY29tL25ld3MvdGhhbGVzLWxlb25hcmRvLWFpcmNyYWZ0LXByb3RlY3Rpb24tc3lzdGVtL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The new Leonardo-Thales missile warning and protection system. Credit: Thales Group.

Thales has collaborated with Leonardo to conduct live-fire exercises that demonstrated the advanced capabilities of their end-to-end missile warning and protection system built to safeguard aircraft.

Tested as part of the surface-to-air launch trial hosted by the Swedish Defence Materiel Administration, the integrated system demonstrated its ability to offer quick defence against multiple heat-seeking, man-portable, air-defence missiles.

While Thales and Leonardo invested in the integration of the aircraft protection system, the UK Ministry of Defence’s (MoD) Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) sponsored the two companies to participate in the trial.

The aircraft protection system comprised the Leonardo-developed Miysis Directed Infra-Red Counter-Measure system and the Elix-IR multi-function threat warning system built by Thales.

“Miysis used a DSTL-built jamming waveform to confuse the missile’s guidance system, forcing it to change direction away from the target.”

The two solutions were integrated using Leonardo’s Defensive Aids Suite (DAS) Controller, an advanced electronic warfare computer.

During the live-fire exercises, an infra-red (IR) missile was fired at a ground target, which was protected by the Leonardo-Thales system.

Following the firing, the Elix-IR system detected, tracked, and classified the missile as a threat and quickly provided an alert to the Miysis system.

The Miysis system was then able to track the threat and accurately direct a jamming laser on to the seeker of the incoming missile.

Miysis used a DSTL-built jamming waveform to confuse the missile’s guidance system, forcing it to change direction away from the target.

The latest generation solution is capable of protecting military and civil aircraft fleets ranging from small helicopters to large tactical transport platforms."

Thales Alenia Space’s advanced technology to respond to distress signals - GPS World magazine,"Mon, 08 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdwc3dvcmxkLmNvbS90aGFsZXMtYWxlbmlhLXNwYWNlcy1hZHZhbmNlZC10ZWNobm9sb2d5LXRvLXJlc3BvbmQtdG8tZGlzdHJlc3Mtc2lnbmFscy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The European Commission (EC) has awarded Thales Alenia Space a contract to develop and build an operational ground station on La Reunion Island to track GNSS satellites in medium Earth orbit. The ground station will be an operational part of the Galileo search-and-rescue (SAR) system.

The contract includes one Medium Orbit Local User Terminal (MEOLUT), engineering support and maintenance services for one year, and the hosting site on La Reunion Island.

Using Thales Alenia Space’s powerful and compact MEOLUT Next phased-array solution, the EC and European GNSS Agency (GSA) will improve their contribution to the Cospas-Sarsat system.

Thales Alenia Space is a joint venture between Thales (67 percent) and Leonardo (33 percent).

The ground station will receive and process 406-MHz distress beacon signals from the MEO satellites being tracked, and relay them to the SAR/Galileo network via the French Mission Control Center (FMCC) at the CNES facility in Toulouse. The contract also included the procurement of the best possible hosting site for this ground station.

This MEOLUT Next will enhance the EC’s contribution to the Cospas-Sarsat SAR system by extending its coverage in the South Indian ocean, contributing to worldwide coverage. It complements the three MEOLUTs that are already deployed around Europe — in Larnaca (Cyprus), Maspalomas (Grand Canaria) and Spitzbergen (Norway) — and under responsibility of the GSA.

The MEO system, which replaces the legacy LEO (low Earth orbit) system, is designed to offer a faster response and better location data in near real time for search-and-rescue authorities, using spacecraft and ground facilities to detect and locate signals from the 406-MHz distress beacons.

The MEOLUT Next will also support the second generation of Cospas-Sarsat beacons. The SAR/Galileo site on La Reunion will be fitted with reference and calibration beacons to monitor the performance of the extended SAR ground segment and precisely calibrate MEOLUT measurements.

“Using Thales Alenia Space’s powerful and compact MEOLUT Next phased array solution, the European Commission will benefit from the world’s first spaceborne search & rescue system of this type,” said Philippe Blatt, vice president, Navigation France at Thales Alenia Space. “We are very proud that our advanced technology is now recognized by many customers worldwide. The performance logged by our MEOLUT Next units in service far exceeds requirements, which not only benefits our customer countries, but also makes travel even safer. It’s worth remembering that the Cospas-Sarsat system, operational since 1988, saves some 1,500 lives a year.”

Thales Alenia Space designs, operates and delivers satellite-based systems for governments and institutions, helping them position and connect anyone or anything, everywhere. Since commissioning in 2016, MEOLUT Next has delivered unrivaled performance, detecting distress signals from more than 5,000 kilometers away. Several countries have already chosen or are interested in the technology, including Canada and Togo."

Venus, Mars, Mercury, Saturn, the Moon, asteroids and comets… Thales Alenia Space is a pivotal partner in Europe’s fantastic missions across the Solar System.



Thales Alenia Space is prime contractor for the current ExoMars program, a role it played on Herschel and Planck, the largest space observatories ever developed in Europe. The company also developed and integrated Corot, France’s own low-orbit “exoplanet” hunter, and will be heavily involved in a new program called PLATO, also tasked with tracking exoplanets (outside our Solar System), but from the Lagrange 2 point, thanks to advanced telescopes optical units built at Leonardo site in Campi Bisenzio in conjunction with leading universities and research organizations.

Thales Alenia Space also built 25 of the 64 huge parabolic antennas (Europe’s contribution) for the giant ALMA radiotelescope array deployed on the Atacama plateau in Chile. In addition, Thales Alenia Space played a lead role on the famous Rosetta-Philae comet mission [especially via assembly, integration and testing of the spacecraft], as well as on Cassini-Huygens. This latter mission [which was front-page news last year as Cassini made its “last dive”] allowed us to explore the atmosphere of Titan and then make a trouble-free – if short-lived! – landing on Saturn’s most mysterious moon. The Huygens space probe was built by Thales Alenia Space as prime contractor. Also on the agenda at Thales Alenia Space is the European program Euclid, which will help us better understand dark matter.

In the meantime, Europe is holding its breath in the run-up to the ExoMars 2020* mission. ESA’s rover on this mission should touch down on Mars in 2021. Fitted with a special drill built by Leonardo near Milan, the rover will take soil samples at a depth of 2 meters, in an attempt to discover traces of past life (bacteria), while the Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO), launched in 2016, continues its mission in orbit around Mars, “sniffing” the Martian atmosphere to discover traces of methane gas in particular.

Half of the ISS's pressurized volume built by Thales Alenia Space

Space exploration has always fascinated planet scientists, of course, along with the entire scientific community and space fans – whose ranks have grown since astronauts on the International Space Station (ISS) have been able to share their daily lives via social media, and especially Frenchman Thomas Pesquet, who has taken and share startling photos from the ISS. The ISS holds a special place in the hearts of Thales Alenia Space engineers based in Turin, Italy. Thales Alenia Space has in fact supplied fully half of the pressurized volume on the ISS, including Nodes 2 and 3, the Multipurpose Module, Multipurpose Logistics Modules (MPLM), Cupola, Columbus lab structure, ATV resupply vessels, and the structure for the Bishop commercial airlock from NanoRacks. Thales Alenia Space has built pressurized cargo modules for the ATV on behalf of Airbus Defence and Space, and for Cygnus on behalf of Northrop Grumman.

Looking beyond the ISS, Thales Alenia Space is gearing up for lunar missions, in particular with the LOP-G (Lunar Orbital Platform Gateway), and is carrying out design studies for NASA (as part of STEP 2) and ESA. Furthermore, following the success of the IXV atmospheric reentry demonstrator, Thales Alenia Space is developing Space Rider, Europe’s new-generation, low-orbit, reusable space transport system.

*ExoMars 2020 is a joint international program between the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Russian space agency Roscosmos. Thales Alenia Space is prime contractor for the overall program, while ADS is in charge of the rover and OHB of the CM (Carrier Module).

Thales receives contract to upgrade Galileo ground segment - GPS World magazine,"Fri, 19 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdwc3dvcmxkLmNvbS90aGFsZXMtcmVjZWl2ZXMtY29udHJhY3QtdG8tdXBncmFkZS1nYWxpbGVvLWdyb3VuZC1zZWdtZW50L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"News from the European Space Agency

The European Space Agency has awarded a new framework contract and two new work orders to Thales Alenia Space in France to upgrade the Galileo Mission Segment, the element of the worldwide Galileo ground segment dedicated to delivering navigation services. Included are upgrades to the Galileo Security Monitoring Centre (GSMC) near Paris, and implementation of a second GSMC in Spain, near Madrid.

ESA Director of Navigation Paul Verhoef signed the contract with Thales Alenia Space Senior Vice President of Sales Martin van Schaik on Oct. 17 at ESA’s ESTEC technical centre in Noordwijk, the Netherlands.

“Galileo has already proven to be the highest performing satellite navigation system in the world, even before the constellation is complete,” Verhoef said. “This achievement is the result of the close collaboration between the public sector — the European Commission, the European GNSS Agency and ESA — and our industrial partners throughout Europe.

“Today I am very happy to announce a continued relationship with Thales Alenia Space in one of the most complex parts of the system, namely the Ground Mission Segment, and thank them for their commitment to the programme.”

The constellation in orbit is only one element of the overall satellite navigation system – the tip of the Galileo iceberg. At the same time as the satellites were being built, tested and launched, a global ground segment was put in place.

Complex System

Establishing Galileo’s ground segment was among the most complex developments ever undertaken by ESA, having to fulfil strict levels of performance, security and safety.

In 2017, responsibility for operating the Galileo ground segment was passed to ESA’s partner organization, the European GNSS Agency (GSA). Nevertheless, ESA continues to be in charge of the maintenance, development and evolution of the ground segment, as well as the development of the space segment.

GSMC upgrade and construction. The first work order contracts Thales Alenia Space as prime contractor to undertake all necessary activities to upgrade the Galileo Mission Segment and the GSMC as part of Galileo’s exploitation phase.

This work includes upgrading Galileo’s system architecture to provide more accurate navigation products for broadcast by Galileo satellites, updating obsolescent elements in the current system, and improving operability linked to the provision of services and enhanced robustness.

This work order also includes the construction of additional uplink stations – tasked with uplinking the latest navigation messages to the Galileo constellation — at the existing Galileo ground station sites of Papeete in French Polynesia and Svalbard in Norway.

A new sensor station — providing a ground-based measurement of Galileo signal quality and precise satellite position — will also be installed at Wallis Island in the Pacific.

The work order will also augment the capabilities for implementation of the Public Regulated Service (PRS), the single most accurate and secure class of Galileo signals. Encrypted PRS signals will be made available only to authorised governmental users through approved national authorities.

Together, the two GSMCs will ensure the security of the overall Galileo system and manage PRS access and operations.

Security monitoring. The second work order contracts Thales Alenia Space as prime contractor to implement security monitoring functions for Galileo operational assets — including the control centres, service facilities and ground stations.

The integration, qualification, deployment and migration into operational services of the various upgraded segments will be undertaken over the next three years.

ESA has issued these work orders in its role of undertaking the design and development of future upgrades and the technical development of infrastructure as well as overseeing Galileo’s deployment, on behalf of the European Union, Galileo’s owner."

Thales Alenia Space contributes expertise to the study of an international Mars Sample Return mission

Cannes, October 9th, 2018 - Thales Alenia Space, a joint company between Thales (67%) and Leonardo (33%), announced today that it has signed two study contracts* with the European Space Agency (ESA) in the frame of a joint ESA-NASA study on an international Mars Sample Return mission. This latest mission to the Red Planet is designed to bring samples from the surface of Mars back to Earth. It represents a major new step forward in our exploration of the Solar System, its formation, and especially in our study of Mars and questions about its possible habitability.

Although not that far from Earth within our Solar System, Mars is very different from our own planet, especially with temperatures ranging from a high of 27°C to a low of -133°C. However, there are still several similarities, including a day that is comparable to our 24-hour day and the presence of seasons. Life on Mars cannot be definitely excluded, given that water has already flowed on its surface, and minerals that only form in the presence of water have been discovered.

The ExoMars probe built by Thales Alenia Space was launched in 2016 to detect any traces of life on Mars. The follow-up to this program is planned for 2020.

With the ExoMars program continuing, ESA is also working closely with American counterpart NASA on studying concepts for a new international mission, namely Mars Sample Return. Within this study, ESA is specifically in charge of the Earth Return Orbiter (MSR-ERO) and the Sample Fetch Rover (MSR-SFR).

Thales Alenia Space, as prime contractor for these aspects, will define the overall architecture and preliminary design for MSR-ERO and the MSR-SFR. It will also be in charge of characterizing the main equipment involved, to be subsequently supplied by a European industrial consortium.

With its major role on the ExoMars mission, which should enable Europe to land on Mars in 2020 to continue the search for traces of life, Thales Alenia Space is contributing its expertise and resources to support the upcoming discoveries that will allow us to better understand the Red Planet and prepare future human missions to Mars.

The Mars Sample Return mission is designed to send a spacecraft (MSR-ERO) into orbit around Mars, with a lander (MSR Sample Retrieval Lander) that will descend to the planet’s surface. The lander will carry the SFR that will collect the samples that have been cached by the NASA Mars 2020 rover from the Martian surface. The SFR will transfer these samples into a mini-rocket (Mars Ascent Vehicle, developed by NASA), which will launch them into Mars orbit. Once the samples have been located and captured by the ERO spacecraft, the samples will then be sealed in a biological containment system to prevent any contamination of Earth by this non-sterilized matter, and placed inside an Earth Entry Vehicle. ERO will then leave Martian orbit and head back to Earth. When it arrives back in Earth orbit, it will jettison the Earth entry vehicle with the samples, and they will be recovered back on terra firma and analyzed. Three launches will be needed for this mission: a first launch in 2020 for a rover to collect the samples of soil in different locations, a second launch for landing the SFR for delivery of the samples to the Mars Ascent Vehicle and a third one specific for the Orbiter.

* Phase A/B1 studies: These two studies include the conceptual analysis of equipment to guarantee mission feasibility, define a reference baseline for the rover and orbiter and its subsystems, and define the development phases.

Thales and Leonardo have announced that their end-to-end missile warning and protection system has been proven highly effective in live-fire scenarios, demonstrating the system’s ability to very quickly defend against incoming missiles. The integrated system was demonstrated as part of the SALT (Surface-to-Air Launch Trial) hosted by the Swedish Defence Materiel Administration (FMV) in Sweden. The UK Ministry of Defence (MoD)’s Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl) sponsored Leonardo and Thales to take part in the trial, while both companies invested in the integration of the system.

The latest-generation protective system consisted of a Leonardo Miysis Directed Infra-Red Counter-Measure (DIRCM) system and Thales Elix-IR multi-function Threat Warning System (TWS), integrated through Leonardo’s Defensive Aids Suite (DAS) Controller, an advanced electronic warfare computer. Together, the system offers end-to-end protection from heat-seeking man-portable air-defence missiles (known as MANPADS) which are being widely employed by armed forces and terrorist groups. For SALT, the integrated system was hosted aboard a Terma Universal DIRCM pod.

During the live-fire exercises, when an Infra-Red (IR) missile was fired at a ground target protected by the Leonardo-Thales system, the Elix-IR system detected, tracked, classified and declared the missile as a threat and rapidly passed an alert over to the Miysis system. Miysis then tracked the incoming threat and accurately directed a jamming laser onto the missile’s seeker. Miysis used a DSTL developed jamming waveform to confuse the missile’s guidance system, steering the missile away from the target. As well as proving the system’s basic capability, the Leonardo and Thales team demonstrated how they have optimised the threat-warning/threat-defeat chain to thwart incoming missiles as quickly as possible.

The integrated protection system is able to protect both military and civil platforms, ranging from small helicopters to large tactical transports/VIP platforms. While Thales and Leonardo will continue to market their systems individually, they will also work closely together to offer the integrated protection capability around the world when it is considered the best solution for customer requirements.

This successful trial against live MANPADS missiles follows earlier individually-effective demos of both Miysis and Elix-IR. At a previous SALT event the Miysis DIRCM successfully acquired and accurately tracked 100% of all live Man-Portable Air Defence Systems (MANPADS) missiles fired. Thales’s Elix-IR was successfully demonstrated in flight trials at the UK Pendine Ranges and on static trials, detecting all threats presented, including some that had challenged previous hostile fire indicator systems. Leonardo’s DAS controller technology is also well-proven and is already at the heart of defensive aids suites on-board multiple UK platforms including the British Army’s new Apache AH Mk2 helicopters."

Changing the way maritime autonomy is developed over the next decade

Digital transformation is one of the most important challenges facing forces today. Only through the experimentation of new and disruptive technologies will maritime forces be able to stay ahead and maintain operational advantage. Autonomy and its key enablers: big data, artificial intelligence, digital security and connectivity, will effectively enter operation for the first time in the mine warfare domain. Industry has a key role to play in the development of existing and future technological capabilities in this sector. Through its long-standing relationship with the Royal Navy and other maritime forces and the power of the Group, Thales is developing and offering the right skills, expertise and means to support this transformation.

A new centre of excellence in maritime autonomy

Committed to investing in digitally transformative maritime technologies, Thales in the UK has opened its Maritime Autonomy Centre at Turnchapel Wharf, Plymouth, in an official opening attended by Stuart Andrew MP, Minister for Defence Procurement, as well as local SMEs and academia. The centre will build on Thales’s leadership in autonomous systems and strengthen the position of UK industry in the market.

MMCM: Halcyon and Boat Zero meet in the English channel

Continuing the long history Turnchapel Wharf has with the Royal Navy, Royal Marines and industry, the Maritime Autonomy Centre will change the way autonomous capability is developed over the next decade by enabling rapid exploration and exploitation of emergent and disruptive technologies. The waterfront facility will specifically provide access to trials areas for the development of cutting-edge maritime autonomous systems, and position Thales and the Royal Navy at the centre of future maritime autonomous capability. The centre is also an integral part of a joint programme between the UK and French governments to develop the next generation of autonomous mine hunting systems – the Maritime Mine Countermeasures programme (MMCM).

Thales has invested £1 million in the facility, with a minimum five-year commitment to developing autonomous systems at the site in Plymouth, with 20 new high-skilled jobs created through its opening. Local SMEs, partners and suppliers will take part in initiatives at the facility, while local schools will run STEM activities onsite. The centre will also be available to academia, enabling institutions working in partnership with Thales UK – such as the University of Plymouth, University of Southampton and the National Oceanography Centre – to take advantage of Turnchapel Wharf’s world-class facilities.

Further to this, in the frame of the Lancaster House Agreement and MMCM programme, Thales is developing for OCCAR, and both the Royal Navy and French Marine Nationale, the very first unmanned mine warfare system for which autonomy is becoming operational. The centre will act as a key enabler for this, with the MMCM programme having now entered its integration and validation stage. Unmanned surface vehicles, loaded with world-first single pass multi-views sonar are already operating at sea.

Shaping the future of maritime autonomy

Thales is working hard to unlock the potential of maritime autonomy. Key benefits of the centre include:

This unique UK centre of excellence will enable highly trained personnel to be on hand to test and deliver autonomous trials.

Rapid access to sea will increase trial time by decreasing transit, and enable progressive trials to be planned around differing sea conditions, from shallow waters to deep open sea.

Working closely with the Maritime & Coastguard Agency will allow platforms and capabilities to be certified to best practice standards.

Running a programme of de-risking trials and secure by design systems to ensure that cyber vulnerability testing and assurance is a key part of the digital offering.

Paving the way for autonomy in other domains, including multi-drones and multi-domain.

Setting standards for unmanned maritime regulations for above and under water.

Developing further the other enablers to autonomy: big data, artificial intelligence, digital security and connectivity.

Victor Chavez and Stuart Andrew MP

Victor Chavez, Chief Executive of Thales in the UK, says: “The unique waterfront location at Turnchapel Wharf will provide access to shallow and deep water trials areas for the development of cutting edge maritime solutions. Our ambition is to help anchor a vibrant ecosystem in Plymouth for the development of advanced autonomous systems and we are already working with a range of academic and industry partners to make this a reality.”

Stuart Andrew, Minister for Defence Procurement, says: “Our Armed Forces must remain a step ahead of our adversaries, something we can only do by collaborating with our leading British defence industry. Thales’s new Maritime Autonomy Centre is another great example of the work being done by our suppliers to ensure our military remains equipped with state-of-the-art capabilities. This centre of excellence will enable industry and academia to experiment and innovate together to help counter emerging sea-based threats and ensure we remain one of the world’s leading militaries.”

Councillor Tudor Evans, Leader of Plymouth City Council, said: “This world-class facility is adding enormously to Plymouth’s fantastic marine community, and we are delighted that it brings with it high skilled jobs and investment. Plymouth is well on its way to becoming one of Europe’s most vibrant waterfront cities, and having facilities like this is essential to our growth and progress, putting the city at the forefront of maritime technology development.”"

Signed a contract for the detection and observation of exoplanets

October 4th, 2018 – Thales Alenia Space, the joint company between Thales (67%) and Leonardo (33%), announced today that it has signed a contract with OHB System AG for the new ESA program PLATO (PLAnetary Transits and Oscillations of stars) . OHB System AG will be the prime contractor with Thales Alenia Space as a partner. PLATO will be the third medium-class (M3) science mission in ESA’s Cosmic Vision Program, following Solar Orbiter (M1) and Euclid (M2), and preceding Ariel (M4). The satellite will be launched in 2026 for an initial mission length of 4.5 years.

The aim of PLATO is to find and study extrasolar planetary systems, especially terrestrial type planets in the habitable zone (compatible with water in the liquid state) around stars similar to our Sun. Unlike the previous missions, CoRot and Kepler, it will offer the unique ability to carry out stable, wide-field observations of bright stars over a very long period (two to four years), enabling us to detect and characterize planets orbiting slowly around their sun, such as the Earth. It will be placed into orbit around the L2 Lagrangian point, and will carry a scientific payload comprising 26 cameras and the associated electronics.

Thales Alenia Space (France and UK) will be in charge of avionics and integration for the service module (SVM). The AOCS (Attitude and Orbit Control System) software proposed for PLATO draws on the expertise and processes developed over the last 20 years and more. Thales Alenia Space offers full expertise in satellite avionics development and testing, from initial equipment specifications to test benches and AIT (assembly, integration, testing). The avionics test bench will be integrated and operated at Thales Alenia Space’s Cannes facility, with teams from Thales Alenia Space in UK also heavily involved. The PLATO Telescopes Optical Units (TOU), funded by Italian Space Agency (ASI), were designed by INAF ((Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica) and will be built at Leonardo site in Campi Bisenzio in collaboration with the universities of Berna, Thales Alenia Space and Medialario to be delivered for the global integration of the cameras at the OHB Space Center “Optics & Science” in Oberpfaffenhofen near Munich in a special ISO Class 5 clean room.

“We are very proud to cooperate with OHB System AG in developing and assembling this unique science satellite for ESA” - said Donato Amoroso, SE Vice-President Observation, Exploration, Navigation at Thales Alenia Space. “The PLATO program will draw on the full range of our avionics skills, already deployed across our telecommunications and Earth observation satellite product lines, as well as knowledge acquired through our work on other L2 missions, namely Herschel-Planck and Euclid. The integration operations assigned to Thales Alenia Space in the United Kingdom reflect our company’s strategy of expanding our European footprint.”

Based on innovative, ultralight, flexible, high-efficiency photovoltaic modules

Cannes, October 16, 2018 – Thales Alenia Space, a joint company between Thales (67%) and Leonardo (33%), announced today the successful completion of static mechanical validation tests of the first full-scale photovoltaic modules specially designed for its Stratobus TM autonomous stratospheric airship.

Stratobus TM will operate at an altitude of 20 kilometers (above regular air traffic) and will perform a wide range of missions, including observation, surveillance and telecommunications, with a service life of five years. To ensure continuity of service, Stratobus TM must remain stationary in its position and withstand winds of up to 90 km/h. To achieve this, it will have 1,000 square meters of photovoltaic cells, which will cover a quarter of the surface area of its envelope and provide the power needed for its four electric motors, energy storage system and mission payload.

Ultralight PV modules

Thales Alenia Space, in collaboration with CEA LITEN working on its INES campus, has developed an innovative photovoltaic technology: flexible, low-cost, lightweight modules weighing less than 800 g/m2 and offering a high power output of more than 200 W/m² and a large surface area of over 4 m².

© Thales Alenia Space

Each module comprises an assembly of PV cells with a high efficiency rating of over 24%. Recent tests have demonstrated the high stability of the encapsulation materials in the presence of UV radiation and ozone, combined with low relative power loss after thermal cycling. The modules are designed to withstand the specific thermal and mechanical stresses of the operating environment, including the expansion and contraction of the envelope, while meeting the long service life requirement for this type of technology.

This innovative PV module technology will be incorporated into the full-scale model of Stratobus TM for its first flight in 2022.

The BepiColombo mission to explore Mercury was launched by Arianespace this evening from the Guiana Space Center in Kourou, French Guiana (South America). But scientists will have to be patient to discover the mysteries of the closest planet to the Sun. As they say, “all good things come to those who wait...” This time it will take seven years, on an incredible journey through the Solar System, before Mercury is in our crosshairs. No point getting hot under the collar either, since Mercury, as you probably know, is very “hot stuff” indeed. You’ll just have to cool your heels until BepiColombo reaches what Jacques Brel called the “unreachable star” in his famous song, “The Impossible Dream” (La Quête/”The Quest” in the original French).

Yes, it’s hot on Mercury… a lot hotter than you ever imaged. Not to mention that the solar radiation around Mercury is ten times more intense than around the Earth. If Icarus lost his wings because he flew too close to the Sun on Earth, just imagine his fate on Mercury! Our latest planetary probe will have to stand up to extreme temperatures as it approaches Mercury, from 300 to 400°C, while its instruments are designed to operate at 0° to 40°C. This meant we had to develop special materials and devices for everything that would be exposed to these temperatures.

A major European first

BepiColombo is the first European mission to explore Mercury. It follows Mariner 10 in the 1970s and Messenger from 2010-2015, two missions that were able to gather information on this hidden and mysterious planet. But Mercury is still largely unknown, because it’s so hard to get a good look. Being so close to the Sun, it’s also a prime target for scientific study, to help us better understand the origins of the Solar System.

The BepiColombo mission

BepiColombo is a joint program by the European and Japanese space agencies, ESA and JAXA, respectively. It comprises four different modules, including three built in Europe:

• MPO (Mercury Planetary Orbiter), with 11 instruments to study and map the planet’s surface and atmosphere.

• A thermal shield, to protect the probe from extreme temperatures as it approaches Mercury.

• MTM (Mercury Transfer Module), which provides propulsion and electrical power for the trip from the Earth to Mercury.

• MMO (Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiter), supplied by Japan, is equipped with five instruments to study Mercury’s magnetic field.

Thales Alenia Space’s contribution to Bepi

This European mission is led by Airbus Defence & Space as prime contractor, working on behalf of ESA. Thales Alenia Space is part of the industry core team, coordinating 35 different European companies. In particular, Thales Alenia Space is in charge of telecommunications, thermal control and the electrical distribution system, as well as integration and testing of the overall spacecraft, plus support services during the launch campaign. The company is also supplying X and Ka-band transponders, onboard computers, mass memory and the 1.1 meter high-gain antenna used for communications between spacecraft and ground, along with the scientific experiment for the radio mission. This antenna is derived from the model developed for the successful Cassini-Huygens mission. [Full Press Release here]

Venus, Mars, Mercury, Titan, the Moon, asteroids, comets, etc.

Thales Alenia Space is a pivotal partner in Europe’s fantastic missions across the Solar System.

Thales Alenia Space is prime contractor for the current ExoMars program, a role it played on Herschel and Planck, the largest space observatories ever developed in Europe. The company also developed and integrated Corot, France’s own low-orbit “exoplanet” hunter, and will be heavily involved in a new program called Plato, also tasked with tracking exoplanets (outside our Solar System), but from the Lagrange 2 point, thanks to advanced optics on the telescope built by Leonardo at its Campi Bisenzio facility, in conjunction with leading universities and research organizations.

Thales Alenia Space also built 25 of the 64 huge parabolic antennas (Europe’s contribution) for the giant ALMA radiotelescope array deployed on the Atacama plateau in Chile. In addition, Thales Alenia Space played a lead role on the famous Rosetta-Philae comet mission [especially via assembly, integration and testing of the spacecraft], as well as on Cassini-Huygens. This latter mission [which was front-page news last year as Cassini made its “last dive”] allowed us to explore the atmosphere of Titan and then make a trouble-free – if short-lived! – landing on Saturn’s most mysterious moon. The Huygens space probe was built by Thales Alenia Space as prime contractor. Also on the agenda at Thales Alenia Space is the European program Euclid, which will help us better understand dark matter.

In the meantime, Europe is holding its breath in the run-up to the ExoMars 2020* mission. ESA’s rover on this mission should touch down on Mars in 2021. Fitted with a special drill built by Leonardo near Milan, the rover will take soil samples at a depth of 2 meters, in an attempt to discover traces of past life (bacteria), while the Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO), launched in 2016, continues its mission in orbit around Mars, “sniffing” the Martian atmosphere to discover traces of methane gas in particular.

Half of the ISS’s pressurized volume built by Thales Alenia Space

Space exploration has always fascinated planet scientists, of course, along with the entire scientific community and space fans – whose ranks have grown since astronauts on the International Space Station (ISS) have been able to share their daily lives via social media, especially Frenchman Thomas Pesquet. The ISS holds a special place in the hearts of Thales Alenia Space engineers based in Turin, Italy. Thales Alenia Space has in fact supplied fully half of the pressurized volume on the ISS, including Nodes 2 and 3, the Multipurpose Module, Multipurpose Logistics Modules (MPLM), Cupola, Columbus lab structure or the structure for the Bishop commercial airlock from NanoRacks. Thales Alenia Space also built Integrated Cargo Carriers (ICC) for the ATV on behalf of Airbus Defence & Space, and Pressurized Cargo Modules (PCM) for Cygnus on behalf of Northrop Grumman. The next Cygnus resupply vessel will lift off for the ISS in mid-November.

Looking beyond the ISS, Thales Alenia Space is gearing up for lunar missions, in particular with the LOP-G (Lunar Orbital Platform Gateway), and is carrying out design studies for NASA (as part of STEP 2) and ESA.

Following the success of the IXV atmospheric reentry demonstrator, Thales Alenia Space is developing Space Rider, Europe’s new-generation, low-orbit, reusable space transport system.

Space Servicers: energizing the space market

“Once a satellite is launched, you can’t service it in orbit.” This was always a truism among satellite makers, but it may no longer be true in the near future. The reason is a new type of space vehicle, called the “Space Servicer”! As its name indicates, this type of spacecraft is designed for in-orbit servicing. Highly versatile, it can be used for a wide variety of orbital tasks, including deorbiting space debris, robotic manipulation, extending a satellite’s service life, fueling, inspection, etc. With these new space machines, we are changing the space paradigm, from the current static situation to a dynamic environment. Thales Alenia Space is spearheading the development of Space Servicers, which will change our approach to space access. And if we do manage to build lunar bases in the future, Space Servicers will undoubtedly play a key role in the transport and assembly of the different components.

*ExoMars 2020 is a joint international program between the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Russian space agency Roscosmos. Thales Alenia Space is prime contractor for the overall program, while ADS is in charge of the rover and OHB of the CM (Carrier Module).

Sono-Flash: Thales New Dual Mode Passive Active Sonobuoy - Navy Recognition,"Mon, 01 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFodHRwczovL25hdnlyZWNvZ25pdGlvbi5jb20vaW5kZXgucGhwL25hdmFsLW5ld3MvbmF2YWwtZXhoaWJpdGlvbnMvMjAxOC9ldXJvbmF2YWwtMjAxOC82NTMyLXNvbm8tZmxhc2gtdGhhbGVzLW5ldy1kdWFsLW1vZGUtcGFzc2l2ZS1hY3RpdmUtc29ub2J1b3kuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Xavier Vavasseur - Editor in Chief

Thales is working on a new sonobuoy system, the Sono-Flash, that will combine both active and passive modes in a single buoy. This was unveiled to us during a trip to the Thales site of Brest (Brittany, Western France) ahead of the Euronaval show. Sonobuoys are typically deployed by maritime patrol aircraft (MPA) or maritime helicopters for anti-submarine warfare.

Unfortunately, Thales would not let us take pictures of their Sono-Flash mock-up (it won't be on display at Euronaval 2018 either) and will not share images of the buoy. Here is our best attempt at an ""artist rendering"" of the Sono-Flash based on what was shown to us at the Thales Brest site.

Thales started working (again) on Sonobuoys at the request of the French Navy (Marine Nationale) and the French Defense Procurement Agency (DGA): France has a strategic need to recover industrial and technological sovereignty in the field of sonobuoys. Thales explained that since the 1990ies the Sonobuoys market relies on two players: Ultra Electronics and Spartan. Nowadays, the French Navy considers that it is no longer sustainable to depend on these companies for its own needs. United States' export restriction is another factor which motivated the development of a new, ITAR-free, system. The final reason is the increase in Russian submarine incursions in French waters. According to Thales, there is a pressing strategic need today for France to recover sovereignty in the field of acoustics systems for anti-submarine warfare (ASW).

Thales' Sono-Flash is based on Thales Australia's Barra Sonobuoy System. It is a standardized Type A sonobuoy (roughly 1 meter long and 10 centimeters in diameter). The Sono-Flash is being developed with the support of the French Navy and DGA. It will be available for export.

Range of sonobuoys currently used by the French Navy (on display at Euronaval 2016).



Thales is looking to achieve technological and tactical breakthroughs with this new system: The unique feature of the Sono-Flash is that Thales managed to combined both active and passive capabilities. So far, sonobouys were always mission-specific and limited to one role (active also known as DICASS and passive, known as DIFAR). The Sono-Flash is fitted with a long reception array similar to those found on passive-only sonobuyos, especially the one found on the original Barra sonobuoy: The design of the reception array is based on the Barra's array. Sonobuoys with a single hydrophone have been in use since the end of the Second World War - but with limited effectiveness. Australian defence researchers Alan Butement and Henry d'Assumpcao in 1964 proposed a much more sophisticated sonobuoy consisting of many hydrophones arranged in a horizontal plane. This was given the name BARRA (a word in one of the indigenous Australian languages meaning “listening”). The Sono-Flash however features a high transmission power as well for the active part, meaning that in active mode, it can receive the echoes from submarines (no matter how silent they might be).

Another advantage of using a unique, dual mode, sonobuoy is the cost. According to Thales, navies switching to the Sono-Flash will be able to reduce their inventory of active and passive sonobouys by a sensible margin.

Sono-Flash users will be able to conduct multistatic ASW, meaning several transmitters and receivers in different locations (and usually deployed from different platforms) to dramatically increase the coverage area that the friendly force is able to search in: The new sonobuoy frequencies were specificaly designed to be compatible with the Flash dipping sonar. It offer several tactical advantages. For exmaple, the Flash sonar can be used for transmission and the Sono-flash for reception, meaning the tracked submarine will know the position of the dipping sonar but will not know the position of the sonobuoy. Several Sono-Flash can even work with each other to ping in specific patterns (or randomly depending on the mission).

Digital acoustic data is sent from the buoy to the aircraft via VHF radio link for processing. The UHF radio downlink is used to command the Sono-Flash such as to change its depth or reset the transmission codes or retask it from passive to active modes. The endurance of the buoy is eight hours (after which it sinks).

We were told that the Sono-Flash development was very much linked to the Atlantique 2 (ATL2) upgrade programme of the French Navy. Sono-Flash in ""Type A"" form factor will also be compatible with the VSR700, the future VTOL UAV of the French Navy.

During our visit we were shown a full size mock-up of a deployed Sono-Flash. Thales also has a demonstrator to run some tests (both hardware and software, first in a pool in Brest, then in a lake and finally at sea). Thales started technological operational studies five years ago. The first phase of the detailed design has just been completed following some flight tests (from October 2017 to June 2018) involving ATL2 MPA and NH90 NFH. The next step will be the test of a prototype. Thales expects to be ready for mass production within two to three years.

Thales' new SonoFlash sonobuoy showcased on French Defense Ministry booth at Euronaval 2018



Anti-submarine warfare capabilities are increasingly crucial for naval forces throughout the world. SonoFlash is a strategic asset that complements ASW systems currently in service and provides an ideal response to the sovereignty requirements of countries today.



SonoFlash is an active/passive sonobuoy for monostatic and multistatic operations. It can be deployed and operated by any type of aircraft or surface vessel, including unmanned platforms. SonoFlash is interoperable with the Flash dipping sonar and the Captas family of towed-array sonars.

Thales' Sono-Flash is based on Thales Australia's Barra Sonobuoy System. It is a standardized Type A sonobuoy (roughly 1 meter long and 10 centimeters in diameter). The Sono-Flash is being developed with the support of the French Navy and DGA. It will be available for export.

Thales is looking to achieve technological and tactical breakthroughs with this new system: The unique feature of the Sono-Flash is that Thales managed to combined both active and passive capabilities. So far, sonobouys were always mission-specific and limited to one role (active also known as DICASS and passive, known as DIFAR). The Sono-Flash is fitted with a long reception array similar to those found on passive-only sonobuyos, especially the one found on the original Barra sonobuoy: The design of the reception array is based on the Barra's array. Sonobuoys with a single hydrophone have been in use since the end of the Second World War - but with limited effectiveness.

This passive naval electronic warfare solution with built-in artificial intelligence and cybersecurity is designed to keep vessels safe from 21st century threats and has already been selected for the French Navy’s FTI medium-size frigates programme.

To protect vessels and crews and assert national sovereignty, navies need to detect threats earlier so they can respond faster, identifying threats in real time while constantly gathering intelligence and maintaining a clear tactical picture of the electromagnetic environment.

ALTESSE-H, the new naval communications electronic warfare solution from Thales, identifies up to 2,000 targets in real time. With its TRC 6460 ultra-high-frequency interceptor and direction finder, advanced antenna system and operating software derived from the Keyobs suite, ALTESSE-H delivers real operational benefits, including faster response times and the ability to capture shorter signals at longer range and gather intelligence data at the same time."
Thales Launches 4D AESA Radar for Naval Platforms - Defense World,"Tue, 23 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2V3b3JsZC5uZXQvMjAxOC8xMC8yMy90aGFsZXMtbGF1bmNoZXMtNGQtYWVzYS1yYWRhci1mb3ItbmF2YWwtcGxhdGZvcm1zLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales today announced a 4D AESA (Active Electronically Scanned Array) air and surface surveillance radar, the NS50 for naval platforms.

Get alerts:

With the NS50, Thales aims to bring the benefits of 4D AESA radar to naval vessels where 2D radars are the standard, a Thales release said.

The 4D AESA radar not only provides bearing, range and elevation (3D), but also in-depth analysis of the target’s Doppler and other characteristics during that extended time-on-target (the 4th dimension) in every single scan.

The result is a vastly superior air and surface detection, tracking & classification performance when compared to 3D and 2D radars.

The NS50 radar is a 4D AESA dual-axis multi-beam radar conceived with a range up to 180 kilometers on a price point to meet the budget consideration of all naval services. Scalable and easily upgradable, software-defined (future-proof) 4D AESA compact radar technology is deployable across all ship classes, combining surveillance and weapon support into one.

This X-band radar can integrate with the latest ship defence weapons, such as new gun-ammunition and active short-to-medium range missiles. The system’s weapon support functionality will provide military-grade 4D track data, either to the ship’s gun systems or active missile systems for “First Time Right” anti-surface or anti-air engagements."

Keeping the UK Armed Forces operational wherever and whenever required - Thales,"Thu, 25 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi91bml0ZWQta2luZ2RvbS9uZXdzL2tlZXBpbmctdWstYXJtZWQtZm9yY2VzLW9wZXJhdGlvbmFsLXdoZXJldmVyLWFuZC13aGVuZXZlci1yZXF1aXJlZNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"We can all be rightly proud of our armed forces. Efficient, versatile and responsive, we rely on them to protect our national interests, day in, day out. Thales helps the UK Armed Forces with its very short range air defence capability worldwide during peacetime and whilst on operations.

The story starts back in 2008, when the UK Ministry of Defence set up the Air Defence Availability ProjecT (ADAPT). Thales’s weapon systems operation in Belfast was awarded the STARStreak high velocity missiles (HVM) ADAPT contract, which gave Thales the responsibility of providing the Royal Regiment of Artillery and the Royal Marines with their air defence weapon systems.

The Regiment plays a vital role in the Army, providing close air defence protection for Armoured Infantry Brigades, as well as maintaining a shoulder-launched and lightweight multiple launcher capability to 16 Air Assault Brigade, which is capable of being deployed worldwide at extremely short notice. ADAPT provides them with the availability and readiness for all aspects of the capability, including the vehicle and missile systems. The army will then take delivery of the equipment and take it on exercise. Once the exercise is over, the equipment is returned to Thales for servicing and restoring to readiness.

The missile provided for these challenging operations is the STARStreak HVM. Operating at a speed in excess of Mach 3, it is designed to defeat fast-moving threats and those with short unmasking times. The three-dart ‘hittile’ configuration maximises lethality and the highly-accurate laser beam riding guidance enables engagement of low-signature targets and is immune to all known countermeasures.

As the world is forever changing and innovations continue, new asymmetric threats evolve and Thales is continually working alongside the customer and user to meet their changing needs and ensure our troops are equipped with a modernised capability.

Providing modernised potent defence ability Stuart Andrew MP, Minister for Defence Procurement, visited Thales’s air operations and weapon systems facility in Belfast along with a number of of defence suppliers, announcing the Ministry of Defence has awarded a £93 million pound contract to Thales to modernise and boost the critical air defence capability of the British Army and Royal Marines.

The Future Air Defence Availability ProjecT (F-ADAPT) will provide the customer with a modernised and fully supported availability solution with enhanced capabilities. The upgrades include thermal imaging, ensuring the HVM system can be used 24 hours a day for ‘friend or foe’ identification, maximising intelligence on potential threats and targets.

With the ever evolving threats come new innovations and weapon systems – capabilities are being continually developed. The lightweight multirole missile (LMM) is Thales’s latest missile with a true multirole capability. LMM will now come into service with the Royal Artillery in 2019 and is designed to provide rapid reaction to a wide range of evolving asymmetric threats, both in the air and on the surface.

The weapon systems available to front line soldiers are now capable of defeating the complete target set from enemy drones to helicopters and armoured vehicles. They also have increased flexibility as both STARStreak HVM and LMM systems are designed to be fired from the in service tactical platforms such as the Stormer fighting vehicle, lightweight multiple launcher and can also be shoulder launched.

Stuart Andrew MP says:

In these uncertain times, it is crucial that we protect ourselves from the rapidly evolving spectrum of global threats. These cutting-edge missile systems will fortify our military advantage over adversaries and help protect UK Armed Forces across the world and into the next decade.

Richard Smart, DE&S Director Weapons, says:

“F-ADAPT is crucial in safeguarding our very short range air defence capability and the team at DE&S has worked collaboratively with industry to deliver the enhancements needed to ensure this project continues to support our troops for years to come.”

Thales will continue to provide its customers with enhanced capabilities to ensure they are efficient, versatile and responsive, wherever and whenever required."
Thales applies predictive maintenance to military electronics | Le Journal de l'Aviation - Le Journal de l'Aviation,"Thu, 18 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmpvdXJuYWwtYXZpYXRpb24uY29tL2VuL25ld3MvNDEyNjctdGhhbGVzLWFwcGxpZXMtcHJlZGljdGl2ZS1tYWludGVuYW5jZS10by1taWxpdGFyeS1lbGVjdHJvbmljc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales applies predictive maintenance to military electronics Léo Barnier 18 OCT 2018 | 1215 words © Thales / E. Raz / Regards



A first model was presented at the ADS Show, which was held at BA 106 in Bordeaux-Mérignac on 26th and 27th September to illustrate the progress in the work carried out by Thales's ""data scientists"" and technical experts. Since the start of the year, this model has been used to supervise the predictions made by the platform to check whether they came to fruition or not, and so test the performance of the algorithms, which are still at the experimental stage. The equipment provider is currently claiming an 80% success rate for the predictions.



The Hums contribution



The ambition of course is to achieve 100 %. While the objective is not possible in itself, the Thales teams should be getting very close to it thanks to the use of health and usage monitoring sensors (Hums) integrated into the electronic components, like what is already being done with mechanical equipment, but with a much higher level of accuracy. Although the sensors are already in place the data generated is not yet recorded and stored.



This will be the aim over the coming months for Thales, which is currently carrying out an experiment with the DGA with three cards on the French air force Rafale's RBE2 AESA radars. These collect data such as pressure, temperature, vibration and other information on the active antenna. Around 0.1 GB of information is collected with each flight. This Hums data is added to the data which is already being exploited.



For the moment, Thales uses around sixty parameters from three types of data. First of all, the data provided by the air force from the Harpagon system, which enables Rafale flight parameters to be collected and analysed after a mission and integrated equipment maintenance information stored by the plane.



Secondly, the ATAMS (Aircraft technical and airworthiness management system) data from the air force's technical and logistical information system, which logs the events which occur (as does Harpagon) but also all of the resulting maintenance actions.



Third of all, the data collected internally from Thales's test and production benches. While this does not fully show the reality of the operations, this last category enables a considerable volume of data to be available - around 12 000 GB - in comparison to the other two categories, which account for 1 GB and 1.4 GB respectively collected during 145 000 flights.

Probabilities and alert thresholds



For now, the algorithms are configured to establish the probability of failures every five flights for each item of equipment monitored within the fleet. The ultimate objective is to move towards longer intervals, every 15 or 20 flights of even every six months. The operator may then define an alert threshold which is more or less strict to remove an item of equipment. The model enables the operator to choose between 50%, 70% and 90% probability of a failure during the next five flights.



The first choice, 50%, guarantees a high level of reliability and above all enables operational availability to be preserved with the equipment which is the most able to carry out a mission. However, it does run the risk of excessive maintenance, compromising the optimum use of the potential of certain components, and so additional costs.



Conversely the third choice, 90%, will enable the component's maximum potential to be achieved and optimise the logistical chain with minimum stock levels and a just in time system. The other side of the coin is an increased risk of failure which may potentially compromise a mission. The choice of threshold will therefore depend on the context in which the aircraft are used, between OPEX or a training mission in mainland France, for example.



The objectives for using predictive maintenance in electronics are therefore the same as for mechanical equipment. The aim is to improve aircraft operational availability, increase mission success and optimise the supply chain.



Increasing accuracy and maturity



The increased accuracy in predictions - in particular with Hums, but also other elements such as maintenance reports via automatic natural language processing (NLP) - is vital to be able to exploit the platform's capacities to the maximum and so provide operational benefits. The research teams are therefore working on a certain number of performance indicators (KPI) to improve their algorithms to be able to predict all removals with the maximum level of accuracy. In-house, Thales feels that predicting 90% of removals with 90% accuracy would already be a very good performance.



The system should start to be gradually rolled out from Thales over the course of the next year. If the experiment with the DGA is a success, the industrial company will try to persuade its contacts to extend it to the whole Rafale fleet to raise the system's maturity level (which requires a certain volume of data and so equipment covered), but also to integrate it with a minimum amount of constraints for military mechanics (see box). A first operational version could then be proposed to the air force at the end of 2019.



But the platform's development shouldn't stop there. Thales wants to achieve a high enough level of accuracy for the system to be able to overcome alert thresholds and establish a ""binary"" response according to the types of mission (with predefined profiles): the equipment is fit for this mission or not. By 2020, the platform could event integrate logistics chain constraints and human and material resource availabilities into its removal proposals.

Flying hour support offer



In commercial terms, Thales's aim is to manage to include this service in support contracts. The electronics specialised would then be able to offer a customer - France only first of all, even if the door is not closed to export customers - a fixed-rate commitment to the usage potential of their equipment, or even cover any additional cost in the event of an early breakdown.



In addition to the RBE2 AESA, where work is more advanced at the moment, Thales is working on two other items of Rafale equipment, the heads-up display (HUD) and the BACHD, the electronic warfare equipment integrated into the Spectra suite. And while the Dassault Aviation combat plane is currently at the centre of the experiment, the equipment provider is planning to extend its predictive maintenance platform to other aircraft such as the Tigre and the ATL2 or even to ships, in particular multi-mission frigates (FREMM). Thales has been setting itself a double challenge for the last two years in favour of the French air force: to implement predictive maintenance in the military sector - which is much less advanced than the civilian sector in this area - and apply it to electronic equipment - an area which is said to be incompatible with this type of solution. While the system still needs several months to mature, with the introduction of new parameters to improve its reliability in particular, the first results are encouraging. The French electronics specialist is not slow to point out that it is a trail-blazer.A first model was presented at the ADS Show, which was held at BA 106 in Bordeaux-Mérignac on 26th and 27th September to illustrate the progress in the work carried out by Thales's ""data scientists"" and technical experts.

As well as the supply of the identification systems, the contract includes the adjustment of the current LW08 radar systems and the delivery of a user interface for stand-alone control.

Identifying air targets after they have been detected is crucial to the prevention of friendly fire in the theatre of operations. Naval forces today need to be able to rely on new technology to make the right decisions when it matters most. Thales helps them to conduct their missions more safely at every decisive moment. Building on its air surveillance expertise and an in-depth knowledge of operational contexts, Thales has developed high value added end-to-end IFF solutions that comply with NATO standards and meet the requirements of the Dutch defence ministry.

The Netherlands sold two of its eight M-class frigates to Belgium and another two to Portugal. As a result, Belgian and Portuguese requirements were taken into consideration as well as the requirements of the Royal Netherlands Navy. The contract includes an option for three more New Generation Identification Systems (NGIS) for the Vasco Da Gama frigates of the Portuguese Navy.

This contract marks an important milestone in the introduction of new NATO agreements and standards. Mode 5 is the latest military standard and will progressively replace all other modes for NATO members. Mode 5 will be mandatory on NATO-led coalition operations from 2020. The upgrade will also include the civil Mode S to generate a comprehensive Recognised Air and Surface Picture (RASP).

“We leverage the latest technologies to provide naval forces around the world with the means to better identify air targets and enhance tactical preparedness so they can make the right decisions at the right time. The New Generation Identification Systems will include an advanced user interface to support stand-alone control.” Gerben Edelijn, CEO, Thales in the Netherlands."

The project involves the construction of four driverless metro lines around Paris (lines 15, 16, 17 and 18) as well as an extension and upgrade of Line 14 to the north and south of Paris to Orly airport, connecting with the existing metro network.

The 76km Line 15 will have 36 new stations and will enable passengers to reach Saint-Denis to the north and Villejuif to the south by passing through Nanterre/La Défense to the west or Rosny-Bois-Perrier and Champigny to the east. The 50km lines 16 and 17 will have 14 new stations and will enable passengers from Saint-Denis/Pleyel to travel east to Noisy-Champs or and north to Roissy˗Charles de Gaulle airport.

Twelve construction and commissioning phases are planned throughout the contract, with the first due to be completed in 2024, and the others by 2030."
EURONAVAL 2018: Thales launches the NS50 4D AESA radar - Navy Recognition,"Tue, 23 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFodHRwczovL25hdnlyZWNvZ25pdGlvbi5jb20vaW5kZXgucGhwL25hdmFsLW5ld3MvbmF2YWwtZXhoaWJpdGlvbnMvMjAxOC9ldXJvbmF2YWwtMjAxOC82NjEwLWV1cm9uYXZhbC0yMDE4LXRoYWxlcy1sYXVuY2hlcy10aGUtbnM1MC00ZC1hZXNhLXJhZGFyLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Today, during blue and brown water deployments, Navies must be able to rely on digital technologies to guarantee the full performance of sensors on board real time and at all times. To provide naval forces with the high solution they need, Thales is launching a 4D AESA (Active Electronically canned Array) air and surface surveillance radar, the NS50.

Thales NS50 AESA radar scale model on Thales stand at Euronaval 2018. NS50 works in the X-band and replaces the Variant and MW08 radars. Thales is proposing the NS50 for the Belgian and Dutch Navy future MCM vessels. Navy Recognition picture.

Threats for naval vessels are becoming increasingly more complex thus driving requirements for an ever broadening spectrum of missions and tasks. With NS50, Thales aims to bring the benefits of a 4D AESA radar to naval vessels where 2D radars are the standard. Thanks to the innovative architecture the new Thales AESA radar family brings to bear 4D, not only providing bearing, range and elevation (3D), but also providing in-depth analysis of the target’s Doppler and other characteristics during that extended time-on-target (the 4th dimension), every single scan. The result: vastly superior air and surface detection, tracking & classification performance when compared to 3D (and certainly 2D) radars.

The NS50 radar is a 4D AESA dual-axis multi-beam radar conceived with a range up to 180 kilometers on a price point to meet the budget consideration of all naval services. Scalable and easily upgradable, software-defined (future-proof) 4D AESA compact radar technology is deployable across all ship classes, combining surveillance and weapon support into one. This X-band radar can integrate with the latest ship defence weapons, such as new gun-ammunition and active short-to-medium range missiles. The system’s weapon support functionality will provide military-grade 4D track data, either to the ship’s gun systems or active missile systems for “First Time Right” antisurface or anti-air engagements.

Within Thales’ NS family, the NS50 is positioned as in class, 4D radar in terms of size and range (short to medium range) and affordable for smaller platforms. “By applying our latest digital technologies to the NS50 and other NS-radars, we enable navies to detect, track and identify any threat and make the right decisions at every decisive moment. In addition, by going to a digital software-defined, future-proof radar architecture, with inherent scalability and upgradability, navies will be ready for whatever the future may brings.” Serge Adrian, Senior Vice President for surface radar activities, Thales."
Euronaval 2018: Nexter/Thales RapidFire T40AA on show - Navy Recognition,"Tue, 23 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL25hdnlyZWNvZ25pdGlvbi5jb20vaW5kZXgucGhwL25hdmFsLW5ld3MvbmF2YWwtZXhoaWJpdGlvbnMvMjAxOC9ldXJvbmF2YWwtMjAxOC82NTk3LWV1cm9uYXZhbC0yMDE4LW5leHRlci1zLXJhcGlkZmlyZS10NDBhYS1vbi1zaG93Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The French Navy future logistic vessels (FLOTLOG program) are likely to be fitted with both naval gun and missile systems. Among companies showcasing their solutions at this week's Euronaval show, Nexter is presenting for the first time a full scale model of its RapidFire T40AA anti-aircraft system, jointly designed with Thales.

Nexter/Thales' RapidFire T40AA at Euronaval 2018

Thanks to the accuracy and efficiency of the CTAI (Joint Venture Nexter and BAE) 40 mm gun and ammunition, the RapidFire T40AA system is capable of intercepting helicopters, drones or light craft up to a distance of 4000 m. This performance is achieved through a viewfinder with electro-optical day/night cameras and a moving target tracking function. The French defense group explains Navy Recognition why the RapidFire could fit the French Navy needs for its future FLOTLOG fleet.



- What are the advantages of the Naval Rapid Fire ?

Navy and Army forces have to face more and more new threats, especially LS4 (LS4 : Low, Small, Slow, Stealth, Swarm) ones like drones (UAV, USV ...) as well as common threats.

Forces require new defence means which match to these new threats, including cost and number of engagement concerns.

Thales and Nexter develop the new RAPIDFire system which fulfil this defence need, thanks to the 2 companies know-how and expertise (Thales in the field of anti-air firing control and system integrator, Nexter in the field of turreted gun). One of the RAPIDFire assets is the new 40 CTA gun base, which is the new medium calibre reference.

The RAPIDFire system is a new 40mm multirole artillery system for Navies, Armies and Air Forces. RAPIDFire includes an anti air firing control system, an anti air turret based on the 40CTA cannon, a new anti air ammunition to be added to the large panel of already available ones. Obviously this anti air capability is the most demanding one, however the RAPIDFire also fulfils antisurface (and ground to ground missions). The extreme accuracy of the system enables to destroy the selected threats with few ammunition.

RAPIDFire responds to the Very SHOrt Range needs of the Navies, Armies and Air Forces facing an increasing number of modern threats such as drones (air and surface ones) by using a modern, mutli threats, multi domains and multi environments (air and sea) artillery system ; the cost per engagement of a RAPIDFire matches to the cost of the new threats. It completes advantageously missile defense.

Dedicated for :

Police operations: Warning and stopping shots (anti-piracy, anti trafficking, ...)

Combat operations: Neutralisation shots, including against asymmetric threats, self defence,...

Ground Forces and Navies are more and more facing modern threats as mainly drones (UAV, USV...), but also light aircraft, small ships, partly RAM (Rockets, Artillery, Mortar), helicopters, light armoured vehicles, missiles.... RAPIDfire is the ultimate fence (range from less than 50 m to 4 000 m) to complete missile mean ; it can deal with many targets in a very short time.





- Why do you think it the right gun for a vessel like FLOTLOG ?

The DGA didn't communicate the armament specification of the FLOTLOG program, however, the main assets of the RAPIDFire are :

· Multi purpose: ground & naval, anti-air and anti-surface capabilities

· Very Short Range (up to 4000m) Defense in front of today and tomorrow threats

· Integrated mode (via CMS/C2) or autonomous mode (thanks to the integrated optronic sight)

· Compatible with almost all ground and naval platforms

Low engagement cost, adequate to emerging threats due to :

· Low dispersion cannon,

· A brand new co-localized sight dedicated to anti-air threat and anti-surface as well,

· An up-to-date firing control system

· A digital turret

These advantages reduce the ammunition number fired per engagement so that enables a larger number of engagements from the same number of ammunitions.

· The compactness of this canon leads to a small, light, non-penetrating Turret, which will be easy to integrate on all platforms or vessels





- The system doesn't exist yet. How do you make sure that development costs won't make the Naval Rapid Fire more expensive than its competition ?

First demonstration firings were made in real conditions performed since 2011 to 2014, confirming the maturity of this system, a low risk development of this new architecture (presented at Euronoval exhibition). Based on the reuse of subsystems in mass production (digital 40CT cannon, processor identical to the one used in the Jaguar-Ajax-Warrior turrets, etc..), a design to cost, and duality between land and naval applications offers synergies of production / optimized maintenance etc.. RAPIDfire will be a reference because of a competitive acquisition cost, a Long terme and optimised maintenance (Life Cycle Cost), reliable, robust and easy to use.





- What is the status of the project today and how long would it take Nexter (and Thales) to mass produce it ?

· First demonstration firings in real conditions : 2011

· Thales and Nexter selfunding

· First customer by 2019

· New design prototype qualification : 2021

· First deliveries: 2022





- Can we expect more naval gun systems from Nexter in the future ? Is this a field in which you want to expand your portfolio ?

Nexter has already a large portfolio of canon and in particular two type of Naval caliber, The Narwhal 20mm turret, 46 unit sold to 4 countries. It now has it's big brother, the new RAPIDFire system with its 40CTA canon.

The evolution of threats and the feedback of the various operations worldwide gave birth to a new tendency, the increase of the calibers, Nexter and Thales respond today to these threats with the RAPIDFire, and will be ready to evolve to always answer at best the different threats.





- Does your extensive experience in the land sector brings some added value to the naval field ?

It's very interesting for the Forces today to have a duality between them (land and naval applications for instance) to take benefit of synergy of production, optimized maintenance through a long term support. Thanks to this synergy, updates/upgrading from one sector is applicable on the other one, this way, the growth potential of the RAPIDFire will benefits both the Navy and Land forces, and Air force as well."

• Thanks to real-time processing and fusion of heterogeneous data from complementary acoustic sensors, BlueScan will enable operators to master the underwater acoustic situation at every decisive moment.

• The BlueScan system has been chosen by the French Defence Procurement Agency (DGA) to equip France’s five future FTI medium-size frigates.

At Euronaval 2018 future naval technologies exhibition in Paris, Thales is launching BlueScan, a new integrated acoustics system featuring real-time multi-sensor data fusion and analysis. The system is designed for naval forces conducting anti-submarine warfare missions and will equip the French Navy’s FTI future intermediate-sized frigates.

Anti-submarine warfare (ASW) missions are crucial to the ability of naval forces to manage tactical situations of ever-increasing complexity and to make the right choices at decisive moments. The BlueScan integrated acoustics system from Thales gives naval forces a tactical advantage by adopting a collaborative approach to acoustic detection with multiple sensors operating in multistatic mode when needed. The solution leverages advances in real-time Big Data analytics and artificial intelligence to provide automatic fusion, technical analysis and classification of heterogeneous data from acoustic sensors deployed by surface ships, aircraft, unmanned systems and sonobuoys.

The sonars in service today deliver increasingly high performance and relay acoustic data in such huge quantities that it is becoming more and more difficult to process by humans. The BlueScan system will provide sonar operators with an accurate picture of the acoustic situation and transmit only high-value data. With its open, scalable architecture, BlueScan is designed to adapt to evolving operational requirements while keeping through-life support costs under control and accommodating incremental capability enhancements to meet the priority objectives of naval forces."
Thales says signalling system for Metro Line LRT ready to go full speed - CTV News Edmonton,"Fri, 05 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vZWRtb250b24uY3R2bmV3cy5jYS90aGFsZXMtc2F5cy1zaWduYWxsaW5nLXN5c3RlbS1mb3ItbWV0cm8tbGluZS1scnQtcmVhZHktdG8tZ28tZnVsbC1zcGVlZC0xLjQxMjMxMjLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The company contracted to build the signalling system for the Metro Line LRT says their system is finally ready to go at full speed, years after the system was first rolled out to the public.

Thales Canada was hired for the project in 2011, but the line has never run at full speed due to safety concerns.

Thales vice president Dave Beckley told CTV News that tests conducted over the summer went well, and trains on the LRT line to NAIT could run at full speed starting now.

“We took a lot of trains, 26 trains and we ran them in a very tight aggressive service pattern on the Metro and Capital lines to demonstrate that the system could run with the capacity the city’s looking for,” Beckley said. “We were very pleased with the outcome of that demonstration.”

Meanwhile, the company said work is still needed on computerized automation of the line. When that is done, ETS staff will still have to manually control the doors on the trains, but trains moving between stations will be fully automated.

A City of Edmonton spokesperson released a statement to CTV News, saying:

“The City’s position has not changed. We are focused on getting a fully operational signalling system on the Metro Line. The City has and will continue to work co-operatively with Thales to achieve its December 4, 2018 deadline. The City will then test the signalling system to ensure Thales has met its contractual obligations.”

The city said officials are in the process of hiring a contractor to install a backup signalling system “in the event the Thales system is not completed or validated.”

Papantoniou who also held the post of Minister for National Economy and Finances from 1996-2001 was considered the architect of Greece's accession to the Eurozone.

He spent the night at the Greek police headquarters after a marathon 18-hour judicial grilling and was expected to be transferred to prison later Wednesday along with his wife Stavroula Kourakou.

Both face money laundering charges to the tune of 2.46 million euros ($2.81 million) from kickbacks dating back to his term as Defence Minister from 2001-04.

After leaving the court in handcuffs, just before midnight, Papantoniou denied the accusations and said such use of the justice system put Greek democracy at risk.

The couple were accused of profiting from a 2003 naval defence contract to upgrade six Greek Navy Type S frigates, signed between Greek Shipyards and a subcontracting French company, Thales Nederland BV.

According to the court indictment, Papantoniou received the money as a gift to assign the contract to the Thales Group and the kickbacks cost the Greek state some 400 million euros.

Papantoniou's wife Kourakou was indicted as joint holder of seven Swiss bank accounts where the grafted funds were alleged located.

Papantoniou signed arms contracts worth 6.22 billion euros during his stint at the Defence Ministry, the report said.

In 2012, the Greek judiciary began investigating the former Defence Minister for his alleged involvement in six cases of high-level corruption during his mandate.

Apart from the six frigates upgrading, the scandal also allegedly involved the purchase of 170 Leopard II tanks valued at 1.77 billion euros and 12 Apache helicopter contract worth 663 million euros.

In 2015 and 2017, the couple was also ordered to serve two four-year sentences for failing to declare part of their wealth in 2009-2010.

Both sentences were commuted by a 14,600 euro fine each, (roughly 10 euros per sentence day) plus two additional 10,000 euro fines.

Maritime Museum collection moves to safe site - City of Newcastle,"Mon, 01 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3Y2FzdGxlLm5zdy5nb3YuYXUvYWJvdXQtdXMvbmV3cy1hbmQtdXBkYXRlcy9sYXRlc3QtbmV3cy9tYXJpdGltZS1tdXNldW0tY29sbGVjdGlvbi1tb3Zlcy10by1zYWZlLXNpdGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"More than 7,000 items belonging to the Newcastle Maritime Museum will be relocated to the Thales Ship Maintenance facility at Carrington later this week.



The collection has for more than a decade been exhibited at the former Maritime Museum site at Honeysuckle and stored at the former BHP-owned QC Lab in Mayfield.



The relocation of the collection to a secure storage site will allow for preliminary curation work before a new permanent exhibition re-emerges at Newcastle Museum next year.

Maritime Museum volunteers will help with the move later this week just as they did earlier this year when the museum closed and exhibits were moved across the road.



The relocation has been generously funded by Hunter Development Corporation (HDC), which owns the harbour-side building vacated by the Newcastle Maritime Museum.



""The City of Newcastle will work with the Maritime Museum’s volunteers to audit the entire collection and carry out any necessary repairs and maintenance work,"" City of Newcastle CEO Jeremy Bath said.



“Relocating items that range from delicate paintings up to 200 years old to boats, one 12 metres long and six tonnes in weight, is a massive undertaking that requires considerable care and expertise, and to be frank, is extremely expensive.



""HDC has agreed to cover the cost of this project with Thales providing a secure building to store the collection for the next two years. Both organisations deserve special thanks for their support and patience as City of Newcastle works with the Board of the Maritime Museum Society following its decision to close its doors in June.""

Larger, fabled items from the collection like Australia 2, the famous America's Cup yacht, will be moved to Carrington.



HDC Chief Executive Michael Cassel said the Honeysuckle site would undergo important maintenance works once the artefacts had been moved.



“Safely relocating the collection to the Thales site at Carrington is our current focus, however once that is complete we will be undertaking maintenance works on the building to ensure ongoing preservation of the heritage property at Lee Wharf at Honeysuckle,” Mr Cassel said.



“HDC has a longstanding commitment to restoring and enhancing true heritage buildings for the community to enjoy, and this building absolutely falls into that category.""



Maritime Museum President Ian Jones thanked all stakeholders for helping preserve the Maritime Museum's artefacts for future generations.



""On behalf of the Newcastle Maritime Museum Society, we are grateful to Thales for agreeing to store the collection given the unsuitability of the current storage facility at Mayfield.



""I'd also like to thank HDC for funding the cost of the relocation and for their considerable support over the past decade.""



Thales Group Project Manager Greg Gocher said the global maritime organisation was proud to support the local shipping industry.



""Thales has a long history of maritime activity not only in Newcastle but around the globe, so it would be tragic to see strong Newcastle Maritime history, such as that within the Museum, forgotten,"" he said.



""Thales is also committed to establishing long-term relationships across Newcastle and the Hunter in support of continued growth across all community and industry-related activity.""



A collection of model boats and a significant shipwreck artefact from the Susan Gilmore have been on exhibition at Newcastle Museum since the closure of the Maritime Museum earlier this year.



“Newcastle Museum has been working with the former Newcastle Maritime Museum volunteers and during these school holidays they will be demonstrating some maritime skills to visitors,” Museum Director Julie Baird said.



“This significant collection is an important element in the story of Newcastle and I am so relieved to know it will remain safe and secure for future local generations to experience.”"
