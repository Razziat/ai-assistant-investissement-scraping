NASA Picks 8 for Spacecraft Catalog - SpaceNews,"Fri, 02 Apr 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9uYXNhLXBpY2tzLTgtc3BhY2VjcmFmdC1jYXRhbG9nL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"SAN FRANCISCO — NASA selected eight contractors, including one new firm, Thales Alenia Space of Italy, for its latest list of satellites that can be acquired by government agencies looking for a way to trim mission costs and schedules.

The contractors and satellites they offer will be included in the third installment of the space agency’s Rapid Spacecraft Acquisition Catalog, a listing of firm, fixed-price goods and services available to government organizations.

Companies selected for inclusion in the new catalog are: Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp.; General Dynamics Advanced Information Systems; Lockheed Martin Space Systems; Orbital Sciences; Surrey Satellite Technology-US; Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems; Thales Alenia Space Italia of Rome; and Thales Alenia Space of France. The list was announced March 30.

Nearly all of the companies were included in the previous Rapid Spacecraft Acquisition Catalog, which was released in late 1999 and augmented periodically when the space agency received additional bids. In many cases, however, the product offerings have changed and satellite models have been upgraded, said Greg Smith, chief of the Rapid Spacecraft Development Office (RSDO) at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.

One exception is Thales Alenia Space of Italy, a firm selected to offer the Prima satellite bus that is designed to carry payloads weighing 1,138 kilograms, according to an RSDO document. RadarSat-2, a Canadian synthetic aperture radar satellite, employs the Prima satellite platform. The catalog also includes Proteus, a satellite used in NASA’s Cloud Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder program and built by Thales Alenia of France to hold 300-kilogram payloads.

Missing from the current list are Swales Aerospace of Beltsville, Md., and EADS Astrium, Europe’s largest space company, two contractors included in the previous catalog. Astrium did not submit a bid for the new catalog and neither did Alliant Techsystems of Minneapolis, which acquired Swales Aerospace in 2007, Smith said.

In contrast, Orbital Sciences will play a larger role than in previous catalogs due to its plans announced in March to acquire General Dynamics’ space business. The new catalog includes two General Dynamics satellite buses designed for payloads of 65 kilograms and 3,115 kilograms, respectively. Orbital Sciences is offering the LEOStar-2, which was used for NASA’s Orbiting Carbon Observatory.

In the past, NASA Goddard mission managers have used the catalog for their payloads, but it has been used less frequently by other NASA centers and only once by the Defense Department, Smith said, adding that the situation may change. “We have had more interest in this catalog than any of the previous ones,” Smith said. “We have interest from other [NASA] centers and other missions.” Smith declined to name those missions.

The latest catalog features three spacecraft from Surrey Satellite Technology (SST)-US, the American subsidiary of Britain’s Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd. The previous catalog included satellites from Surrey Satellite Technology of Britain. John Paffett, SST-US chief executive, said the new catalog is exactly the type of U.S. opportunity the firm is seeking. As an American company, albeit foreign owned, SST-US can more efficiently serve a U.S. customer base, Paffett said.

The three Surrey satellites included are: SSTL 150, a platform designed to accommodate payloads of 50 kilograms and used in the RapidEye remote-sensing constellation; SSTL 300, a bus that can carry 150-kilogram payloads that is used in the NigeriaSat-2 program; and STL 600, a platform capable of carrying 200-kilogram payloads that is being used by European Space Agency for the GIOVE-A navigation mission operating in Medium Earth Orbit.

Ball’s entry is the BCP 2000, the basic design used for NASA’s Quick Scatterometer and National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System Preparatory Project.

Lockheed Martin’s LMx, a platform designed for 460-kilogram payloads, is included in the catalog. The LMx is an improved version of the satellite used by GeoEye’s Ikonos commercial Earth-observation mission, according to Lockheed Martin spokesman Gary Napier. Another catalog entry is Northrop Grumman’s Eagle, a lightweight, modular platform designed for 86-kilogram payloads and used in the Korea Multipurpose Satellite program.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999992847442627}",neutral,0.9999992847442627,0

launched theprogram in 2002 to support the International Space Station's), as well as future manned space missions. Developed byas prime contractor, the Eurobot programme kicked off with a design study for a robotic EVA assistant, capable of aiding spaceborne crews and thus reducing the time spent by astronauts on extravehicular activities. ESA moved to a new phase of the Eurobot program in 2008 by financing the), designed to expand the robot’s capabilities beyond the scope of the ISS, and encompass possible manned missions in the Solar System. The new robotic system is designed to operate on the surface of a moon or planet, preparing for the astronauts' landing and supporting them afterwards.Since July of 2008, Thales Alenia Space has led the team of European companies working on the EGP project. The EGP’s architecture is based on the ""centaur"" concept, which includes a mobile platform () transporting a manlike robot () that has two articulated arms, with force and torque sensors and vision systems. This makes it an autonomous system, capable of traveling on its own over the surface of the Moon or Mars and building the necessary infrastructures for the construction of a base. The system can be controlled from Earth (when the time lag due to the distance between the planets is acceptable), from a control station on the planet or in direct response to astronaut voice commands. The current prototype is capable of transporting 150 kilograms, including a space-suited astronaut. It has four driven wheels and is highly maneuverable, with its back wheels steerable over 120 degrees. Subcontractors on the EGP project include, acompany.The EGP demonstrated exceptional performance during the final qualification stages before delivery to the client. In particular, the EGP successfully performed two missions:recently confirmed that collaborative robotics for astronauts is a technology worth investing in for future space exploration missions, and suggested that it could be validated on the International Space Station, perhaps via a joint international initiative. Thales Alenia Space has built up extensive experience in the Eurobot programme, making the company a leading candidate for any future joint projects between the European and American space agencies. As the supplier of 55 percent of the pressurised volume in the non-Russian segment of the ISS, Thales Alenia Space is a major player in manned space programmes. The company is also heavily involved in laboratories and other modules for manned space programmes, as well as for services, and is developing the technologies needed for the atmospheric reentry of manned spacecraft.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9967243075370789}",neutral,0.9967243075370789,0
Watchkeeper is Flying in the UK - Defense Update,"Thu, 15 Apr 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vZGVmZW5zZS11cGRhdGUuY29tLzIwMTAwNDE1X3dhdGNoa2VlcGVyLTIuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Newest British UAV is Scheduled for Delivery Later in 2010

Watchkeeper, the newest unmanned aircraft to join the ranks of the British Army performed its first flight in the U.K. on April 14, 2010 at Parc Aberporth in West Wales. TheParc Aberporth facilities, managed by QinetiQ through the West Wales Unmanned Air vehicle (UAV) Centre, are the premier test facilities for UAVs in the UK.

Performing the first success flight is the first milestone in the UAV induction of the Watchkeeper system with Army units, demonstrating that the vehicle and its system meet the robust safety and airworthiness criteria required to fly UAVs initially on ranges and segregated airspace in the UK. Thales UK, the system integrator and prime contractor is scheduled to deliver the first Watchkeeper systems to the MOD this year. Photos: Thales UK

“2010 is an important year for the program as it will also see the opening of the Watchkeeper training facility based in Larkhill, and the continuation of the technical field trials at Parc Aberporth” Alex Dorrian, CEO of Thales UK added. “Building on lessons learnt on current operations, Watchkeeper will also soon be an invaluable asset for commanders on the ground.” Dorian added. Thales UK, as Prime Contractor for the Watchkeeper program, will deliver equipment, training and facilities, with the capability being delivered to the MoD customer from late 2010. Production of the Watchkeeper system will take place at U-TacS (UAV Tactical Systems Ltd), the Thales UK and Elbit Systems joint company, based in Leicester.

Watchkeeper is a high-performance multi-sensor, all-weather UAS that can remain airborne for over 16 hours in a single mission. It includes a high degree of automation, with automatic take-off and landing (ATOL), and has a de-icing capability, to expand its ability to operate in all weather / operational environment. Delivered in a dual-payload configuration, the system includes enhanced electro-optic / infrared sensors, with laser target designator, as well as an advanced I-Master synthetic aperture radar / ground moving target indicator radar.

Until the Watchkeeper is fielded, the Army relies on the services of fleet of leased Hermes 450 unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) operated by Thales UK offering the MoD customer an innovative ‘ISTAR-by-the-hour’ contract. Since the contract award, in July 2007, these Hermes 450 UAVs have flown more than 30,000 operational hours in over 2,000 sorties, supporting UK forces in current operations, primarily in Afghanistan. The company launched this service in response to an Urgent Operational Requirement (UoR) contract issued by the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD), and will run through to contract completion in October 2010 which could potentially be extended until April 2011 when the H-450s will be phased out as the Watchkeeper delivers frontline capability.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9540036916732788}",neutral,0.9540036916732788,0
Mirage upgrade augments new fighter force - Arabian Aerospace,"Wed, 28 Apr 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHA6Ly93d3cudGltZXNhZXJvc3BhY2UuYWVyby9uZXdzL2RlZmVuY2UvbWlyYWdlLXVwZ3JhZGUtYXVnbWVudHMtbmV3LWZpZ2h0ZXItZm9yY2XSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Upgraded F-5s have already entered service and Morocco ’s MF2000 Mirage F1 upgrade is now flying in prototype form.

The Moroccan Mirage F1 upgrade was designed and is being integrated by the new Association Sagem Thales pour la Rénovation d'Avions de Combat (ASTRAC) consortium. This is a joint venture between Thales and Sagem Défense Sécurité (SAFRAN) and was established in November 2005 at the request of the French Ministry of Defence.

ASTRAC aimed to provide an upgrade for remaining Mirage F1 export customers – principally Morocco – whose aircraft still enjoyed competitive performance characteristics but whose avionics were dated, and whose operational capabilities were somewhat limited.

Thales brought its experience of the Spanish Mirage F1M upgrade to the project, while SAFRAN has played a major role in a number of Mirage and other combat aircraft upgrades, including the upgrade of French Mirage F1C interceptors to multi-role F1CT fighter-bombers.

The ASTRAC consortium put together an upgrade (using the designation MF2000) which transforms the capabilities of the ageing Mirage F1 in both air-to-air and air-to-ground operations, providing a new multi-mode radar, a laser designation pod, new electronic warfare and self-protection systems and giving compatibility with a range of new weapons.

Much of the upgrade is based on technology developed for the latest Mirage 2000 versions (Mirage 2000-5 and 2000-9). The cockpit is transformed, becoming a modern, digital glass cockpit with two-colour multifunction displays replacing the analogue flight instruments and the old analogue Cyrano IV radar screen. The aircraft is also fitted with a new HUD with a broad panel up front control panel (UFCP) and features full HOTAS controls. The aircraft has two SAGEM mission computers interfaced with a MIL STD 1553B digital databus, and a hybrid Sigma IN/GPS. The MF2000 has new secure voice radios, and the cockpit is compatible with a helmet mounted sighting system. Finally, the pilot sits on a modern zero-zero capable ejection seat.

The upgraded Mirage F1 is fitted with a Thales RC400 (RDY3) multi-mode pulse Doppler radar. This is based on the Mirage 2000-5’s RDY radar, but with a smaller antenna giving shorter range.

The Mirage F1’s electronic warfare capabilities are similarly enhanced, with a new digital radar warning receiver (RWR) and an external PAJ FA ECM pod designed to detect, classify and counter search, fire-control, and missile seeker radars. The aircraft is also fitted with Corail flare launchers and Phimat chaff dispensers.

The upgraded Mirages retain their internal 30-mm DEFA cannon with 135 rounds per gun, and augment these with a variety of externally carried weapons. For use in the air-to-air role, the MF2000 can carry AIM-9L/M Sidewinder, Magic 2 or IR MICA missiles with MICA EM available for BVR use.

For air-to-ground missions, the MF2000 can carry a wide range of guided and unguided munitions. Use of the Damocles day/night laser designation pod allows the carriage of a variety of laser-guided bombs, but perhaps the greatest expansion to air-to-ground capabilities is provided by the new AASM precision-guided, stand-off rocket-boosted bomb, supported by a mission preparation system provided by Sagem Défense Sécurité and a debriefing system from Thales.

For more specialised missions, the MF2000 is compatible with the ARMAT anti-radiation missile, and with the MBDA AM39 Exocet anti-ship missile.

Though there have been proposals to re-engine the Mirage F1 (with South Africa successfully integrating a derivative of the MiG-29’s RD-33 engine) the MF2000 retains the basic Snecma ATAR 9K50 engine, though this is ‘optimised’ under the so-called ATAR Gratification programme, with a new compressor module, a redesigned HP turbine, a six per cent increase in mass flow and a 40 per cent increase in turbine entry temperatures combining to increase thrust from 7,200 kg to 7,500 kg.

At the Paris Air Salon at Le Bourget, ASTRAC displayed what purported to be an example of the MF2000 in the aircraft static park though, in fact, the aircraft was a loaned Armée de l’Air Mirage F1CT (No.281), with some cockpit modifications. But though the aircraft wore an interesting black and grey camouflage scheme, it was not fully representative of the Moroccan upgrade configuration.

As it had done when undertaking the Spanish Mirage F1 upgrade programme, Thales gave responsibility for incorporating modifications on the real ‘prototype’ aircraft to Belgium ’s SABCA at Charleroi , near Brussels .

In the case of the Moroccan upgrade, the first two aircraft (173 and one other) were upgraded at Charleroi , with the third (150) undergoing modifications in-country. The prototype made its maiden flight on October 19 2009, and flight tests and certification are expected to continue throughout the spring and summer of 2010, before activity transfers to Sidi Slimane.

Some 27 Mirage F1s (a mix of Mirage F1CH, F1EH and probe-equipped F1EH-200) will be upgraded to a common MF2000 standard under the ‘F1 Renovation’ programme, at an estimated cost of $420m US.

It has been claimed that with RDY-3 radar and MICA missiles, the upgraded Mirage F1 enjoyed the same BVR air combat capabilities as the Mirage 2000-5, while the combination of Damocles and AASM transforms the aircraft into a ‘pocket Rafale’ in the air-to-ground role.

Though the Mirage F1 has been retired from service in Greece , Jordan , and will soon bow out of Armée de l’Air service, further upgrade opportunities may exist in Gabon , Libya and perhaps Ecuador .

Also, new customers may emerge for the aircraft retired by Jordan (and France), perhaps including Argentina, which was recently reported to be examining a $100 million proposal to buy 12 ex-Jordanian air force Dassault Mirage F1CJ fighters and one F1BJ trainer, having rejected a Spanish offer for a similar number of F1s. The aircraft would replace the Fuerza Aerea Argentina ’s surviving Mirage IIIEAs, which are scheduled to be retired in 2012.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9983606934547424}",neutral,0.9983606934547424,0
One careful owner – why Mirage sale might be no illusion - Arabian Aerospace,"Thu, 29 Apr 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHA6Ly93d3cudGltZXNhZXJvc3BhY2UuYWVyby9uZXdzL2RlZmVuY2Uvb25lLWNhcmVmdWwtb3duZXItd2h5LW1pcmFnZS1zYWxlLW1pZ2h0LWJlLW5vLWlsbHVzaW9u0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"But the Mirage 2000-9 is far from being obsolete or past its prime and it has been estimated that $3.4 billion of the $9.9 billion spent by the UAE has been used on the Mirage 2000-9 series (with $6.5 billion spent on the Block 60 F-16). The UAE, therefore, naturally expects to realise a good price for these versatile, modern and highly capable strike fighters.

Though the UAE’s first batch of 36 Mirage 2000s were purchased in 1986, 30 survivors have been extensively refurbished and then upgraded – bringing them to the same standard as the 32 new Mirage 2000-9s ordered in 1998 under the so-called Bader 21 purchase agreement and delivered from 2003. As such, all surviving UAE Air Force and Air Defence Mirage 2000s now share the same 21st Century 2000-9 configuration and, thus, represent the top of the Mirage 2000 evolutionary tree.

The Mirage 2000-9 incorporates state-of-the-art technologies and advanced capabilities that the basic Mirage 2000 lacks, many of which were incorporated as a direct result of experience gained by Dassault during the development of the Rafale, and which may be viewed as ‘Rafale technology’, with similar modular avionics, an LCD glass cockpit with full night vision goggles compatibility, and advanced sensors and systems.

At the core of the Mirage 2000-9’s navigation and attack system is a Thales-and Dassault Aviation-developed modular data processing unit (MDPU) that is similar to that used by the Rafale. This serves as the mission computer, manages the navigation and attack system, controls the cockpit display system and generates symbology for the head-up display (HUD) and head-down displays (HDDs). As a result, the Mirage 2000-9 is claimed to enjoy a world-beating, highly intuitive man-machine interface.

Though the Mirage 2000-9 is externally very similar to the original Mirage 2000C fighter, it actually represents the culmination of several stages of technical advance. The Mirage 2000-5 was developed as a private venture multi-role update of the fighter Mirage 2000 with a new Thales RDY multimode radar, a wide-angle HUD, hands-on throttle and stick (HOTAS) controls, and with provision for a Thales TV/CT CLDP laser designator pod.

A two-seat Mirage 2000B was extensively upgraded and modified to serve as the first Mirage 2000-5 prototype, making its maiden flight on October 24 1990. Thirty-seven existing Armée de l’Air Mirage 2000s were upgraded to 2000-5F standards, becoming operational in 2000.

The aircraft was further upgraded for export customers as the Mirage 2000-5 Mark 2. This added RDY-2 radar with enhanced air-to-ground capabilities. The Mk 2 also gained a new Thales Totem 3000 ring laser gyro IN/GPS, an ICMS 2 countermeasures suite and a Samir DDM missile warning system, higher resolution colour cockpit displays, and provision for a Topsight helmet-mounted display.

Compared to the Mirage 2000-5 Mk 2, the UAE’s -9 variant incorporates what Dassault coyly refers to as “additional operating capabilities specified by the UAE AF & AD”, and which include enhanced survivability and much-improved long-range stand-off air-to-ground capabilities.

With the USA unwilling to facilitate the integration of certain local weapons on aircraft that it supplies to the UAE, to avoid upsetting certain regional sensitivities, it has been the Mirage 2000 that has acted as the delivery platform for the UAE’s Black Shaheen cruise missile (a derivative of the MBDA Apache/SCALP/Storm Shadow) and the MBDA Al Hakim family of rocket-boosted LGBs. The original UAE Mirage 2000EAD was equipped with a ‘day-only’ ATLIS II laser targeting pod, but the Mirage 2000-9 was provided with a new Shehab laser designation pod – with a Nahar navigation FLIR in the dedicated pylon used to attach the Shehab pod to the aircraft.

The Mirage 2000-9 has a unique new IMEWS electronic warfare and countermeasures system. IMEWS was designed and developed by Thales, Elettronica and MBDA to UAE Air Force and Air Defence requirements.

The aircraft also has a new Thales communication, navigation, identification (CNI) suite, with a frequency-agile Thomrad V/UHF secure voice radio system, and an LU2 tactical datalink.

The Mirage 2000-9 is powered by the latest version of the SNECMA M53-P2 turbofan, incorporating FADEC and a sophisticated autothrottle (which provides automatic control of engine speed to maintain whatever speed is selected by the pilot).

Development of the Mirage 2000-9 was spread over five years and was divided into two distinct weapon delivery and navigation system standards, known as SAD91 and SAD92. Deliveries of 32 new-build aircraft to SAD91 standards began at the end of April 2003 and continued until early 2004.

Retrofitting of the UAE’s surviving 30 Mirage 2000EAD/RAD/DADs to the new standard was jointly undertaken by French specialists based in Paris , and at the Istres Flight Test Centre and by UAE Air Force & Air Defence (AF & AD) staff at Al Dhafra. The first two of these aircraft were upgraded in Istres , France , between 2001 and 2003, with the remaining 28 undergoing upgrade at Al Dhafra. The conversion consisted of a major overhaul and the avionics/equipment retrofit, undertaken simultaneously. The programme ran until 2007.

The Mirage 2000-9 programme provided the UAE AF & AD with invaluable experience and allowed the UAE to establish in-country software development, weapon integration, test and evaluation capabilities.

If the country’s planned Rafale purchase goes ahead, the UAE’s surplus fleet of Mirage 2000-9s would represent an extremely potent fighter for any buyer, far more modern and far more capable than the simple Mirage 2000 name might suggest, and quite probably available at a bargain price.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999850988388062}",neutral,0.9999850988388062,0
