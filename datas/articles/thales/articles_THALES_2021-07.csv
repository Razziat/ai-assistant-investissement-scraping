The World’s First Commercial Space Orbital Infrastructure and new comfortable home for humans in space

Extending the boundaries of research and science activities in space for a more sustainable life on Earth

In this occasion, Thales Alenia Space and the Italian Air Force ratify a Memorandum of Collaboration for a variety of developments and tests in microgravity

Rome 15 July, 2021 – Thales Alenia Space, Joint Venture between Thales (67%) and Leonardo (33%), and Axiom Space of Houston, Texas (USA), have signed the final contract for the development of two key pressurized elements of Axiom Space Station - the world’s first commercial space station. Scheduled for launch in 2024 and 2025 respectively, the two elements will originally be docked to the International Space Station (ISS), marking the birth of the new Axiom Station segment. The value of the contract is 110 Million Euro.

Axiom Station will serve as humanity’s central hub for research, manufacturing and commerce in Low Earth Orbit (LEO), expanding the usable and habitable volume of the ISS, attached to the ISS Node 2 module, built also by Thales Alenia Space. When the ISS is decommissioned, the Axiom modules will detach and operate as a free-flying, next-generation commercial space station, a laboratory and residential infrastructure in space, that will be used for microgravity experiments in-space manufacturing, critical exploration life support testing, and hosting both private and professional institutional astronauts. Axiom Space Station will be the cornerstone of a permanent, prosperous human presence and a thriving network of commercial activity in LEO, enabling new advances both on Earth and further out in space. The first two elements to be launched will accommodate up to 4 people each.

Today, in this occasion, Thales Alenia Space and the Italian Air Force have ratified a Memorandum of Collaboration, aiming to promote the access to low earth orbit in favour of institutions, the scientific community, industry and commercial operators, and the development of a research chain on strategic issues (medicine, materials, biogenetics, etc.) as well as to support the possibilities of technological development and OT&E (Operational Testing & Evaluation) in microgravity.

“The contact signed today with Axiom Space confirms the positioning of Thales Alenia Space as a leading industrial player in the New Space ecosystem, both for private and public missions”, stated Massimo Claudio Comparini, Thales Alenia Space Deputy CEO and Senior Executive Vice President Observation, Exploration & Navigation business line. “With the development of more than 50% of the ISS’ habitable volume, our Company has marked the history since the origins of Orbital Infrastructures programs. Based on this unique legacy, we are pioneering the future of human presence in LEO. We are pushing back the boundaries of space exploration and setting the basis for the Lunar Gateway and the Moon’s Surfaces ecosystem that will lead manned exploration missions to the red planet by the 2030’s. Humankind’s quest of sense in space is becoming a reality and we are so proud to contribute to making it come true”.

The welding activities of the primary structure of the first module will start in September 2021, with the assembly process concluding in 2022. The first module will arrive at Axiom facilities in Houston in July 2023, where Axiom will integrate and outfit the core systems and certify it for flight prior to shipping to the launch facility.

“We have convened an elite collection of expertise at Axiom to build and operate the world’s first commercial space station, and Thales Alenia Space fits right into that mold as a partner,” Axiom President & CEO Michael Suffredini, who previously served as NASA’s International Space Station Program Manager from 2005 to 2015, said. “This agreement confirms the primary structures for the next-generation destination in space will be constructed with an expert touch, serving as the core of the first human-rated spacecraft to ever be assembled in Houston.”

The project is currently undergoing a detailed design phase: the four radial bulkheads for the first module have been recently developed in Thales Alenia Space facilities in Turin. These bulkheads provide the structure to which radial Common Berth Mechanisms (CBMs) and hatches will attach. Together, the four bulkheads, with their accompanying hardware form a cylindrical section, providing four ports for other station elements, including docking adapters. The cylindrical protrusions seen on the bottom half of the bulkhead will serve as a connecting unit, allowing power, data, and fluids to pass from one element to another, including Axiom modules and the ISS.

Latest MMCM Milestones Paves the Way for Thales on International MCM Markets - Naval News,"Wed, 21 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdmFsbmV3cy5jb20vbmF2YWwtbmV3cy8yMDIxLzA3L2xhdGVzdC1tbWNtLW1pbGVzdG9uZXMtcGF2ZXMtdGhlLXdheS1mb3ItdGhhbGVzLW9uLWludGVybmF0aW9uYWwtbWNtLW1hcmtldHMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Latest MMCM Milestones Paves the Way for Thales on International MCM Markets Naval News earlier this year visited the Thales site of Brest to learn about the latest developments in the French-British MMCM program. We learned about some key milestones being achieved. We also found out what is next, including on other MCM market with Thales' Pathmaster product.

Thales is now pushing its Pathmaster unmanned MCM solution on the international market

The Maritime Mine Counter Measures (MMCM) program passed an important step late last year, with a production contract awarded by both British and French authorities as part of phase 2.

Guy Le Bihan, MMCM Chief Engineer at Thales, explained to Naval News that the culmination of MMCM “phase 1” was the live demonstration of the entire “system of systems” with back-to-back tests. These tests took place in very different environments in Brest, Toulon, and Plymouth, involving a complex set of scenarios and sub-scenarios. Carried out in autumn and early winter, testing was ramped up rapidly from 8-10 hour slots to 24/7 evaluation. The unmanned vehicles covered an equivalent of 30,000 football pitches – demonstrating an outstanding, threefold, increase in MCM productivity, compared with purely conventional approaches. Dozens of mines were detected, in all environmental conditions, and then classified and localised to clear the seas of threats.

“We covered about 200 Km², day and night, in high sea states, up to 4, in high wind conditions, up to 25 knots, we had up to 3 knots of current, from 300 meters of water depth in Toulon to shalow water, up to 7 meters in Plymouth for amphibious operation scenario. […] The end-users were happy with the systems and with the results […] we detected everything. The navies laid more than 130 mines, 10 to 15 different types of mines and we achieved 100% detection. For the most challenging scenario which was choke point and amphibious operation we succeeded to have between 95% and 99% probability of classification.”



Guy Le Bihan, MMCM Chief Engineer at Thales

Looking ahead, with MMCM “phase 2” Thales is putting in place full-scale production facilities, and reinforcing its global supply chains as it gets ready to deliver four complete systems to the Royal Navy and four to the Marine Nationale.

The opportunity to work with the French and British navies on MMCM’s groundbreaking work has enabled Thales to build deep expertise that can also serve other allied navies. Thales now offers its unmanned MCM knowhow and expertise on the international market with a product called PathMaster. Officially launched at Euronaval 2016, it is a complete approach designed to help customers cut through the complexity of unmanned mine warfare and explore the solutions that meet their future MCM needs and budgets.

“We are ready to address the international market either by proposing the full system of systems or to integrate, thanks to your open architecture, any asset a customer would like to integrate”.



Guy Le Bihan, MMCM Chief Engineer at Thales

A natural market for Thales (and Thales Australia) would be the upcoming SEA 1905 MCM program of the Royal Australian Navy. Le Bihan admitted that Thales is “looking closely” at this potential market.

About SLAM-F / MMCM

Mi-Map: AI-assisted Mine Warfare

Mine Intelligence Mapping system (Mi-Map) is a new AI-assisted solution developed by Thales for mine warfare analysis.

Mi-Map is a digital assistant powered by AI for sonar data analysis including a fully integrated design for quick deployment and a continuous machine learning capability. This platform can reduce operator workload, improve Man-Machine performance, and speed up post mission and real time operator analysis whilst being able to self-adapt to new environments or threats.

“Mi-Map is the operational software that we use for mine warfare. It was proven at sea during the recent trials in both England and France. It allowed us to match the French Navy and Royal Navy requirements in order to detect and classify all the mines that had been laid on the sea-bed”.



Saab MuMNS: The mine-killing ROV of MMCM

According to its designer Saab, MuMNS delivers a new generation of mine identification and disposal in a powerful, modular system based on proven unmanned Saab technology and Mine Countermeasures solutions. This means unparalleled operational capability with greater flexibility that significantly improves operational tempo, and reduces the cost of Mine Countermeasures operations and risk to personnel.

David Peron, ROV product manager at Thales told Naval News that MuMNS can carry three mine neutralisation systems (shapped charge). Therefore MuMNS can neutralise three mines in a single mission which is quite unique. Another unique feature of MuMNS is that it can safely and quickly be reloaded at sea. Thales recently demonstrated the reloading of a MuMNS ROV using a RHIB in sea state 2."
Thales's biometric payment card provides users with increased security and convenience - Help Net Security,"Wed, 21 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhlbHBuZXRzZWN1cml0eS5jb20vMjAyMS8wNy8yMS90aGFsZXMtYmlvbWV0cmljLXBheW1lbnQtY2FyZC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Payment cards are familiar products, which are part of our daily lives. They have evolved quickly over recent years with the emergence of contactless technology. At the heart of this move, Thales has helped banks to constantly reinvent the card itself and offer the best payment experience. This new card, which integrates a biometric sensor, provides users with increased security and convenience. This latest generation of cards represents a key milestone in the payment space.

The contactless biometric card simplifies proximity payments and also provides an essential level of privacy and confidence. The user’s fingerprint data is loaded on the card via a simple and secure personal enrollment process, carried out from home or at a bank branch.

In addition, none of the biometric details used for the enrolment are shared with any third party; the fingerprint in the card’s chip is only used to provide a local authentication of the cardholder when paying contactless. Neither the retailer nor the bank get access to biometric data as it stays securely stored in the chip of the card.

In terms of security, the biometric card ultimately means that a lost or stolen card is useless without the owner’s fingerprint to authenticate a contactless transaction. In such trustworthy payment environments, there is no need to set any payment limit. What’s more, whenever the cardholder’s fingerprint can’t be used – such as for ATM cash withdrawals – use of a PIN code is still possible as a fallback solution.

The Thales EMV contactless biometric payment card is the only solution in the industry fully certified by major EMV payment schemes like MasterCard and Visa. After a series of successful trials around the world, the solution has been commercialized in several countries.

“After a trial of the Thales biometric payment card and its positive outcome, we have now opened the offer to all our customers with confidence. This premium solution addresses several challenges such as convenience, safety and contactless. A simple yet rigorous enrollment process has been set in the branch so the biometric data never leaves the card. This is a key pre-requisite as we take the privacy of our customers’ data very seriously,” said Jean-Marie Dragon, Head Of Payments and Cards, BNP Paribas.

“The COVID-19 pandemic has pushed the Tech sector to develop touchless solutions and has indirectly resulted in higher transaction levels being processed without a second authentication factor. The biometric payment card allows contactless payment for any amount while safeguarding the privacy of this very personal data,” said Bertrand Knopf, SVP Banking and Payment Solutions at Thales."
Thales eyes 2023 certification for UAS 100 platform | News | Flight Global - Flightglobal,"Wed, 07 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vY2l2aWwtdWF2cy90aGFsZXMtZXllcy0yMDIzLWNlcnRpZmljYXRpb24tZm9yLXVhcy0xMDAtcGxhdGZvcm0vMTQ0NDg3LmFydGljbGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales is targeting 2023 for European civil certification of its new UAS 100 unmanned air system, after conducting a first flight of a half-scale model on 22 June.

Developed in partnership with French general aviation manufacturer and composite materials specialist Innoaire Aviation and autopilot software provider Hionos, the three-engined aircraft will have a maximum take-off weight of 100kg (220lb), and a 10kg payload capacity.

A hybrid propulsion system comprises a pair of electric motors and a mid-mounted conventional engine, each driving propellers. This configuration – installed on a tri-hull airframe – offers “optimum safety, endurance and discretion”, the company says, referring to its low noise output.

“Having three engines is part of the safety concept,” notes Marc Duval-Destin, vice-president strategy, product policy and innovation at Thales’s flight avionics business.

With a 5.4m (17ft 6in) wingspan and 5h endurance during autonomous operations, the UAS 100 has short take-off performance, requiring “much less than a football pitch” to get airborne.

Range will be in excess of 54nm (100km), with expected commercial or government applications including powerline inspection, border surveillance, fire monitoring, event security and search and rescue (SAR) tasks.

Multiple payloads will be carried simultaneously, with Thales giving the example of carrying an electro-optical sensor and GSM signal receiver to perform SAR duties.

Military roles could also be explored for the system, with the development activity supported by the French defence ministry via its Defence Innovation Agency. Thales says that its modular design concept means that longer-endurance surveillance operations could be performed by using a larger wing.

However, the company’s concept of operations involves automatic flight in non-segregated airspace at no more than 10,000ft, and perhaps only 1,500ft above populated areas.

“It is not our aim to operate in controlled airspace,” says Duval-Destin. “Our challenge is to fly in open zones, near general aviation, to be safe doing that with a light system that is easy to operate and deploy.”

Thales says the operational UAS 100 will meet the European Union Aviation Safety Agency’s Special Condition – Light Unmanned Aircraft Systems regulations, with “world-class flight safety performance”.

“We have safety features that have no equivalent on the market today” for this category of unmanned system, Duval-Destin says. This includes the use of co-operative sense and avoid technology, and Thales is exploring the use of equipment for non-cooperative capability.

“Its jam-resistant navigation system will ensure safe operation even in dense or cluttered electromagnetic environments,” the company notes says.

“We will be capable of still flying even after having two failures of our critical systems, and land safely in a known remote area,” says Emmanuel Guyonnet, drone programme director at Thales’s flight avionics business.

Meanwhile, Yannick Assouad, Thales’s executive vice-president, avionics, notes that “the new system paves the way for the [unmanned] air mobility solutions of tomorrow”.

Continued testing with the half-scale vehicle will progress to conducting automatic beyond line-of-sight operations. It also is scheduled to take part in a flight demonstration during the UAV Show near Bordeaux on 21 October.

A full-scale example is due to get airborne for the first time in the second half of 2022.

Thales has already received market interest in the UAS 100 design, with Duval-Destin noting: “Our first prospects are out of France.”"
Thales raises $2.5M for binary options platform in Synthetix ecosystem - Cointelegraph,"Wed, 14 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vbmV3cy90aGFsZXMtcmFpc2VzLTItNW0tZm9yLWJpbmFyeS1vcHRpb25zLXBsYXRmb3JtLWluLXN5bnRoZXRpeC1lY29zeXN0ZW3SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A decentralized finance project providing binary options style trading has just completed a $2.5 million seed round.

Binary options are financial instruments that allow traders to speculate on the price movement of the underlying market or cryptocurrency. There are two possible outcomes which is why they are considered binary.

At launch, Thales will support markets for more than 60 different assets including cryptocurrencies, commodities, equities, and index products, before expanding into sports markets. At the time of writing, there was no mention of the specific launch date.

The strategic investment round for the Thales platform was led by Framework Ventures and Apollo Capital. There were several other venture capital contributors including LD Capital, Honey DAO, the LAO, Zee Prime Capital, IOSG Ventures, D64 Ventures, and Koji Capital.

The announcement added that there will be a two-year token vesting strategy by the protocol’s strategic partners starting at the token generation event.

The funding round was completed using 'DAO-first capital formation', a method proposed by Synthetix founder Kain Warwick earlier this month. This approach enables the project to establish token holder-based governance usi a Decentralized Autonomous Organization much sooner than going through legal structures and processes.

Thales is a Synthetix ecosystem project building support for trading binary options and on-chain derivatives on the Ethereum network. In late 2020, core contributors at Synthetix began to seek an external team to develop a binary options trading platform that would become Thales. It received seed funding from the SynthetixDAO to kick start the project.

Thales token distribution model will be weighted towards active Synthetix community members with 35% of the 100 million tokens claimable by SNX stakers with minted debt. Another 45% will go toward various incentive programs and yield farms and 20%, or 20 million Thales tokens, will be allocated to the current and future team.

The Thales airdrop will likely happen in August and September according to Synthetix core contributor, Jordan Momtazi.

New Satellite Integration Clean Room Opened By Thales Alenia Space In Spain – SatNews - SatNews,"Thu, 08 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5zYXRuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA3LzA4L25ldy1zYXRlbGxpdGUtaW50ZWdyYXRpb24tY2xlYW4tcm9vbS1vcGVuZWQtYnktdGhhbGVzLWFsZW5pYS1zcGFjZS1pbi1zcGFpbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales Alenia Space has inaugurated the company’s new satellite integration clean room in Tres Cantos (Madrid); with the presence of the Minister of Science and Innovation of Spain, Pedro Duque, and high representatives of Spanish institutions and Industry.

This cutting-edge facility represents an important step forward in the company’s development strategy in Europe and a qualitative leap in the capacities of the space industry in Spain for the assembly, integration and tests (AIT) of large space systems, something within the reach of only a few space powers worldwide.

The new clean room will add more than 600 m2 clean area to the existing 2000 m2 clean area at the site of Thales Alenia Space in Tres Cantos. With a free height of 12.5 meters in the inside (20 meters high building), it is equipped with bridge cranes with lifting capacity up to 12 tons, allowing the integration of large satellites, payloads and instruments for all types of space missions, spanning telecommunications, navigation, Earth observation and science. The construction of this facility began in July 2019 and did not cease despite the difficult conditions caused by Covid-19.

This building will enable to carry out high-scale activities such as the integration in a few months of the Communications Module of SPAINSAT NG, Spain’s new generation governmental satellites owned and operated by Hisdesat. The Communications Module, which houses the satellite’s communications payloads, is a 6-meter high structure weighing nearly two tons, equipped with hundreds of units, that will become the largest satellite system ever integrated in Spain to date. Thales Alenia Space leads in Spain the development of the communications payloads in UHF and military-Ka bands for both satellites. This is the first time that Spanish industry leads the construction of satellite communications payloads, an important milestone in scope and complexity.

“This brand new clean room is the sign of Thales Alenia Space’s determination to develop its activities in Spain, in line with the company’s global development strategy to meet the evolving needs of its customers and of the space market,” said Herv Derrey, President and CEO of Thales Alenia Space.

“This new facility will allow us to carry out in Spain activities of high added value with all the implications that it has regarding the creation of high quality employment and the strengthening of the space ecosystem in Spain. The new capabilities will boost the competitiveness of our national space industry”, said Alfonso Richart, COO of Thales Alenia Space in Spain."
"Thales launches a certified UAS development programme looking at civil, government and military use - EDR Magazine","Wed, 07 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVkcm1hZ2F6aW5lLmV1L3RoYWxlcy1sYXVuY2hlcy1hLWNlcnRpZmllZC11YXMtZGV2ZWxvcG1lbnQtcHJvZ3JhbW1lLWxvb2tpbmctYXQtY2l2aWwtZ292ZXJubWVudC1hbmQtbWlsaXRhcnktdXNl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Paolo Valpolini

Named UAS 100, the programme launched by Thales was unveiled in a virtual press conference on Tuesday July 6th, the aim being to have a certified light UAS by the end of 2023 that will cope with the new European SC-LUAS (Special Condition – Light Unmanned Aircraft Systems) regulations. The company announced its programme after the half-scale model of the future system successfully carried out its maiden flight, which exact date was not unveiled.

The new programme was presented by Marc Duval-Destin, Thales Vice.President for Strategy, Product Policy and Innovation for Flight Avonics business, and by Emanuel Guyonnet, the company Drone Programme Director, Flight Avionics.

While the main driver is the development of a light UAV system capable to fly in civil airspace comes definitely from the intention to widen the market of drones commercial use, thanks o a much greater degree of freedom, which would apply also to government applications, as it will inherently allow flying over populated areas. While military developments are foreseen, “it is designed firstly to be a safe and simple system for government and private usage, and will then be adapted for military missions, but no decision has been made to date,” the two speakers said, the fact that the programme is carried out in cooperation with the AID (Agence de l’ Innovation de Défense), the French defence innovation agency created in 2018, shows well an interest from the French military. In fact many of the solutions that are being developed to increase reliability, which means safety, allow improving the capability to prosecute a mission even after two major failures. On the other hand safety might become an issue also in military operations; more than one wondered if it was ethic to fly Phoenix UAVs over Kosovo in the early 2000, 12 such systems crashing during operations, some of them victim of enemy fire but many due to technical failures. Should one of them have fallen over a populated area causing casualties, the collateral damage issue would have been raised, and operating over urban areas is sometime a must in asymmetric warfare, as well as when military assets are used to work alongside homeland security forces. Not to mention training issues in country.

Back to the UAS 100 programme, the airframe as well as control laws were designed by Thales in cooperation with Issoire Aviation, the company based in central France that was the first in the world to certify an all carbon aircraft. The team is completed by Hionos, a Paris-based start-up specialised in autopilots for drones.

The final product will be a platform of less than 100 kg with an over 100 km range (hence the UAS 100 name), a 5.4 meters wingspan and a 10 kg multiple payload capacity; according to speakers the latter will not be fitted according to the classic logic used on military UAVs, no more details being provided.

The only photo available of the half-scale prototype doesn’t allow to see many details; the aircraft has a triple body fuselage, the two side ones featuring vertical rudders while the central one seems fitted with a vertical fixed fin. At the front the central element of the fuselage features a vertical sponson carrying a pod that might well host the internal combustion engine ensuring battery reloading that provides an increased endurance, up to 5 hours in the final model according to data provided by Thales, but should also drive the central propeller; not many technical details were unveiled, but no air intakes and exhausts are visible in other parts of the fuselage, although such a position might not be the ideal one for centre of gravity issues. The two lateral propellers are mounted on spikes fitted close to the rear of the wing, and are clearly driven by electric motors. According to speakers the layout allows very short take-off runs “much less than a football field”, while once aloft the power will be reduced to save energy and increase endurance. The availability of multiple motors is also increasing system safety, the aircraft being also able to fly all-electric, allowing acoustic signature reduction, while the traction available will allow flying in strong winds, no data being provided as flight trials have still to explore the flight envelope. An all-electric version might also be developed, but will have a reduced endurance. Limiting the environmental impact was one of the design features, the UAS 100 wings being fitted with winglets to improve their efficiency. Although no details were provided, the choice of Issoire Aviation as a partner makes it safe to say that the airframe should be mainly made of carbonfibre elements.

Long range UAVs will definitely not limit their operational altitude below the 150 meters above ground, the maximum height currently allowed for non-certified systems, the UAS 100 being designed to fly up to FL 100, which means 10,000 ft or over 3,000 meters. Communications will be ensured by direct radio link when operating within line of sight, SATCOM for beyond line of sight operations, and commercial networks such as 4G and 5G, “the system automatically switching to the best communication channel, which further adds to safety,” Thales representatives stated. The UAS 100 will of course be fitted with recovery features in case of loss of contact with the control station, however it was clearly said that “it is not a remotely piloted vehicle, as we are entering a wholly new era in the UAS world so after take off the aircraft will operate autonomously, the operator only acting as supervisor.” This might allow a single operator to b responsible for multiple aircraft, but no answer was given on potential numbers.

A key issue for flying in the civil airspace is the visibility of the UAS from ATC sensors and other aircraft, as well as its own capacity to sense the air traffic and avoid it. Thales is currently working on that issue, the initial flights being carried out with the FLARM cooperative anti-collision system, however opening the flight envelope will require additional sense and avoid systems to be installed and tested, the aim being to demonstrate the required level of insurance both in cooperative and non-cooperative scenarios. “We are only at the beginning of the story,” the speakers said, this being the second step in their development roadmap.

The roadmap saw the first step, the flight of the half-scale model, in 2021, which happened successfully. This will undergo flight tests and will incorporate increased flight autonomy features, this development being carried out in parallel with that of the full-scale system, which first flight is planned for 2022. Leveraging the autonomy building blocks tested on the smaller aircraft, this should be quickly brought up to a level in order to allow full certification by late 2023. Will the full-scale prototype be the final configuration of the UAS 100? This is apparently not sure, the speakers stating that “we might find an optimisation between the half-scale and the full-scale aircraft, to provide the market with a light, cheap and easy to fly system.”

The UAS 100 will be an ITAR-free product and beside the usual selling schemes Thales is ready to provide it as a service, with contracts based on missions or flight hours. According to estimates provided by Thales over 100 000 long-range UAV will fly worldwide in 2030, which led the company decision to launch the UAS 100 programme to capture part of that lucrative market.

The UAS 100 is designed to fly in Sail V and Sail VI category (high risk) according to EASA (EU Aviation Safety Agency) SORA (Specific Operating Risk Assessment), this estimate being based mainly on the population density, mass and speed of the drone. Regulations are being gradually implemented, the Thales programme following closely those evolutions to be among the first, if not the first UAS of its category to be fully qualified for operating in the civil airspace.

The UAS 100 will be demonstrated at the UAV Show that will take place in Bordeaux on 19-21 October 2021, COVID permitting, tests and demonstrations being planned in the last day of the event. As for military applications we must wait and see.

The New Norcia ground station photo is courtesy of ESA.

This new-generation, 35 meter antenna will enable ESA to increase its communications capacity in X-, K- and Ka-bands and to round out this network of antennas for tracking spacecraft and collecting science data from solar system missions, such as Exomars TGO, currently on-orbit around the Red Planet, and BepiColombo, en route for Mercury, as well as upcoming missions that include the Euclid astronomical observatory or the Juice mission to Jupiter, both set to launch in 2022.

New Norcia is part of ESA’s ESTRACK global network of ground stations. Thales Alenia Space is the consortium partner in charge of overall performance of the antenna, set for commissioning in 2024. The company will also be responsible for the antenna’s systems engineering, the overall system and equipment (RF, power, cooling, and so on).

The construction of this deep space antenna marks a first for Thales Alenia Space. The challenge is to pick up very faint signals and then boost them considerably for transmission from and to objects in deep space, to enable reception of science data and uploading of commands to space probes. Thales Alenia Space will be relying on Thales’ expertise in Australia to finalize the terms of the civil engineering contract and oversee its execution, and on lessons learned by Telespazio, in charge of the maintenance of one of the three ESA antennas for deep space communications in Malargue, Argentina.

The high-performance New Norcia ground station comprises an antenna weighing more than 600 metric tons, employing cutting-edge technologies including 20-kW high-power amplifiers (HPA) and low-noise amplifiers (LNA) cryogenically cooled to –260 C. It is aiming for optical efficiency of more than 90% and pointing precision of 6 millidegrees in all weather conditions.

“We’re extremely proud to have been selected by ESA for this project, which marks a new challenge for Thales Alenia Space,” noted Marc-Henri Serre, Thales Alenia Space Executive Vice-President, Telecommunications. “Building a consortium with a strong European footprint to attain excellence in the cutting-edge field of deep space antennas was key to winning this contract. With this first success for the E-DSA2 consortium, we can look forward to positioning this alliance for the long term in the institutional market and beyond.”

The deeper mysteries of Venus soon revealed

Cannes, July 1st, 2021 – Following the recent selection by the European Space Agency (ESA)’s Science Programme Committee of EnVision as the fifth Medium-class mission in the Agency’s Cosmic Vision plan, Thales Alenia Space, the joint company between Thales (67%) and Leonardo (33%), will pursue the B1 study phase for the Venus orbiter. This orbiter is dedicated to providing a holistic view of the planet from its inner core to upper atmosphere to determine how and why Venus and Earth evolved so differently. EnVision will complement two other Venus missions announced by NASA as part of its Discovery program to explore the Solar System: the descent probe DAVINCI+ and the orbiter VERITAS, slated for launch towards the end of the decade.

Venus is the planet closest to Earth and its characteristics are similar in terms of size, gravity field and overall composition and is located at the edge of the Solar System’s habitable zone. When they first formed, these two planets were undoubtedly alike. But while the Earth offers a very temperate climate, the surface temperature on Venus now exceeds 460°C and its atmosphere, bereft of water, is mainly composed of carbon dioxide (96%), which provides an atmospheric pressure on the surface of 92 bar, that is almost hundred times denser than on Earth ! High abundance of corrosive sulfur-bearing gases indicates high level of current volcanic activity. The absence of plate tectonics and internal magnetic field also makes Venus drastically different from our home planet.

One of the most intriguing questions in planetary science is why our immediate neighbor evolved so differently and underwent such a spectacular climate change and whether the planet is still active today. ESA’s EnVision mission aims to provide a comprehensive view of the planet, from its inner core to its upper atmosphere, to help explain why Venus and the Earth took such divergent paths in their evolution.

Thales Alenia Space, one of the two prime contractors selected for this study phase will work with OHB as main partner to design the spacecraft that will orbit Venus. The mission’s cost, development and technical feasibility being recently completed, this new phase which will kick off in July 2021 for a period of 30 months, will consolidate the design of the mission and spacecraft and prepare its implementation.

The orbiter will carry five instruments provided by the ESA Member States and NASA to understand how the surface and atmosphere of Venus evolved over billions of years and whether the planet is still active today. The European payload includes a sounder to investigate subsurface structure and three spectrometers to study the atmosphere and analyze the surface. A synthetic aperture radar from NASA will acquire images of the surface and map its properties. The radio-science experiment will determine the planet’s gravity field more accurately. These instruments will be working together to more completely characterize the planet, thus offering an overall view of Venus and its associated processes.

“We’re very proud to be on board this very innovative and exciting new ESA mission, which will help us pierce the mysteries of Venus’s geological and climatic evolution,” said Bertrand Denis, VP Domain Observation and Science France at Thales Alenia Space. “Furthermore, this mission clearly shows the key role played by Europe and Thales Alenia Space in carrying out scientific investigations of our Solar System.”

Venus, Mars, Mercury, Saturn, the Sun, comets, exoplanets, the dark universe… and soon, a return to the Moon! Thales Alenia Space has always been a key partner in international space exploration missions, a role that is clearly reflected in its tagline, “Space for life”. In addition to its role in the exploration of the Solar System, the company also supplied fully half of the International Space Station’s pressurized volume, as well as pressurized modules for resupply vessels. In 2020, ESA chose Thales Alenia Space to supply the two main European modules for the Lunar space station, a key part of NASA’s Artemis program, designed to return astronauts to the Moon by 2024.

Already a winner of three Oscars (Scientific & Technical Award), Angénieux is Thales’ high-precision optics brand, spotlighting the Group’s expertise in this demanding area. Angénieux has earned global renown as a supplier of the sophisticated lenses used to shoot movies.

The company has been an official partner of the Cannes Film Festival since 2013 and it will once again be at the Palais des Festivals in Cannes this summer. While Angénieux has long provided state-of-the-art equipment to cinematographers from around the world, it’s equally well known for its historic achievements in another fantastic universe, namely space!

On July 20, 1969, Angénieux took part in one of humanity’s most extraordinary achievements, allowing hundreds of millions of people to see the historic moment when humans first set foot on the Moon.

Back in 1964, the Ranger 7 spacecraft took the first photos of the Moon with Angénieux optics – and these optics were once again chosen by NASA to shoot the first human landing on the Moon, during the incredible Apollo 11 mission. Some of the most memorable images were of the Lunar Module approaching the surface.

From the Earth to the Moon, and all around it!

Thales played a role in this exceptional moment 52 years ago, but it’s also heavily involved in today’s planned missions to once again explore the Moon. In just a few short years, humans will once again be heading to the Moon, in preparation for longer voyages into deep space. In particular, the Moon will be used as a waystation for crewed missions for explore the planet Mars. That’s the aim of NASA’s Artemis program, designed to send astronauts back to the Moon by 2024.

Thales Alenia Space has capitalized on its expertise in orbital infrastructures – it supplied 50% of the International Space Station’s habitable volume – to be chosen for the Lunar Gateway, the future space station orbiting the Moon. Thales Alenia Space will provide three key modules for this station, including the ESPRIT communications and refueling module, built in Cannes for the European Space Agency (ESA).

Optics are also used on various Earth observation satellites built in whole or in part by Thales Alenia Space, which is headquartered in Cannes. This plant has earned a global reputation for its manufacture, assembly, integration and testing of famous spacecraft, such as the three generations of Europe’s Meteosat geostationary weather satellites and the Trace Gas Orbiter from the first ExoMars mission, still circling the Red Plant. Cannes has also developed unrivaled expertise in the production of high and very-high resolution optical instruments. This all started back in 1995 with the launch of Helios-1A, the French intelligence satellite that carried an optical instrument offering unprecedented precision. Thales Alenia Space would subsequently become the exclusive supplier of high and very-high resolution optical payloads for France’s surveillance satellites, Helios, Pleiades and CSO. For example, the CSO family features the most powerful space camera ever built in Europe.

From Angénieux headquarters in Saint-Héand to Cannes and from Cannes to the Moon, the company’s zoom lenses are favored by demanding cinematographers worldwide. And Angénieux continues to revolutionize the movie industry by delivering major innovations, such as the Optimo Ultra 12x zoom lens and its recently introduced Optimo Prime line of full frame lenses.

• Unique in Spain, this cutting-edge facility confirms Thales Alenia Space development strategy in Europe and further enhances the role of Spain as key actor in the space sector

• The brand new clean room will host the SPAINSAT NG Communications Module, Spain’s new generation of governmental satellites

• Inaugurated in the presence of Pedro Duque, Spanish Minister of Science and Innovation

Madrid, 8 July 2021 - Thales Alenia Space, joint venture between Thales (67%) and Leonardo (33%), inaugurated today its new satellite integration clean room in Tres Cantos (Madrid); with the presence of the Minister of Science and Innovation of Spain, Pedro Duque and of high representatives of the Spanish institutions and Industry. This unique cutting-edge facility represents an important step forward in the company’s development strategy in Europe and a qualitative leap in the capacities of the space industry in Spain for the assembly, integration and tests (AIT) of large space systems, something within the reach of only a few space powers worldwide.

“This brand new clean room is the sign of Thales Alenia Space's determination to develop its activities in Spain, in line with the company’s global development strategy to meet the evolving needs of its customers and of the space market ”, declared Hervé Derrey, President and CEO of Thales Alenia Space.

The new clean room will add more than 600 m2 clean area to the existing 2000 m2 clean area at the site of Thales Alenia Space in Tres Cantos. With a free height of 12.5 meters in the inside (20 meters high building), it is equipped with bridge cranes with lifting capacity up to 12 tons, allowing the integration of large satellites, payloads and instruments for all types of space missions, spanning telecommunications, navigation, Earth observation and science. The construction of this facility began in July 2019 and did not cease despite the difficult conditions caused by Covid-19 .

“This new facility will allow us to carry out in Spain activities of high added value with all the implications that it has regarding the creation of high quality employment and the strengthening of the space ecosystem in Spain. The new capabilities will boost the competitiveness of our national space industry”, added Alfonso Richart, COO of Thales Alenia Space in Spain.

This building will enable to carry out high-scale activities such as the integration in a few months of the Communications Module of SPAINSAT NG, Spain’s new generation governmental satellites owned and operated by Hisdesat. The Communications Module, which houses the satellite’s communications payloads, is a 6-meter high structure weighing nearly two tons, equipped with hundreds of units, that will become the largest satellite system ever integrated in Spain to date.

Thales Alenia Space leads in Spain the development of the communications payloads in UHF and military-Ka bands for both satellites. This is the first time that Spanish industry leads the construction of satellite communications payloads, an important milestone in scope and complexity.

Minister Pedro Duque has pointed out that “space is a sector that has been offering solutions and well-being to our society for many decades, but its relevance will grow in the coming years, in part, due to the acceleration of some processes caused by the pandemic. Thales Alenia Space's investment in our country and the creation of a considerable number of quality jobs are already tangible benefits of this commitment to the future that represents the space sector”. The minister recalled the Government's commitment to the space sector and was convinced that ""it will serve to create wealth and employment and sustain our welfare state, because generating wealth with scientific discoveries and innovation must be part of our commitment to society.""

Center of Excellence in Spain

In its 32 years of activities in Spain, Thales Alenia Space has already participated in 600 satellites, space probes and space vehicles for space agencies and satellite operators around the world, for which it has manufactured more than 4,000 equipment and systems at its site in Tres Cantos, that accumulate more than 200 million hours of operation in orbit.

Thales Alenia Space in Spain is a specialist in satellite communications systems with solid heritage in TT&C and data transmission systems for all types of space missions and orbits, including missions in low Earth orbit (Sentinel 1-2-3, FLEX, etc.), geostationary orbit (GEO-KOMPSAT-2, MTG), lunar orbit (Smart-1, KPLO, ESPRIT), missions to the Moon’s surface (VIPER, NOVA-C, PRIME-1), science missions in orbit around the L2 Lagrange point (Herschel, Planck, Euclid, WFIRST, PLATO) and missions to asteroids (HERA). The company makes another key step up in the value chain with the inauguration of the satellite integration clean room, as integrator of large space systems.

More recently, Thales Alenia Space was selected by ESA and the European Commission to play a major role in the two European emblematic programs Copernicus expansion and Galileo Second Generation as prime contractor. In this frame, Thales Alenia Space in Spain is strongly involved by providing key equipment and systems for the six new Copernicus missions as well as the communications and several critical technologies of the six new Galileo satellites.

The development of Thales Alenia Space in Spain is reflected in the creation of highly qualified jobs, with an increase of more than 20% in its workforce in this country in the last 12 months, despite the pandemic.

Thales Australia and the WSU ICNS, in collaboration with Thales’s subsidiary and international Joint Venture, Thales Alenia Space, will use the grant to leverage the European Robotic Orbital Support Services (EROSS+) program1, to integrate and test the Neuromorphic Event Based Vision Sensor (EBVS) capability with Thales’s Spacecraft and Planetary Imaging by Camera Model (SPICAM), to examine the feasibility of neuromorphic sensors for potential application in complex in-orbit processes including spacecraft docking, refueling and payload transfer or replacement.

The project will focus on the performance gains achieved using Event Based Vision Sensor technology over existing sensors in support of orbital support service activities in high contrast visual environments. It will also determine performance gains for combined use of EBVS and existing sensors through sensor fusion.

The project supports the commitments made by Thales Australia’s Strategic Statement of Intent signed with the Australian Space Agency in December 2019, and is indicative of potential future export opportunities available to Australian businesses and research institutions through Thales’s global supply chain.

“Thales Australia is no stranger to the creation of sovereign capabilities in Australia. We have a long history of developing new and high-quality capabilities in partnership with local Research Institutions and our SME supply partners with many now exporting around the world. We are proud to be working with Western Sydney University’s neuromorphic laboratory on this unique and sovereign sensor paradigm, which has performance characteristics that exceed traditional optic sensor technology, and we are excited about its potential application in NASA’s Moon to Mars Missions.” Matt Dawson, Director Space, Thales Australia and New Zealand

“The opportunity to work with Thales to develop a new type of space-based capability is exactly the type of research we are focused on. We are looking to demonstrate the utility and efficiency of Neuromorphic systems while advancing our knowledge and understanding of field. This project will continue our broadening partnership with Thales and aims to deliver enduring impact in the emerging field of space based operations. The collaboration will enhance the skills and capabilities of both organisations and enrich the local ecosystem with new understanding of how to operate in the challenging space environment.

Cygnus #16 en route to ISS - Thales,"Thu, 29 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi93b3JsZHdpZGUvc3BhY2UvbmV3cy9jeWdudXMtMTYtcm91dGUtaXNz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The latest Cygnus cargo vessel is safely on its way to the International Space Station, and in about two days, it will reach astronauts waiting for fresh supplies, new science experiments and personal items.

For the NG-16 mission, the Cygnus spacecraft will deliver approximately 3,700 kg (8,200 lb) of cargo to the ISS. Named in honor of the late Ellison Onizuka, the first Asian-American astronaut, the S.S. Ellison Onizuka was launched into orbit on August 10 by an Antares 230+ rocket from Virginia Space’s Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport (MARS) Pad 0A on Wallops Island, VA.

Cygnus comprises two main elements: a Service Module, built by Northrop Grumman, and an enhanced Pressurized Cargo Module (PCM), developed and built by Thales Alenia Space since the start of the program. The first contract in 2009 was for delivery of nine PCM modules, then a second contract in 2016 called for a further nine. Since late 2015, the enhanced Cygnus configuration features a more efficient design and can accommodate more payload weight (over 3,500 kg) and volume. Sixteen operational PCMs plus a demo module have been launched to date, four in the original version and eleven in the enhanced configuration.

Cygnus missions have been critical for the safe resupply of the ISS since 2013. The spacecraft is a lifeline designed to transport fundamental cargo, including oxygen, water, crew supplies, science experiments and spare parts. They contributed to delivering critical science experiments to the space station, significantly increasing the ability to conduct new investigations in 0 gravity and paving the way to the next great leap in exploration, including future manned missions to the Moon and eventually to Mars.

3D printing in space, using a material simulating rock and soil found on the surfaces of planetary bodies, such as the Moon, investigation to evaluate whether engineered human muscle cells cultured in microgravity are a valid model for studying muscle loss, demonstrations of the importance of fluid physics technologies for future missions to the Moon and Mars, testing affordable thermal protection system or anti-radiation jackets… are some key examples of experiments implemented thanks to Cygnus deliveries.

Building on the technological heritage of the Cygnus modules, Northrop Grumman and Thales Alenia Space have the capabilities to deliver other deep-space habitats, such as the Habitation and Logistics Outpost (HALO), one of the first two elements of the Lunar Gateway, the future human outpost in lunar orbit and one of the pillars of NASA’s Artemis program. Our company is leveraging its unique legacy in orbital infrastructure, space exploration and space transportation systems to become a leading industrial partner for the Lunar Gateway and Axiom space stations.

Thales Announces Drone Range of 62 Miles - For Construction Pros,"Fri, 09 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmNvbnN0cnVjdGlvbnByb3MuY29tL2NvbnN0cnVjdGlvbi10ZWNobm9sb2d5L25ld3MvMjE1NTE0OTgvdGhhbGVzLWFubm91bmNlcy1kcm9uZS1yYW5nZS1vZi02Mi1taWxlc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"When it comes to drone technology, it's all about reaching the point where drones can fly beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS). As drone technology advances, companies are increasingly making announcements like this most recent one from drone maker France-based Thales, which just completed the first flight of a half-scale prototype of its UAS 100 long-range unmanned air system.

In construction, this is important because it brings the industry one step closer to an increased use of drones on job sites, to collect data, take aerial photos, monitor project progress and inspect structural integrity of buildings and infrastructure. To make drones more of a reality on job sites, drone technology needs to advance, especially in terms of how far drones can fly and how much weight they can carry, among other factors.

Developed in partnership with Issoire Aviation and Hionos, and with the support of the French Ministry of the Armed Forces via the Defence Innovation Agency (AID), the Thales UAS100 will help meet demand for more cost-effective drone missions with a lower environmental impact.

Watch a Thales drone test flight:

Unmanned air systems (UAS) have significant commercial potential, with hundreds of thousands of drones due to enter service over the next 10 years. As a result, airspace management and the aerospace ecosystem will become considerably more complex, creating new safety and security challenges and forcing civil aviation authorities to tighten their regulations.

To meet these challenges, Thales is proposing a long-range, long-endurance UAS developed with the support of the AID and capable of meeting future flight safety, security and certification requirements.

UAS100 will meet mission requirements while operating in full compliance with general aviation regulations, according to Thales. Its flight avionics combine the certified levels of flight safety and security of Thales's technology for the aerospace sector with the low weight and compact design needed for integration on board a light UAV.

Thales



Longer Range and More Secure

The UAS 100 system will offer range capabilities in excess of 62.1 mi./100 km and its jam-resistant navigation system will ensure safe operation even in dense or cluttered electromagnetic environments.

The drone is powered by two electric motors as well as an internal combustion engine, for the discretion needed to accomplish its missions and operate over populated areas, while ensuring the necessary endurance and resilience to failure.

With a level of system redundancy and high security specifications, the Thales drone is expected to natively meet the requirements of the new European SC-LUAS (Special Condition - Light Unmanned Aircraft Systems) regulations.

The system will reduce operating costs and improve the environmental footprint of drones, opening up new opportunities for inspection and surveillance operations and expanding the capabilities of government services and the armed forces.

The innovation has been developed in close partnership between Thales, Issoire Aviation and Hionos. Issoire Aviation, pioneer of the all-carbon aircraft, has provided unique know-how in aerostructure design and manufacturing, while Hionos has made an contribution to the project with its autopilot software solutions for drones."
Thales Test Tank Rescue Mission - Thales,"Thu, 15 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi9jb3VudHJpZXMtYXNpYS9hdXN0cmFsaWEvbmV3cy90aGFsZXMtdGVzdC10YW5rLXJlc2N1ZS1taXNzaW9u0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It’s a scenario many Aussies are used to: dropping something in the pool and having to do a quick duck dive to pick it up; often with accompanying cheers from your relatives/mates. Now, imagine if something was sitting on the bottom of a 30-foot pool – how would you get it? You aren’t going to be able to take a couple of deep breaths and hope for the best. This exact scenario presented itself to our team at Rydalmere when they needed to retrieve an item (not a Zooper Dooper) from the bottom of our Test Tank.

One of the many benefits of working at Rydalmere, in amongst world-leading experts in the field of sonar and acoustics, is that we often have things on hand the average workplace does not. In this instance, we were able to utilise a few of our, you know, standard office items including a Remote Operated Underwater Vehicle (ROV) and, not as interesting but a little surprising, a dustpan.

This ROV wasn’t just any ROV, it’s one a few of our team are working on with students from the University of Technology Sydney (UTS). The software on board is a combination of open source work, code produced by Thales and code produced by UTS students through the Industry Studio collaboration Thales has with UTS Engineering and IT Faculty.

The dustpan was just a typical dustpan, but before long it would have its moment to shine/scoop.

Here’s a first-hand account of the events that unfolded from one of our engineers Aaron Di Noia; who just so happens to be leading the project with UTS.

During the rescue mission

Once we were in the Acoustic Test Tank we performed our pre-dive checks and then we were ready to dive! We deployed the ROV through the floor and lowered it into the water using rope & its tether.

Looking at the display it felt like we exploring a hidden underground cave or some kind of secret underwater base; a very different perspective of the Test Tank, that’s for sure! The plan was to push the item to the wall edge before trying to scoop it up. Once we arrived and hit the bottom floor for the first time, a wave of dust came off the pool bottom and a round of laughs went around the room – that’s when we begun to truly understand just how much dust was settled at the bottom. As we conducted the operation, dust continued to fly up and obscure our vision; at times the dust cloud was too thick for us to see anything at all and we’d have to drive the ROV upwards out of the cloud in order to regain our bearings. It was a great experience that helped us better understand what it would be like to be an ROV operator working with sandy environments and minimal visibility out in the ocean.

Eventually we were able to adjust our eyes to the murky waters and managed to push the item over to a wall and, after a few attempts and about 20 minutes, it was scooped into the dustpan.

*This photo was taken prior to social distancing and mask requirements

Once back at the surface, a boat pole was used to fish out the item and retrieve it out of the pool- success! There were smiles and happy faces all around, and there was a great sense of achievement among the team in being able to utilise the ROV for a real-life rescue mission.

Now the ROV is headed over to UTS for some collaboration work with undergraduate engineering students as part of the Industry Studio Project. Here the students are working on implementing some autonomous behaviour onto the vehicle so that it can think, move and react to the world around itself without human assistance. This forms part of their final demonstration for the project for Autumn Semester 2021 and will become foundations for future students to continue building upon into Spring and beyond. We’re excited that we can play a role in enriching their university experience and give them a taste of what a career in Engineering could look like."

Australia's Sovereign Guided Weapons Heritage - Thales,"Mon, 19 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi9hdXN0cmFsaWEvbmV3cy9hdXN0cmFsaWFzLXNvdmVyZWlnbi1ndWlkZWQtd2VhcG9ucy1oZXJpdGFnZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Corry Roberts, Vice President Land, Thales Australia & New Zealand

There has been much made of the Prime Minister’s announcement in late March of the creation of an Australian Sovereign Guided Weapons Manufacturing Enterprise. And rightly so. This is a big ambition for the nation and big news for defence industry. Most importantly it is more achievable than most people think and that’s because the design, development and manufacture of Guided Munitions in Australia is not an industrial capability in its infancy. Australia has 70 years of demonstrated achievement in world class collaborative work by scientists, industry (including local SMEs), and Academia in developing and manufacturing a tried and tested guided weapons capability.

If we look back to the 1950s and 60s, Australian rocket motors and booster solutions were already considered to be top-of-class. They were utilised to play significant roles in the push for both defence and commercial satellite launches into orbit. To put this into perspective, Australia was one of the first nations globally to build and launch a satellite into Space from its own soil.

At the same time and well into the 1970s and early 80s Australia was producing a range of guided missiles including the MALKARA wire-guided missile and then the IKARA ship-borne long-range anti-submarine guided weapon. The IKARA proved to be such an effective guided missile it was adopted by the Royal Navy, the Royal New Zealand Navy and the Brazilian Navy. During this period, the KALKARA Unmanned Aerial Target also came into service. Australian made rocket motors propelled this advanced guided aerial target which was capable of operating at 40,000 feet.

During the 1980s and early 90s the Australian Government centralised its sovereign rocket motor production, guided weapons and energetics manufacturing capability into one facility in regional New South Wales where it still continues to operate under Thales Australia’s management. Since that time Thales has invested heavily in energetics research and development and forged strong, enduring relationships with organisations such as DST Group, other defence Primes, Academia and local Australian industry to produce some of the best guided weapons capability in the world.

During the 1990s and early 2000s the Kongsberg Penguin anti-ship missile, whilst originally a Norwegian design, had its warheads manufactured here in Australia. The production of these Penguin missiles was to support Kongsberg supplying the Sea Sprite helicopter, however, when the Sea Sprite program was cancelled the Australia made Penguin warheads were exported to six countries. Thales was fortunate to have recently celebrated the 22nd Anniversary of the Penguin missile production with a visit from the Norwegian Ambassador at our stand at the 2021 Land Forces Conference in Brisbane.

The 1990s and early 2000s also saw the production of rocket motors for another highly successful guided weapon – the Nulka Active Missile Decoy. Nulka, which is capable of hovering in place, took ship protection to an entirely new level and was commissioned by the Royal Australian Navy, the U.S. Navy and the Canadian Armed Forces in 1999. It saw its first action in 2003 during the Gulf War and quickly established itself as a ‘game changer’ in ship protection. Later, Australia would perform a Tech-Transfer to the United States for Nulka where it continues to be built. Here in Australia, BAE, as Prime for the Nulka missile system, continues to work with Thales to this day to manufacture Nulka at the facility. The Nulka program is one of Australia’s largest and most successful defence export products – exporting guided weapons to allied forces."

Dubbed the UAS 100, the prototype is designed to address the demand for more cost-effective drone operations with less environmental impact.

French company Thales has entered the drone game with its new autonomous aircraft. Built for infrastructure inspection, coastal surveillance, border surveillance, search-and-rescue, and military operations, the UAS100 is still in its prototype phase.The UAS 100 program was born from a collaboration between aircraft manufacturer Issoire Aviation, which designed and constructed the drone, and avionics software company Hionos, whose expertise contributed to implementing the autopilot software solutions.Combining Thales' approved standards of flight safety and security with the small weight and compact design, the aircraft is equipped with jam-resistant navigation technology that will ensure its safe operation even in case of electromagnetic interferences (EMI).According to the Les Ailes du Quebec , the UAS 100 is powered by two electric motors as well as an internal combustion engine and has a flight time of five hours. It also uses radio, 4G, satellite communication and can even function in areas where the signal is poor. The final version of the aircraft will be capable of carrying a payload of 10 kg (22 lbs) and offer a range of over 100 km (62 miles).Further testing will be carried out, with a full-scale model flying test expected to take place in 2022. Thales seeks to be certified by 2023 and fly outside urban areas with an operational altitude below 150 meters (492 ft) above ground.The system, which has received support from the French Ministry of the Armed Forces through the Defence Innovation Agency (AID), aims to reduce drone operating costs and improve their environmental impact while also providing new options for inspection and surveillance missions and enhancing government and military capabilities."
Magnificent 7 brackets head to space with Thales Alenia Space - Develop3D,"Fri, 09 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vZGV2ZWxvcDNkLmNvbS8zZC1wcmludGluZy90aGFsZXMtYWxlbmlhLXNwYWNlLW1hZ25pZmljZW50LTctYnJhY2tldHMtaGVhZC1mb3Itc3BhY2Uv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales Alenia Space has described the process behind a mission critical sub-system on its Spacebus NEO satellite, the Electrical THruster Mechanism (ETHM), which points the satellite propulsion to correctly position it in space.

Comprising of 7 brackets, four ETHMs are required per satellite, forming the chassis around the engines, performing as two axis gimbals holding the electrical propulsion unit, and enabling it to vector with smooth and steady movements.

Thales Alenia Space and 3D Systems have collaborated to put over 1,700 flightworthy parts in orbit as of 2021, and for the ETHM project, Thales Alenia Space once again partnered with the additive manufacturing experts’ Application Innovation Group (AIG) to combine several functions within a small design space while guaranteeing accurate dynamics.

The total dynamic volume allotted for the ETHM is 480 x 480 x 380mm, and includes rotary actuators, harness, tubing, and a holding mechanism.

3D Systems provided manufacturability and design feedback to help Thales Alenia Space achieve its performance objectives, optimising the strength-to-weight ratio while making adjustments for areas of heat concentration, helping to protect functional components from thermal damage.

By using 3D printing to manufacture the system, Thales Alenia Space triggered an expansion of positive impacts: light-weighting improved thrust efficiency beyond what conventional manufacturing would allow, which in turn improved fuel efficiency, resulting in lower costs and new opportunities for technical innovation elsewhere.

“Every feature is more or less conventional, but putting them together in a single compact and competitive mechanism is really a challenge,” said ETHM product manager Gilles Lubrano.

Parts were built using 3D Systems’ DMP Flex 350 metal 3D printers in LaserForm Ti6Al4V grade 23 titanium material, with 3D Systems’ experience working with titanium helping balance the complexity and strength of the parts, as well as reducing the number of iterations needed through tools like 3D Systems’ 3DXpert simulation module

Achieving the acute accuracy needed was an extra challenge, needing a full manufacturing workflow comprising of post-processes CNC-finishing and tomography inspection to guarantee product and process repeatability in an AS9100 controlled environment.

3D Systems application engineers helped provided guidance on the level and sequencing of quality controls for risk mitigation to help Thales Alenia Space ensure a thorough, quality-oriented, and cost-efficient manufacturing flow – achieving the 0.1-degree pointing accuracy required in which some parts have as many as 249 measurement points taken via CMM that must be in spec.

Prior to transitioning production to Thales’ production facility in Morocco, 3D Systems helped organise and coordinate a best-in-class supply chain to fulfil series production and produced more than 70 parts at its Customer Innovation Center in Belgium, which is part of 3D Systems’ AIG."

Thales Alenia Space, a European aerospace manufacturer, will develop the two pressurized modules of the Axiom Space Station. The two elements, which are scheduled to launch in 2024 and 2025, will dock to the International Space Station before eventually detaching and operating as a fully independent, commercial station.

The two companies announced the signing of the final contract, valued at €110 million ($130 million), on Thursday. Each module will be able to accommodate four people. Thales will also be designing the micrometeoroid and debris protection system for each module.

The modules are still in their design phase, Thales Alenia said. The company recently completed development of the first module’s four radial bulkheads at its facility in Turin, Italy. The bulkheads, once connected, will form a cylinder. That structure will attach to the common berth mechanisms, parts of the module that will connect to the ISS and hatches.

The two modules have a long road ahead of them. Thales Alenia, a joint venture between French company Thales Group and Italian conglomerate Leonardo, will begin welding on the first module this September through to next year. That module will be sent to Axiom’s Texas facilities in July 2023, where Axiom will then integrate the core systems and prepare it for launch in 2024.

NASA tapped Axiom to build the first commercial living quarters for the ISS in January 2020. Once the ISS is decommissioned, Axiom’s station will detach and function as a commercial center for future missions and scientific experiments. It’s a major part of NASA’s plans to encourage the growth of the burgeoning low Earth orbit economy and the buildout of other private orbital labs and commercial facilities.

Axiom will also operate the first fully private mission to the ISS, scheduled for January 2022. Axiom Mission 1 will send four private astronauts to space onboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon, for an eight-day mission."

Thales to provide new avionics equipment for Dassault Aviation Rafale - EDR Magazine,"Fri, 23 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVkcm1hZ2F6aW5lLmV1L3RoYWxlcy10by1wcm92aWRlLW5ldy1hdmlvbmljcy1lcXVpcG1lbnQtZm9yLWRhc3NhdWx0LWF2aWF0aW9uLXJhZmFsZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"22 July 2021 – Thales has been awarded the contract to supply Scorpion® helmet-mounted sight and display systems and digital multi-function displays for all the Dassault Aviation Rafale aircraft in service with the French Air and Space Force and the French Navy.

From reconnaissance to air defence and precision strike missions, the Rafale has helped ensure the success of countless military operations. But future aircrews will have to analyse more data in less time on combat missions carried out in increasingly complex environments. Coupled with the aircraft’s weapon systems, the Scorpion® helmet-mounted sight and display enhances tactical situational awareness and enables crews to respond more quickly and with greater agility to a whole range of threats. Its progressive rollout on the Rafale F4 standard will be a decisive advantage in ensuring the success of airborne missions and protecting populations.

The helmet-mounted display symbology brings together information from the aircraft’s onboard sensors to help pilots perform their missions even in the most challenging situations. It creates a continuum between the cockpit and the outside world to radically improve awareness of the tactical situation. Coupled with the weapon system, the display can be used to designate and track targets anywhere in the crew’s field of view in daylight and at night.

Scorpion® delivers all of these capability enhancements in addition to the protection and survivability functions of a conventional flight helmet. It is optimised for weight and balance to maximise pilot comfort and mission effectiveness.

The 400 digital multi-function displays on order will replace the lateral displays on France’s in-service Rafale aircraft, which are primarily used to inform the pilot about the status of the aircraft’s systems and provide imagery from its onboard sensors. The new equipment offers a larger display area, an improved touchscreen interface and greater processing power.

“When the success of a mission is decided in a fraction of a second, aircrews must be able to understand the tactical environment quickly and interact intuitively with the aircraft’s systems. We are delighted to have this opportunity to provide future Rafale F4 crews with an operational advantage that will be critical to the success of their missions, thanks to latest-generation equipment offering advanced display capabilities and enhanced interaction with the weapon systems.” Jean-Paul Ebanga, Vice President, Flight Avionics, Thales.

On-board HMS Queen Elizabeth – The story behind the tower of Air Power - Thales,"Fri, 09 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi91bml0ZWQta2luZ2RvbS9uZXdzL2JvYXJkLWhtcy1xdWVlbi1lbGl6YWJldGgtc3RvcnktYmVoaW5kLXRvd2VyLWFpci1wb3dlctIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"On-board HMS Queen Elizabeth – The story behind the tower of Air Power Queen Elizabeth Class (QEC) Share this article

One of the most enduring images of Carrier Strike Group 21 as the deployment sails across the globe is the iconic sight of HMS Queen Elizabeth’s unique twin island design.

Originally designed by Thales, the twin islands configuration means that the ship has a dedicated rear island to direct air operations, while the forward island and bridge controls the ship’s navigation. Both islands are designed to switch functionality if required, giving the carrier a key redundancy factor in an operational environment.

And the rear island is home to some truly innovative technology. Imagine the glass of a flying control tower so strong that it could withstand a strike equivalent to a direct hit from the blade tip of a Chinook helicopter. The tower looks down onto a hugely complex and demanding four acre flight deck where visibility and control are critical.

One of the biggest successes of the Aircraft Carrier Alliance was to bring together specialist companies and experts across industry to provide the most innovative solutions. And the story of the flying control tower incorporates supply chain partnering at its best.

As a founding member of the ACA, Thales (like its partners BAE, Babcock and the Ministry of Defence) had specific responsibilities within the alliance. One of these was the leadership of the platform design and aviation teams.

The glass flying control position (or FLYCO), fitted onto the rear island, is the operational centre controlling all air operations and is closely linked to the ship’s operations room, navigation bridge, flight deck and hangar operations centre. Thales also provides the cutting edge communications system to support the ship’s air operations.

As part of its aviation lead responsibilities, Thales led the procurement of the FLYCO from the Special Projects division of Ipswich-based key supplier Tex ATC Ltd, one of the world’s leading providers of military and civilian airfield visual control rooms.

It amazes me the depth of Engineering specialisation that exists in the UK. Tex ATC is a great example of the many niche companies that operate in the aviation sector, relatively unknown to the public but world renowned for their visual control room solutions. It was a pleasure to work alongside Tex ATC and the result of their efforts is very visible to anyone who has seen the aircraft carriers

Jim Bennett, QEC Programme Director

The FLYCO position provides the operators with an unparalleled operational working space, with three metre tall specially glazed panels, giving more than 290 degrees of view over the flight deck. The multi-layered glass – designed to provide solar and noise protection – is also incredibly strong.

Thales originally approached Tex ATC as an acknowledged specialist in delivering state-of-the-art flying control solutions. The company had previously designed and built the visual control room at RAF Coningsby in preparation for the arrival of the Typhoon aircraft.

Tex ATC’s experience in specialist control environments for military applications led to their delivery of visual control rooms at RAF Linton-on-Ouse, RAF Mildenhall, RNAS Yeovilton and Camp Bastion in Afghanistan. Around 100 people in the company and its supply chain were involved in the delivery of the FLYCO.

When Thales introduced its Sophie Ultima at Eurosatory 2018 its new product marked a quantum jump in targeting binoculars, as it packed four functions, target locator, tele-converter, day laser rangefinder and tactical binocular in a single package weighing less than 2.5 kg with batteries. At SOFINS, the Special Operations Forces Innovation Network Seminar organised by the Cercle de l’Arbalète at the Camp de Souges, north of Bordeaux, more details emerged on the Ultima, as well as on other Thales products in the same segment.

One of the key elements of the Ultima is the direct view optical channel fitted with a 7×35 lens featuring a 6° Field of View (FoV) that provides the best possible image to the operator. That said, for daylight a colour TV channel is also present, allowing recording of images and video and their transmission through the net. For night vision and decamouflaging the Ultima is fitted with a thermal channel; its cooled 640×512 sensor works in the Medium Wave InfraRed (3-5 µm) and is fitted with an optical zoom providing a FoV ranging from 2° to 20°. The focal plane array is of the HOT type, hence it works around 150 °K rather than 80 °K, which allows using a less powerful cooling machine, which also features a much greater reliability MTBF being in excess of 10,000 hours, the higher operating temperature also providing a reduced turn-on time of around 3 minutes. The thermal channel can be fused with the daylight channel in order to see hidden targets behind camouflage, playing between visible and IR. It is obviously fitted with a laser rangefinder with an 8 km range, a digital magnetic compass and an embedded C/A GPS. The Sophie Ultima is designed for specialised operators belonging to elite units, such as Special Forces and JTACs (Joint Terminal Attack Controllers). Compared to information gathered when the Ultima was launched, an other detail was unveiled; to ensure maximum protection against cyber attacks, a card with cyber protection elements has been included into the Ultima, the same path having been followed for its less sophisticated sister product, the Sophie Optima, virtually launched at Eurosatory 2020.

The Optima is aimed at conventional forces commanders at platoon level, and is therefore a more affordable system as it has to be acquired in greater numbers. The main difference is in the thermal channel, where the cooled MWIR sensor is replaced by an uncoooled HD sensor. Working in the 8-12 µm Long Wave InfraRed (LWIR) band, the Lynred 1280×720 matrix can fit into the Optima as it adopts last generation technologies allowing reducing the pitch down to 12 µm. The thermal channel has a dual FoV, 10° and 20°, while the day channel remains the same of the Ultima, ad well as the other targeting elements, the rangefinder having a range comparable to that of the Optima detection capability. According to Thales its uncooled product provides D/R/I ranges similar to previous generation cooled systems, and has proven to be compatible with the ATAK kit.

Last but not least another product that due to COVID was unveiled virtually, the Nellie binocular NVG, which provides an over 47° FoV, the key issue being that resolution is the same of a 40°FoV system. This peculiarity comes from the know-how of Angénieux, one of the Thales Group companies specialised in high quality optics cinema lenses. At less than 460 grams including batteries, the Nellie allows movements up to Night 4. Thales is currently launching the Nellie production, the system being not yet in service.

France’s DGA defence procurement agency in 2016 selected the Spy’Ranger 330 to meet the army’s mini reconnaissance drone system (SMDR) requirement. Paris ordered 35 systems, each including three air vehicles and ground control station equipment.

“Since December 2020, SMDR is combat-proven, being daily committed in operations in the toughest environment in Mali,” says Pascal Secretin, Thales’s product line director for imagers and sensors. “French army feedback recently highlighted that SMDR provided a capability jump versus the existing generation of mini-drones,” he adds.

With a 4m (13ft 1in) wingspan, up to 3h endurance and beyond line-of-sight operating range of 16.2nm (30km), the air vehicle weighs 15kg (33lb). It carries an electro-optical/infrared sensor, communications equipment and datalink, all produced by Thales.

Secretin attributes the type’s performance to “its unrivalled endurance in such tough environments, level of safety, range of operations and optronic day and night vision system”.

“SMDR is contributing every day and every night to mission success, and has already helped to save soldiers’ lives,” he says.

Thales has so far delivered 12 of the on-order SMDR systems, and has separately begun producing a larger Spy’Ranger 550 model for an undisclosed customer.

Meanwhile, eyeing a projected massive increase in the commercial use of UAVs over the coming years, Thales is promoting its TopSky air traffic management technology for use by drone operators.

The company and Operational Solutions also have announced entering into a teaming agreement to offer the latter’s FACE command and control software with Thales’s counter-UAV and unmanned traffic management technology.

Referring to the challenge of safely introducing such a high volume of UAVs alongside manned aircraft while also defending against their reckless or malicious use, Olivier Rea, Thales’s head of unmanned traffic management services, notes: “We have to do what aviation did in [its first] 100 years within 10 years.”

Thales in early July launched its UAS 100 product – a three-engined air vehicle optimised for flight in non-segregated airspace, after flying a half-scale model of the design. In addition to seeing broad commercial applications for the platform, it sees underpinning technologies as also applicable to the urban air mobility sector."

The French Air and Space Force and the French Navy are constantly upgrading their Rafales with new capabilities, with the most recent enhancement package, the F3-R standard, achieving operational status in March this year.

In addition to upgraded display systems, the new F4 standard will bring upgrades to the radar sensors, front sector optronics, and new weapons, including Mica NG air-to-air missiles and the 1,000-kg AASM air-to-ground modular weapon.

Thales innovation at the heart of robot wind farm team

Thales has been at the heart of one of the UK’s most ambitious robotics projects to prove the concept for robotic teams repairing offshore wind farms.

Led by the Offshore Renewable Energy (ORE) Catapult, the project paves the way for human-robot teams at wind farms within 10 years and wind farms designed for robotic maintenance by 2050 – a scenario that will be vital to the UK achieving its net-zero ambitions.

The two-year £4 million MIMRee project, funded by Innovate UK, has just concluded this month and the team – drawn from industry and academia - say they have successfully proven and demonstrated the core technologies at the heart of the concept.

Under the MIMRee scenario, a Thales autonomous mothership called Halcyon detects defects on wind turbine blades using an onboard camera inspection system that can scan the structure of blades while they are still turning at up to 200mph at their tips. The mothership then signals the blades to stop and launches a specially adapted drone that can transport a six-legged ‘blade crawler’ onto them to carry out the repairs.

Technology from Glasgow

The onboard Moving Wind Turbine Inspection System was developed out of Glasgow and incorporates world leading optronic technology currently used on submarines, tanks and armoured vehicles.

Barry Connor, Innovation & Technology Manager for Optronics, said: “Using Thales’ experience in stabilising systems in harsh environments, the moving wind turbine blade camera system is able to overcome wave motion and take stable, multiple images of the turning blades from 100 metres away and detect defects such as cracks, erosion or lightning strikes.”

“The system uses an electro optic system with AI processing to detect defects on the blades without interfering with wind turbine operations.“

“The stabilising capability and sensor technology used are derived from technological solutions to stop swaying imagery on optronic masts fitted to the Royal Navy Astute Class submarine or cameras fitted to the Challenger tank.”

Inspired by space missions

The project’s inspiration was drawn from space exploration, the epitome of an extreme environment. Professor Sara Bernardini, from Royal Holloway, The University of London, previously worked on mission planning for space operations with NASA, developed the AI system that controls how the MIMRee robots work together and communicate with humans.

She said: “Space provides a good example of humans working with robots. The current Mars exploration programme uses a team of robots - from helicopters to rovers - that can withstand extreme conditions. Astronauts are deployed selectively, where human ingenuity is most needed and risk to life is lowest. Likewise, future offshore work will be about humans being in the control room, developing and managing robotics and learning the skills required to work in teams with them.”

Dr Paul Gosling, Chief Technical Officer for Thales in the UK, said: “Increasingly we are seeing the technologies around robotics, autonomy sensing and AI providing solutions enabling activities involving harsh environments to be undertaken using unmanned systems.

“The MIMRee work is a perfect example of a UK team of experts using this evolving technology to benefit society and the environment in the future. I am delighted Thales was able to contribute its expertise in the form of the autonomous mothership, camera sensing and AI technology to make this activity a success.”

Other team members include Plant Integrity, Wootzano, University of Bristol, University of Manchester and The Royal College of Art."
Indra And Thales design the digital brain that will ensure the Spanish Army’s control of the battlefield - EDR Magazine,"Fri, 30 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lZHJtYWdhemluZS5ldS9pbmRyYS1hbmQtdGhhbGVzLWRlc2lnbi10aGUtZGlnaXRhbC1icmFpbi10aGF0LXdpbGwtZW5zdXJlLXRoZS1zcGFuaXNoLWFybXlzLWNvbnRyb2wtb2YtdGhlLWJhdHRsZWZpZWxk0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Madrid, 30 July 2021.- Indra, a leading global technology and consulting company and one of the main players in the global defence technology industry, and Thales, a global technology player in the defence, aerospace, security and digital identity and transport markets, have completed the development of the new release of the Battlefield Management System (BMS). It is the most advanced and effective tactical command and control solution on the market and with which the Spanish Army ensures superiority in deployments on the ground.

A unit of Spanish Army paratroopers on a fictitious international peacekeeping mission is deployed in to control a confirmed threat: hostile forces have taken positions in two neighbourhoods of an important city. All the air-launchable vehicles in which unit move are fitted with Indra and Thales’ BMS tactical command and control system that enables them to display the exact position of each member of the group in real time as they advance towards the objective. There are also infantry taking part in the exercise and they advance in silence, using text messaging for coordination without needing to use their voices. They each carry a ruggedized tablet connected to their tactical radios by Wi-Fi and communicates with the command chain and collaterals. The whole group simultaneously receives orders updated with the mission plan together with images and videos of the objective.

They hear shots and a soldier gets out of the vehicle to inspect the area. She marks the position of a sniper on the digital map on the screen to warn the other units of the hazard. At the same time, she receives an alert that another unit has detected a homemade bomb in a nearby street. The unit requests support to deactivate the explosives and the commanding officer orders a group of sappers to join the mission along with the rest of the deployed forces. Mission command follows the all the events in real time from the base and prepare supporting fire in automatic coordination with the artillery.

This is just one of the use cases that the 6th “Almogávares” Paratrooper Brigade, from the “Príncipe” Base in Paracuellos de Jarama near Madrid, has recreated in the exercises carried out recently to test the new release of the BMS system.

This new version provides unique capabilities to operate in demanding bandwidths such as those usually available for tactical communications. This ensures that the system works effectively in the most complex scenarios in which communications are difficult and hostile forces are constantly trying to prevent them. The system is equipped with the capacity to exchange not only text messages and images, but also direct video in real time.

The BMS also integrates perfectly with NATO standards which makes it interoperable with other allied countries’ systems. It also enables the commanding officers who direct the operation to make changes to the order of battle on the spot, reacting instantly to any unforeseen events.

Indra and Thales’ BMS is also integrated with the Army logistics management system (SIGLE) to streamline and automate inventory management and with other Army systems through the standard IDT interface for exchange of tactical data.

During the exercise, the SYNAPS radio was also tested. This high capacity tactical radio, with ESSOR SCA architecture, is a bi-band (VHF / UHF) and bi-channel radio specifically designed for collaborative combat and continuity of the chain of command. The SYNAPS capabilities allow the integration of the units through interoperability with the current PR4G combat radios of the Army and the ability to scale new functional features and services that can be integrated into the BMS-ET in the future, preserving security, integrity, confidentiality and resilience of communications. At the same time, it offers Brigade 2035 the possibility of reducing its logistics footprint by covering, with a single radio station instead of three, the communication needs with the upper and lower echelons with a single VHF channel and simultaneously having the high bandwidth performance provided by the UHF channel. At the Command Post, integrated into the BMS-ET, a real-time video was shown transmitted by an observation unit located more than 10 kilometres away.

The Army has already been deployed in real missions abroad with the earlier version of the BMS system that has provided excellent results in facilitating coordination and interoperability with the rest of the allied forces.

The increasing digitisation of the battlefield has made data a decisive factor for any army to prevail over its adversaries. The Spanish Army has been working with Indra and Thales on this advanced system for years; an experience that has helped to positioned it at the forefront of European command and control technologies.

In a world in which the future of defence is increasingly complex, with more and more diverse scenarios and ubiquitous sensors in constant motion, the Army’s centre of gravity continues to be the combatants who, however, require technologies that enable them to carry out their missions in collaboration with their allies and also provide data for better and faster decision-making. Consequently, the BMS has become a key tool that provides and manages all the required information in the shortest time possible to ensure the success of the mission. It could be said that this system is the embryo of the future combat cloud in which all systems and platforms, manned or not, will be interconnected, constituting a complex adaptive system in which the key factors are agile operation and the seamless exchange of information.

The degree of technological development that the Spanish Army has reached enables the country to lead the most ambitious European initiatives and address development of the next generation of strategic operational command and control systems at levels higher than the tactical tier already covered by the BMS.

Hawkei Light Protected Vehicle - Army Technology,"Thu, 01 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFybXktdGVjaG5vbG9neS5jb20vcHJvamVjdHMvaGF3a2VpL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Hawkei protected vehicle is offered in four-door and two-door variants. The Hawkei vehicle features a blast and ballistic resistant design. The Hawkei vehicle is powered by a 200kW engine supplied by Steyr Motors.

Hawkei is a lightweight protected vehicle designed and developed to meet the requirements of the Australian Defence Force (ADF). It is manufactured by Thales Australia for the Department of Defence’s Land 121 phase 4 programme that aims to replace the Australian Army’s Land Rovers.

The vehicle is named after a stealthy species of death adder, Acanthophis Hawkei, a native of Australia. Hawkei can accommodate six soldiers and is designed to be protected from blasting and ballistic threats.

The vehicle is developed as a next-generation light mobility vehicle. It was officially launched on 29 September 2009 and will replace unarmoured Land Rovers. The Hawkei can be airlifted by a C-130 Hercules transport or other standard cargo aircraft. It can travel at a maximum speed of 100km/h over a range of more than 1,000km.

Hawkei has been tested against improvised explosive devices (IED) to ensure that its design allows for maximum protection. Tests were conducted to gather the data and modernise the blast management system equipped in the vehicle. The first series of mine blast test on the Hawkei vehicle’s passenger compartment were completed on 26 November 2009.

Hawkei orders and deliveries

The forecast report of the ADF stated that orders for the Hawkei would not exceed more than 1,300 vehicles.

The first prototype vehicle was unveiled in November 2010 after completion of several blast tests. Thales delivered two prototypes of Hawkei to the ADF in February 2011 for verification and validation. Hawkei was selected as a preferred vehicle for the LAND 121 Phase 4 programme in December 2011.

Thales delivered six Hawkei vehicles and one trailer prototype to the Australian Army by June 2013. Testing of the vehicles was performed by the Defence Materiel Organisation’s Land Engineering Agency.

In October 2015, the Australian Department of Defence signed a A$1.3bn ($980.41m) contract with Thales Australia to procure 1,100 Hawkei vehicles and more than 1,000 companion trailers to be delivered by the end of 2021.

Hawkei vehicle design

The light protected vehicle features a generic vehicle architecture (GVA), an open design approach of the UK Ministry of Defence for electronic and power architectures of modern defence vehicles. It can be used in support of a range of missions including air defence, reconnaissance, command, patrolling, logistics supply and liaison.

The vehicle is 5.78m-long, 2.4m-wide, and 2.3m-tall. It has a kerb weight of approximately 7,000kg and gross weight of more than 10,000kg. The model is available in a four-door and two-door variants.

The Hawkei design encompasses high levels of blast and ballistic protection. The vehicle is designed to incorporate the future system requirements of adaptive campaigning with C4I (command, control, communications, computers and intelligence) capabilities. It can be upgraded for specific missions. The integral V-shaped monocoque hull and blast absorption system provides objective level blast protection.

The next-generation protection vehicle’s hull is designed to protect the vehicle from blasts while incorporating high levels of tactical and operational mobility and allow easy conversion between variants. The vehicle’s adaptable ballistic protection technology is designed for air transport and is reconfigurable by a two-person crew in under half an hour without using specialised devices or equipment.

Armament carried by the light protected vehicle

A remotely controlled weapon station (RCWS) is installed in the Hawkei vehicle. It is an automated control weapon station principally used for light and medium-calibre weapons. The RCWS can accommodate remote control weapons encompassing 5.56mm, 7.62mm, and 12.7mm machine guns, 40mm automatic grenade launchers, anti-tank missiles and observation pods.

The RCWS can accommodate weapons up to 12.7mm machine guns and is manufactured by Samson Technologies Corporation, US.

Hawkei engine and mobility

The Hawkei vehicle is powered by a 200kW (268hp) Steyr V6 diesel engine manufactured by Austrian firm Steyr Motors. The inline starter or generator offers sufficient level of electrical power to drive the C4I and mission equipment.

The twin-turbo engine is fitted with an eight-speed automatic transmission system. The vehicle features a four-wheel drive and a an independent coil-type suspension. It has a central tyre inflation system with exceptional on and off-road performance in all types of road conditions.

Contractors involved Thales Australia is the prime contractor for the design and development of Australia’s Hawkei lightweight mobility vehicle. Boeing, Plasan Sasa and PAC Group are partners of Thales, supporting the Hawkei project.

Boeing Defence Australia provided integrated logistic support (ILS) to Thales during the design and development of the Hawkei vehicle. In August 2009, Boeing Defence Australia was awarded a contract by Thales Australia to offer ILS for its Hawkei protected mobility vehicle. The contract encompasses supporting Thales during the design and development phase of the Hawkei vehicle to ensure the vehicle lasts longer while saving costs. Armour solution provider Plasan Sasa is supporting Thales Australia to achieve the highest levels of protection in the Hawkei lightweight vehicle.

PAC Group has worked closely with Thales Australia to provide a flexible production capability."
Singapore Airlines offers real-time seatback shopping on A350s - - Runway Girl Network,"Thu, 08 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMjEvMDcvc2luZ2Fwb3JlLWFpcmxpbmVzLXNlYXRiYWNrLXNob3BwaW5nLWEzNTBzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"During the COVID-19 crisis, people have grown accustomed to buying big ticket items online via screens at home. So, it stands to reason that this behavior will carry over into the inflight realm.

It is against this backdrop that Singapore Airlines (SIA) is now offering live inflight shopping to passengers via its KrisWorld connected seatback IFE systems on select Airbus A350s, under a partnership with its IFE provider Thales InFlyt Experience and e-commerce specialist Airfree.

The connected IFE system supports real-time credit card payments for KrisShop purchases, and offers multiple delivery options, including to passengers’ homes or on their connecting or returning flights, says Thales, which also powers SIA’s connectivity aboard A350s with Inmarsat’s Global Xpress service.

An initial image of the “eShopping” experience, shared by Thales, shows a curated collection of items displayed on a Thales AVANT IFE screen. The collection includes perfume, alcohol and non-traditional items like a car seat and a coffee maker.

“The digital onboard shopping marketplace eliminates the logistics, weight, and resources required to support traditional onboard shopping, while tremendously increasing passenger choice,” explains Thales in a statement.

The company says SIA is “the first airline to offer live e-shopping onboard via KrisShop”.

Acquired by Alaska Airlines in 2016, Virgin America is generally considered to be the first airline to offer buy-on-board functionality via its Red-branded inflight entertainment system. Passengers simply swiped a card on the system to order food, beverages, premium content and retail goods. The solution freed up aisle space onboard, and allowed the airline to monetize its IFE system.

But what’s old is new again, and crucially in Singapore Airlines’ case, the Thales solution supports real-time transactions, naturally facilitating larger purchases.

“With proprietary bandwidth optimization technology, the Airfree onboard hosted eShopping platform drastically reduces satellite data consumption compared to traditional platforms,” notes Thales, intriguingly.

SIA senior vice president customer experience Yeoh Phee Teik says: “E-commerce is the future of shopping, and integrating this feature into our inflight entertainment system is yet another industry first for SIA. This allows KrisWorld to go beyond movies, television shows, music, and games, and offer customers more of what they want while flying with us.

“This is part of our unwavering commitment to continuously innovate and enhance our product and service offerings, and augment the travel experience for our customers.”

The seatback shopping solution entered into service on 28 June, and will be progressively rolled out on select A350s.

Though SIA’s adoption of the eShopping platform is news, Thales’ relationship with Airfree is not. During a recent press briefing to unveil Thales’ new 4K screen partnership with Samsung, Thales director of strategic marketing Jerry Thomas noted that the firm was the “first to market” with the Airfree e-commerce offering, and that the arrangement would help Thales understand what passengers are doing and drive better analytics.

Whether or not even pricier items will be sold in the future remains to be seen. But, on the ground, people now buy cars and even homes online.

Crotale NG Short Range Air Defence System - Army Technology,"Mon, 05 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFybXktdGVjaG5vbG9neS5jb20vcHJvamVjdHMvY3JvdGFsZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Crotale NG (Next Generation) is an all-weather short-range and multi-sensor air defence system developed by Thales Air Defense (formerly Thomson-CSF Airsys).

The missions of the system are in front-line armoured brigade defence, permanent or semi-permanent site defence and area defence against air threats, such as fixed-wing aircraft, attack helicopters, cruise missiles, tactical missiles and saturation attacks with stand-off weapons released from aircraft and helicopters.

The Crotale NG system provides air situation and threat assessment, extended detection range, identification friend or foe (IFF), multi-target detection plus automated acquisition, tracking and engagement and all-weather operation. The data exchange capability provides integration of the Crotale NG into a global air defence scheme.

A platoon of four Crotale NG units can be operated in coordinated mode using the automated computer-to-computer data exchange. According to the threat assessment and the relative positions of the four units, the target is engaged by the unit in the best position.

Crotale NG design and development

Crotale NG entered production in 1990 and is in service with the Finnish Army (20 systems), and the French Air Force (12 shelter-mounted systems) and Navy.

Thales signed a contract with Greece in June 1999 for 11 Crotale NG systems, nine for the air force and two for the navy. The system has also been sold to Saudi Arabia and Oman.

In February 2000, Thales and Samsung were jointly awarded the contract for the Republic of Korea Pegasus (Chun Ma) K-SAM (Korean Surface-to-Air Missile) programme. The contract called for the production of 48 Crotale NG surveillance and fire control systems. Samsung Thales was awarded a follow-on contract in December 2003.

In March 2001, Thales Air Defence (formerly Shorts Missile Systems) was awarded a contract for the production of the VT1 missile. The Finnish Defence Forces successfully conducted a live firing of the Crotale NG integrated with Thales’ advanced Catherine XP thermal camera in June 2018.

Crotale NG missile defence system

Crotale NG missile defence system houses both radars and infrared sensors to provide the best view of the airborne targets.

The various subsystems are integrated on a single vehicle, which makes Crotale a stable and compact platform.

The range of operations that system can perform includes detection, interception and responding to the hostile threats such as unmanned aerial vehicles , rockets, and helicopters. The missile system can offer protection to stationary or mobile military and civilian assets from airborne threats.

The latest upgrade of the Crotale NG features an advanced thermal camera for reliable real-time imaging during day and night.

The warhead carrying capacity of the system is 13kg. The weapon system can launch the warhead at a maximum speed of Mach 3.5 to hit targets 11km away.

The Crotale NG defence system is used by with Finland, France, Greece, Oman and South Korea.

The VT-1 missile features

VT-1 is a short-range surface-to-air missile intended for use in land and sea-based operations.

It features a high level of manoeuvrability with load factor of 35g up to 8km. The missile can travel at a speed of Mach 3.5+ to cover 8km in 10.3 seconds. Propelled by a solid propellant rocket motor, the VT-1 missile has an effective range of more than 11km and ceiling of over 9km.

The Command to Line-Of-Sight (CLOS) guidance uses radar and electro-optical sensors. The missile is armed with a focused blast and fragmentation warhead, initiated by an RF proximity fuse. The warhead provides a lethal blast radius of 8m. Typical interception time from firing to airborne target destruction at a distance of 8km is 10.3s.

Fire control and surveillance The air defence missile system is equipped with a multi-sensor suite, including passive electro-optics and radar with built-in Electronic Counter Countermeasures (ECCM) to engage airborne targets under adverse conditions of dense electronic warfare and hostile battlefield environments of nuclear, biological and chemical warfare (NBC) and smoke and dust screens.

The sensor suite includes an S-band pulse doppler surveillance radar that can perform the functions of sectored surveillance, search-on-the-move and has a built-in IFF antenna. The ECCM features are low side lobes, frequency agility, pulse compression, CFAR (Constant False Alarm Rate) and strobe on jam. The range is 20km with altitude coverage from 0m to 5,000m.

A Ku-band TWT (travelling wave tube) single pulse doppler tracking radar on the missile system has a beam width of 1.20° and range of up to 30km.

The optoelectronic tracking system includes a thermal camera that has a dual field of view and electronic magnification providing 8.1 or 2.7° in azimuth and 5.4 or 1.8° in elevation. The range is up to 19km.

The daylight CCD camera has a field view of 2.4° in azimuth and 1.8° in elevation. The detection range of the camera is up to 15km. An infrared (IR) localiser mounted below the CCD camera is used for missile gathering.

All functions from target detection to target tracking are automated to achieve reduced reaction times. The reaction time is typically six seconds between first detection and launch of the missile. Once the missile is fired, the operational software selects the best missile tracking sensor according to data being supplied from all sensors. The operator has the option of overriding the sensor automatically selected by the operational software.

Crotale Mk3 long range air defence missile system

Thales developed the Crotale Mk3, a new long-range variant of the Crotale NG. The Crotale Mk3 has a maximum effective range of 16,000m and altitude of 9,000m. With the new Shikra 3D multibeam surveillance radar (derived from the Thales Netherlands SMART-S Mk2 search radar), Crotale Mk3 forms Thales’s Multishield system designed to protect sensitive sites and theatres of operation.

The Crotale Mk3 was first test fired in February 2007 at the DGA Centre d’Essais des Landes (CELM) missile launch range at Biscarrosse in South West France. It intercepted and destroyed the target at a range of more than 14,000m. In January 2008, the Mk3 missile system successfully intercepted and destroyed a Banshee target drone at an altitude of 970m and a range of 8,000m in an 11-second engagement. In a second test firing, Crotale MK3 destroyed the target flying at an altitude of 500m and a range of 15,000m."
Singapore Airlines expands in-flight shopping with on-ground fulfillment - PaxEx.Aero,"Mon, 12 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vcGF4ZXguYWVyby9zaW5nYXBvcmUtYWlybGluZXMtaW4tZmxpZ2h0LXNob3BwaW5nLXRoYWxlcy1hdmFudC1pZmUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Singapore Airlines wants to sell more on board, with fulfillment on the ground. An update to the IFE system on some A350s will support this.

In-flight shopping took a new turn on Singapore Airlines as the carrier unveils an expanded on-board shopping experience. Through a partnership with Thales and Airfree, the carrier massively expanded the shopping selection available to travelers on the company’s A350 fleet. With a range of delivery options, the expanded KrisShop melds the convenience of on-board shopping with inventory only possible through a warehouse on the ground.

KrisShop has been at the forefront of connecting with consumers since our rebranding in 2019. Today, together with Singapore Airlines, we are excited to be able to enhance and rejuvenate the in-flight shopping experience with the inclusion of our live ecommerce platform on KrisWorld. This extends our reach to the travel audience segment, and reinforces our commitment to deliver an integrated user experience to all customers. – Mr. Chris Pok, Chief Executive Officer, KrisShop

The Airfree-powered shop integrates seamlessly with the on-board KrisShop offerings available on the Thales in-seat entertainment screens, creating a single e-commerce interface for passengers. Travelers can browse and purchase items from a single interface with real time payment processing.

Goods can be delivered to the passenger’s home. Or, depending on the product and order timing, the items can be collected during a connection at Changi Airport or prior to departure on the return flight leaving Singapore.

The ability to deliver goods at the terminal could be a game changer. It enables the value of impulse buying on board in a much broader manner than a typical duty free cart ever could. And it does so without burdening the cabin crew as retail clerks along the way.

SkyMall magazine tried a similar approach many years ago (phone in an order via the on-board GTE Airfone and collect on arrival; ATL was the key airport in that experiment). The breadth of selection was much lower at that time, however. Moreover, the shopping world had not yet evolved into the heavily digital version we know today. Presumably this version will perform better.

Mr. Yeoh Phee Teik, Senior Vice President Customer Experience, Singapore Airlines describes the updated offering as allowing “KrisWorld to go beyond movies, television shows, music, and games, and offer customers more of what they want while flying with us.” Apparently many travelers were chomping at the bit for the opportunity to spend their time on board browsing various shopping portals.

The updated KrisShop with Airfree integration certainly delivers on what Teik describes as an “unwavering commitment to continuously innovate and enhance our product and service offerings, and augment the travel experience for our customers.”

That said, the decision to limit the shopping portal to only the embedded in-seat IFE screens rather than opening it up via the airline’s app or a web portal on board is an interesting (and not especially innovative) decision. Perhaps that changes as the platform matures. But typically today one expects a mobile-first experience when launching a new digital platform.

Indeed, in launching similar offerings other airlines such as AirAsia chose to be mobile-only, owing in part to the lack of screens on its planes.

Another ancillary revenue channel

Cedric Rhoads, Vice President, Product Policy, Thales InFlyt Experience sees the offering as an opportunity for airlines to “extend the benefits of the open AVANT in-flight entertainment platform by connecting with a robust network of digital partners such as Airfree, unlocking significant value from their IFE investment.” Airfree CEO Etienne de Verdelhan echoes that position, noting, “Our pioneering technology dedicated to inflight environment provides unique passenger eShopping experience and unlocks new revenue opportunities.”

And this comes from a launch customer that historically was not as focused on deriving direct revenue from the entertainment system.

Make no mistake: Even carriers like Singapore Airlines are now considering ways to extract a bit more cash from the installations. And given the billions of dollars in losses over the past 18 months perhaps this comes not a moment too soon.

A lightweight implementation

Thales also notes that much of the digital content for the Airfree/KrisShop experience is cached on board. Bits of real-time data such as inventory or payment confirmation can be handled over the aircraft’s satellite network connection using only a tiny sliver of bandwidth.

This seatback shopping solution entered into service on 28 June 2021. The carrier expects to progressively roll it out on selected Singapore Airlines Airbus A350 aircraft.

Thales hosts students from the Clontarf Foundation visit to Garden Island - Thales,"Wed, 07 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGFsZXNncm91cC5jb20vZW4vY291bnRyaWVzLWFzaWEvYXVzdHJhbGlhL3JlZmVyZW5jZXMvdGhhbGVzLWhvc3RzLXN0dWRlbnRzLWNsb250YXJmLWZvdW5kYXRpb24tdmlzaXQtZ2FyZGVuLWlzbGFuZNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Last month our Above Water Systems team at Garden Island hosted students from the Clontarf Foundation to see for themselves potential pathways into traineeships, apprenticeships, internships and other career prospects. The day was a huge success and jam-packed with workshop tours followed by a highly anticipated boat ride in a 40-foot Steber with an early lunch on Sydney Harbour.

This site visit followed three visits made by Thales staff in recent weeks to learn more about the important work the Clontarf Foundation does to improve the education, discipline, life skills, self-esteem and employment prospects of young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander men.

The students arrived early at GI and there was a buzz of excitement in the air as the day started with morning tea and a briefing in the Digital Dock Room. Dock Operations and Reticulated Services (DORSC) Program Manager, Anthony Burrows introduced the boys to the DORSC and HR team and went through the day’s program, followed by a safety briefing by Trades and Production Capability Manager, Stuart Stafford.

After donning their PPE gear, the students were divided into small groups and set off for workshop demonstrations of the different trades including Boilermakers, Fitters, Plumbers, Sheet Metal Workers and Electricians. Questions were encouraged and the boys were keen to know what a day in the life of a tradesperson looked like; pathways and apprenticeships available at Thales; support systems in place for apprentices; starting and finishing salaries of apprentices; what happens when an apprenticeship ends; opportunities for further training; career prospects and of course lots of questions about the ships.

Pursuing a trade after school was a hot topic of conversation amongst the boys who thought the day was a great opportunity to look first hand at the options available to them. Some of the feedback included:

I have an interest in plumbing but enjoyed seeing all the cool trades today. It has given me an idea of what else is available and what I may want to do later on. Charlie

I’ve never seen anything like this before! Denzel

What a great day! Wow, so many job opportunities around. Harrison

I am interested in engineering and after today I would like to pursue this interest. Jarraki

I am interested in welding. Today has given me some hard thinking to do. Kye

I loved looking at all the trades today. I am in year 11 and want to do a trade. Now I have a better idea of the different trades I can get into and what’s involved. Maleek

Clontarf Foundation Facilitator, Heath Northey said the site visit shows the students what their future career can look like. “Our mission is to ensure young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander men finish school, further their schooling or find employment prospects after school. The boys here today are in years 10 to 12 from Matraville High School. For the year 10 boys, today plants the seeds around employment and the opportunities available with our partners such as Thales when they finish school. For the year 12 boys, today is about the next step in their future and starting a serious conversation about pursuing an apprenticeship.”

Anthony Burrows says apprenticeships are a win-win for both apprentice and employer. “The apprentice gains valuable on-the-job training while building credentials and skills and learning a trade. For Thales, we are able to develop and build a stronger talent pipeline for the Defence Industry to support the Department of Defence’s Plan Galileo. Apprentices bridge the skills gap. We also have better retention rates, because young people come in with a support network around them and feel that they belong, so they are more engaged and more productive. I hope to work with some of these inspiring young men in the near future.”

Thales Australia is proud of its partnership with the Clontarf Foundation to create meaningful change in the lives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and promote respectful unity between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians."

RBS biometric payment cards (UK) - Thales,"Mon, 19 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi9tYXJrZXRzL2RpZ2l0YWwtaWRlbnRpdHktYW5kLXNlY3VyaXR5L2JhbmtpbmctcGF5bWVudC9jdXN0b21lci1jYXNlcy9yYnMtYmlvbWV0cmljLWNhcmTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"​If you run a major High Street bank and are at the vanguard of innovation, what do you do to ensure you stay ahead of your traditional and emerging rivals?

The banking innovation challenge today centres on how to beef up security while ensuring even greater convenience for customers.

That's why the UK banking giant RBS Group is ensuring it stays ahead of the pack by adopting fingerprint biometric contactless payment cards.

UK consumers are increasingly comfortable with making contactless payments with their bank card.



Using biometric technology

They also enjoy using biometric technology, using it several times a day to access their smartphone or tablet.

These two trends drove RBS Group to become the first banking brand in the UK to combine the two popular technologies, contactless and fingerprint ID, in a single bank card.

The innovative biometric payment card was first trialled early in 2019 with a three-month pilot through the RBS Group and NatWest brands involving 150 people using Visa debit cards.

The results of this live experiment have confirmed that consumers are ready for and enthusiastic about the convenience that these technologies offer.

They're also fans of the LED lights on the card as they can be sure of whether or not a transaction has been successful.

RBS Group has been running a similar pilot since October 2019, this time using Mastercard credit cards, and will consider a wider commercial deployment for 2020 if it confirms their expectations.



Improved user experience

Payment transactions with the biometric card are perceived as more convenient and more secure by the consumers.

There's more.

It removes the standard £45 transaction limit for contactless payments by adding an extra layer of security.

To confirm their ID, users of the new card place their finger on the sensor embedded on the card, so a comparison can be performed between the scanned fingerprint and their biometric data securely stored in the card.

This highly secure fingerprint authentication means cardholders can pay quickly and easily with just a simple touch.



Tech supplier of choice

RBS Group wanted to ensure their customers had the best payment journey. They selected Thales because of its advanced & high-quality biometric payment card solution, proven by successful pilot programs in Italy, Cyprus, and Lebanon. Its indisputable global reputation for innovation and performance.

The RBS biometric payment card provided by Thales also has excellent green credentials compared with other solutions since it does not need a battery as it gets power directly from the payment terminal.

The two firms have a long working relationship as RBS group has previously purchased Thales' digital banking solutions and successfully rolled them out to clients of its 1,500 branches nationwide.

This innovative move helped them to maintain their position in the top five rankings of UK banks."

Fiber in the sky for connectivity services thanks to laser communications

Rome, 21 July 2021 - Thales Alenia Space, a joint venture between Thales (67%) and Leonardo (33%), has successfully completed the first study phase of the European Space Agency's (ESA) HydRON (High-thRoughput Optical space Network) project. Laser communications are revolutionising satellite communications and ESA’s HydRON optical network will seamlessly link satellites to fiber networks on the ground, enabling reliable, instant connectivity for European citizens across the world. HydRON is a high-throughput optical space network and forms part of ESA's ScyLight programme for secure and laser communication technology.

This first phase, HyPha Study, defined early system requirements and explored network architectures, as well as the technologies necessary for future implementation. Subsequently, activities will be carried out to build first IOD (In-Orbit Demonstrator) flight demonstrators to test and mature space optical network solutions for satellite and terrestrial operators usage, that will be operating in the future market.

For this study, Thales Alenia Space, reinforced by its expertise in the production of optical technologies for space developed in Zurich, coordinated a work group, involving Telespazio, a joint venture between Leonardo 67% and Thales 33%, as a satellite operator, Open Fiber as the “wholesale-only” infrastructure operator, providing access and transport networks, entirely in optical fiber to more than 200 operators in Italy, Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies, an academic institution with expertise in free space communication systems FSO (Free Space Optics).

This initiative contributes to Europe's technological independence in connectivity services through space (Fiber in the sky / Internet beyond the Cloud(s)) and to the expansion of its capacities towards new types of services and applications (Cloud in the sky, IP Routing On-Board Satellite, extra-territorial service capacities, etc.).

About optical satellite connectivity

In FSO, lasers are used to establish a transmission link with optical receptors (photodiodes) for reception. One advantage of using lasers, or better direct and collimated links, is that these links are very difficult to intercept, assuring a naturally very secure communication process. But above all, by exploiting the technique of wavelength multiplexing commonly used in terrestrial fiber connections, it is possible to create FSO links with capacities of hundreds of Gbit/s. This is much higher than bandwidths of current radio-frequency technologies, thus allowing to meet increasing network bandwidth requests. Moreover, satellite connectivity is always available in its coverage area and does not require complex infrastructure to be deployed (poles, lines, exchanges, etc.).

Recent studies show that the ultra-broadband digital connectivity demand increased significantly during the past years, and the COVID-19 pandemic has shown that it is now essential for families and businesses to have fast data connections. By integrating seamlessly with the terrestrial optical fiber networks, satellite systems employing FSO technologies will empower telecommunications infrastructures to be able to meet growing demand, support 5G and to enable new, innovative applications using Artificial Intelligence and Internet-of-Things.

ABOUT THALES ALENIA SPACE

Drawing on over 40 years of experience and a unique combination of skills, expertise and cultures, Thales Alenia Space delivers cost-effective solutions for telecommunications, navigation, Earth observation, environmental management, exploration, science and orbital infrastructures.

Robotic inspection project for offshore wind turbines concludes - Energy Global,"Wed, 14 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVuZXJneWdsb2JhbC5jb20vd2luZC8xNDA3MjAyMS9yb2JvdGljLWluc3BlY3Rpb24tcHJvamVjdC1mb3Itb2Zmc2hvcmUtd2luZC10dXJiaW5lcy1jb25jbHVkZXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"One of the UK’s most ambitious robotics projects has proven the concept for robotic teams repairing offshore wind farms. This paves the way for human-robot teams at wind farms within 10 years and wind farms designed for robotic maintenance by 2050 – a scenario that will be vital to the UK achieving its net-zero targets.



The £4 million MIMRee project, which was funded by Innovate UK, has concluded this month and reported on its drive to develop an autonomous robotic team for inspecting and repairing offshore wind farms. Two years since starting the project, the MIMRee team, including leading academics and technology developers, say they have successfully proven and demonstrated the core technologies at the heart of the concept.

Under the MIMRee scenario, a Thales autonomous mothership detects defects in wind farm blades using an onboard inspection system that can scan the structure of wind farms blades while they are still turning, sometimes at speeds of 200 mph at their tips. The mothership then signals the blades to stop and launches a specially adapted drone that can transport a six-legged ‘blade crawler’ onto them to effect repair.

The Offshore Renewable Energy (ORE) Catapult, which has led the project, believes that within 10 years this scenario will be feasible at offshore wind farms with robots working semi-autonomously (that is, under the remote supervision of humans and only requiring technicians for intervention offshore when essential).

By 2050, such a system could be capable of planning its own missions and conducting them autonomously at ‘wind farms of the future’ that are built for repair by resident robots. ORE Catapult estimates that this move will shift workers from hazardous environments at sea to onshore control room roles and reduce the cost of energy by 10% (including a 27% reduction in operating expenses).

“This is not just a way for the sector to reduce costs, it is essential if the offshore wind industry is to achieve the scale of expansion needed for Net Zero”, said Ben George, who leads ORE Catapult’s Operations and Maintenance Centre of Excellence (OMCE). “Today, conditions at sea make human-only missions subject to safety risks, delays, cancellations, and extensive turbine downtime. This will not be a feasible way of running the super-sized offshore power stations of tomorrow that lie in deep waters hundreds of miles from shore.”

The inspiration for the project was drawn from space exploration, the epitome of an extreme environment. Professor Sara Bernardini, who previously worked on mission planning for space mission operations, including the NASA’s Mars Exploration Rovers programme, developed the AI system that controls how the MIMRee robots work together and communicate with humans.

“Space provides a good example of humans working with robots. The current Mars exploration programme uses a team of robots, from helicopters to rovers, that can withstand extreme conditions. Astronauts are deployed selectively, where human ingenuity is most needed and risk to life is lowest. Likewise, future offshore work will be about humans being in the control room, developing and managing robotics and learning the skills required to work in teams with them,” comments Professor Bernardini.

Another crucial technological breakthrough was developing a robot’s ability to repair blades. The BladeBUG robot was lent to the project by BladeBUG Ltd, a London start-up that has previously achieved the world’s first robotic ‘blade walk’ at a working offshore wind turbine.

Wootzano Ltd fitted their patented electronic skin, used in harsh environments such as nuclear decommissioning and applied it to the feet of the crawler robot. The Wootzkin allows robots to navigate around slippery wind turbine blades monitoring for slips and avoiding falls whilst carrying out repairs.

The Royal College of Art’s Robotic Laboratory developed the repair module that is capable of cleaning and recoating damaged blades.

Drone technologies were adapted to take-off and land on the autonomous vessel when it is moving at high speed while it is carrying the blade crawler. This phase of the work was led by the University of Bristol, the University of Manchester, and Perceptual Robotics.

Ben George concludes: “This project has proven that such a system is possible and can handle the extreme environments at sea. We have tested each of its components in real-world settings, including at our offshore demonstration turbine off the coast of Scotland. We’ve also developed a hardware-in-the-loop simulation system that allows individual robots to connect to a simulated environment so we can fine-tune their team behaviour before they go into field. It is highly significant that these technologies are being developed and demonstrated first in the UK – this puts us in pole position for a fast-growing global export market.”

Dr Paul Gosling, Chief Technical Officer for Thales in the UK, said: “Increasingly we are seeing the technologies around robotics, autonomy sensing, and AI providing solutions enabling activities involving harsh environments to be undertaken using unmanned systems. The MIMRee work is a perfect example of a UK team of experts using this evolving technology to benefit society and the environment in the future. I am delighted Thales was able to contribute its expertise in the form of the autonomous mothership and camera sensing technology to make this activity a success.”

The awards were established to recognise partner companies that created innovative and impactful Microsoft solutions. Throughout the awards process, there were 4,400 nominations representing 100 countries across the world.

According to a release from Thales, their Nexium Defence Cloud Edge (NDC Edge) allows users to deliver and analyse information “in real time”. The program, which uses Microsoft’s Azure Stack technology, was created for use by the Australian Defence Force but can be expanded for use by Five Eyes nations and civilian groups.

The transference of data by the NDC Edge extends from the battle headquarters all the way through to the soldier.

Rodney Clark, corporate vice president, global partner solutions, channel sales and channel chief at Microsoft, noted that the award recipients had demonstrated drive to build leading digital solutions.

“I am honoured to announce the winners and finalists of the 2021 Microsoft Partner of the Year Awards,” he said.

“These remarkable partners have displayed a deep commitment to building world-class solutions for customers — from cloud-to-edge — and represent some of the best and brightest our ecosystem has to offer.”

Chris Jenkins, chief executive of Thales Australia, outlined how the award shows the benefits of the NDC Edge on the battlespace.

“We are delighted to be recognised by Microsoft with the 2021 Defence and Industry Partner of the Year award. This achievement validates the collaborative efforts of both the local and global Thales and Microsoft teams. This collaboration has produced a sovereign, customer focused solution that draws from the very best of the world-leading capabilities from across both organisations. NDC Edge is able to deliver a clear capability advantage across all domains from the headquarters to the tactical level to deliver a decisive impact on the battlefield,” Jenkins said.

The announcement comes the same week that Thales successfully completed the test flight of its UAS 100 system.

Thales executive vice-president of avionics Yannick Assouad outlined that the company's UAS 100 hopes to achieve the military requirements of future UAS systems.

""With this new long-range UAS, Thales is providing the trusted solution needed for civil, government and military inspection and security applications,"" Assouad noted.

As the latest company to sign the Soldier On Pledge, Thales joins more than 100 veteran-supportive companies working in partnership with Soldier On to enable veterans and their families to thrive.

According to Chris Jenkins, Thales Australia CEO, joining the Pledge would enable veterans to identify Thales as an attractive and supportive option for their future employment.

With a strong connection to the Australian Defence Force, Thales actively supports the veteran community with quality and meaningful employment opportunities for Defence personnel, contemporary veterans and their families throughout the business.

Organisations that sign the Pledge commit to learning more about the skills and attributes that Defence personnel, veterans, and family members can bring to their organisation.

Thales Australia is a welcomed addition to the Soldier On Pledge, according to Ivan Slavich Soldier On CEO. The Pledge recognises the exemplary skills, leadership and training of those who have served Australia. ​

“Soldier On is thrilled to have Thales Australia join the Pledge. It is terrific to see a veteran supportive organisation and trusted partner of the Australian Defence Force taking further steps to support the veteran community,” Slavich said.

For every organisation that signs the Pledge, we are one step closer to enabling more veterans and their families to secure their future. The addition of Thales Australia will see a significant increase in the meaningful opportunities available to the veteran community."""

The corruption trial of former South African president Jacob Zuma who is currently in prison, has been postponed to August 10 as it is decided whether he must be physically present in the courtroom or can appear via video from where he is in detention.

Zuma asked that his trial be postponed until he could attend the case at the court in Pietermaritzburg, the capital of KwaZulu-Natal province. Zuma claimed that proceedings held via a video link prevent him from properly consulting with his lawyers. Zuma is currently in Estcourt Correctional Center, about 100 kilometers (62 miles) away.

He is accused of receiving bribes from French arms manufacturer Thales during South Africa’s purchase of arms in 1999.

Before the corruption trial begins, the court must also rule on Zuma's application for lead prosecutor Billy Downer to recuse himself from the trial for alleged bias against Zuma.

Zuma is currently serving a 15-month prison sentence for defying an order by the country’s top court, the Constitutional Court, to testify before a commission probing allegations of corruption when he was president from 2009 to 2018.

The former president’s imprisonment earlier this month triggered protests that escalated into widespread rioting in KwaZulu-Natal, Zuma’s home province, and in Gauteng the province that includes Johannesburg South Africa’s largest city.

At least 215 people died in the rioting and more than 2,500 people have been arrested for theft and vandalism. Order was restored last week after 2,500 army troops were deployed to Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal.

In a separate case, the Constitutional Court is considering Zuma's request to have his 15-month contempt of court sentence rescinded. Zuma’s lawyers have argued that the country’s apex court made errors when convicting and sentencing him."
Army's Hawkei PMV-L achieves IOC | ADBR - ADBR,"Mon, 12 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vYWRici5jb20uYXUvYXJteXMtaGF3a2VpLXBtdi1sLWFjaGlldmVzLWlvYy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"(ADF)

The Australian Army’s fleet of Thales Hawkei protected mobility vehicles-light (PMV-L) has achieved an initial operational capability (IOC).

Procured under Project LAND 121 Phase 4, the Australian-designed and produced Hawkei has had a protracted development and operational introduction into service.

The Hawkei was named as the preferred solution for the project in December 2011, and it was announced in October 2015 that 1,100 Hawkeis would be acquired. In 2016 Thales was awarded the Defence Science and Technology (DST) Eureka Prize for the development of the Hawkei, and in 2018 a number of vehicles were sent to Iraq and Afghanistan for operational evaluation.

Full rate production of the Hawkei was announced in September 2020 but it and the planned IOC slipped from to mid-2021 due to an issue with the brakes which has reportedly now been resolved.

“This project is an excellent example of Australian industry providing Defence capability to meet Australian requirements,” Minister for Defence Industry, Melissa Price said in a statement. “Hawkei has been designed and built in Australia by Thales Australia, which supports Australian jobs and Australian service personnel.”"
