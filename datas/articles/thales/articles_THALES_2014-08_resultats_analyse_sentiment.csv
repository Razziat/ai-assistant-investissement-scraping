Thales Leites: A Double Threat - UFC,"Thu, 21 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVmYy5jb20vbmV3cy90aGFsZXMtbGVpdGVzLWRvdWJsZS10aHJlYXTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"For years, Thales Leites was the “jiu-jitsu guy.” That’s not an insult, and when it comes to the gentle art he’s one of the best in mixed martial arts, but you had a good indication that on fight night, if he had his druthers, he was going to take his opponent to the mat and submit him.

He doesn’t deny it either.

“Sometimes during a fight when I hit my opponents strong and they feel my punch, I was going to take them down,” Leites admits. But when he did land, you could tell that the middleweight from Brazil could crack a bit. And his coach at Nova Uniao in Rio de Janeiro, Andre Pederneiras, knew it too.

“He (Pederneiras) came to me and said ‘Thales, you have heavy hands; when you hit your opponent, move forward and try to knock him out.’”

What followed was plenty of work on Leites’ hands in the gym, and when he got his chance in a fight against Trevor Smith in April, he pounced.

“During my fight I hit my opponent with an overhand, he fell and I didn’t stop,” Leites, who halted Smith in just 45 seconds, said. “It wasn’t a surprise to me and my team because we’ve been training for a long time, and what was missing before was the confidence to exchange more.”

Now that confidence is there, and when you add in his already-present ground game, Leites has been a new fighter since coming back to the UFC in 2013, and this Saturday he will put his three-fight Octagon winning streak on the line against Francis Carmont.

“I’m feeling great, I’m feeling more confident each time, and this time won’t be different,” he said. “I’m going forward, looking to knock him out or submit him every time.”

During his first UFC run in 2006-09, Leites was capable of entertaining fights, and he did win five of eight bouts, but that time in his career will likely be remembered for his five-round snoozer with then-middleweight champion Anderson Silva in 2009. In his next fight, he lost a decision to Alessio Sakara that most believed he won, but since the fight was so dreadful to watch, few protested the verdict.

Leites was cut after the bout, and after regrouping and dealing with some injuries, a 6-1 record brought him back to the Octagon. This time, he has looked like a legitimate contender again, and after beating Smith, he clocked in at number 15 in the current middleweight rankings. A win over the 12th-ranked Carmont will likely move him up even further.

“I saw his last fights, and he lost to two of the top guys in the world in the middleweight division in Ronaldo “Jacare” and CB Dollaway,” Leites said of his opponent. “He lost the fights, but he fought until the end. He’s a tall guy, he likes to use his hands and his front kick, and all I know is that I can’t let him like the fight. I have to walk forward and make him not like the fight. It’s what I’ve been training for for a long time, and it’s time to show to the world that I deserve to be in the top 10.”

What a difference a year makes, or as the 32-year-old Leites correctly points out, a year and 20 days. When he steps into the Octagon with Carmont, it will be that length of time since his return against Tom Watson last year, and while he’ll take a win any way he can get it, since he’s knocking people out now, would he prefer a KO or submission?

“The feeling of a submission is great,” he said. “I’m a jiu-jitsu fighter and I’ll always represent Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. I love it and I’m proud of it. But this is MMA and you have to be ready for every situation. The feeling of the knockout is great, but the submission, for me, is wonderful. If I have to choose, it doesn’t matter during the fight, but for me, the submission’s better.”

Spoken like a true jiu-jitsu guy.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9955499172210693}",neutral,0.9955499172210693,0
Italy Commits More Funds to Second-generation Radar Satellites - SpaceNews,"Thu, 28 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS80MTY5OWl0YWx5LWNvbW1pdHMtbW9yZS1mdW5kcy10by1zZWNvbmQtZ2VuZXJhdGlvbi1yYWRhci1zYXRlbGxpdGVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"ASI President Roberto Battiston said after the contract was signed that “it is essential that the first satellite be operational by 2017 and the second by 2018.” Credit: Festivaldella Scienza

PONTE VEDRA, Fla. — The Italian government’s agreement to commit another 66.6 million euros ($88 million) to the design of a second-generation Cosmo-SkyMed radar satellite system will keep the program moving forward but does not assure it will be completed in time to assure continuity with the first-generation system, Italian government and industry officials said.

Thales Alenia Space, Cosmo-SkyMed’s prime contractor, announced Aug. 27 that it and its sister company, ground services provider Telespazio, had received contracts valued at 43.6 million euros and 23 million euros, respectively, to continue designing the two-satellite system.

But a substantial new funding commitment will be needed before the end of the year if the satellites are to be launched in 2017 and 2018, a date that Thales Alenia Space and the Italian Space Agency (ASI) agree would assure no gaps in coverage between the first- and second-generation systems.

ASI President Roberto Battiston said after the contract was signed that “it is essential that the first satellite be operational by 2017 and the second by 2018.”

“You can now proceed without interruption,” Battiston told the industrial team. “ASI remains committed, together with the government, to finding the necessary resources to complete the entire program.”

Cosmo-SkyMed is a four-satellite radar Earth observation system designed to provide imagery at ground resolutions as sharp as less than 1 meter for military customers, and between 1 meter and 100 meters for nonmilitary users.

The four satellites were launched between June 2007 and November 2010 with design lives of five years. As is the case with most large Earth observation spacecraft, the Cosmo-SkyMed satellites have continued to operate well beyond their contractual service lives, taking some of the pressure off Italian space-budget planners.

But Thales Alenia Space and ASI have concluded that the follow-on system, with two satellites instead of four, needs to be in service by 2018 to avoid a service gap. Italian officials have concluded an agreement with the Argentine government that will permit Argentina’s Saocom radar satellites, still in development, to complement the second-generation Cosmo-SkyMed to reduce time between orbital passes over a given geographic area.

As it deals with a slow economic recovery, the Italian government is confronting major new demands on its space budget in 2014. ASI is struggling to complete the financial package needed to assure that the European Space Agency’s ExoMars Mars-exploration program, featuring launches in 2016 and 2018, stays on schedule, particularly for the second launch.

In addition, Italy wants the next meeting of ESA ministers, scheduled for December, to result in an agreement to upgrade the Italian-led Vega small-satellite launcher alongside commitments to a next-generation Ariane rocket.

Germany, meanwhile, is pressuring Italy to bring its international space station contribution back to previous levels, which will mean nearly tripling its investment from today’s funding, starting in 2015.

Battiston told journalists in late August that he was uncertain of being able to find the resources for all these commitments but that he was nonetheless determined to try.

The first-generation Cosmo-SkyMed constellation cost around 900 million euros. For the second-generation system, cost estimates have been at around 400 million euros.

While not resulting in a major financial contribution, the Polish Defense Ministry’s decision to join the program with a 2.5 percent stake, and to agree to operate its own, independent ground Earth station to access radar imagery, was a diplomatic success for Italy and added to pressure in Italy to assure full financing of the second-generation system.

The 66.6 million-euro tranche that Thales Alenia Space announced Aug. 27 will permit completion of system design and “basic technological developments for both the on-board component … and all the ground infrastructure.”

Elisio Giacomo Prette, chief executive of Thales Alenia Space Italia, said in a statement that the contract will fund industry work until 2015.

Prette said continuity of service between the first- and second-generation systems can only be guaranteed if the first second-generation satellite is in service by June 2017, with a second in orbit in 2018.

“To achieve this goal — and since the [contract tranche] agreed upon provides only partial financial coverage — guaranteeing financing for the entire system by the end of 2014 is an essential priority,” Prette said.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999819993972778}",neutral,0.9999819993972778,0
Airbus May Sell Stake In Submarine Supplier - MarineLink,"Fri, 22 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmluZWxpbmsuY29tL25ld3Mvc3VibWFyaW5lLXN1cHBsaWVyLWFpcmJ1czM3NTU4N9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus is considering a sale of its 49 percent stake in submarine supplier Atlas Elektronik as part of a reshuffle of its military business, German newspaper Die Welt reported on its website on Friday, citing industry sources.



Aerospace and defence group Airbus - then called EADS - and German industrial group ThyssenKrupp jointly bought Atlas Elektronik from BAE Systems in 2005, beating out France's Thales.



Die Welt said Airbus was to make a decision on a sale of its stake in the coming months. ThyssenKrupp likely has a right of first refusal, it said.



Airbus declined to comment and ThyssenKrupp said it would not comment on speculation. Atlas said it was up to its owners to comment on the report.



The news comes only days after Germany's economy minister told the country's arms industry that its future lay in consolidation with European peers, as Berlin becomes more cautious on arms exports.



Atlas Elektronik - which makes a range of products for submarines ranging from combat systems to torpedoes, marine minesweepers and communication systems - generated about a third of its 2013 sales of 441 million euros ($584 million) outside Europe, according to Die Welt.



The paper speculated that Thales could launch a fresh approach if Airbus decided to sell its stake, having lost out in 2005 due to political resistance to a foreign firm becoming part-owner in a German defence business.



While governments and industry agree on the rationale for consolidation in the European defence industry, in practice governments often find deals unpalatable for security or domestic political considerations.



Thales declined to comment on the matter.
