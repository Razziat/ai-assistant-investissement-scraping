Diversity and collaboration

Women engineers at Thales are supported in a group that embraces Diversity and Inclusion as a cornerstone of innovation, and that recognises in order to achieve a truly diverse workforce we need an array of thoughts, skills and experiences. Collaboration is a fundamental of how we work, giving you opportunities to be your best, in a workplace that supports the way you work, and empowers your continued development.

Diversity is a way of life for a global, multidisciplinary group like Thales.

We promote engagement between staff members with different backgrounds, cultures and experiences — not just to boost our image as a multicultural company, but because diversity and cohesion translate into better performance.

As well as having a strong passion for innovation and high technology, we also understand the value of good professional development opportunities, the importance of structured progression, and the opportunity to work on meaningful programmes where you can make a difference. And, as you will see below, teamwork is highly valued in our dynamic, multicultural environment.

Supporting women into scientific and technical careers

Diversity and inclusion in STEM is vital to Thales because we know that means increased cohesion which translates into better performance.

At Thales we recruit a significant proportion of our workforce from engineering schools, but in some countries the number of women attending these schools is falling. So, Thales is actively engaged in partnership with educational institutions through initiatives aimed at attracting young women to scientific and technical careers.



Thales companies play an active role worldwide supporting local communities and helping local and regional economies. We offer exciting projects, intelligent teams and an excellent work culture – plus are we providing increasingly flexible compensation and benefits packages that are designed to allow return to work following maternity leave.

Take a closer look at Thales

In Australia

Thales Australia's Country Engineering Director Kerry Lunney recently spoke at the Women in Engineering Leadership Summit, which took place earlier in the month.

In Kerry's words ""I presented on the topic of “Jumping from a technical role to technical leadership to executive” using my own career and examples from other technical entities. The number of questions I was asked over 30 minutes and then into the lunch break, followed by numerous LinkedIn requests, leads me to believe I generated much interest and perhaps have assisted a number of female engineers in tackling their future"".

However what resonated with me was the advice given by Nicole van Hattem, on the “5 to Thrive”, specifically in relation to looking after your own well-being in a tough workforce. This applies to everyone and I thought I would share it :

Ask why?

Put your own oxygen mask on first! (Look at what and who you surround yourself with)

Get Up and Move! (Females have a 94% higher risk of death caused by a lifestyle of sitting more than 6 hours daily, compared to 48% for males. Both figures are scary!)

Fuel Your Success! (We are what we eat and drink.)

Switch Off!

Laure Baltzinger is one of the employees that gains inspiration from Kerry.

Laure is currently Air Traffic Management Safety Authority in Melbourne, Australia, where she provides safety strategy guidance and safety governance to current and future projects. During her career, she has been involved in the management and the safety engineering work in a variety of international projects in Air Traffic Management and Aviation domains.

She has been working in Thales for the past six years, starting in Toulouse, capital of the French aviation industry and now discovering the Australian engineering community.

Thales has given Laure the opportunity to develop her engineering skills and at the same time discover new domains, new cultures and new challenges.

In Singapore

According to Dunlin Tan ""The greatest job satisfaction lies in knowing you can make a difference with what you do.”

Dunlin continues, ""I feel privileged every day to work with some of the best talents in the industry. What makes it more fulfilling is to see the work that we do have actual impact in the real world. One of my biggest ambitions is to see a piece of our research actually become a commercial Thales product or solution.

Every day at work, we look at how we can solve a diverse range of challenges that are most important for public and private entities. This job gives me the opportunity to bring my ideas to fruition and helps me explain to my fellow engineers the value our team can bring to the company"".

In China

6月23日，是国际女性工程师日（International Women in Engineering Day，INWED），以此来庆祝世界各地的女性工程师的杰出成就并希望提高女性在工程师领域的关注度。

At Thales In China we celebrated the outstanding achievements of female engineers all over the world and marked the occasion with a series of discussions aimed at raising women's awareness of engineering.

In an article publised on our Wechat channel on the day, our female engineers share their experiences and discuss the choices they made as they moved from student life to the world of work.

You can read the article in full here (chinese).

In Germany

Thales in Germany have organised two events, one internally focused for employees, and another for potential candidates to find out more about the group.

Both events are designed to highlight prospects for women in engineering at a technology leader like Thales Germany, and how to prepare for either a career start - or the next step.

Advice is on hand from colleagues ready to engage with participants during panel discussion and at the subsequent ""Market Place"" where they shared their own experiences . And, the recruiting team are on hand to help with getting ready for your next decisive step with the full list of current vacancies at Thales.

See more here and here, also stay up to date with Thales Deutschland on Xing.

In USA

Thales in the USA is breaking barriers for women in engineering. The team shares a common passion for engineering, technology, and innovation. Ready to take on the big challenges, most importantly they do it together! This week a number of our women engineers got together to raise the profile of engineering at Thales InFlyt and to celebrate how together we are #RaisingTheBar for #INWED18.

In the United Kingdom

Increasing the number of women in Thales and the engineering sector is a business priority. We heavily engage with schools to promote science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) amongst young people, assuring that engineering is an attainable career path for both males and females. This is aligned with the view that engagement needs to be applied across all disciplines, including engineering but also the range of other business functions.

Earlier in the month, Thales UK were part of the Big Rail Diversity Challenge, proving that diverse teams perform better.

And, throughout this week our female engineers have been #raisingthebar on Twitter sharing their perspectives on the importance of diversity and inclusion.

""I am lucky enough to have been able to progress my career within Thales, whilst raising a family at the same time. I have always felt fully supported, and have been allowed the opportunity to work flexibly. This has enabled me to manage my commitments outside of work, alongside achieving my career goals and aspirations.” Sophie Peskett, UK Head of Resourcing

See more in the video below about how Thales in the UK are a supporting Women in STEM.

In Spain

In Spain, 39% of researchers in R&D are women, vis-à-vis the 33% of the European Union. Nevertheless, Thales in Spain are committed to ""No Diversity without Inclusion"" and to fully supporting the new role for women in technology. Led by the HR team, with senior management fully engaged, this has led to concrete measures being out in place.

As an example of best practice in this regard, Thales España has this year signed an agreement with Madrid Polytechnic University to create the “Thales for Diversity” bursaries. These bursaries, in addition to the monetary complement they entail, will offer a company internship to female students each year. These “Thales for Diversity” bursaries include a monetary complement and an internship in the company.

As Director of Engineering, Ana Romera is a member of the Thales España Steering Committee. In a recent interview Ana talks openly about the added value that Diversity and Inclusion brings to an organisation, and about her own career at Thales España.

In Romania

Over the last ten years or so, Thales in Romania has become a major player in the Romanian rail transport industry and now operates a mainline rail Competence Centre employing 200 software engineers, including many women. In their own words:

As a women, the work part is important because it helps us reaching our full potential but what matters more are the friendly environment and the nice people. Here, you have the opportunity to state your point of view, to ask whenever you don’t understand something and receive answers to your questions - see more

Why should women consider a career in Thales? First of all, because we are like a big family. We enjoy working and doing things together. It’s funny, difficult enough and focused on really interesting projects - see more

I admit I was a bit afraid to apply to this company, given my economic profile, but now I know it was the best decision I have took and I enjoyed every single day in this company - see more

Working at Thales

According to Paul Bowles, Global Leader in Talent Acquisition, ""we are committed to giving all our employees the opportunity to be their best. We not only value diversity and teamwork but we also value you as an individual, encourage your unique perspective, and offer you the chance to share your ideas with colleagues who will both challenge and inspire you"".

At Thales, we have started to take steps to ensure all opportunities are open to the widest possible range of candidates. This has started with a conversation inside the group, including a closer look at our historic situation, an award winning worldwide Diversity and Inclusion campaign, and the setting of some ambitious objectives including raising the proportion of externally recruited female employees to 40% over the next few years.

Paul continues, ""this particular objective has challenged us to remove barriers that might put off some candidates from applying, including a fresh look at how we evaluate previous experience, how we can offer flexible working in some locations, and how can engage more meaningfully with candidates and other stakeholders through the application process. We recognise the value of offering an attractive range benefits to all our people, after having listened to what matters most to our employees during a recent series of worldwide focus groups. Work life balance was a key factor for many and in various parts of the world we are being better at smart and flexible working which includes the work-space, the technology we use to connect, and also when we work during the day"".

Our worldwide talent acquisition team is ready to help you. If you are unsure whether your profile matches a particular job posting, then get in touch. We are out there on social media, are ready to answer your questions, and to introduce you to others in the group. And we will seek to understand any particular challenges you might have, as well as your big ambitions for the future regardless of where you are in your career today.

Paul adds ""To see what others are saying about Thales I would encourage you to look at our page on Glassdoor, or to talk to any one of our 64,000 people""."

(ENXTPA:HO) because I’m attracted to its fundamentals. Looking at the company as a whole, as a potential stock investment, I believe HO has a lot to offer. Basically, it is a financially-robust company with a a great history of dividend payments and an optimistic growth outlook. Below is a brief commentary on these key aspects. If you’re interested in understanding beyond my high-level commentary, read the full report on Thales here.

Flawless balance sheet with reasonable growth potential and pays a dividend

HO’s ability to maintain an adequate level of cash to meet upcoming liabilities is a good sign for its financial health. This implies that HO manages its cash and cost levels well, which is a key determinant of the company’s health. HO appears to have made good use of debt, producing operating cash levels of 1.03x total debt in the prior year. This is a strong indication that debt is reasonably met with cash generated.

ENXTPA:HO Future Profit Jun 19th 18

HO is also a dividend company, with ample net income to cover its dividend payout, which has been consistently growing over the past decade, keeping income investors happy.

Thales Alenia Space CEO for Space24.pl: We are the world champion in constellations of telecommunication satellites - Defence24.com,"Fri, 08 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL2RlZmVuY2UyNC5jb20vdGhhbGVzLWFsZW5pYS1zcGFjZS1jZW8tZm9yLXNwYWNlMjRwbC13ZS1hcmUtdGhlLXdvcmxkLWNoYW1waW9uLWluLWNvbnN0ZWxsYXRpb25zLW9mLXRlbGVjb21tdW5pY2F0aW9uLXNhdGVsbGl0ZXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Paweł Ziemnicki: In which segment of the market is your company the leader and what is the area that you would like most to develop?

Jean-Loic Galle: Thales Alenia Space is a satellite company. We are mainly involved in satellite designing and manufacturing. In other words we are not really a part of launch industry even if we supply some small parts to Arianegroup.

As far as satellites are concerned we are covering absolutely all the segments of satellites: telecommunication, observation, science, exploration and navigation. In all of those segments we are the European leader and one of the leaders in the world with some competitors in the US. In the navigation field for example we are providing the Galileo ground segment to the European Commission and also the EGNOS system. We are probably number two in the market of communication satellites. So this is the picture of today.

I would also like to add the fact that we are the world champion in constellations of satellites - telecommunication constellations. We have supplied three constellations so far, the last one being Iridium. We are launching satellites for them this year. It is a constellation of 66 satellites. Having just recently launched a new batch of them today we have 55 satellites in orbit working very well with a very big satisfaction of our customer.

So this is where we are today. If we look into the future what will probably be important is the new segment of what we call ""on-orbit servicing""?

That is exactly what my second question is about. What is the future of on-orbit servicing and what are your company's plans about it?

We have a lot of plans that we have presented to the European Space Agency. We want to become the European tomorrow leader of this technology. It is the segment of the market that will probably increase drastically in the next decade. Obviously there is a problem of space debris removal. There is a lot of debris in different orbits and the situation will be even worse tomorrow. So we have to take care globally of this issue. And I hope that Europe, the European Commission and ESA, probably in cooperation with USA will take care very soon of this problem.

So we are working on robotic technologies in order to take care of this problem. But there are also other kinds of services that will be available tomorrow in space as far as satellites are concerned, including the refueling of satellites, repair of them, the change of payload, including the change of position of satellites. All these things will happen probably around 2025.

Afterwards there will be other things such as factories in space in order to produce big parts, big items for space stations and satellites. But it will happen a little bit later. But generally it is a very promising segment of space industry.

How about all-electric propulsion satellites? Is your company pursuing the trend to design and launch more all-electric propulsion satellites?

Yes, for sure. We have already developed a new product line that we called Spacebus Neo. We decided that this product line will be fully propelled by electricity and not traditional chemical thrusters.

So our new product will be totally electrically propelled. Today if we look at the market around 50% of the telecommunication satellites are no longer chemically propelled. Obviously the trend will increase during the next years. Clearly it will be a technology of propulsion for tomorrow. Moreover it will soon apply also to observation satellites.

You mentioned Thales engagement in science. In what missions is the company taking part in deep space - like for example the NextSTEP mission for the cislunar exploration?

We also have a very strong position in this field through our Italian subsidiary but also French subsidiary. We are participating in most scientific missions by ESA and the European Commission. We are targeting the next ones, without exceptions, including the project of Moon space station. But we are also covering many other missions.

Thales Alenia Space is also contributing to the development of ESA Space Rider, the European concept of the reusable spacecraft. What exactly are you preparing for this project?

We have very successfully made the first prototype which was called IXV. Its mission was a full success. Now we are working with ESA and the Italian Space Agency in order to continue this program under new name which is Space Rider.

ESA is preparing the ministerial conference in 2019. We are pushing in order to make ESA put budget with some member states including Italy on this program. It would allow to build a new vehicle. We think that this vehicle will be very important for in orbit servicing. Such vehicle is needed for this new segment. So we are hoping that this project will be launched in the next two years and we will work in cooperation with Avio company in order to build this vehicle.

Thales is also working on pseudo satellites (HAPS) - platforms like Stratobus. Are you not afraid that if it succeeds it will consume some of your satellite market?

I guess the future of the Stratobus will be brilliant. We are in the middle of the development of this platform. The first trial launch of Stratobus is going to take place at the end of next year. It will really be a breakthrough because we will be the first one to implement such an object into the market. It will be used for different kinds of missions like telecommunication and Earth observation. It is a very flexible vehicle on which you can change the payload whenever you want and especially every year when you bring the Stratobus back to the Earth.

We strongly believe in this project and a lot of countries have already come to us in order to buy Stratobus. I am not afraid of the cannibalization of some part of satellite market by Stratobus. You know it is similar to so called war between GEO satellites and LEO satellites. Some might say that LEO satellites may someday kill the geostationary satellites. I do not think so.

Those products - GEO satellites, LEO satellites, Stratobus and drones - are so different in terms of capability and in terms of performance that you cannot compare them. I see them more as complementary objects in a system providing the customer with different data and different information rather than competitors.

When you compare the performance of the payloads of Stratobus and a GEO satellite you realize that the power of the payload mounted on Stratobus it will be 10 times less than on the big GEO communication satellite. Stratobus cannot then easily replace such satellite. Generally speaking, the constellation of satellites is something global whereas Stratobus is used for local purposes – to observe for example 200 km X 200 km square, so it is totally different in terms of applications, customer's needs and performance. You cannot compare the satellite with HAPS as you cannot compare drones with the satellites although drones can also make pictures for you.

In my opinion both civilian and military customers will soon use data gained by all those platforms. The merged data will provide the customer with the best information. So we do not have to oppose those things. They are totally complementary.

You are starting cooperation with the Polish company SCNTPL. How can it boost the progress of the Polish space industry and support your activities in Poland?

On the one hand Thales Alenia Space is a worldwide leader in satellite industry with more than 40 years of history, so with huge knowledge about space. On the other hand the Polish companies are just staring to work in this area. They have a lot of technological expertise but mainly in other fields. I really think that Polish companies need this kind of partnership if they want to accelerate very quickly. If not, it will be a little bit more difficult for them to be in the position to master satellite manufacturing in a very short term.

So I think this partnership could benefit to the Polish side in order to move further and quickly in the space playing field. At the same time it will benefit to Thales Alenia Space also for different reasons. Firstly, because Poland has decided to be a strong stakeholder at ESA. So it means, that we, as a prime contractor, need to have a Polish partner to work on ESA programs. So building this partnership and having good relationships with Polish partners will help us progress on ESA contracts.

On the other side we are delighted to develop our partnership in Poland: we appreciate in particular the expertise, especially in the mechanical field, combined with the competitiveness of the Polish industry and its value chain.

Thales launches Sophie Ultima camera to enhance night-time combat - Army Technology,"Mon, 11 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFybXktdGVjaG5vbG9neS5jb20vbmV3cy90aGFsZXMtbGF1bmNoZXMtc29waGllLXVsdGltYS1jYW1lcmEtZW5oYW5jZS1uaWdodC10aW1lLWNvbWJhdC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales has launched its four-in-one high performance Sophie Ultima thermal imager. Credit: François Guénet.

Thales has launched its new Sophie Ultima thermal imager, a lightweight high-performance four-in-one camera at the Eurosatory defence and security exhibition in Paris, France. The latest from the Sophie range, the device is ready for connected combat and augmented reality with assistance to support day and night-time operations.

The camera combines tactical binoculars, an infrared target locator, a daytime laser range finder, and a teleconverter into one device. Sophie Ultima weighs 2.5kg and provides even higher performance than previous models.

It also improves target identification over long distances and provides tactical advantages in daylight operations by combining a high-performance glass day channel with the detection capabilities of infrared imaging, detecting body heat at more than 1km away. This enables soldiers to target even camouflaged enemies.

""The armed forces rely on Thales for its expertise in the connectivity, big data, artificial intelligence and cybersecurity technologies that are key to their digital transformation.""

Sophie Ultima delivers collaborative combat benefits such as augmented reality in digitalised operations, which Thales reports enables soldiers to detect enemies sooner and act faster. This allows them to conduct faster strikes while maintaining precision.

The camera can also accommodate future operational requirements and technologies, including the new ‘eXtension’ concept, several plug and play accessories for future capability upgrades.

Using common interfaces and shared maintenance solutions, Sophie Ultima offers significantly reduced instruction, training, and support, and will cover the needs of operational units from squadron leaders to Special Forces, ensuring that the camera is still suitable for each task.

Thales has sold 15,000 Sophie thermal imagers in 55 countries. The Sophie range offers surveillance capability during degraded visibility conditions in the operational theatre, enabling accurate detection, identification, and localisation, ensuring high efficiency to multi-purpose missions."
Thales: the Sophie family grows up - EDR Magazine,"Fri, 22 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVkcm1hZ2F6aW5lLmV1L3RoYWxlcy10aGUtc29waGllLWZhbWlseS1ncm93cy11cNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Paolo Valpolini

With seven systems already part of the Sophie family of hand-held thermal imagers, Thales added an eight one with the aim of further reducing weight and adding modularity, to obtain a lightweight system that maintains all functionalities of a true target acquisition system.

Known as Sophie Ultima, it packs four main capabilities in a single system that weighs less than 2.5 kg with the Bren-Tronics rechargeable battery that ensures four hours operational life.

Looking at the binocular-type imager from the front, on the left side we find the cooled thermal imager, operating in the 3-5 µm band, fitted with a continuous optical zoom giving a 3° – 20° field of view, a boost allowing to reach 2° FoV. The IR channel features a 640×512 pixel matrix, cool-down time being of only three minutes. Moving to the right, at the bottom we find the colour day TV channel, which images can be recorded, a small circular window over the TV channel being that of the laser pointer. At the top we find an optic day channel, with a x7 magnification and a FoV of 26°; this 7×35 optic has been added as direct viewing is definitely the best image that can be made available to the operator, as it respects true colours and lighting.

For decamouflaging purposes the image obtained with the glass day channel can be fused with the thermal one, allowing the operator to spot targets which temperature differs from that of the background. Finally, moving further to the right, we find the eyesafe laser rangefinder, with a range of 8 km. According to Thales, range performances of the new Sophie Ultima are the double of those of previous similar systems, i.e. a tank should be identified at 3 km distance while positive ID of a man should happen at 800 meters. The thermal binocular is fitted with a C/A (Coarse Acquisition) GPS and with an NMEA connection to be linked up to other systems. It also contains a digital magnetic compass and is fitted with numerous interfaces, USB2 for image and video download, Bluetooth, WiFi, Ethernet and RS232. Images are recorded on a micro-SD card. The Sophie Ultima provides image stabilisation and features an optimised man-machine interface. The aforementioned weight is valid for the system in this configuration.

However on the right side, always looking from the front, a module can be attached to add further functionalities; these can be of different types, a SWIR camera, a laser designation module, a celestial north finding for increased accuracy, a TV channel with zoom, an LTE (Long-Term Evolution) communication module, or others, this modularity allowing to adapt the Ultima to the operator mission. The Sophie Ultima is currently in the very last stage of development, Thales planning the delivery of a prototype to the French Direction Générale de l’Armement in early 2019. The Ultima is the high-end product of a new family of Sophie, the next one being known as Sophie Optima; here the TI cooled channel will be replaced by an uncooled 1280 x 1024 microbolometer operating in the 8-12 µm band, with a dual FoV of 10° or 20°. Target weight for this version, which will have reduced performances, a tank will be identified at 1.5 kg, is slightly more than 2 kg. The Sophie Optima should be available in late 2019, early 2020. Thales roadmap includes a third step, which will lead to a mono-function product for observation-only, known as Sophie Proxima, with a target weight of 1 kg, which should become available in 2021-22."
ATLAS ELEKTRONIK and Thales Deutschland to deliver Combat System of K130 Corvettes - Naval Post,"Wed, 27 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vbmF2YWxwb3N0LmNvbS9hdGxhcy1lbGVrdHJvbmlrLWFuZC10aGFsZXMtZGV1dHNjaGxhbmQtdG8tZGVsaXZlci1jb21iYXQtc3lzdGVtLW9mLWsxMzAtY29ydmV0dGVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"ATLAS ELEKTRONIK and Thales Deutschland have jointly been commissioned to deliver the combat system of the German Class K130 Corvette. The order comprises 5 corvettes as well as the Test and Training Centre (EZ/BUZ) in Wilhelmshaven.

With completion scheduled for 2025, the “FüWES K130” consortium formed by the two companies and led by ATLAS ELEKTRONIK will deliver the combat system hardware and also adapt and update the existing Combat Management System software of the K130, first batch (ship 1-5). The contracted solution for Ship 6-10 is identical to the original contract (2003) for the K130, first batch. In line with the re-build requirement, changes in the solution are only related to obsolescence and compliancy with German regulations. Regulations regarding Safety and IT Security are significantly aggravated since commissioning the first batch of corvettes.

Although the industrial situation has changed over the past years, the existing K130 combat system knowledge is preserved within the companies concerned. For this reason, ATLAS ELEKTRONIK will remain responsible for the operational software and Thales will remain responsible for an IT secure combat system infrastructure."
Thales Sonar Upgrades to Extend Australia’s Collins Class Submarine Capability - Asian Military Review,"Thu, 28 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFzaWFubWlsaXRhcnlyZXZpZXcuY29tLzIwMTgvMDYvdGhhbGVzLXNvbmFyLXVwZ3JhZGVzLXRvLWV4dGVuZC1hdXN0cmFsaWFzLWNvbGxpbnMtY2xhc3Mtc3VibWFyaW5lLWNhcGFiaWxpdHkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Australia’s strategic priority on enhancing its submarine capability will be supported by Thales through major upgrades of the sonar systems on all six Collins class submarines. The A$230million contract with Thales is part of a A$542million project approved by the Australian Government for the upgrade of the Collins class sensor capabilities, the key to extending the life and the regional superiority of the Collins fleet.

Thales Australia CEO Chris Jenkins said the Collins sonar upgrades continued a 30 year history of support for the Collins program since the original transfer of sonar technology from France in the 1980’s that formed the basis of the underwater systems business in Australia.

“It is critical that Australia maintain the highest levels of submarine capability from the Collins fleet until the Future Submarine enters service. The sonar systems are the ‘eyes and ears’ of the submarines, and Thales will bring together the best underwater sensing technology from around the world to ensure the Collins remains a potent force” Mr Jenkins said.

Manufacturing and integration work will be carried out at Thales’s underwater systems centre of excellence in Rydalmere, Western Sydney, supporting more than 140 jobs, including 50 people directly employed on the project.

In an internationally collaborative program, the Collins’ legacy cylindrical array will be replaced with a Modular Cylindrical Array (MCA) based on Sonar 2076 submarine technology developed by Thales teams in the UK. The existing flank array will be replaced by the latest generation flank array from Thales teams in France.

Thales will work with local industry including Raytheon Australia as the Combat System Integrator to deliver the upgrades for the six submarines integrating products from other Australian providers including Sonartech Atlas, and L3 Oceania.

Thales is a key strategic partner of the Australian Defence Force and the Royal Australian Navy, and is Australia’s market leader in underwater systems, having supplied advanced sonar and minesweeping systems to naval and civil customers in Australia and overseas for more than three decades.

“France and Australia have collaborated closely on sonar systems for the Collins submarines since the start of the program more than 30 years ago. Thales teams based in France, UK and Australia have worked together as one team to master the sonar technology in Australia and to share know-how with one ambition: assure long term regional superiority for the Royal Australian Navy.” Alexis Morel, Vice-President, Underwater Systems at Thales."

The new product is ready for connected combat and augmented reality and will help to guarantee tactical superiority both night and day.



Thales' new Sophie Ultima thermal imager

Sophie Ultima represents a new generation of 4-in1 thermal imaging devices for dismounted soldiers. It combines tactical binoculars, an infrared target locator, a daytime laser range finder and a teleconverter into a single piece of equipment, significantly reducing size and weight while delivering even higher performance. At 2.5 kg, Sophie Ultima meets the need to progressively reduce the weight of the equipment deployed by armed forces.

Providing significant tactical advantages at night, it makes target identification possible over distances at which competing equipment can only recognise the target type. Most importantly, Sophie Ultima also provides tactical advantages in daytime operations by combining a high performance glass day channel with the detection capabilities of infrared imaging. Through its ability to detect body heat at ranges exceeding 1 Km, this technology will allow soldiers to decamouflage potential enemy soldiers that would previously have been invisible to the naked eye.

With Sophie Ultima, Thales proposes a thermal imager with expanded functionality and augmented performance. This enables it to deliver the benefits of collaborative combat such as augmented reality in a digitalised theatre of operations. Soldiers are able to detect sooner and engage faster, and as a result, strikes are faster, safer and more precise.

The product architecture is fully modular to accommodate future operational requirements and technologies, and includes the new “eXtension” concept, a family of plug & play accessories for future capability upgrades, such as SWIR, communication module, laser designator and laser pointer.

Sophie Ultima offers a significantly reduced instruction, training and support footprint thanks to common user interfaces and shared maintenance solutions, while still ensuring that suitable equipment is available for each task and mission. The new Sophie family will cover the needs of operational units from squadron leaders to Special Forces.

In recent years, Thales has sold 15,000 Sophie thermal imagers in 55 countries.

""The armed forces rely on Thales for its expertise in the connectivity, big data, artificial intelligence and cybersecurity technologies that are key to their digital transformation. With Sophie Ultima, the soldier of the future will master the art of collaborative combat day and night,"" said Jean-Pascal Arrou-Vignod, Vice President, Optronics, Thales."
