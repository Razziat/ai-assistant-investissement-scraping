Both companies will carry out tests to connect directly the payload embarked in the balloon with a smartphone in the ground.

Zero 2 Infinity will provide the balloon in this demonstration, while Thales Alenia Space is developing the future full - scale stratospheric airship.

Cannes, September 11, 2018 – Hispasat, the Spanish satellite communications operator, and Thales Alenia Space, the joint venture between Thales (67%) and Leonardo (33 %), announced today that they are jointly preparing a stratospheric balloon demonstration for 4G/5G telecom applications. Scheduled for October 2018 in southern Spain, the demonstration will test 4G/5G applications by allowing direct communications between smartphones and a High-Altitude Pseudo Satellite (HAPS) – a stratospheric balloon in this case.

To match the early interest of Hispasat for the innovative market of HAPS, Thales Alenia Space, serving as prime contractor for this demonstration and offering its payload expertise of 4G/5G telecommunication missions, is teaming up with Spanish company Zero 2 Infinity, S.L., which will provide the stratospheric balloon, while Thales Alenia Space is developing the future full-scale stratospheric airship, Stratobus.

“Reflecting our ongoing policy of developing innovative solutions to address our customers' needs, we are continuing to study the vast possibilities offered by stratospheric platforms as a complement to geostationary satellites,” said Hispasat CEO Carlos Espinos. “Stratospheric solutions offer greater operational flexibility and agility, enabling us to immediately meet communications and connectivity needs with an infrastructure that provides a huge broadband with a minimum delay, while avoiding all technical and economical limitations derived from a rocket launch. Moreover, this solution entails a smaller environmental footprint than satellites, which is an additional advantage. We take a keen interest in the solution offered by Thales Alenia Space, and it’s ideas like this that keep us at the forefront of space. We are delighted to collaborate with our long-standing partner on such a promising project.”

Jean Loic Galle, CEO of Thales Alenia Space, added: “Thales Alenia Space is taking an incremental approach to this program with Hispasat. We are proud to have earned Hispasat’s trust in our dedicated HAPS solution, namely Stratobus™ – a stratospheric airship that combines the best of drones and satellites to provide a low-cost system that offers autonomous operation and permanent regional coverage, while offering an excellent fit with satellite systems. StratobusTM is designed for a wide range of civil or military applications, including telecommunications, navigation and surveillance. Its position in the stratosphere at an attitude of 20 kilometers is optimal for 4G and 5G telecommunications, with signals sent directly to the end-user’s smartphone in just milliseconds.”

Vietnam Airlines has announced that it has selected the Thales AVANT in-flight entertainment system for installation on board its fleet of eight new Boeing 787-10 Dreamliners.

The selection of the AVANT IFE system further extends the relationship between Thales and Vietnam Airlines, which has already deployed the system on its 787-9s and Airbus A350s.

In collaboration with Hanoi-based Vietnam Airlines Engineering Company, Thales also provides turn-key maintenance services on the IFE systems installed on these aircraft.

“Thales is proud to partner with Vietnam Airlines. This award further demonstrates Thales’ commitment in supporting the airline’s ambitions to provide the best-in-class onboard experience with our state-of-the-art AVANT IFE and aircraft maintenance services,” said Philippe Carette, CEO, Thales InFlyt Experience.

“We are confident that the quality, reliability and advanced technology of our solutions will deliver an exceptional inflight experience on Vietnam Airlines new Dreamliner,” he added.

The 787-10 is Boeing’s most recent – and longest – addition to the Dreamliner series of twin-engine, wide-body aircraft, enabling airlines to increase seating capacity on the “long and thin” routes that the plane’s design specifications are optimized to serve.

Established in 1956 by the Vietnam government, and designated as the country’s flag carrier in 1993, Vietnam Airlines is a member of the SkyTeam Airline Alliance. The carrier flies to 50 destinations in 17 countries, with a fleet of single- and twin-aisle aircraft."

United to offer streaming class of inflight Internet on the 737 MAX - Runway Girl Network,"Mon, 03 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTgvMDkvdW5pdGVkLXRvLW9mZmVyLXN0cmVhbWluZy1jbGFzcy1vZi1pbmZsaWdodC1pbnRlcm5ldC1vbi10aGUtNzM3LW1heC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"While United Airlines has adopted a wide variety of connectivity solutions, ranging from Gogo air-to-ground, Panasonic Ku and Thales/Viasat Ka, the carrier has historically strived to offer a consistent passenger experience across those systems.

United unified the various user interfaces by layering its own portal over the existing Gogo portal. It has also limited the functionality of its speedy Thales/Viasat Ka system – with Thales as the prime contractor – to match the experience of both its Panasonic and Gogo systems. It blocked Netflix, YouTube, Hulu and pretty much any other streaming video service on its flights.

Yet when Viasat Ka is fully unleashed, as seen at JetBlue, it provides an excellent streaming experience. With Viasat serving as prime for Ka installs on the 737 MAX 9 fleet, United has finally unlocked the full capability of the Viasat system on the MAXs, RGN can reveal. (We asked in February if the carrier would ‘unleash the beast’ on these birds; now we know the answer is ‘yes‘).

In an update to its inflight Wi-Fi documentation page, the question is posed: “Can I use Netflix or other streaming video websites?” United’s answer confirms that passengers on the 737 MAX 9 aircraft connected with the Viasat system – and only on the MAX – can stream to their heart’s content. As for the rest of the Wi-Fi equipped fleet, video streaming services will remain blocked.

The 737NG aircraft managed by Thales use a very similar system to the Viasat 737 MAX system (same satellite right now, even) so what accounts for this change? A United spokesperson tells RGN:

We’ve always been interested in offering a Premium Wi-Fi service, which supports streaming and is currently only available on our MAX aircraft via Viasat. We introduced streaming on Viasat equipped aircraft because they have the right service using the latest technology to support streaming.

Does United expect this to expand to other aircraft in the future?

We are currently focused on improving our Wi-Fi’s reliability, which is a priority before adding other enhancements. However, we do know that customers value being able to stream on board, and we are looking into ways to expand this capability to more aircraft.

As to whether there is any messaging on the aircraft to alert passengers that Netflix and streaming is allowed, the United spokesperson says: “When customers visit the Wi-Fi portal on our MAX aircraft, they are alerted that streaming is supported when purchasing the premium Wi-Fi option.”

The frequently asked questions page also confirms that the MAX aircraft will sport Wi-Fi on international flights before the end of the year. “Our new 737 MAX 9s equipped with Viasat Internet are currently entering service and do not have Wi-Fi internet capabilities for international flights, but will begin offering Wi-Fi service on international flights by the end of 2018.”

In February, United signed a deal with Viasat for connectivity on more than 70 aircraft, at least 58 of which will be for the MAX.

The airline has not announced an upgrade path for the hundreds of existing 737NGs with Thales as the prime contractor, though Viasat management has intimated on earnings calls that it is gunning for prime on those birds as well (after winning prime with JetBlue).

Thales's Brazilian subsidiary Omnisys recently obtained certification for the Kingklip as a Strategic Defence Product (PED) in an official endorsement of the Group's decision to develop advanced sonar solutions in Brazil. The Kingklip sonar delivers exceptional performance and is the ideal response to the requirements of the Tamandaré programme.



With Omnisys, Thales is committed to helping develop the Brazilian defence industry. Thales and Omnisys are investing over R$ 20 million (€5 million) in the local production of transducers, making Omnisys the first company to build an industrial infrastructure to manufacture sonar equipment in Brazil.



Also this year, Thales reached another milestone with the Indonesian Navy with the successful installation and integration of the Kingklip hull-mounted sonar on the Diponegoro-class corvette. For more than 40 years, the Group has provided combat systems to help the Indonesian Navy to sustain their capabilities. The Kingklip will further enhance the Navy's ability to meet the country's defence requirements. The sonar upgrade follows a repair of the corvette, which was damaged in an accident during a routine sea operation in January 2015.



Thales worked closely with local industrial partner PT Dharma Satya Nusantara (DSN) on the repair of the system, reinforcing its commitment to long-term relationships with local industry partners, through-life support and the transfer of knowledge and expertise.



Thales has provided more than 150 hull-mounted sonars to more than 20 navies since 1975. In 2017, the Kingklip was selected by the French Navy to equip its La Fayette frigates and the next-generation intermediate frigates being developed on the FTI programme."

But the city has a backup plan, just in case.

The alternative plan involves extending the signalling system used on the older Capital Line to parts of the Metro Line, said the report, expected to be discussed by council on Tuesday.

The report said the city will start installing that extended system in early 2019, if required. Consultants and contractors have been contacted to help with development and implementation.

The battle between the city and Thales has stretched on for years.

In May, the city issued a notice of default on the $55-million contract after Thales failed to fix the system by council's April 30 deadline.

The Metro Line LRT, with stops at MacEwan University, the Royal Alexandra Hospital and NAIT, opened in 2015, more than a year behind schedule.

But the signalling system on the line has still not been fully merged with the one on the Capital Line LRT, resulting in slower trains and reduced frequencies."

MESMER software has been integrated into the Thales Bushmaster vehicle to produce the first robust mobile MESMER unit, aimed at deployment by military forces. D13’s MESMER is a counter drone system that provides a safe and effective method of protecting personnel and infrastructure from dangerous drones. D13 has been working with Thales to develop the system and by integrating the prototype into the Bushmaster MESMER can, for the first time, be operated from a mobile vehicle as well as acting as a standalone fixed system.

Thales is a France-based global provider of aerospace, space, security, defence and ground transportation solutions. Currently exported to seven separate countries, the Bushmaster is predominantly utilised as a troop carrier, weapons deployment vehicle, ambulance, patrol or support vehicle.

============== ==============

MESMER software operates on the Bushmaster’s Electronic Warfare Platform, which is one of the additional mission systems equipment and integration capabilities that Thales offers within the Bushmaster.

Jonathan Hunter, chairman and CEO of D13, said, ""I am very pleased to be able to announce the integration of MESMER onto a mobile platform. This comes as the result of a collaborative effort, with D13, EPE and Thales Australia, and highlights the flexibility of the MESMER software and its ability to quickly integrate into existing software and hardware platforms.""

MESMER is a unique and patented drone mitigation solution. It is low power, non-jamming, non-line of sight, and non-kinetic. MESMER provides a safe and effective method of protecting personnel and infrastructure from dangerous drones. The key differentiator for MESMER is its ability to manipulate weaknesses in all digital radio protocols.

This allows MESMER to execute sophisticated automated detection and mitigation strategies that stop, redirect, land or take control of drones across a range of national security and defence scenarios. MESMER's patented technology is built on open source software architecture. This ensures that MESMER can be seamlessly integrated into existing security and surveillance systems.

The MESMER v1.5 system has three key components:

A general purpose computer server running Linux OS. Multiple Ethernet ports are utilised for intra-system communication; Software defined radios (SDR) that are commercially available for RF signal reception and generation. SDRs can generate arbitrary waveforms which are used to detect, identify and mitigate drones; and An RF front end that provides signal conditioning on both receive and transmit channels, and that allows MESMER to perform optimally in a real-world environment.

Thailand’s Defence Technology Institute to digitalise Armed Forces’ capabilities - Asian Military Review,"Thu, 13 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFzaWFubWlsaXRhcnlyZXZpZXcuY29tLzIwMTgvMDkvdGhhaWxhbmRzLWRlZmVuY2UtdGVjaG5vbG9neS1pbnN0aXR1dGUtdG8tZGlnaXRhbGlzZS1hcm1lZC1mb3JjZXMtY2FwYWJpbGl0aWVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The digital revolution has opened up a world of possibilities for armies by allowing them to use the best technology to outsmart opponents. Precise and secure digital radio communication is essential for soldiers in the battlefield to communicate critical information, make quick decisions, react to future threats and get the edge in the battlefield.

As the Royal Thai Army seeks to digitalise its capabilities for network-centric operations, Thales, Datagate (Thales’ key industrial partner) and the Thai Defence Technology Institute (DTI) have signed a Memorandum of Agreement (MoA) to further enhance collaboration in the Communications domain for military vehicles application.

The MoA follows a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed in September 2017 which paved the way for Thales and DTI to collaborate closely in research and development related to air defence and digital communications systems. With this new agreement, the first common project for all parties will be dedicated to the upgrade of the Royal Thai Army’s existing fleet of Armored Personal Carrier (APC).

The MoA focuses on upgrading the APCs with a C5I (Computerised, Command, Control, Communications and Combat Information) operational solution, integrating both VHF and HF combat net radios, a Battle Management System (BMS) for tactical command and control, and vehicle electronics integration. To develop expertise in Thailand, Thales will progressively transfer technology and knowledge to DTI, enabling, at the end, the capability for Thailand to design, integrate and validate C5I systems on any local platform.

Coupled with training courses focused on programming, robust digital vehicle architecture, manufacturing, maintenance and services, Thales supports the long-term ambitions of the Thai government to grow its capabilities in the high-end digital domain. This agreement further underscores Thales’ commitment to supporting Thailand 4.0, with one of its objectives being the development of local Thai capabilities in the defence industry, through knowledge and technology transfer.

“Thales is always looking to empower local capabilities in the defence industry so that they may continually develop technologies and take these innovations to greater heights. Additionally, we are glad to partner with Datagate and DTI and are fully supportive of DTI becoming Thailand’s Vehicle Infrastructure Design Authority for military vehicle application.”

From September 18th to 21st at #InnoTrans2018 Thales presents intelligent sensor technology for railways consisting of Lite4ceTM sensor and Lite4ceTM evaluator.

Thales smart fibre optical wheel sensing technology

The application of fibre optical technology eliminates limitations of classic electro-magnetic systems such as electromagnetic interference and enables significant distances between sensors and EAK.

The Thales Lite4ce™ sensor is based on Fibre Bragg Grating technology, which enables sensors on the rail to safely detect a variety of parameters on rolling stocks. These include the safe detection of wheels, the quality of the wheels as well as the speed and weight of vehicles.

Innovative technology

The Thales Lite4ce™ sensor is based on Fibre Bragg Grating technology, which enables sensors on the rail to safely detect a variety of parameters on rolling stocks. These include the safe detection of wheels, the quality of the wheels as well as the speed and weight of vehicles.

Lite4ce™ sensor is equipped with a heat-activated adhesive foil. The sensor is bonded to the rail web using an innovative adhesive device. Calibration or adjustment of the sensor for commissioning, as is necessary with all conventional sensors, is eliminated.

Fibre vs Copper

The exclusive use of fibre optic sensors together with fibre optic cables significantly reduces the investment costs for the track occupacy signalling device.

Lite4ce™ sensing technology eliminates the need for any electronics in the track area or along the track. Instead of the copper cabling as in conventional sensors, the much cheaper fibre optic cabling is used. At the same time, all systems to protect cabling against overvoltage are eliminated. The use of a data transmission system on the fibre optic cable is also not necessary.

Furthermore, the use of Lite4ce™ smart sensing technology enables significant savings in operation costs.

Maintenance of the Lite4ce ™ sensor is not necessary. The energy consumption of the Lite4ce™ track detector significantly decreases compared to conventional systems. The Lite4ce™ sensor is immune to any kind of electromagnetic interference from rail vehicles on the train detection equipment.

Sarah Tack: setting the global strategy for safety - Thales,"Thu, 20 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi91bml0ZWQta2luZ2RvbS9uZXdzL3NhcmFoLXRhY2stc2V0dGluZy1nbG9iYWwtc3RyYXRlZ3ktc2FmZXR50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Sarah Tack, Head of HSE, Ground Transportation Systems

Sarah Tack is one of the many talented women working at Thales, inspiring young engineers and professionals across London and the UK.

She is the Head of Health Safety and Environment (HSE) for Thales’s Ground Transportation Systems global business, and has been with Thales for over six years, during which time she was awarded the prestigious Guardian Angel Award at the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) Occupational Health and Safety Awards in London. This is an award celebrating individuals who make a difference in safety and accident prevention in the workplace, so who better than the Head of GTS’s HSE team to be recognised with such an award.

Sarah is responsible for setting the global strategy and direction of the HSE agenda. Given that Thales operates within the project and services environments in around 30 countries, all of which have significant risks, there is a wide variety of cultural issues and delivery variations to deal with, so Sarah has a busy schedule.

“One day I could be supporting the ‘Four Lines Modernisation’ (4LM) project, which is an immensely complex programme that Thales is running with Transport for London to upgrade the signaling system on four of the busiest London Underground tube lines, looking at ways to reduce our safety risks. Another day I could be in the Middle East, South Africa or Singapore looking at how we better collaborate with our customers to support the HSE challenges on projects that Thales is delivering,” she explained her role when we caught up with her.

This is not the first role or industry in which Sarah has excelled through the years. She has worked in construction, manufacturing, and also health and fitness. Through all these roles she had to do a lot of travelling, and therefore developed the resilience to help her focus and not give in easily in the face of adversity and complications. “I have also done a lot of long-distance running so I think I have great determination to keep going even when it really does hurt a lot”, she adds.

Engineering work, construction and manufacturing was not what the 10-year old Sarah had her heart set on though. “I was into gymnastics and ballet, and anything else that meant being physically active and not studying academically,” she admits.

Moreover, she didn’t have much encouragement in this decision. “If I am truthful, there are people in my family who are still to this day somewhat puzzled by my choices,” she explains.

So how did she land this role? “When I finished travelling round the world in my 20s the realisation hit that I needed to look to the future and find a career. One of the jobs I had enjoyed most when travelling was working in a project office for a large construction company, helping out with the coordination of their health and safety. On looking at opportunities in the UK I discovered there were many similar roles. My first role was at Ford Motor Company in the area of workers health. It all really developed from there, gaining qualifications and experience, and then moving into construction and transportation over the years”, she recounts.

While her role takes her to some great places, Sarah admits that one of her career highlights has been the realisation that she “can make a real difference globally, and that a significant amount of people from around the world have been supportive and receptive to [her] guidance and suggestions”.

Sarah and Thales are keeping London safe, secure and on the move."
What do you want to be when you grow up? An astronaut! - Thales,"Thu, 27 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi93b3JsZHdpZGUvc3BhY2UvbmV3cy93aGF0LWRvLXlvdS13YW50LWJlLXdoZW4teW91LWdyb3ctYXN0cm9uYXV00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"September 27th 2018 - Today is a historic moment for space aficionados. Two astronauts from the European Space Agency met today at the European Space Research Institute (ESRIN) to share their experience in orbit. One is Italian; the other is French... I have named Luca Parmitano and Thomas Pesquet; two famous astronauts who have made a significant contribution to making space activities accessible to a very wide audience. In 2019, Luca Parmitano will fly back to the ISS. Fair wind to you Luca!

From Sicily to Space

January 18, 2017. ESA Director General Jan Woerner confirms that Luca Parmitano will fly a second mission to the International Space Station in 2019. Next year ESA astronaut Luca Parmitano is returning to the ISS, this time as commander during the second part of his flight, becoming the first Italian astronaut to command the Space Station. Luca Parmitano is preparing for his second trip into space by training and running simulations of the new experiments that he will conduct alongside NASA astronaut Andrew Morgan and Roscosmos astronaut Alexander Skvortsov. The trio will be part of Expeditions 60/61 on the ISS.

In February 2011, Luca was assigned as a flight engineer to the Italian space agency ASI's first long-duration mission on the International Space Station, Volare. Luca spent 166 days in space, conducting over 20 experiments and overseeing the docking of four spacecraft. He also made two spacewalks, becoming the first Italian to take part in an “extravehicular activity” (EVA). The ESA astronaut and his colleagues also became social media stars – in particular through Luca’s Twitter account @astro_luca – by recounting their day to day experiences, both personal and professional. They especially communicated with the young, to stir their curiosity and inspire science, technology and engineering vocations, while whetting their appetites for the fantastic adventure of spaceflight.

Thomas Pesquet : the Space photographer

November 17, 2016. Astronauts Peggy Whiston, Oleg Novitski and Thomas Pesquet, representing NASA, the Russian space agency Roscosmos, and the European Space Agency (ESA), have boarded the Soyuz MS-03 capsule. The Proxima mission is in the starting blocks, ready to take these three astronauts to the ISS, circling the Earth at an altitude of 400 kilometers. After the traditional countdown, the rocket lifts off. The launch is successful, everybody is smiling! Peggy, Oleg and Thomas arrive safe and sound two days later, as the Soyuz docks to the ISS. They get a hero’s welcome – and now it’s time to get to work!

Thomas is the tenth French astronaut to travel to the Space Station. He has chalked up 196 days in orbit, participated in 55 scientific experiments and taken over 2,000 photos from the Cupola, the preferred viewing point of ISS astronauts, built by Thales Alenia Space. @Thom_astro [his Twitter handle] quickly starts to share his passion for space with the public. Above all, it’s his photos of our planet from space that have attracted the most attention. Thomas shot the Earth from all angles and both day and night, ranging from desert landscapes to snow-covered land, and some very popular offbeat shots.

Half of the ISS's pressurized volume built by Thales Alenia Space

The International Space Station holds a special place in the hearts of Thales Alenia Space’s engineers. The company has provided fully half of the pressurized volume on the ISS, including Nodes 2 and 3, the Leonardo Permanent Multipurpose Module (PMM), Multipurpose Logistics Modules (MPLM), Cupola, Columbus lab structure, cargo modules for the ATV resupply vessels and the Bishop Airlocks structure for NanoRacks. Thales Alenia Space also builds, on behalf of Northrop Grumman, the pressurized cargo modules (PCM) for the Cygnus resupply vessels, set for its next launch scheduled in the upcoming months.

The Bushmaster will now come equipped with MESMER systems developed by American security developer Department 13 (D13) to take control of suspect drones that defence personnel don’t want buzzing around.

MESMER, named after early an early proponent of hypnotism Franz Friedrich Anton Mesmer, monitors unlicensed radio frequencies to passively pick up signals going between a drone and its operator.

Unlike other counter-drone devices such as those used during the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games earlier this year, MESMER doesn’t jam the radio frequencies being sent to the drone, nor does it rely on physical measures like bullets, nets or eagles to knock the aircraft out of the sky.

Instead, the Linux-based system can take advantage of protocol weaknesses and take command of the drone, either forcing it to land in a safe area or sending it back to its launch site.

The first mobile prototype for the system will be incorporated into the Bushmaster’s electronic warfare platform.

Thales and Microsoft unveiled in June a portable Azure stack for the Bushmaster to provide armed forces greater connectivity and end-to-end cybersecurity and encryption solutions for IT operations on the go.

The collaboration between Thales Australia and D13 was unveiled at Adelaide’s Land Forces event on Tuesday."
TfL awards Thales £380m contract without competition - Transport Network,"Tue, 04 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYW5zcG9ydC1uZXR3b3JrLmNvLnVrL1RmTC1hd2FyZHMtVGhhbGVzLTM4MG0tY29udHJhY3Qtd2l0aG91dC1jb21wZXRpdGlvbi8xNTI4MNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Transport for London (TfL) is to award a contract worth up to £380m to maintain and upgrade a key communications system for the London Underground without competition after admitting that it has ‘no reasonable alternative’.

The body, which comes under the control of London mayor Sadiq Khan, has published a voluntary ex ante transparency notice for a contract award without prior publication.

The contract will be awarded to contractor Thales, the only shareholder in special purpose vehicle CTL that is active in the provision of services under a PFI contract dating back to 1999, which is due to expire next year.

Shashi Verma, chief technology officer at TfL, said: 'Having considered the current telecoms market, TfL intends to enter into an interim contract with Thales Transport and Security Limited (Thales) to continue providing the Connect radio system for four years, with an option to extend for a further three years.

'Doing so will allow us to get best value for money, ensure the continued operation and safety of the London Underground as well as deliver upgrades and extensions to the system.'

The notice claims that ‘for technical reasons and reasons connected with exclusive IP [intellectual property] rights, there is currently no reasonable alternative to LUL engaging Thales under the Interim Contract’.

The value of the contract over the full seven years is stated to be £380m, of which £110m is ‘likely to be subcontracted to third parties’.

The original PFI contract covers the Connect digital radio and transmission system, which provides voice radio between LUL control centres and train drivers, safety alarms for drivers and other staff, fixed cable voice and data connections between stations, and other links.

The notice explains that Thales is responsible for the operation and maintenance of the Connect system, which uses a TETRA (TErrestrial Trunked Radio) radio system supplied by Motorola as contractor to CTL, using its Dimetra product.

At the expiry of the PFI, the Connect system assets will transfer to LUL. However, the notice states that ‘Thales has the essential know how to build, integrate and commission the upgraded radio system without disrupting the railway operations. As Motorola owns the exclusive IP rights in the Dimetra product, the necessary upgrade to the radio system can only be delivered with Motorola’s involvement (as contractor to Thales).’

According to LUL, it came to the conclusion that there is ‘currently no reasonable alternative’ but to extend its use of the Connect system ‘having considered the current telecoms market, such as other TETRA solutions, 4G/LTE, 5G and FRMCS’.

The notice states: ‘Recognising the need to ensure the continued operation and safety of the LU railway, it is essential that some hardware and software in the Connect system is upgraded, such as the core radio system and the entire dispatcher control system.

‘This will require extensive intrusive work on the Connect system to design, install, test, commission and deploy these elements without interrupting the LU railway services, all of which work needs to start this year and is anticipated to take 2 — 3 years to complete (i.e. will start before the end of the PFI Contract and will not complete until after expiry of that contract).’

LUL says it will ‘at the earliest feasible opportunity either bring the services in-house or run a competitive procurement process for such services’.

However, it adds that it ‘needs to be able to do this at a time and in a manner which does not put LU railway operations at risk whilst undertaking upgrade works to the Connect System'.

The notice breaks down the potential £380m cost of the interim contract as follows:

Estimated fees until 21.11.23:

asset management, support and maintenance fees of £120m,

contemplated upgrade works of £40m, some of which are needed and some optional (at LUL's discretion),

estimated additional variation works of £55m,

Estimated fees from 22.11.23 until 21.11.26:

asset management, support and maintenance fees of £90m,

contemplated upgrade works of £40m, all of which are optional,

estimated additional variation works of £35m."
ANAO releases scathing report into Hawkei - Australian Defence Magazine,"Thu, 13 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1c3RyYWxpYW5kZWZlbmNlLmNvbS5hdS9idWRnZXQtcG9saWN5L2FuYW8tcmVsZWFzZXMtc2NhdGhpbmctcmVwb3J0LWludG8taGF3a2Vp0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) has released a report into the Land 121 Phase 4 project to acquire the Thales Hawkei.

The report acknowledges that all the material it drew upon cannot be released publically. In formal language, the ‘Disclaimer of Conclusion’ essentially means that the ANAO has blacked out many parts of their supporting evidence and is not able to “express a clear conclusion on the audit objective” in light of that measure. The redacting of material is formed on the basis that “it would prejudice the security, defence or international relations of the Commonwealth; it would unfairly prejudice the commercial interests of any body or person”.

Nevertheless, the report is bluntly brutal in its assessment of the management methodology during the decision making process leading up to First and Second Pass. In October 2015 the Commonwealth entered into contract with Thales Australia for the acquisition and support of 1,100 Hawkei PMV-L and 1,058 companion trailers.

ANAO

“Defence did not provide robust benchmarking of the Hawkei and the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) option to the government at Second Pass, to inform the government’s decision in the context of a sole source procurement,” according to the report. “At Second Pass, Defence advised the government that the Hawkei would be approximately 23 per cent more expensive to acquire than the JLTV but would also be more capable. Without robust benchmarking of cost and capability, Defence was also unable to apply competitive pressure in its negotiations with Thales. Defence did not inform the minister appropriately when material circumstances changed immediately after Second Pass.”

The report explores the timeline of the project, from the examination of the US JLTV program involvement and comparative benchmarking from 2009, the Manufactured and Supported (MSA) campaign for the project in 2011, through to the contract negotiations for the Hawkei which are still ongoing with change proposals commonplace. Defence gave formal approval for the Hawkei to enter Low-Rate Initial Production on 11 August, 2017.

Thales provided design approval for the Hawkei in March this year, with a number of known deficiencies and a plan for rework, according to the report.

“At a meeting of the Defence–Thales Strategic Relationship Board in March 2018, Defence stressed that ‘the ongoing Hawkei reliability problems were a concern’,” according to the ANAO report. “The schedule pressures built into the project, together with the recent reliability issues, have resulted in contract schedule changes during 2017–18. Defence has observed, in the context of the 10 July 2018 Gate Review, that:

Over the past 18 months the schedule ‘float’ between the contract and MAA [Materiel Acquisition Agreement] schedules has reduced from approximately six months, to one and two months for IOC [Initial Operational Capability] and FOC [Final Operational Capability], respectively. The critical path to IOC remains primarily dependent upon the successful completion of PRAT [Production Reliability Acceptance Test].”

In order to respond to these delays, the next period of testing under PRAT will now involve eight vehicles rather than four and will be undertaken over eight months rather than 14 in order to make up lost time.

However, a Gate Review in July this year noted that “the vehicles are now in their sixth cycle of reliability failure–redesign–retest but the results to date remain well below the requirement. Despite more than seven years of development Army’s Protected Mobility Vehicle — Light has not yet achieved the required level of reliability which has been significantly reduced during the period.”

ADM Comment: The fact that Thales sought a legal injunction over the matter in May via the Federal court and later received a letter from the Attorney General telling the ANAO to back off essentially (available in the appendices of the report) sets a precedent. What this means for subsequent ANAO reports into Defence programs remains to be seen.

As to whether Defence conducted ‘effective procurement processes between 2011-2014’ the ANAO is not convinced and is outright sceptical of their ability to keep government decision makers informed. Box 1 on P38 is particularly enlightening reading on this point. A letter (P76 for those reading the report at home) co-signed by Defence Secretary Moriarty and Chief of the Defence Force General Angus Campbell disagrees with the ANAO assessment that the LRIP contract was signed with a ‘lack of appropriate scrutiny’.

Hindsight is a wonderful thing but not available in the moment when key decisions are being made

The back and forth contractually that a developmental program consists of is no surprise to those experienced in this space. Good planning only covers so much when you have unknown unknowns to account for. Looking at any other ANAO report into developmental programs, like Thales’ own Bushmaster (which is a frequent character in this report), is testament to this.

Hindsight is a wonderful thing but not available in the moment when key decisions are being made.

A response letter from Thales Australia CEO Chris Jenkins is also illuminating, highlighting the fact that the ANAO didn’t much like Bushmaster either. Selective comparisons with the JLTV program are unhelpful given that programs performance issues as well, according to his statement available in the appendices. Jenkins rightly points out that the policy settings surrounding Australian industry content and sovereignty have also changed significantly over the life of the Hawkei program.

While that last point might be true, once again hindsight is a valuable thing. The change in policy settings could not have been predicted at the time of contract signature that saw Hawkei effectively used as a support base for Thales’ Bushmaster production capability and the not insignificant R&D efforts from Thales to bring Hawkei off the page and onto a test track.

“Hawkei delivers life-saving capability to the ADF, designed and manufactured in Australia,” Thales said in the wake of the report. “The Bushmaster program demonstrated beyond question that maintaining a sovereign capability in protected vehicle design, engineering and manufacture saved Australian soldiers’ lives.

“It is disappointing that the ANAO places zero value on maintaining this life-saving industrial capability; zero value on Australian content and zero value on Australian jobs.

“Thales Australia welcomes the engagement with industry during the preparation of the ANAO report, resulting in the exclusion from the final report of sensitive details that might have endangered soldiers’ lives or unfairly prejudiced commercial interests if published,” the statement concludes.
