"The Right Way to Get Your First 1,000 Customers - HBR.org Daily","Tue, 02 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vaGJyLm9yZy9wb2RjYXN0LzIwMTkvMDQvdGhlLXJpZ2h0LXdheS10by1nZXQteW91ci1maXJzdC0xMDAwLWN1c3RvbWVyc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales Teixeira, associate professor at Harvard Business School, believes many startups fail precisely because they try to emulate successful disruptive businesses. He says by focusing too early on technology and scale, entrepreneurs lose out on the learning that comes from serving initial customers with an imperfect product. He shares how Airbnb, Uber, Etsy, and Netflix approached their first 1,000 customers very differently, helping to explain why they have millions of customers today. Teixeira is the author of the book Unlocking the Customer Value Chain: How Decoupling Drives Consumer Disruption.

CURT NICKISCH: Welcome to the HBR IdeaCast from Harvard Business Review. I’m Curt Nickisch.

A lot of the advice for budding entrepreneurs goes like this: offer something that is ten times better than what’s on the market, build network effects, put in place a technology infrastructure, and own the end-to-end customer experience. And when you look at successful, disruptive businesses like Uber and Airbnb, those lessons ring true.

But our guest today believes many startups fail because they try to do all that from the get-go and that that’s a big mistake. He says a key reason that Airbnb and Uber are expected to go public soon is because they ignored some of those truisms early on and that how they approached their first 1,000 customers differently helps explain why they have millions of customers today.

Our guest today is Thales Teixeira. He’s an associate professor at Harvard Business School and he’s the author of the book Unlocking the Customer Value Chain: How Decoupling Drives Customer Disruption. Thales, thanks for coming on the show.

THALES TEIXEIRA: Thanks for having me, Curt.

CURT NICKISCH: I want to talk to you about these early-stage companies because you focus on that in the book, taking your business from zero to 1,000 customers. Clearly, that’s a different stage, but why is it so unique?

THALES TEIXEIRA: So, my experience at Harvard, I teach courses on e-commerce and I teach courses on digital marketing and quite a few of my students in the past few years have been launching their own businesses and they start off the process of launching by trying to emulate companies that are successful and are similar to them.

CURT NICKISCH: This is where you get everybody saying the Netflix of this and the Uber of that.

THALES TEIXEIRA: Yeah, so they already emulate it in the way they think about the business, but they also emulate it in the way they try to acquire new customers. And I say, “Wait a minute. Why – you’re a startup, you’re trying to acquire your first 10 customers. Why are you looking at Uber who’s already had millions of customers and is trying to acquire them?”

If you’re trying to learn how to walk and you look at Usain Bolt, the fastest man on the planet and try to observe how he’s running and say, “I’m going to do the same thing.” It’s not going to work. Why? Because you’re at a completely different phase in your life.

And so, unfortunately for these entrepreneurs, there’s not many articles or explanations of Uber, Airbnb, Amazon, what did they do in the early days? How did they acquire their first 100 customers or 10 customers? What they did, in the beginning, Airbnb, Uber, Etsy, and all these other big companies is not what they’re doing now that they’re huge.

CURT NICKISCH: You’re looking basically at Uber’s baby steps.

THALES TEIXEIRA: That’s right.

CURT NICKISCH: To figure out why they’re running as fast as they are today. What is different about those first steps and how are early customers different?

THALES TEIXEIRA: So, you’re a startup. You don’t have a lot of money. You don’t have all these resources. Therefore, the chances that you’re going to build a product or service that is so much better than what’s available out there in the market today is very, very slim.

And so, when you acquire those first few customers, that is practically an aberration. It shouldn’t have happened. You should really keep asking yourself, “why did they buy from me and not the alternative?” You should make it as a puzzle.

In my experience these startups, they go too much in the process of optimizing to get as many customers as possible at the lowest cost possible. And they forget that what they’re trying to do is understand what should they build for their customers and why are customers even interested in their products?

CURT NICKISCH: I mean it’s understandable why they do that. If you don’t have a lot of resources you want to keep costs low, but that takes you down a different path of thinking that you essentially, you end up learning the wrong things and developing the wrong skills at that stage.

THALES TEIXEIRA: That’s right. And the alternative to acquiring customers at low cost is not acquiring customers at high cost. In the beginning, the alternative is not acquiring customers at all.

In the beginning, Uber did not have the great experience that it has today. You would download an app and you would actually have to send a text message or call somebody and there would be an Uber employee that would receive your message or your phone call and would frantically try to call other black car companies – that’s how they started – and try to get somebody to go pick you up wherever you were. And so, it wasn’t this automatic process that it is today.

The same thing with Airbnb. Airbnb was actually you were renting an airbed which is an inflatable mattress and somebody would make you a hot meal once you woke up. Are those 10 times better products than what’s available out in the market today? There’s so many good hotels. They were not. So, why? Why would anybody go through this process?

Well, the secret is these businesses, in the beginning, they looked for pockets of demand, of consumers that weren’t satisfied, weren’t being satisfied by the traditional players. So, Airbnb launched in the national conventions of political parties, in San Francisco, and in Austin, they did a South by Southwest.

And during those times these cities had 100% occupancy in hotels. And so, if you were one of the last ones to go there you just basically had no place to stay. And so, when Airbnb came and said, “Hey, stay in somebody’s house and pay 30, 40, 50 bucks per night,” people were like either I do that or I don’t have a place to stay.

The same thing Uber – Uber launched in places and in times where people could not get cabs. Think about after a major sports event, or a concert. People, there were thousands of people coming out needing cabs at the same time. And so, Uber made sure to be in these places where the alternative was nothing. And that’s how it acquired its first customers.

CURT NICKISCH: So, in those cases, they’re not even competing with anybody at that time.

THALES TEIXEIRA: Exactly. And that’s the point. Figure out how you can compete with no other options. You need time and resources to build a better product. And in the process, you need to acquire these first few customers that are going to help you in some regards.

First, they don’t have options. Second, customers do more for your business in the beginning than just pay you, just give you a check. Customers can do so many things. Number one, customers can talk to other acquaintances about your product and that’s much of how both Etsy and Uber came about because people used them and they liked it and they told other people about it. So word of mouth was important.

Second, these early customers, there’s a reason why they’re going for you because they’re not fully satisfied, or they’re happy to kind of take a chance of a new startup. So, you should make sure that you take care of them and help them help themselves. Why are they doing that? They’re interested in talking to their acquaintances about new startups. New apps. New things like that. So, support them and give them the resources.

Third, these consumers, they can actually provide you R&D that you traditionally would need to test and evaluate, get consumer groups, focus groups, pay for that. They’re willing to tell you for free what is working, what is not working in their business.

There’s even a startup that I advise. It’s a business-to-business application. So, instead of hiring people to go on the phone to do product support and help when their customers call in and say “I don’t know how to do this, I don’t know how to do that.” They actually gave these consumers the task of teaching the new consumers how to operate the software.

So, all of these things consumers are willing to do, and the alternative would be to hire people to do marketing, to do R&D, to do product development, to do product testing, to do consumer support.

CURT NICKISCH: You haven’t mentioned technology, hiring coders. You haven’t mentioned a lot of the things that we associate with big, new technology, disruptive companies. Are you going to get to that or is this something that’s intentionally missing?

THALES TEIXEIRA: So, this is intentionally missing because this is intentionally not part of the success stories of startups in their early days. Uber did not have any innovative technology in its early days. Those drivers actually had a GPS connected phone, so for the first time ever you would see a car coming closer to you. But that was it.

Airbnb had no new technologies. Even Amazon in the beginning. They were selling books. No new technologies. Etsy, no new technologies. Netflix had no new technologies. They were just buying DVD’s and shipping them from different shipping facilities.

And so, the important thing that a tech entrepreneur should see is that it’s this idea that we commonly refer to as the iceberg. Only the tip is the technology, but under the technology, there’s a lot of operational excellence in all these companies. These startups, in the beginning, they had to just go outside of the internet and recruit customers knocking on doors.

Etsy decided to actually go into all these fairs across the United States, having people travel to all these craft fairs and recruit sellers because the sellers would eventually recruit their own buyers to the website instead of just using digital marketing. The technology eventually becomes important in a differentiating factor. But in the early days, it’s definitely not true.

CURT NICKISCH: Yeah. This makes me think of Pinterest also which really incubated its early customers by being really judicious about who they invited onto the platform at first. So, they really focused on designers and photographers, and they tried to create a culture that eventually everybody else would emulate when they weren’t able to manage every single person on there like they did at the beginning. But it just sort of helped set the stage for what they were trying to do.

THALES TEIXEIRA: And it helped set the tone for quality. So, there’s a great story on Airbnb that it was doing well in many cities in the U.S., but it was doing very poorly in New York City. And the founders of Airbnb went there. First, they went and they stayed in a few Airbnb rentals – a few private homes – to try to understand what was going on and it turns out the quality of the homes, the apartments were pretty good, but the quality of the images in the website were really bad.

So, they decided to instead of trying to convince everybody to take better pictures, they just rented a very expensive camera and went from apartment to apartment in Manhattan and would say, “we’re going to take the pictures for you” and they would take professional quality pictures instead of the cell phone pictures that were being uploaded.

And suddenly people started seeing this in a better light and that created the standard for all of the other ones. So, this comes back to this – do things that don’t necessarily scale. Scale is a problem of when you’re growing fast. If you’re small and you don’t get to that phase, there’s no point in trying to do things at scale if you’re going to die beforehand.

CURT NICKISCH: One of the common things that any founder is told who has an idea is that you need to partner with your CTO early on. That’s maybe your co-founder is going to be a technical person. And so, I’m just wondering if that is necessary? Are these startups that start out by building an app and really focusing heavily on the technology early – are they going about that wrong?

THALES TEIXEIRA: Well, I think that it depends actually on what type of business we’re talking about. If it is a business in which the value to the consumer will be delivered through the technology primarily, you need to build something. You need to build the infrastructure and that a CTO will do. But if the infrastructure to deliver value to consumers is not primarily through technology, through an app, through a website then probably you can get away early on without having to hire a partner with a – you know, a CTO that will build a technology.

So, to give two examples. So, all of these startups right now, there’s this craze of direct-to-consumer startups that are selling anything that you can probably see in your home, that you would normally buy in a grocery store, in a supermarket. Now there’s a startup, they’re just trying to make a better product and deliver it for you. Toothbrushes. There are beauty products. Pet care. All of these things. And mattresses.

The technology’s not the primary driver of the experience for these products, it’s the products itself. And you can easily create a website and offer that product. And so, having a CTO early on is not kind of the main driver of your early customer adoption.

Whereas, obviously if you’re building kind of a business to business software, then the way you’re delivering it is through software and obviously having a CTO will be of primary importance. So, it depends on the type of business. The question that entrepreneurs should be asking is, what is the primary driver of value to the customers that I will deliver and how technology plays a role in that, how big or how small?

CURT NICKISCH: Yeah. How do you think Airbnb answered that question early on?

THALES TEIXEIRA: Airbnb had one engineer for a long time.

CURT NICKISCH: Which was one of the founders, yeah.

THALES TEIXEIRA: Founders, yeah. And that’s it. Right? So, Airbnb’s whole purpose was to reduce the– or increase the utilization of an expensive asset which is a private home, or a second home, or a summer home, or something like that.

And you don’t really need that much technology. When they launched, they faked it a little bit. Instead of just showing their inventory they hid it. And so, when you would go online they would just give an example of a few places and probably that’s all they had. And you would go and say “OK. I need to be in New York City on the 17th, or the 19th, and I want an apartment.”

Well, you can’t really choose from all the available inventory because there was none. And so, they just said, “you fill out that information and then somebody will come back to you with a few options in 24 hours or so.”

So, the experience was not perfect – like today you can just look at the options and even book it online and have it guaranteed. This is way later on. In the beginning, you have to be humble about what you have and what you can offer. And so, if you don’t have it you have to do a little bit fake it until you make it.

So, don’t show your weaknesses. Show the availability or possibility. And the first customers that went to Airbnb were the ones that were like “Fine. I don’t need, I’m not a business person. I don’t need to make sure I have a guaranteed booked in the next hour or so, but I’m interested in staying in a house next time I visit San Francisco.”

And those are the customers – were the ones that they got. It wasn’t those like the mass population that requires additional things. So, that’s what’s important here.

CURT NICKISCH: Yeah. This is making me think of enzymes in chemical reactions where the reaction would take place anyway with a lot of time and maybe with a lot of energy. And enzymes essentially lower the amount of energy for such a reaction to happen and they’re–

THALES TEIXEIRA: That’s a great point. So, we could say that technology is the enzyme of startups. Technology is never the driver of digital disruption, in my experience, from my research. Technology is always the enabler or the way to speed up the process.

But it speeds up a process once you know what process you want to speed up. If you speed up a bad process, you’re going to just drive through the cliff with your startup faster. So, you should always think about — first — kind of figuring out what product or experience you’re going to build and deliver and then acquire your customers that are willing to coexist to purchase these products even if they’re not perfect.

And there are people out there. There are people that are trying new things. There are people out there that prefer to give their business to a startup than a big company. There are people out there that they are expecting to have a relationship with other companies. There are people out there that have all these other different needs – that they don’t want to go to the mass of the market and the standard products and services available. And so, cater to those is very important. And you will find those not by plastering ads on Facebook or on Google at very expensive costs.

CURT NICKISCH: How do you know when you are done with the baby steps? How do you know when you’ve learned what you needed to from that first thousand customer phase and that you need to move on and start scaling?

THALES TEIXEIRA: The key metric that changes from baby steps to learning how to walk efficiently and running fast, is in the baby steps your goal is to learn, not to do fast. When you’re running your goal is to do fast, not learn. You should have learned way before.

And so that is the key insight to know that in the beginning, the goal for every new customer that you acquire is: what did we learn? What did we learn by acquiring this customer and what did we learn by servicing this customer that we can use in the next customer and then in the next customer and again, and again, and again?

As this cycle unfolds of learning how to acquire better and learning how to deliver the service or product better, over time naturally startup entrepreneurs start to reduce their amount of learning. They, everything that they learned they already knew, so there’s no new learning.

And you start amassing a group of customers that starts to get bigger and bigger. That is the point that you should start switching from trying to learn as much as possible and disregarding to some extent, doing it efficiently into an efficiency mode, into scaling, doing it faster and faster. Getting more and more customers for each dollar you spent and being more effective. The idea is that you stop learning and then you learn this learning to optimize yourself. That is the transition point to be able to kind of switch from learning to doing it better.

CURT NICKISCH: You clearly have a sense that a lot of startups fail because they don’t master this first phase well. So, which do you think is harder? This first phase or the scaling part? Where do you think more startups fail?

THALES TEIXEIRA: Well so clearly research has shown that more startups fail in the early phases. The vast majority of startups – both tech startups and non-tech startups, small businesses – they fail in the first few years. One of the biggest reasons that they fail is actually they don’t get enough customers to pay for the cost of their maintenance or their survival. And that’s one of the main drivers.

And so, obviously, the answer to not failing as much, or not have a huge likelihood of failing as a startup is really to make sure that you acquire enough customers to sustain your business. And in that regard, this is a little bit of a shift away from what others have advocated for. There’s this idea that you should build your best product possible. You should get capital. You should grow. You could scale. You should create network effects. And you should use technology and invest and hire technical people.

All of these things are overwhelming to startup entrepreneurs and they basically can’t do them all at the same time. And so, what I advocate is: these are all important elements for later on in the phase of a company for the scale phase. But in the early phase of a company, acquiring customers is your main job, your only job and all that you have to focus on.

And the way to acquire customers if you’re going to build better products, or you’re going to create a better relationship, or do whatever it takes. You do that with a goal of acquiring enough customers to be able to just survive another day.

Video: Thales Delivers First SeaFire Radar Array Ahead of Schedule - Naval News,"Tue, 16 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdmFsbmV3cy5jb20vbmF2YWwtbmV3cy8yMDE5LzA0L3RoYWxlcy1kZWxpdmVycy1maXJzdC1zZWFmaXJlLXJhZGFyLWFycmF5LWFoZWFkLW9mLXNjaGVkdWxlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Video: Thales Delivers First SeaFire Radar Array Ahead of Schedule The French Minister of Armed Forces, Florence Parly, was visiting the Thales site of Limours this week, which specializes in military radars. The first SeaFire radar array for the future FDI frigates of the French Navy (Marine Nationale) was presented to her.

Thales is delivering this first antenna on budget and ahead of schedule. It will now be shipped to the Shore Integration Facility in Southern France, where it will be thoroughly tested for about four year by DGA, French Navy, Thales and Naval Group.

According to Thales, the SeaFire provides early warning of potential attacks from conventional and emerging air and surface threats using long-range 3D surveillance, horizon search, and surface surveillance. Its 360-degree coverage can track 800 objects simultaneously without saturation at a range of up to 500 kilometers in the air and 80 kilometers on the surface.

The first SeaFire radar array reading for testing in Southern France at the Shore Integration Facility.

From covering its host ship and the area around it to ASTER air-defence fire control and surface-gun support, Sea Fire’s fully digital, software-controlled processing is a game-changer for radar. It gives smaller vessels the performance of much larger ones and can be upgraded to meet client needs and new threats. Benefiting from Thales’ big data and cybersecurity expertise, Sea Fire automatically adapts to an approaching object’s characteristics.

The SeaFire will allow the future FDI (Frégate de Defense et d’Intervention – Intervention and Defense Frigates) of the French Navy to counter emerging and future threats from UAVs to hypersonic threats, including ballistic missiles.

The French Navy is set to commission five FDI frigates between 2023 and 2029. The ships are being designed by Naval Group and will all be built at the company’ shipyard in Lorient.

They will be 122 meters in length with a displacement of 4,250 tons. One of their main design feature will be their inverted bow. They are set to be crewed by 120 sailors.

The FDI will be the first French Navy vessels to feature a phased array, non-rotating, radar. They will also be the first surface combatant to deploy almost systematically a VTOL-UAV, the SDAM. They will be fitted with a wide range of top-of-the-line technologies such as:

– The “digital combat bridge” featuring augmented reality technology. Located right behind the bridge, the digital combat bridge will display a panoramic view of the exterior and fuze data from the CIC and the various sensors from the ship allowing for a better watch of the surroundings of the vessel, including at night.

– An IT configuration with two data centers aboard the vessel, making it ultra resilient against cyber threats."
Thales to lead EU project on drone geofencing - GPS World magazine,"Thu, 04 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdwc3dvcmxkLmNvbS90aGFsZXMtdG8tbGVhZC1ldS1wcm9qZWN0LW9uLWRyb25lLWdlb2ZlbmNpbmcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales is leading the SESAR Joint Undertaking to research and develop new services for safe, efficient and secure access to airspace for drones.

The SESAR Joint Undertaking (SESAR JU) supports the European Commission’s U-space initiative by researching and developing new services for safe, efficient and secure access to airspace for an expected increase in drone use.

The Geosafe project is part of the founding services for the development of drones operation. Thales will manage the project, supported by Aeromapper, AirMap, Atechsys, Airmarine and SPH Engineering.

The 280 flight tests with 16 different drones will be conducted in France, Germany and Latvia. These tests will explore all possible situations that an automated drone will face in urban and rural areas.

By securing the flight pattern of drones to avoid determined zones, geofencing solutions are key safety enablers. Geofencing ensures that drones don’t fly in protected perimeters around critical infrastructures, such as power plants or airports.

The objectives of Geosafe are to establish state-of-the-art geofencing solutions regarding U-space regulation and to propose improvements and recommendations for future geofencing system definition.

Geosafe will be based on a one-year-long flight-test campaign, assessing a number of commercially available geofencing solutions so that it can propose an improved geofencing system and technological improvements for automated drones.

Thales designs systems ensuring high security and safety levels for future air mobility. As the leader of the project, Thales will organize all tests and provide recommendations for the European geofencing system.

“Thales is playing a leading role in shaping the autonomous world,” said Christian Bardot, Thales VP in charge of Helicopter and UAV Avionics Business. “Together with SESAR JU and the Geosafe partners, we will strengthen the foundations of drones’ safe and secure operations, unleashing the potential of this tremendous market.”"

Deliveries will begin in early 2020. Built around the Thales MINDS / SAIM system, the platform will enable capture, analysis and optimal exploitation of all types of imagery data. It will be completely virtualised to facilitate integration with the customer’s existing infrastructure, and will incorporate the most advanced AI technologies to take image data analysis to a new level, thus enabling the most relevant intelligence to be distributed to the Swiss authorities, so they can make the right decisions.

Drawing on its expertise in the most advanced multi-source data analysis technologies, Thales is optimally positioned to support governments in their fight against constantly evolving threats.

Thales develops the systems that governments need to maintain surveillance and identify and assess the ever-expanding array of threats they face. In the race to anticipate threats before they happen, which is an inherent part of national security today, weak signals are a crucial part of decision support for operations. It calls for the ability to gather data, process it, extract operationally relevant information and then tie it all together to make it directly actionable by decisionmakers.

A key element in the intelligence chain that supports operations, the MINDS / SAIM platform is designed to digitally process real-time data feeds from all types of sensors. With the increasing number of sensors — satellite, airborne, deployed on the ground — image data analysis requirements continue to grow, calling for advanced processing tools to address issues arising from the volume of data and diversity of sources. In today’s world of ubiquitous information, MINDS / SAIM will enable the Swiss Armed Forces to precisely target the data they need to process and to identify threats, thanks to a set of highly sophisticated tools based on AI and other technologies.

“This latest export success confirms MINDS / SAIM’s positioning as the solution of choice for all armed forces involved in image intelligence,” says Gérard Herby, Vice President, Protection Systems Business Line, Thales.

Thales Enables the Future of Digital Payment Innovations with Next-Generation Payment Hardware Security Module - PR Newswire,"Thu, 25 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcm5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2VzL3RoYWxlcy1lbmFibGVzLXRoZS1mdXR1cmUtb2YtZGlnaXRhbC1wYXltZW50LWlubm92YXRpb25zLXdpdGgtbmV4dC1nZW5lcmF0aW9uLXBheW1lbnQtaGFyZHdhcmUtc2VjdXJpdHktbW9kdWxlLTMwMDgzNzk1OS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS, April 25, 2019 Thales, a leader in critical information systems, cybersecurity and data protection, announces the availability of a next-generation payment hardware security module (HSM), payShield 10K, enabling customers to adopt new innovative digital payment technologies easily and securely. The new payment HSM secures digital payments at lower processing costs by using a fraction of the energy. It also streamlines operations and supports the latest standards for real-time payments, open banking and secure remote commerce.

""Hardware security modules perform a critical function in terms of securing data,"" said Garrett Bekker, principal analyst, 451 Research. ""This is especially true for hardware security modules used within the payments ecosystem. The ability to secure new digital payment technologies while also providing increased resiliency, improved remote management and lower power consumption should be a welcome development for the market.""

Go Green

To help customers achieve their green data center goals and reduce costs, the payShield 10K features enhanced processing capabilities and power management techniques. This translates into lower overall power consumption, in some cases by up to 40%, even when operating at twice the cryptographic performance. As payShield 10K can be securely managed remotely with a 'no touch' implementation, deployments in dark data centers could also be optimized.

Streamlined Operations & Greater Protection

With the introduction of the payShield 10K, deployment has been simplified and operations has been significantly streamlined. Its firmware update workflow process also has been reduced by more than a factor of 10, while maintaining all necessary security checks for code authenticity and integrity.

Stronger tamper protection is a key component of the payShield 10K. In fact, in the event of an attack, it will erase keys and sensitive data immediately. In addition, it will become permanently disabled if attempts to gain access to the inner security module are detected. This advanced level of protection directly addresses key concerns among IT and security executives: half now actively fear exposure of payment card details or other personally identifiable information, according to the 2019 Thales Data Threat Report-Global Edition.

For higher resiliency, the payShield 10K performs new background monitoring of HSM system processes and application code to detect abnormalities and to respond automatically without the need for customer intervention.

""As the growth and adoption of card and digital payments continue to accelerate and new methods of payment evolve, businesses are increasingly challenged to protect the confidentiality and integrity of transactions,"" said Todd Moore, vice president, encryption products for cloud protection and licensing activity, Thales. ""With the launch of payShield 10K, we are building on our strong foundation of powering 80% of the world's point-of-sale transactions, allowing businesses to keep pace with payment innovation, adhere to the latest security standards and embrace a smarter, greener payment infrastructure.""

The enhanced Pressurized Cargo Module (PCM) developed by Thales Alenia Space delivers 3,500 kg of cargo in a total volume of 27 cubic meters.

Cannes, April 18th, 2018 – The Cygnus spacecraft to deliver cargo to the International Space Station (ISS) has been successfully launched by an Antares rocket from Wallops Island, Virginia at NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility, on its eleventh operational mission. The Cygnus spacecraft comprises two main sections: the Service Module from Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems ( formerly Orbital ATK) , and the enhanced Pressurized Cargo Module (PCM), developed and built by Thales Alenia Space, a joint venture between Thales (67%) and Leonardo (33%).

This Cygnus was named in honor of Roger Chaffee, the Apollo 1 astronaut who died in NASA's pursuit of the first moon landing in a fire during a pad test in 1967.

Thanks to the PCM enhanced version, this mission will use a new late load capability. Previously, all cargo had to be loaded about four days prior to the launch. This new capability will now allow time-sensitive science experiments — including live mice — to be loaded into Cygnus just 24 hours before the liftoff.

The Cygnus is expected to remain at the station through July, the same month as the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission, as its cargo is offloaded and it is repacked with refuse for disposal during its destructive re-entry into Earth's atmosphere.

The S.S. Roger Chaffee will also demonstrate the Cygnus spacecraft's capability to remain in orbit after it departs from the space station, in support of the ship serving as a scientific research platform on future missions.

Thales Alenia Space has supplied cargo modules to Northrop Grumman since the start of the Cygnus program. The first contract in 2009 provided for the delivery of nine modules, while a second contract in 2016 added nine more. Eleven operational PCMs plus a demo module have been launched to date, four in the original version and eight in the enhanced version. Built by Thales Alenia Space using a new friction welding system, this new module feature lighter weight and a more efficient design that increases payload weight and volume, with the capability of accommodating nonstandard cargo.

This launch further confirms not only Thales Alenia Space’s ongoing contribution to the success of Cygnus cargo missions but also its ability to contribute to future space exploration missions, bringing its expertise to cooperate in expanding the frontiers of knowledge.

How are you doing down there?”

If you’re a space fan, you may know that it’s the Trace Gas Orbiter from the 2016 ExoMars mission talking here. Since then, the spacecraft has been in a circular 400 km orbit around Mars, with all instruments operating as expected and meeting all of its scientific objectives.

In addition to studying trace gases in the Martian atmosphere, of biological or geological origin, the TGO also acts as a data relay for communications from the ExoMars 2020 rover and surface science platform, as well as from rovers deployed by partner agencies.

The TGO's instruments include: Atmospheric Chemistry Suite (ACS); Color and Stereo Surface Imaging System (CaSSIS); Fine Resolution Epithermal Neutron Detector (FREND); Nadir and Occultation for Mars Discovery (NOMAD).

© ExoMars TGO

© Thales Alenia Space/Imag[IN]

The TGO is already being used to relay more than 50% of the data from two American missions to Mars, Curiosity and Insight.

The TGO has performed about 200 overflights of the red planet, picking up more than 90 Gb of data from NASA’s Curiosity lander. It was also called on in recent efforts to restore communications with Opportunity, the 14-year-old lander that lost connections during a Martian dust storm in the summer of 2018. Despite these efforts, it was officially declared inactive on February 14, 2019, after traveling 45.16 kilometers during 5111 sols.

The dust storm also affected the TGO’s science observations. Because of the opaque Martian atmosphere, the high-resolution pictures of the surface taken by the CASSIS instrument had to be suspended.

All instruments are up and running again, as the Martian sky is once again clear, promising beautiful new pictures of Mars.

Nor has the TGO stood still. The ESA control team at ESOC identified certain areas for improvement, asking Thales Alenia Space, prime contractor of the ExoMars 2016 and 2020 missions, to make software changes. These modifications will help optimize all communications, especially when the TGO/ground link starts to be critical due to the long distance from the Earth.

© ESA/ATG medialab

On August 28, Mars and Earth will be at the greatest distance from each other, at 400,224,357 km (2.67 AU) and communications will be temporarily interrupted, until the angle between the Earth, the Sun and the spacecraft is greater than 3 degrees. As we get closer to this date, the TGO/Earth data downlink rate will be reduced to 26 kbps, which in turn increases the time needed to download a minimum data set. However the improvements made will guarantee basic communications, despite these conditions.

The TGO’s role will become even more critical once the rover reaches the Red Planet, because all communications with the Rover Operational Control Center in Altec, at Thales Alenia Space’s Turin plant, will be routed through its instruments.

Fuel consumption on the TGO is as planned with significant contingency margins, and few orbit adjustments will be needed to prepare for mission tracking and arrival in March 2021.

The upcoming ExoMars 2020 mission entails sending a landing platform to the surface of Mars, along with a rover. America has already carried out this daunting task several times… now it’s Europe’s turn. The rover will be drilling down up to 2 meters to take and analyze soil samples – and no other robot has ever dug so deep! These samples will then be analyzed in a sophisticated mini-lab, named the Analytical Laboratory Drawer, designed by Thales Alenia Space in Italy with the support of OHB and integrated within the Rover vehicle. The ultimate aim is of course to find any traces early martian life like bacteria, which would finally provide an answer to the existential question from your favorite rock’n’roll spaceman, David Bowie: “Is there Life on Mars?”

Or perhaps it would be more accurate to say, “Are there traces of past life on Mars?” That is the question!

* ExoMars is an exploration program conducted by the European Space Agency (ESA ) in cooperation with the Russian space agency Roscosmos, designed to study the Martian environment, atmosphere and soil. It will generate huge volumes of data to feed scientific research for many years to come. Thales Alenia Space is prime contractor on both ExoMars missions, 2016 and 2020, at the head of a large industrial consortium. For the 2020 mission, Leonardo will provide the soil sample drill, OHB the carrier module and various rover instruments, while the rover, named after Rosalind Franklin, is supplied by Airbus Defense & Space. NPO Lavochkin will build the descent module and its landing platform."

David Palmer, Head of Main Line Rail, Thales GTS UK

Thales works to deliver solutions that transform Britain’s journeys and an integral component of these solutions are Traffic Management Systems (TMS). TMS provide permanent control across the network, automatically setting routes for trains and logging train movements, while also detecting and solving potential conflicts. David Palmer, Head of Main Line Rail (UK), talks about his role within the business and Thales’s global expertise in the main line signalling market.

“Day to day it is a classic business leadership role, where I am responsible for the Main Line Rail business in the UK, the contracts we are trying to win, those we have and the strategy going forward to evolve and grow within the UK.”

David joined Thales four years ago. He had completed a degree and spent several years in the Army, before moving into the transport industry, initially in project management within Research and Development. Thales presented an opportunity to combine new technology with a leadership role and he arrived to take over the Traffic Management programme, before moving on to run the Main Line Rail business.

David sees building Thales’s Main Line Rail team as a key priority for success. He empowers those he works with and enables them to take on more responsibility which has resulted in a greater ability to deliver and build on creative ideas for the future. In recent months, several colleagues have gone on to take up more senior roles in other parts of Thales. David sees this as a sign of success for him personally and the working environment in the company.

“There is so much happening in Main Line Rail that if we want to be successful we must build highly effective teams and offer people opportunities for growth.”

One of the key projects within David’s mainline portfolio involves introducing an on-board digital signalling system into trains to enable them to operate more safely and efficiently, which is a key component of ETCS.

“Whilst this First in Class project is quite small scale in terms of value, it is hugely complicated due to the multiple stakeholders involved and how previous changes to the Class 43 fleet has led to multiple train cab configurations, all of which needs to be managed by our team to ensure success.”

One area of the business that David is keen to grow is that of the Train Protection Warning System, which is designed to enhance safety on the railways. This national system has been deployed for a number of years now but the team are now looking to develop this offer further for current and future customers. Part of this involves searching for innovative solutions and adaptations, so that Thales can continue offering something new and efficient.

Thales’s global expertise in the main line signalling market and vast product base is something which David hopes to expand within the UK. This international insight combined with a proven record of delivery on even the most complex projects is a hallmark of Thales’s offer.

The opportunity for growth in Rail within the UK is significant. The government through the Department for Transport, Network Rail and HS2 has committed to not only maintain the existing network but to improve performance and grow capacity over the next 5-10 years. Leveraging Thales’ global expertise offers the UK team the opportunity generate an innovative and compelling offer for our customers in order to be part of this future.

“There is a drive across the whole country to build a better railway, there are vast opportunities and as an industry it is a good place to be working. Thales globally is well positioned to support the UK and the really exciting part of my role is helping to build and deliver a strategy that brings this capability to bear in the UK.”

Maritime Autonomy will help revolutionise Royal Navy Operations

Thales welcomes the announcement by Gavin Williamson MP, the Secretary of State for Defence, that MOD will invest £75 million in pioneering new technology to revolutionise Royal Navy operations, including maritime autonomous systems.

The funding will be spent on two new autonomous mine-hunter vessels with improved operational capabilities and a new joint military and industry hi-tech accelerator, called NavyX.

This new accelerator will look to improve the way the Navy buys the latest technology, thus streamlining the process and creating a facility where industry, military and academia can cooperate to test, assess and purchase new equipment.

Victor Chavez, CEO of Thales in the UK, says:

Thales stands ready to support this important initiative to accelerate the pace of innovation to support the Royal Navy. This is a great opportunity to leverage the experience gained through the development of autonomous technologies under the Anglo-French MMCM programme and the use of the Maritime Autonomy Centres of Excellence at Turnchapel and Brest Working alongside the Royal Navy and their French counterparts, we have been able to develop, test and deploy world-class autonomous mine countermeasure systems as well as shape some of the operational factors, which are key to delivering military effect. This exciting announcement will ensure that RN operators get the ground breaking innovative technology they need to face the next generation of threats - safely."
BepiColombo on its way to Mercury - Thales,"Fri, 05 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi93b3JsZHdpZGUvc3BhY2UvbmV3cy9iZXBpY29sb21iby1pdHMtd2F5LW1lcmN1cnnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"BepiColombo on its way to Mercury Thales Alenia Space Space Exploration Share this article



LinkedIn

BepiColombo is continuing along an interplanetary trajectory which will gradually bring it to Mercury, the closest planet to the sun. The spacecraft has already covered over 450 million kilometers out of a 9-billion-kilometer journey to its “red hot” destination.

Launched on October 20, 2018 from the Guiana Space Center in Kourou, French Guiana, BepiColombo completed the Near Earth Commissioning Phase (NECP). The European Space Agency (ESA) had announced that BepiColombo successfully passed its Mission Commissioning Review, meaning that the spacecraft was healthy and ready to continue its trip across the Solar System.

The NECP is an essential phase, since it provides the green light for the next steps in this ESA/JAXA (Japanese Space Agency) mission. Taking place several months after launch, this phase evaluates the performance of the Mercury Transfer Module (MTM), which is carrying ESA's Mercury Planetary Orbiter (MPO) and Japan's Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiter (MMO), while their systems and subsystems have undergone constant monitoring. The aim is of course to make sure that the propulsion, communications, thermal protection, power generation, data collection and other units are all working properly.

ESA recently announced in Darmstadt, Germany that the NECP was a success, including positive feedback from antennas, transponder, thermal control, electrical distribution and onboard computers – all components to which Thales Alenia Space made a significant contribution.

The NECP also included an evaluation of the spacecraft’s scientific instruments, which are of course the key to the ultimate mission objective of studying Mercury.



The European mission is led by Airbus Defence & Space as prime contractor, working on behalf of ESA. Thales Alenia Space is part of the industry core team, coordinating 35 different European companies. In particular, Thales Alenia Space is in charge of telecommunications, thermal control and the electrical distribution system, as well as integration and testing of the overall spacecraft, plus support services during the launch campaign. The company is also supplying X and Ka-band transponders, onboard computers, mass memory and the 1.1 meter high-gain antenna used for communications between spacecraft and ground, along with the scientific experiment for the radio mission. This antenna is derived from the model developed for the successful Cassini-Huygens mission.

Thales Alenia Space teamed up with the Italian space agency ASI and Sapienza University of Rome to develop two of the “passengers”: Italian Spring Accelerometer (ISA), and the Radio Science Experiment MORE, both used to study the planet as well as conduct further tests on Einstein’s theory of General Relativity. The European Space Operations Center (ESOC) in Darmstadt announced that these instruments are in good condition and ready to spring into action.

BepiColombo will conduct an Earth flyby on April 13, 2020 as it receives an additional gravity boost to continue on its journey to Venus, the Sun and Mercury… and help us answer some of our oldest questions about the Solar System, and even the Universe.

“Coast Watcher 100 maritime surveillance radars will allow the Jamaica Defense Force to benefit from the state of the art solution in detection, surveillance and control.”

The air and surface targets that can be detected by Coast Watcher 100 include inflatable dinghies or jet-skis, warships, as well as low-level aeroplanes and helicopters.

The contract was awarded as part of the Jamaican Government’s Maritime Domain Awareness Capability Initiative, a comprehensive programme designed to mitigate criminal maritime activities around the Jamaican coast.

According to Thales, the system architecture enables the radar to counter the threat of piracy and smuggling operations.

Thales Latin America vice-president Ruben Lazo said: “Thales’s high technologies help our customers make the best decision in real time. Coast Watcher 100 maritime surveillance radars will allow the Jamaica Defense Force to benefit from the state of the art solution in detection, surveillance and control.”

The latest order builds on the existing relationship between Thales and the Jamaican government.

The country already uses Thales air traffic control centres and radars to secure its airspace.

Jamaica Defense Force placed an order in 2013 with the company for the supply of 12 Bushmaster armoured vehicles.

Last month, the company received a contract from the French Defence Procurement Agency to supply Coast Watcher 100 radars to enhance maritime threat detection."
Brit Watchkeeper drone fell in the sea because blocked sensor made algorithms flip out - The Register,"Mon, 15 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJlZ2lzdGVyLmNvbS8yMDE5LzA0LzE1L3dhdGNoa2VlcGVyX2Ryb25lX2NyYXNoX3drMDQyX21vaXN0dXJlX2Jsb2NrZWRfcGl0b3Qv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlcmVnaXN0ZXIuY29tL0FNUC8yMDE5LzA0LzE1L3dhdGNoa2VlcGVyX2Ryb25lX2NyYXNoX3drMDQyX21vaXN0dXJlX2Jsb2NrZWRfcGl0b3Qv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A British Army Watchkeeper drone stalled itself and crashed into the sea on a bad weather flight test, military investigators have said – though most of the wreckage was never found.

The unmanned aircraft, tail number WK042, fell from the sky in February 2017 while trialling a new ice detection system. The drone was being flown from West Wales Airport, formerly known as Aberporth Airfield, by 47 Regiment Royal Artillery.

Investigators concluded that one of its pitot probes used for reading the aircraft's speed and angle of attack (AOA) became blocked, causing the Watchkeeper's onboard flight control logic to enter an erratic series of climbs and dives until it stalled itself and flopped into the sea. They criticised the craft's maker, Thales, for not fully understanding how its algorithms responded to loss of accurate sensor data.

Air Marshal Susan Gray, director-general of the Defence Safety Authority, criticised the Ministry of Defence and Thales for their ""incomplete level of detailed technical understanding"" regarding the drone and its systems. So far the British military has crashed five Watchkeepers, including two in quick succession during 2017, which led to a months-long grounding of the entire fleet.

Those two crashes, of which WK042 was one, were not publicly revealed until a senior Navy officer blabbed about them within earshot of a sharp-eared reporter, prompting accusations of an MoD cover-up over the troubled multimillion-pound programme.

The automated decision-making that led to the crash has some parallels with the recent Boeing 737 Max controversy, in which automated flight control software has been fingered as a potential factor in two fatal airliner crashes that cost hundreds of lives. The Watchkeeper crash investigators stated:

The software algorithms used to identify and disqualify single sensor failure were not always well understood by [Thales] within the UK. Consequently, the effectiveness of the algorithms at maintaining the integrity of the air data required by the [flight control system] for safe flight was in part unknown.

""From its detailed analysis,"" wrote Air Marshal Gray in her formal comments on the Service Inquiry (SI) report, ""the SI concluded that the design of [Watchkeeper's] air data system limited its ability to fly safely in cloud and precipitation."" A buildup of moisture in the Watchkeeper's pitot probes was found to have caused its automated flight logic to start doing crazy things – ultimately leading to a stall and a crash.

Ice, ice, baby

After taking off uneventfully from Aberporth on the scheduled icing detection trial flight, WK042 climbed first to 3,000ft in the hope of finding icing conditions, gradually stepping up to 8,800ft. It then ""experienced high wind that was momentarily on the allowable limits"", prompting its operators to command a descent and return to base.

Watchkeeper is not flown like a conventional aeroplane with a human sitting at a stick and rudder. Its operators select waypoints on a screen for the drone to fly itself towards. During flight, its onboard logic decides precisely how the drone arrives at those waypoints, within constraints selected by human operators. Watchkeeper's predecessor, the Hermes 450, could be flown manually but this design feature was not included on the British Army's craft.

Twenty minutes later, a spate of warnings began to be displayed to the operators as their controls relayed the drone's violent oscillations. Fifteen minutes after that, contact with the Watchkeeper was lost. In that last quarter of an hour, the drone ""pitched up and down repeatedly between 3,200ft and 3,500ft"" until it ""descended rapidly into the sea"" about two miles northwest of the hamlet of Llangrannog, which itself is four or five miles northeast of Aberporth Airfield.

Among the warnings displayed to its operators during the pitching incidents were ""estimated AOA in use"" and ""flight envelope protection active"", indicating that the Watchkeeper was no longer trusting its sensors. Thales' own investigators concluded that the left tail fin had been damaged or possibly even been torn from the airframe by the violent manoeuvres, ""causing a catastrophic loss of control"", though the MoD inquiry downgraded this to saying it was a contributory factor but not the critical one.

A seabed search using remote underwater vehicles failed to turn up any of the Watchkeeper wreckage, though RAF personnel later found one of its composite panels washed up on a beach. That was the sum of wreckage found by investigators – all the analysis was done from data transmitted by the UAV back to its ground station. There is no ""black box"" on a Watchkeeper.

The SI report into WK042 is here.

The MoD has 50 Watchkeepers remaining on charge. Another report into WK050 – the 2018 crash on land near Aberporth village – is expected soon, while The Register will be separately reporting about the crash of WK043, which also had an unscheduled surface/aircraft interaction event a month after the drone featured in this article. ®"

'End of the line': City terminates Thales' troubled Metro Line LRT contract - CBC.ca,"Tue, 09 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9uZXdzL2NhbmFkYS9lZG1vbnRvbi90aGFsZXMtbWV0cm8tbHJ0LWVkbW9udG9uLXNpZ25hbGxpbmctMS41MDkwNDI20gEgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2JjLmNhL2FtcC8xLjUwOTA0MjY?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The City of Edmonton has officially severed ties with the company behind the Metro Line LRT's problem-riddled signalling system.

Thales Canada Inc. was served a notice of termination on April 4, the city confirmed at a news conference Tuesday.

""This is the end of the line for Thales,"" Mayor Don Iveson told reporters. ""Thales has consistently let Edmontonians down in delivering on their contractual obligations.

""The signalling system they delivered to the city isn't complete, isn't reliable, has not worked.""

Iveson said there was ""ample evidence"" to support the termination. The decision was unanimously supported by council, he said.

The city said field testing of the system, which began in December, found that the Thales system couldn't keep trains on schedule and caused trains to stop suddenly.

'Enough is enough'

""We are not the first city to experience significant reliability issues with Thales,"" Iveson said. ""Their shortcomings are well documented, from New York to Singapore to Hong Kong.

""The City of Edmonton has given Thales ample time, five years in fact, and plenty of resources to complete their work but enough is enough and it's time to find a resolution on the Metro Line without Thales.

""We will now move forward with a different signalling system that will deliver the LRT we all expect and deserve. And this isn't about picking a scapegoat, it's about accountability.""

The termination will not immediately change Metro Line operations, the city said. For now, Metro Line trains will continue to operate on current schedules using the ""incomplete Thales signalling system.""

City sought settlement, Thales went 'public'

City manager Linda Cochrane said administration made every effort to find a resolution to the ongoing contract issues before the termination notice was served.

""We issued a formal notice of termination to Thales and proposed that it remain confidential so we could attempt to reach a settlement but Thales has alternatively chosen to go public,"" Cochrane said.

Thales said its employees were escorted from the worksite last week.

""Thales is extremely disappointed in the city's commitment to the failure of this project and its abandonment of the objectives to achieve a better LRT service for Edmontonians,"" Thales said in a harshly-worded news release earlier Tuesday.

""Thales regrets this decision and will vigorously pursue appropriate remedies with all means available to us.""

Company officials held a news conference Tuesday morning at Manulife Place in downtown Edmonton.

""This is absolutely not the message Thales wanted to be delivering today,"" Dave Beckley, Thales Canada's vice-president of customer service, told reporters. ""Despite years of challenges on this project, we never walked away.""

The cancellation of the contract is unprecedented in the company's history, Beckley said.

""Every job I've worked on has had surprises ... and we've worked through them with the strong and solid support of our customers, and unfortunately that has not been the case here.""

Dave Beckley, Thales Canada's vice-president of customer service, speaks in Edmonton Tuesday, April 9. (Peter Evans/CBC)

Thales said it stands by its work on the LRT line and ""thousands of hours of testing on the system"" have demonstrated that both the Metro and Capital Lines are ready for full service.

""Instead of working with Thales to deliver a successful service to LRT riders, and after years of unprecedented interference in this project, the city spent months conducting its own testing in a manner contrary to industry standards, while contemplating a fundamental change to the Metro Line signalling scheme.""

Thales said that since work on the Metro Line began in 2011, the city has continually asked for changes to the system which fall outside the original scope of the project, including automated train operators and the introduction of special train service to NAIT.

'Thales will not be a scapegoat'

A city plan to remove all Thales equipment from the transit system demonstrates a disregard for Edmontonians' investment in the project and will waste millions of dollars, Thales said.

Any alternate transit plan will only lead to future traffic disruptions for Edmontonians, the company said.

""Despite these extraordinary efforts, Thales continued to witness a fundamental lack of leadership from the City of Edmonton on this project,"" Beckley said in the news release.

""Thales will not be a scapegoat for the city's lack of experience and understanding of [communications based train control] systems. It is this type of challenging work environment that contributed to the failure of this infrastructure project, shortchanging Edmontonians and ultimately eroding trust in the LRT.""

In May, the city issued a notice of default on the signalling contract after Thales Canada Inc. failed to fix the system by council's April 30, 2018 deadline.

Under that notice, the company committed to a new deadline of Dec. 4, 2018.

City has withheld $22 million

On the day of the deadline, Thales announced the signalling system was fully functional. The same day, the city announced that it would put the signalling system through a series of tests to ensure it was working properly.

The city has paid Thales $33 million but has withheld a further $22 million.

The Metro Line LRT stops at MacEwan University, the Royal Alexandra Hospital and NAIT and has more than 34,000 riders per week day.

The $600-million line has been plagued by problems since it opened more than a year late in September 2015. An audit that year revealed the contract with Thales was poorly managed, and that updates and delays weren't communicated properly to city council."
First Flight for Royal Navy’s Merlin Crowsnest AEW Helicopter - Naval News,"Thu, 11 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdmFsbmV3cy5jb20vbmF2YWwtbmV3cy8yMDE5LzA0L2ZpcnN0LWZsaWdodC1mb3Itcm95YWwtbmF2eXMtbWVybGluLWNyb3dzbmVzdC1hZXctaGVsaWNvcHRlci_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"First Flight for Royal Navy’s Merlin Crowsnest AEW Helicopter The first Leonardo Merlin HM.2 helicopter fitted with the Crowsnest kit conducted its first flight in late March 2019 at the Leonardo Helicopters (formerly AgustaWestland) site of Yeovil. The Crowsnest kit transforms the Merlin HM.2 of the Royal Navy into an Advanced Early Warning (AEW) helicopter.

For the record, the British Ministry of Defense awarded a contract worth 269 million pounds to Lockheed Martin in January 2017 for the supply of ten Crowsnest kits for the British naval aviation. The kits are modular radar systems that may be fitted (and taken off) any of the 30 Leonardo AW101 Merlin HM.2 maritime helicopters fielded by the Royal Navy.

The Merlin HM.2 helicopters equipped with this system will fly missions from British aircraft carrier Queen Elizabeth-class and are replacing Sea King ASaC.7 DRLO helicopters in the 849th Navy Aviation Squadron (which were all decommissioned in September 2018)

Picture by British plane spotted Michael Coombes published with his consent.

The developer and manufacturer of the Crowsnest system is the British branch of Lockheed Martin (Lockheed Martin UK), while Thales and Leonardo are subcontractors. Under the terms of the contract, the first Merlin HM.2 helicopter equipped with the Crowsnest kit was set to be commissioned in June 2019, however it seems like the program is facing some minor delays. Initial operational capability (IOC) was planned for the end of 2020, and full readiness for 2022.

Initially, Lockheed Martin offered its own containerized Vigilance system as part of the Crowsnest program, using a multipurpose radar with AFAR based on the Northrop Grumman AN / APG-81 radar (used on the Lockheed Martin F-35 fighter) or the Israeli IAI radar placed in an external onboard container Elta EL / M-2052. This system has been tested by Lockheed Martin since the end of 2011. However, in April 2015, Lockheed Martin, joining forces with Thales, proposed a more conservative and cheaper version of the Thales solution, which was originally proposed by the latter independently. It is an upgrade of the Cerberus radar system used by the Sea King ASaC.7 helicopters with modified Thales Searchwater 2000 AEW radar with mechanical scanning. In May 2015, this “budget” decision was chosen by the UK Department of Defense."

Under this contract, Thales is scheduled to deliver two Coast Watcher 100 radars by the end of 2020. One of them will be installed at the DGA missile test range of Mediterranean Sea, while the other one will be installed at the DGA missile test range of the Landes. Through this contract, Thales will also provide through-life support and security maintenance for seven years for both radars.

The Thales Coast Watcher 100 is a high-performance radar that enables optimal detection of small maritime threats in challenging environments such as high-sea states, rain, ... and low-altitude airborne threats. Its missions are to maintain optimal surveillance of the territorial waters and economic exclusive zones, site surveillance (ports, oil & gas platforms, high-value sites such as missile test sites, ...), detection of asymmetric threats and low altitude surveillance.

The Coast Watcher 100 is built around a Modular Solid-State Transmitter permitting high performances and availability. It is associated with a COTS (PC) hardware-based processing allowing the best performance/cost ratio.

The Kinematic Scan To Scan© signal processing technology of the algorithm performs precise filtering of all environmental clutters (including extreme weather conditions), allowing precise small target detection, discrimination and a low false alarm rate. It allows a very small target detection even in a harsh environment (rain, sea-state 5). It simply provides detection, where competitors are blind.

The Coast Watcher family is made of an open-architecture based on COTS elements, leading to a low-cost radar production and universal interfacing with all existing systems in operation today. Moreover, this universal interfacing will allow you to perform an easy integration of your radar in a future larger system you might think of."

The new generation of 68mm induction rocket system (IRS) was developed by TDA Armaments, 100% affiliated of Thales Group. IRS is a name for a product family of new generation guided missiles and unguided rockets, utilizing electronics and wireless technologies.

The TDA induction rocket systems offer a range of benefits for platform integrators and aircrews alike: simplified mechanical systems and logistics operations, fully adaptable loading configurations, in-flight programmable dual-mode rocket capability, fully integrated guided-rocket control, automatic identification of loaded rocket types, and a built-in health and usage monitoring system.

Induction rockets cannot be used as improvised explosive devices or fired by adversary rocket launchers. In addition, since activation does not require electric cables or physical connectors, foreign object damage to the platform is no longer an issue. The absence of cables and connectors around the munitions and the advanced digital launcher interface makes the load/unload process 100% tool-free.

The induction rocket can hit targets between from 500 m to 6,000 m. At SOFINS 2019, the pod mounted of the Hawkei vehicle has four launcher tubes each armed with one rocket. All the firing operations for the rocket launcher system is controlled by an operator console and control handle located inside of the vehicle, which is also used to operate the other weapons of the remotely operated turret.

At the rear of the roof of the vehicle, an additional container is used to store four additional rockets to reload the rockets pod mounted on the remotely operated weapon station.

Iveson said the city has given the company plenty of time and resources to complete their work.

“Enough is enough and it’s time to find a resolution on the Metro Line without Thales,” he said.

“This isn’t about picking a scapegoat, as Thales has characterized it, this is about accountability and standing up for Edmontonians.”

“Thales regrets this decision and will vigorously pursue appropriate remedies with all means available to us.”

Thales Canada customer service vice president Dave Beckley insisted the system is safe, adding an independent safety contractor hired by the city said the same thing.

“The city may say the CBTC system is unsafe and unreliable. This is not true,” Beckley said. He said the company never walked away, despite years of challenges.

The Thales Communications Based Train Control (CBTC) system was designed to work alongside the existing 1970s-era system.

The problem-plagued Metro Line has experienced several issues since it opened to riders in September 2015, including crossing arms coming down on green lights and trains heading in opposite directions on the same set of tracks.

Last year, the city issued a notice of default to Thales. A new timetable was established to fix all of the remaining issues with the system, with a date of Dec. 4, 2018 to finally hand the system over to the city to operate.

“Between May and December, our staff did whatever it took to help Thales get their work done. At midnight, on weekends, our engineers were always beside theirs,” city manager Linda Cochrane said. “Edmontonians helped do this work as well. Numerous tests were conducted. There was also system-wide closures of the LRT which affected all Edmontonians.”

Over the past few months, the city has conducted testing of the signal system.

“The signalling system they provided on Dec. 4 was not ready and it was not reliable,” Cochrane said. “It couldn’t keep trains on schedule despite a lot of manual intervention from our own staff. It delayed trains at stations, it caused trains to stop suddenly. These sorts of issues shouldn’t be showing up in a signalling system that is supposed to be complete and ready.”

“Instead of working with Thales to deliver a successful service to LRT riders, and after years of unprecedented interference in this project, the city spent months conducting its own testing in a manner contrary to industry standards, while contemplating a fundamental change to the Metro Line signalling scheme,” Thales said.

Thales said it stands by its declaration of practical completion of this project in December.

“Three and a half years of Metro Line operations and the results of the thousands of hours of testing on the system have demonstrated that the system is ready for full CBTC service on both the Metro and Capital Lines. The delivered Communications Based Train Control (CBTC) system is highly integrated into the entire railway, a key component of the safe transport of nearly 35,000 Edmontonians every day,” the company said.

Thales said the actions of the City of Edmonton are completely unwarranted, starting over will cause disruption to LRT riders for years to come, and result in the waste of millions of dollars. The city said the Metro Line will continue operating safely under the current signalling system as it pursues a replacement.

“Our relationship with Thales is over but our commitment to building and operating a reliable LRT system for a city of more than a million people remains unchanged,” Cochrane said.

Since the Metro Line project began in 2011, Thales said the city has requested several “significant” changes to the system, including the addition of Automated Train Operations and the introduction of a “special” train service to NAIT— additions Thales said “were out of scope of the original contract.”

Thales is an international company that has designed transit systems around the globe. When asked what went wrong in Edmonton, Beckley said it’s a “very unique situation.”

“Every railway in the world is different, especially the urban railways. We’re not talking about an ‘off-the-shelf system’ here.”

“We’ve had moments where, ‘okay, what are we going to do here?’ And we’ve worked through them with the strong and solid support of our customers, and unfortunately this has not been the case here and that has made Edmonton different.”

Thales said for the past two years, it “made extraordinary efforts with the city of Edmonton to work towards the successful delivery of this project, including multiple meetings with senior city administration to help guide the project.”

“Despite these extraordinary efforts, Thales continued to witness a fundamental lack of leadership from the city of Edmonton on this project,” Beckley said.

It is this type of challenging work environment that contributed to the failure of this infrastructure project, shortchanging Edmontonians and ultimately eroding trust in the LRT.” Tweet This Click to share quote on Twitter: ""Thales will not be a scapegoat for the city's lack of experience and understanding of CBTC systems.

The city has previously said as a contingency, it has developed a backup plan in case officials aren’t satisfied with the Thales system. It would be based on the old signal technology used on the Capital LRT Line.

Beckley said all work has stopped and its dispute with the city is heading to arbitration. The city said it proposed to Thales keeping the termination confidential so the two sides could attempt to reach a settlement.

"Thales completes acquisition of Gemalto, expands Canadian footprint - Canadian Manufacturing","Thu, 04 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhbmFkaWFubWFudWZhY3R1cmluZy5jb20vdGVjaG5vbG9neS90aGFsZXMtY29tcGxldGVzLWFjcXVpc2l0aW9uLW9mLWdlbWFsdG8tZXhwYW5kcy1jYW5hZGlhbi1mb290cHJpbnQtMjMwNDA4L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The move creates a digital security juggernaut; In Canada, Thales will add more than 400 employees to its team

After 15 months, French multinational Thales Group has completed its acquisition of Dutch Gemalto for $7.3 billion, to create a digital security juggernaut.

In Canada, Thales will add more than 400 employees to its team, totalling more than 2000 country-wide.

Cara Salci, national director, public affairs and communications at Thales Canada, said in a phone interview that the additions are primarily concentrated in Burlington Ont. and Ottawa.

Thales Canada says the acquisition is a prime example of the parent company’s continued commitment to Canada.

In October 2017, Thales announced a $50 million AI research lab in Montreal. Salci says the lab is fully operational with close to 50 experts working in the space, and is also home to one of the company’s three digital factories, the others located in Singapore and Paris.

Salci said, “From a Canadian perspective, Thales Canada really is making its contribution to the group’s digital transformation objectives but also working to support different customers and business opportunities in developing critical AI capabilities where decision making is key.”

Globally, the firm will expand its operations in Latin America (2,500 employees, up from 600), triple its presence in Northern Asia (1,980, from 700), Southeast Asia (2,500, from 800) and India (1,150, from 400), and North America (6,660 employees, up from 4,600). The acquisition increases Thales’ revenues to $29 billion, with 80,000 employees in 68 countries.

Thales says that with Gemalto, it will cover the entire critical decision chain, with capabilities spanning software development, data processing, real-time decision support, connectivity and end-to-end network management.

The company has $1.5 billion a year devoted to self-funded R&D, including $40 million in Canada—”With the acquisition, we expect that figure will grow,” said Salci. The research is focused on artificial intelligence, big data, cybersecurity and connectivity/IoT, and Thales says it plans to tackle challenges like unmanned air traffic management, data and network cybersecurity, airport security, and financial transaction security.

Gemalto will form one of Thales’ seven global divisions, called Digital Identity and Security.

“The digital identity and security capabilities that Gemalto is bringing to Thales will really help us leverage our past acquisitions and the work that we’re doing out of Montreal in AI,” said Salci. She also noted, “Our work in Canada involves a lot of systems integration and software engineering and Gemalto brings to the table capabilities like biometrics and authentication. So there’s a lot of complimentary opportunities that we see across the landscape to leverage Thales’ experience on the engineering side with Gemalto’s experience in digital identity and security.”

Philippe Vallée, CEO of Gemalto, spoke about the acquisition in a teleconference, “At the end of the day, if you need to capture the two essential elements that we are bringing to Thales, we know how to authenticate people and things, and second, and we know how to protect data.”

Vallée highlighted Gemalto’s expertise in authenticating users of online accounts, working through the three stages of this process: identifying a new user; tracking that user’s online activity; and lastly; when they want to leave a service, ensuring that they are forgotten and their data is wiped out.

Philippe Keryer, executive vice-president, strategy, research and technology at Thales, also mentioned during the same teleconference Gemalto’s work with a technology called silent authentication, which tracks the way a user types on their keyboard and uses their mouse and compares against past behaviour to authenticate them. He says this solution can be a huge boon to Thales’ work in AI.

Keryer said that both companies will benefit mutually from the transaction, as the new business group it creates will “be at the heart of digital transformation of many markets, markets from the connected car to telecom operators.”

The project of the Hawkei was launched in September 2009 and the first prototype vehicle was unveiled in November 2010. Thales Australia is the prime contractor in the design and development of Australia’s Hawkei lightweight mobility vehicle. Boeing, Plasan Sasa and PAC Group are partners of Thales, supporting the Hawkei project.

In October 2015, Defence entered into a contract with Thales to acquire and support 1100 Hawkei vehicles and 1058 trailers. Total budget and related funding for the Protected Mobility Vehicle — Light capability, as estimated by the ANAO, is $2.2 billion.1 Defence has expended $463.1 million of project funds to 30 June 2018, as well as $293.9 million on related costs.

In February 2019, during the defense exhibition IDEX, Thales Australia confirmed the vehicle is now in production for the Australian army, 70 units having already been delivered. The full-rate production will start by the end of 2019, a few months late on initial schedule. 1,100 units (plus 1,000 associated trailers) are to be delivered to the Australian army by 2021.

During SOFINS 2019, Thales has confirmed that the Hawkei will be offered for some program of armed forces in Europe. In 2018, the Australian Newspaper website has announced that the global export market for the Australian-made Hawkei light armored vehicle could be worth up to $2 billion. The first export contracts for the Hawkei could be in place in the next few months, with European nations expressing an interest in the Australian-designed protected ­mobility vehicle.

The layout of Hawkei 4x4 light protected vehicle is conventional, with the engine at the front, crew and troops compartment in the center and large cargo area at the rear. It incorporates high levels of blast and ballistic protection in a light, highly maneuverable and readily air transportable vehicle that has been engineered for peak performance.

The Hawkei 4x4 light protected vehicle is motorized with a six-cylinder, 3.2 liter direct injection diesel engine rated at 225 kW and producing maximum torque of 680 Nm at 2,000 rpm. It can run at a maximum road speed of 115 km/h with a maximum cruising range of 600 km."

Mayor Don Iveson addressed the Notice of Termination Tuesday, after Thales went public with the change earlier in the day.

“This isn’t about picking a scapegoat, as Thales has characterized it,” Iveson said. “This is about accountability and standing up for Edmontonians. You deserve a system that works.“

The City issued a Notice of Default on May 1, 2018, and Thales committed to a completion date of December 4, 2018. The signaling system underwent testing and the City determined that it is not ready or reliable.

“After more than five years of delays, it is clear that Thales cannot deliver the signaling system we were promised,” City Manager Linda Cochrane said. “This is not the outcome we wanted. It was in all of our best interest – the City of Edmonton, for Thales and for Edmontonians – to get the signaling system that we hired Thales to deliver. But at some point, we had to call it and we did.”

The Metro Line will continue operating at its current capacity while work begins on an alternative signaling system.

The decision to terminate the contract was unanimously supported by City Council. The City intends to recover all the costs associated with the Thales signaling system.

“We will now vigorously defend the interests of Edmontonians through the legal processes that unfold from here,” Mayor Iveson said. “You deserve a system that works.”"

Thales strengthens partnership with Qatar University| Gulf Times - Gulf Times,"Wed, 24 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmd1bGYtdGltZXMuY29tL3N0b3J5LzYyOTcwMS90aGFsZXMtc3RyZW5ndGhlbnMtcGFydG5lcnNoaXAtd2l0aC1xYXRhci11bml2ZXJzaXR50gFgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ3VsZi10aW1lcy5jb20vc3RvcnkvNjI5NzAxL3RoYWxlcy1zdHJlbmd0aGVucy1wYXJ0bmVyc2hpcC13aXRoLXFhdGFyLXVuaXZlcnNpdHkvYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"French aerospace, transportation, defense, security and space group Thales has further strengthened its partnership with Qatar University (QU), to reinforce the transfer of knowledge in cybersecurity, by extending its sponsorship of a 'Professional Chair' and by providing a cutting edge Cyber Range software training platform.





This builds on the agreement Thales signed with Qatar University to sponsor a 'Professional Chair' in 2014. The renewed partnership on the cyber security demonstrates the trustful cooperation established between Qatar University and Thales over the years, and Thales strong commitment to support Qatars education sector in the long run.



With the contribution of the Cyber Range software training platform to Qatar University, developed in collaboration with Diateam, Thales offers another advanced training tool for students. Cyber Range is designed to help organizations improve their capabilities to ensure that they are adequately prepared for cyberattacks. Cyber Range has three critical services: practice, validation and experimentation. As a training platform, it aims at developing skills to defend systems and organizations against cyber-attacks. It also reproduces/simulates information and industrial systems from the simplest to the most complicated, in order to analyze their resistance to attacks. It is also a perfect tool to evaluate the products and solutions in terms of cyber security.



Commenting on the agreement, College of Engineering Dean Prof Abdelmagid Hammuda said: ""This cooperation with Thales to renew the chair MoU which represents the good relations between academia and industry and the commitment of both to graduate highly professional engineers in different industrial areas. We are proud of this partnership which will add great value to education and research at QU and which will contribute significantly to Qatar's society as a whole.""



Frederic Sallet, Qatar VP, Country Director of Thales Group, said: ""The sponsorship of the Professional Chair for cybersecurity by Thales has achieved tangible results with Qatar University, developing stronger skillsets and access to knowledge based on this important topic that is central to the digital transformation shaping Qatar today in line with the Qatar National Vision 2030. The renewed partnership also highlights the industry-academic links that are central to driving Qatari human capital development, especially in technology. Thales Groups continuous support will further add to the skills of Qatari youth as they start their careers in both the public and private sector."""
Thales Cancels Plans To Sell Atrax Bullpup Rifle On US Civilian Market - - The Firearm Blog,"Wed, 10 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZpcmVhcm1ibG9nLmNvbS9ibG9nLzIwMTkvMDQvMTAvdGhhbGVzLWNhbmNlbHMtcGxhbnMtdG8tc2VsbC1hdHJheC1idWxscHVwLXJpZmxlLW9uLXVzLWNpdmlsaWFuLW1hcmtldC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Atrax bullpup rifle was developed as a semi-automatic version of the Australian Defense Force’s F90. Lithgow Arms has been planning to sell the Atrax on the civilian market in the United States since 2016. However, a spokesman for Thales, the company that developed the upgrades for the Steyr AUG variant, announced that they were canceling plans for the civilian version based on “ethical grounds”.

TFB has kept readers abreast of the developments of the EF-88/ F90 bullpup rifle since its introduction in 2012. Thales won the contract to produce the F90 in 2014. TFB also reported on the first operational deployment to Iraq in 2017, where it reportedly earned the respect of those that fielded it. However, it was 2016 that brought multiple reports of a semi-automatic version. First, was the announcement of a semi-auto version being marketed for police. Later that year, it was announced that the semi-auto version of the F90, later named as the Atrax, would be offered on the civilian market.

The timing of the announcement to cancel civilian sales seems somewhat questionable from a business standpoint. In 2017, TFB reported that Lithgow Arms would be producing the Atrax bullpup rifle for the civilian market and that they were taking pre-orders. Furthermore, it was reported in 2018 that some of the components were being produced in the United States to meet importation compliance. TFB’s Nathaniel F. wrote:

Representatives of Dasan USA, the stateside manufacturer/importer, said that major components of the Atrax, including the barrel, were already being produced in their facilities within the country, to allow production weapons to comply with US import laws. Dasan Representatives said that the technical data package for the US-made components was transferred to the US from Australia, so each component made in the States adheres exactly to Lithgow’s methods and standards for that component.

You can read the rest of Nathaniel’s post here, which has more interesting data on the unique serialized receiver. The Australian reported that no F90 variants had been sold, other than to governmental agencies. There was no mention of where it leaves the Dasan company or those that pre-ordered in the wake of Thales’ “ethical” decision.

The video below is TFB TV’s James Reeves’ review of the Steyr AUG A3. Even though the Steyr isn’t exactly the same as the Atrax rifle, they share the same principles of operation and fielding. It seems that for the time being, the Steyr AUG A3 is the closest the civilian market will get to an Atrax. It should be noted that Steyr has also updated their rifles to be more modular as well as offering a .300BLK version.

Have you, or anyone you know already pre-ordered an Atrax bullpup rifle? Have you received any word as to how your money will be handled?"
Thales Partner with Kalyani for Indian Army Carbine Competition - - The Firearm Blog,"Mon, 15 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZpcmVhcm1ibG9nLmNvbS9ibG9nLzIwMTkvMDQvMTUvdGhhbGVzLXBhcnRuZXItd2l0aC1rYWx5YW5pLWZvci1pbmRpYW4tYXJteS1jYXJiaW5lLWNvbXBldGl0aW9uL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales Australia have teamed up with Indian corporation, the Kalyani Group, to submit the F90CQB bullpup to fulfil India’s 5.56x45mm carbine requirement. The partnership also spans Thales’ other products including the Hawkei protected mobility vehicle and Bushmaster gun system.

The agreement was signed aboard HMAS Canberra during a visit to India. Rajinder Singh Bhatia, President & CEO (Defence & Aerospace), Kalyani Group, said:

We are very excited to enter the military weapon systems segment. This alliance will combine Thales’s advance technology, knowledge and experience as an OEM with world class design, development and manufacturing capabilities of the Kalyani Group. Our cooperation aims to provide indigenously manufactured solutions for both the Indian and international markets, thereby furthering the ‘Make in India’ initiative of the government.

Kevin Wall, Thales’ Vice President for vehicles and tactical systems, added:

We are very pleased to bring high-end technology from Australia and work in close collaboration with the Kalyani Group for the design and development of next generation defence systems including variants of the F90 assault rifle already in service with the Australian Defence Forces. This new collaboration will help us serve India as well as international markets. This partnership is the result of our ambition to support soldiers on operations with next generation, cutting edge technology and reaffirms our commitment to India.

Reports suggest that the CQB carbine programme might call for as many as 350,000 rifles. We at TFB have been closely monitoring India’s rifle procurement for some time and we’ve recently seen some progress in terms of the selection of the AK-203 and the SIG Sauer SIG716 to fulfil requirements for infantry rifles. A large number of sniper rifles have been ordered too from Beretta and Barrett.

What the new partnership with Kalyani means for the memorandums of understanding signed between Thales and another Indian company, MKU Ltd., a year ago is unclear. Thales had previously announced that they would work with MKU to produce rifles and optics in India for submission to the Indian Army’s close-quarter battle (CQB) carbine requirement.

The F90CQB may face competition from a number of companies. Earlier this year it was reported that negotiations were underway for the purchase of 95,000 5.56x45mm rifles from Caracal. While back in July 2018, we reported that Punj Lloyd Raksha Systems had teamed up with IWI to manufacture the X95 in India, it seems likely that this will also be submitted to fulfil the CQB carbine requirement.

The partnership in India comes as Thales Australia announce that they will not seek to import the F90 into the US for commercial sale as the Atrax on ‘ethical grounds’."
Lithgow Arms Halts Upcoming Release of F90 Atrax Rifle to US Commercial Market - AllOutdoor,"Sat, 06 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsbG91dGRvb3IuY29tLzIwMTkvMDQvMDYvbGl0aGdvdy1hcm1zLWhhbHRzLXVwY29taW5nLXJlbGVhc2UtZjkwLWF0cmF4LXJpZmxlLXVzLWNvbW1lcmNpYWwtbWFya2V0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Lithgow Arms Halts Upcoming Release of F90 Atrax Rifle to US Commercial Market Dickson 04.06.19



According to an exclusive article in The Weekend Australian, the Australian manufacturer Lithgow Arms will not be selling the highly anticipated semi-automatic F90 Atrax bullpup rifle chambered in 5.56mm Nato to the American commercial market.

Lithgow Arms is located in Lithgow, Australia and is owned by defense contractor Thales Group in France.

The article published on March 29th states “…today a Thales spokesman said the company had dropped plans to sell any of the rifles to civilian markets on ethical grounds.”

The decision was likely to be influenced by the New Zealand Christchurch mosque shootings incident of which the gunman killed 50 people.

This rifle has been shown to the American audience numerous times at SHOT Show in previous years. Back in January 2018 the manufacturer even claimed to have started US production.

The Atrax is largely based on the Steyr AUG, with improvements made such as case deflector, ambidextrous magazine release within reach of your shooting index finger, a quick detachable “upper” that includes the barrel and picatinny top rail which allows mounted optic to returns to zero.

The select fire version, called the F88 Austeyr, comes in several variants and are the current issue rifle for the Australian Army."
