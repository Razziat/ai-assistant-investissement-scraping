Monitoring plant health from Space to evaluate the health of Earth’s ecosystem

Cannes, January 10, 2019 - Thales Alenia Space announced that it has signed a contract with the European Space Agency (ESA) to lead the Fluorescence Explorer (FLEX) satellite mission. FLEX was selected in 2015 as ESA's eighth Earth Explorer mission, and is scheduled for launch in 2023. It will make use of an innovative instrument, named FLORIS, to map the Earth’s vegetation fluorescence to quantify photosynthetic activity.

Thales Alenia Space is program prime contractor and has also signed a novation agreement to integrate the contract that ESA awarded to Leonardo in 2016 concerning the development of the FLORIS instrument. The overall contract is worth approximately €150 million.

Thales Alenia Space will be leading a consortium for the FLEX program that includes its own subsidiaries and partners from the space industry. Thales Alenia Space in the UK will be in charge of the satellite propulsion system, as well as assembly, integration and testing (AIT). Thales Alenia Space in Spain will provide the radio-frequency subsystem, including X-band and S-band transponders, and RUAG will contribute to the design and production of the platform.

Leonardo’s FLORIS instrument is a high-resolution imaging spectrometer operating in the 500-880 nm spectral range. Leonardo is leading a consortium of European companies, including primary partner OHB System AG, to deliver the spectrometer. Operating from an altitude of 800 kilometers, the FLEX instrument will collect the light emitted by plants and break it down into its constituent colors. The sensor can then identify the faint reddish glow emitted during photosynthesis, normally invisible to the naked eye, and precisely identify the fluorescence of vegetation, allowing researchers to evaluate the health of Earth’s ecosystem.

“This contract is the culmination of Thales Alenia Space’s development strategy in Europe, including our ability to submit the first full consortium offer for ESA that integrates the industry consortium very early in the process,” said Marc Henri Serre, head of the Observation and Science domain at Thales Alenia Space in France. “The FLEX program is the latest reflection of our strong commitment to environmental programs and a perfect illustration of our company’s watchword, ‘Space for Life’.”

The conversion of atmospheric carbon dioxide and sunlight into energy-rich carbohydrates through photosynthesis is one of the most fundamental processes on Earth – and one on which life depends. Information from FLEX will improve our understanding of how carbon moves between plants and the atmosphere and how photosynthesis affects the carbon and water cycles. In addition, information from FLEX will give us a better insight into plant health. This is especially important today since the Earth’s growing population is placing increasing demands on the production of food and animal feed.

The FLEX satellite will orbit in tandem with one of the Sentinel-3 satellites (part of Europe’s Copernicus program), also built by Thales Alenia Space. It will take advantage of Sentinel-3’s optical and thermal sensors to provide an integrated package of measurements to assess plant health. FLEX is to be orbited by a Vega light launcher. It will be placed in a Sun-synchronous orbit at an altitude of 815 km, with an expected latency of 24 hours for Level-1 products.

"Private College for $11,000 a Year? Libertarian Businessman Creates an Alternative to Higher Ed Waste - Reason","Fri, 25 Jan 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vcmVhc29uLmNvbS8yMDE5LzAxLzI1L3ByaXZhdGUtY29sbGVnZS1mb3ItMTEwMDAtYS15ZWFyLWxpYmVydGEv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Bob Luddy is the founder and owner of CaptiveAire, the world's largest commercial kitchen ventilation manufacturer, with $500 million in 2018 revenues, zero debt, 1,300 employees, and factories in seven states. His latest venture is a non-profit college that seeks to slash typical costs and improve quality, offering an alternative to the wasteful practices of higher ed.

""Industries fall into group think,"" Luddy told Reason. ""Anybody in their right mind would go to a college and say, 'why do you need all these buildings?'""

Thales College, which is launching this fall in the Raleigh, North Carolina area, isn't Luddy's first education venture. He started a charter school in 1998, and a Catholic school in 2001. The charter, Franklin Academy, is the third largest in North Carolina, with four applicants vying for every one kindergarten spot. But, in Luddy's view, charters have limited potential for disruption because state regulators won't consent to radical approaches.

So in 2007 he launched Thales Academy, a network of K-12 private schools affordable for working-class families. (Watch ""Libertarian Builds Low Cost Schools for the Masses."") Thales keeps costs down by cutting out virtually all administrative employees and nonessentials. Its seven locations (soon to be eight) with over 3,000 students don't have auditoriums because they're expensive to heat and cool. And they don't have sports teams, which Luddy considers distractions. Annual tuition is $5,300 for elementary school, and $6,000 for junior high and high school.

Luddy's latest project brings his brand of cost cutting and innovation to higher education. Students will pay $10,667 annually for a degree that will take just three years, since classes will run 45 weeks per year rather than the conventional 30, appealing to students and families unwilling to take on crushing debt. The school's strategy for keeping costs down will mirror CaptiveAire's: cut out non-essentials, aggressively integrate new technologies, and otherwise seek every opportunity to break with widely accepted practices that are useless or wasteful.

Thales will be a teaching college, where the faculty doesn't face pressure to publish or perish. Lectures will be offered online, so that students can watch (and rewatch) at home. Since online learning can't replicate the value of one-on-one mentoring, each student will get at least an hour per week alone with a professor.

Prospective students will need to score higher than the 60th percentile on the SAT or ACT. Thales will function as a commuter school, limiting the applicant pool, but the school may consider serving out of towners in the future. Some applicants, however, will be turned off by the offering of a single program with no electives, a Bachelor of Liberal Arts, with set courses offered in Western literature, ethics, math, logic, economics, and finance.

Luddy's decision to offer a fixed curriculum grew out of his experiences hiring talent at CaptiveAire. What ""some of these graduates of engineering programs don't know is shocking,"" he says. The best employees, in his view, learn on the job and through their own initiative. ""One of the top three engineers in our company never went to engineering school,"" Luddy says. His focus is on creating self-starters.

Thales College won't seek accreditation because doing so would be a ""hindrance,"" says Dr. Timothy Hall, who will serve as the school's director of operations and academics. Accrediting institutions require that colleges have research libraries and a certain number of Ph.D.s on their faculty, according to Hall. Luddy sees college research libraries as a waste of money in the online age, and Hall says that the school will hire the best teachers, whether they have doctorate degrees or not.

Lack of accreditation means students won't be eligible for federal loans, and if they decide to transfer schools, other accredited institutions may decline to honor the credits they've accrued. Hall says that won't be a problem. ""We're confident they'll be able to transfer credits,"" he says, because other institutions generally ask for syllabi to evaluate the quality of another school's courses. Hall's ""not sure"" if not being accredited will disqualify Thales alums from admission to some graduate programs, but anticipates that most will go right into the workforce. This is a school ""for entrepreneurs.""

Thales College will accept 45 students in its inaugural class, with ambitious expansion plans if the model is successful. In Luddy's view, ending all federal subsidies would be the fastest and most effective way to upend higher education. But that's unlikely to happen anytime soon. Societal change comes not through advocacy, but via ""exit:"" Create alternatives and people will vote with their wallets.

Jan. 18 (UPI) -- France's defense ministry has awarded Thales a contract to develop onboard sensors and communication systems for Rafale F-4 combat aircraft. The agreement allows the combat aircraft ""to maintain its superiority against new threats,"" Thales said in a news release Friday. Advertisement

On Monday, France's government signed a $2.3 billion contract for 28 updated Rafale fighter jets from French-headquartered Dassault Aviation.

In all, 500 French firms are part of the Rafale program, including Dassault Aviation, which will serve as the industrial architect and be responsible for deploying new connectivity solutions.

Rafale's role includes reconnaissance, air defense and precision strikes during a single mission. The company noted the aircraft is ""a crucial component of France's National Security policy, which calls for the highest standards of levels of technological excellence,"" including airborne nuclear deterrence.

""This contract is a further endorsement by the French Ministry for the Armed Forces of the industrial know-how and advanced technology expertise of French defense contractors,"" Thales Chairman and CEO Patrice Caine said in a statement. ""The Rafale F4 standard's sensors and communication systems will be a key driver of the shift towards collaborative combat, and Thales's capabilities in connectivity and artificial intelligence will enable Rafale air crews to make the best choices in every decisive moment.""

Thales engineers and technicians plan to enhance the aircraft's onboard sensors and improve connectivity by enabling greater interconnection between the Rafale and all the other aircraft and ships deployed on the mission.

The TALIOS optronic pod will handle larger volumes of information in real time by incorporating artificial intelligence to analyze tactical data almost instantaneously in flight and extract and identify targets, the company said.

And new threat detection and jamming capabilities will be developed for the aircraft's SPECTRA electronic warfare system.

Thales will also prepare for the introduction of the CONTACT radio; secure, intelligent communications server technology; and a Syracuse IV satellite communications capability.

Also planned are improvements to the air-to-ground mode of the RBE2 active electronic scanning array radar, the company said.

The Rafale entered service with the French navy in 2004 and with the French air force in 2006.

Of the 180 aircraft ordered by France,152 have been delivered, Dassault said in a fact sheet.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9970159530639648}",positive,0.9970159530639648,1

French arms manufacturer Thales underpaid Australian workers by $5.4m - The Guardian,"Tue, 08 Jan 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS93b3JsZC8yMDE5L2phbi8wOC9mcmVuY2gtYXJtcy1tYW51ZmFjdHVyZXItdGhhbGVzLXVuZGVycGFpZC1hdXN0cmFsaWFuLXdvcmtlcnMtYnktNTRt0gFxaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL3dvcmxkLzIwMTkvamFuLzA4L2ZyZW5jaC1hcm1zLW1hbnVmYWN0dXJlci10aGFsZXMtdW5kZXJwYWlkLWF1c3RyYWxpYW4td29ya2Vycy1ieS01NG0?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The French multinational arms company Thales underpaid Australian workers by $5.4m over seven years. Some 240 Australian workers across five sites in Victoria and New South Wales have been affected.

Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning

Guardian Australia understands the underpayment was the result of a human resources bungle related to discrepancies between workers on individual contracts and those on a similar job classification on the collective agreement.

Thales Australia’s vice-president of strategy, Gary Dawson, said between September and November 2018 back payments, including superannuation and interest, were made to 240 current staff totalling $5.4m.

Thales employs 3,700 workers in Australia.

“We made it clear to the affected staff that this was an error that should not have occurred, we’re sorry it happened, and that, having discovered it, we are determined to fix it and ensure it doesn’t happen again in the future,” he said.

“We are now examining records for staff who have left the company to determine whether any payments are owing to former employees, with the process expected to be finalised by March.”

Employees working in middle management, administration, production, technical and engineering roles were affected. Some staff at the munitions operations at Benalla in Victoria and Mulwala in NSW were affected along with those at Bendigo involved in the Bushmaster and Hawkei army vehicles projects. Other workers at ship repair sites at Garden Island in Sydney and Newcastle were also underpaid.

The company identified the underpayment issue in the first half of 2018. It brought in Deloitte to go through its pay rolls and also informed relevant unions and the Fair Work Ombudsman.

“For many employees, it’s come out of the blue, it’s a windfall,” a defence industry insider said.

Thales has attracted controversy in recent months over the federal government’s partial redaction of a report by the auditor general finding that Australia could have saved hundreds of millions of dollars had it gone to the United States to buy its new fleet of light protected army vehicles instead of buying 1,100 of Thales’s Hawkeis.

A spokesman for the Fair Work Ombudsman said it was making its own independent inquiries into the matter and the company has been assisting.

Labor’s workplace spokesman Brendan O’Connor said, “Labor is concerned about any underpayment of Australian workers, but we welcome the company’s actions to repay its workforce.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999848484992981}",neutral,0.999848484992981,0

AI could be key pilot training aid - Skies Magazine,"Tue, 29 Jan 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vc2tpZXNtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWktY291bGQtYmUta2V5LWFpZGUtZm9yLWZsaWdodC1pbnN0cnVjdG9ycy_SAUpodHRwczovL3NraWVzbWFnLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FpLWNvdWxkLWJlLWtleS1haWRlLWZvci1mbGlnaHQtaW5zdHJ1Y3RvcnMvP2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Chris Thatcher | January 29, 2019 Chris Thatcher |

Estimated reading time 6 minutes, 55 seconds.

Artificial intelligence (AI) may someday transform how aircraft fly, but one of the early beneficiaries of the emerging technology could be more elemental–flight instructors.

Imagine sitting behind a student pilot in a cockpit simulator and, on a tablet in real time, having precise biometric and other performance data as she executes a difficult procedure. Was the student calm or was her heart rate significantly elevated? Were her eyes scanning the correct displays and controls or looking elsewhere?

Flight simulators already provide instructors with plenty of information on a student’s performance. And a lab can gather biometric data from an array of body sensors. Combining the two in a way that doesn’t distract the student from the task at hand is another matter. Enter AI.

Thales is developing a non-invasive method to monitor performance, using cameras and AI to provide instructors with insight into the mental and physical state of a student during critical moments in training.

The application, called HuMANS, synchronizes and contextualizes what might otherwise be an overload of data, explained Christophe Bruzy, the technical director of simulators for the French aerospace, defence, transportation and security company.

It employs an array of seven cameras to monitor and track the eye movements and other physical responses of a student that the AI then displays in graphical detail. In a debrief, instructors can select specific phases of the flight to show a student exactly what has happened, simultaneously presenting a map of the flight, a video of the student in the cockpit, and a graphic of their eye movement, among other information. Instructor notes made on the tablet during the session are also synched with the flight.

The system can help an instructor identify and correct “inappropriate behaviour,” said Bruzy, and is not platform agnostic, meaning it could be adapted to any flight or vehicle training system.

Using similar technology, Thales is also developing a training system for air traffic controllers (ATCs) that could significantly improve their effectiveness while reducing the time and cost of instruction.

Faced with a shortage of ATCs and a flight volume that is expected to double in Europe over the next two decades, “this is our solution to cope with the increase in training needs raised by this huge increase in traffic load that is coming,” said Jean-Phillipe Pinheiro, manager of Thales’ SkyCentre air traffic management innovation lab.

Called SkyCentre-SimDebrief, the system tracks the actions of a trainee. It monitors eye movement and heart rate and captures voice cadence and duration of calls with pilots as the student manages simulated aircraft separation. All of that information is available to assist the instructor in real-time.

“If you were an instructor doing a simulation with your trainee, the electronic instructor assistant would be like another instructor sitting alongside you,” said Pinheiro. “It would be looking at a lot of data, detecting if something is going well, going bad, and touching you on the shoulder [to say] there is something happening at this position.”

He compared the experience to the motivating effect of a smartwatch that synthesizes a wealth of data on a person’s physical activity and encourages them to keep going.

To refine the AI of each system, Thales is using machine learning based on instructor grading and feedback.

The presentations were two of more than a dozen panels and demonstrations of AI applications in transport, defence, cybersecurity, healthcare, and cities during a media day hosted at the company’s new Centre of Research and Technology in Artificial Intelligence eXpertise (CortAIx) in Montreal.

Thales typically invests about 20 per cent of its revenue in research and development and has been exploring AI for almost 30 years, said chairman and CEO Patrice Caine. Since 2016, though, it has invested over $10 billion in AI, connectivity, big data and cybersecurity. It opened Digital Factory, a digital incubator and cyber security hub, in Paris in 2017, and CortAIx in 2018.

The interest in Canada is well timed. In late December, the federal government announced nearly $230 million for a Quebec-based AI-powered supply chain supercluster, called SCALE.AI. That followed the creation in early December of an international panel on AI to share research results and best practices and convene international AI initiatives. The panel was first announced by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and French president Emmanuel Macron on June 7, 2018.

In a wide-ranging discussion before the demonstrations, Caine acknowledged the risks associated with AI–he specifically pledged not to invest in autonomous killing machines: “It’s not that difficult to say no to killer robots,” he said. But he argued more transparency is needed to “build trust” and understanding in the decisions AI applications make if they are to be readily accepted.

“I don’t think the solution is to put AI in a cage and make everything secret,” he said.

Everybody’s familiar with GPS, the American Global Positioning System for satellite-based navigation. And you’ve undoubtedly heard of Galileo, the European counterpart. But did you know that Galileo already considerably improves the GPS signal received by your smartphone? Designed to meet the civilian needs of European citizens, the Galileo system offers higher precision… and it has already been adopted by over 500 million users… So what are you waiting for?

About GALILEO

Galileo is Europe’s own global navigation satellite system (GNSS). Up and running since December 15, 2016, Galileo’s initial services are fully interoperable with GPS, while offering users an expanded range of performance and service levels, along with far more accurate positioning. Based on initial feedback from European users, navigation is greatly improved, and geolocation is better. While other satellite navigation systems are run by the armed forces in the United States (GPS), Russia (GLONASS) and China (Beidou), Galileo remains under civilian control, the only GNSS system of this kind. Once all planned Galileo satellites are in operation – the complete constellation should be in orbit towards 2020 – users will be able to enjoy the full range of services.

Thales Alenia Space’s contribution

In October 2018, the European Space Agency (ESA) further cemented its trust in Thales Alenia Space by awarding the company a contract for the operational phase of the Galileo Mission Segment (GMS) and the Galileo Security Facility (GSF), together designated as WP2X.

Worth about 324 million euros, this first contract includes the development and deployment of new versions of the infrastructure needed to optimize Galileo services by the end of 2020, especially for the Open Service offering, which will reach Full Operational Capability, and for Public Regulated Services, which will then offer Initial Operational Capability. The contract also encompasses the maintenance of current operational versions of the GMS and GSF. Supported by a Thales Alenia Space-led consortium, ESA and the European GNSS Agency (GSA) will strengthen Galileo’s ground infrastructures, making them more robust.

On December 20, 2018, Thales Alenia Space had also announced the signature of a new tranche of the framework contract first signed on October 18, 2018 with ESA, on behalf of the European Commission and the GSA. This latest tranche, worth about 130 million euros, will cover the period up to June 2021 concerning:

Completion of the PRS (Public Regulated Services) service offering.

Adapting the ground segment to handle, via the Point of Contact Platforms, the interface between the following: The Galileo security center (GSMC) in charge of managing PRS access to the new system. Government entities that control access on their own receivers.



“Thales Alenia Space and partners will offer our top-flight solutions, enabling us to address the requirements of European citizens and Galileo users, in terms of improved services, and meet the challenge of ensuring Europe’s strategic independence via an appropriate PRS service,” said Jean-Loïc Galle, President and CEO of Thales Alenia Space.

It’s against this backdrop, galvanized by these two latest contracts, that the production program – code name “WP2X” – will be officially launched on January 23 in Toulouse, in a ceremony attended by our customers and partners, as well as our own program team. You could even say that this is a “European dream team”, created to shepherd an outstanding satellite navigation program!

Thales to develop new connected sensors for Rafale F4 standard - EDR Magazine,"Fri, 18 Jan 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVkcm1hZ2F6aW5lLmV1L3RoYWxlcy10by1kZXZlbG9wLW5ldy1jb25uZWN0ZWQtc2Vuc29ycy1mb3ItcmFmYWxlLWY0LXN0YW5kYXJk0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Paris La Défense – 18.01.2019 – Thales, as a member of the Rafale joint venture (Groupement d’Intérêt Economique), has been awarded a contract by the French defence procurement agency (DGA) to contribute to the development of the Rafale F4 standard, enabling the Rafale combat aircraft to maintain its superiority against new threats.

Today, the Rafale is capable of performing multiple roles, ranging from reconnaissance to air defence and precision strikes, in the course of a single mission. The aircraft is also central to France’s airborne nuclear deterrence, a crucial component of France’s National Security policy, which calls for the highest standards of levels of technological excellence. Tomorrow’s combat aircraft aircrews will face a broader range of threats in increasingly complex operational environments, and will therefore need to analyse larger volumes of data in very short timeframes to ensure mission success and protect civil populations. The sophisticated electronic equipment and systems Thales equips on the Rafale, from nose-to-tail, will help these aircrews meet these challengers.

Under the Rafale F4 standard development programme, Thales engineers and technicians will enhance the aircraft’s onboard sensors and improve connectivity to offer a broader range of

capabilities and new operational functions by enabling greater interconnection between the Rafale and all the other assets deployed on the mission. Collaborative combat is now crucial for taking part in coalition operations, countering new types of threats and conducting sovereignty operations. In particular, Thales will prepare for the introduction of the CONTACT radio; secure, intelligent communications server technology; and a Syracuse IV satellite communications capability. To ensure high survivability, new threat detection and jamming capabilities will be developed for the aircraft’s SPECTRA electronic warfare system. Further improvements to the air-to-ground mode of the RBE2 active electronic scanning array (AESA) radar are also planned. In addition, the TALIOS optronic pod will incorporate artificial intelligence to analyse tactical data almost instantaneously in flight and extract and identify targets.

The enhancements will enable aircrews to assess tactical situations more effectively, handle significantly larger volumes of information in real time, and make the best choices in every decisive moment in order to safely and securely locate, identify, classify and engage threats, and to assess and analyse the results of the action taken.

To meet the needs of users, armed forces also need a high level of equipment availability. The development of predictive maintenance based on technologies such as Big Data and artificial intelligence is a key component of Thales’s strategy. The purpose of predictive maintenance is to anticipate failures before they occur: Thales’s new developments for the Rafale F4 standard aim to make this objective a reality.

“This contract is a further endorsement by the French Ministry for the Armed Forces of the industrial know-how and advanced technology expertise of French defence contractors. The Rafale F4 standard’s sensors and communication systems will be a key driver of the shift towards collaborative combat, and Thales’s capabilities in connectivity and artificial intelligence will enable Rafale air crews to make the best choices in every decisive moment,” Patrice Caine, Chairman & CEO, Thales.

Thales onboard the Rafale Thales provides a wide range of sophisticated equipment and systems for the Rafale, including the RBE2 active electronic scanning array (AESA) radar, the SPECTRA electronic warfare system, the front-sector optronic systems, the CNI system (communication, navigation, identification), the majority of the cockpit display systems, power generation systems and a logistics support component.

The world’s highest performance and most sophisticated telecom constellation now fully deployed

Cannes, January 11, 2019 – The last batch of Iridium® NEXT satellites, built by Thales Alenia Space, the joint company between Thales (67%) and Leonardo (33%), was successfully launched today from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. With this successful eighth launch, the Iridium NEXT fleet is now fully deployed to low earth orbit. The operational constellation comprises 66 satellites, at an altitude of about 780 kilometers, organized in six orbital planes, each containing 11 satellites, plus nine spare satellites in a parking orbit and six more ground spares.

The major challenge for Thales Alenia Space, as prime contractor for the Iridium® NEXT program, was to deploy a complex, end-to-end turnkey satellite system, while also ensuring compatibility between the old and new generations of Iridium Block One satellites. It marks the first time that an operator and a manufacturer have worked hand-in-hand to replace a complete constellation of 66 satellites, one-by-one, without any interruption in user service*.

The Iridium® NEXT constellation, now completely in orbit, represents the current state-of-the-art in terms of technology and flexibility. It features global coverage and independence from the ground segment, since each satellite is linked to the four closest satellites: in front, behind, to the left and the right. No matter where users are on Earth, they will always be in the line-of-sight of at least one satellite, meaning that they can always establish a connection. This type of direct satellite access, whether for transmission or reception, provides communication capability at any given moment, even in the case of natural disasters, conflicts, or in isolated environments. It also ensures secure communications, with protection against intrusion and piracy**.

Denis Allard, Vice-President Constellation Projects at Thales Alenia Space, said: “Thales Alenia Space is very proud of this successful last launch. We have just delivered a constellation comprising 81 satellites – a daunting challenge, but one that our teams met with panache. The success of this program also confirms Thales Alenia Space’s global leadership in the constellation market, and further bolsters our unrivaled expertise as prime contractor for end-to-end and turnkey complex telecommunications systems.”

* Slot swap

Thales Alenia Space handled satellite positioning and in-orbit testing from Iridium’s satellite control center in Leesburg, Virginia, near Washington, D.C. The satellites are launched in clusters of ten and, given their LEO orbit, ground stations have only ten minutes per orbit to send commands while the satellites are visible. This means that all teams had to be exceptionally well prepared and on top of their game to do everything needed during those ten minutes.

The new satellites are then placed in their final orbital position one by one, before control is handed over to Iridium’s teams for the actual “slot swap” operations, handled by Iridium with the support of Thales Alenia Space, based on procedures defined and tested by Thales Alenia Space. Each Iridium® NEXT satellite is fitted with a star sensor from Leonardo that guarantees orbital position-determination and control. The satellites were previously integrated by Northrop Grumman Corporation (the former Orbital ATK), a subcontractor to Thales Alenia Space based in Gilbert, Arizona, supervised by specialized teams from Thales Alenia Space and Iridium.

** Telecom signal routing in orbit

Each satellite has links to the four other closest satellites, in front, behind, left and right, making the service completely independent from ground networks. This in-orbit routing is completely software-driven by an onboard processor (OBP) and a platform computer (PFC). These software programs are the most sophisticated used to date on a constellation of satellites. They can also be uploaded from the ground, meaning that ground operators can send updates if needed, as well as deploy higher-performance versions, enabling Iridium to expand and enhance its customer services.

The Welsh Government is working with global technology company Thales to establish a £20m cyber centre which will sit at the heart of its Tech Valleys programme, Economy Minister Ken Skates has announced.

National Digital Exploitation Centre (NDEC)

The National Digital Exploitation Centre (NDEC) will be the first research and development facility of its kind in Wales, and will provide the perfect setting for SMEs and microbusinesses to test and develop their digital concepts.

It will also provide a research lab in which big multi nationals can develop major technology advances and will connect Wales to major tech centres across the UK and globally.

Not only will the cyber centre help Wales to exploit the global opportunities of digital transformation, it will also equip businesses with the skills and knowledge they need to win a greater share of large regional and national projects.

The NDEC, located in Blaenau Gwent will be delivered by Thales in collaboration with the University of South Wales (USW).

The University will run an Advanced Cyber Institute at the Centre that will provide a base for major, multi million pound, academic research, and will also operate a Digital Education Centre that will enable SMEs, schools and individuals with the skills they need to protect themselves online.

As well as providing a vital facility for Welsh SMEs and academic research, the NDEC will also root technology giant Thales firmly in the South Wales valleys. The centre will be managed by a small team, some of whom have already been recruited from the local community.

Both the Welsh Government and Thales have committed £10m each to the project which is expected to generate significant income. All elements, apart from the educational aspects of the centre, are expected to be fully self-sufficient within five years.

Announcing the Welsh Government’s partnership with Thales, Economy Minister Ken Skates said:

I am delighted that the Welsh Government is working in partnership with global technology company Thales on a new £20m cyber centre that will be located in Blaenau Gwent and right at the heart of our Tech Valleys project.

“The centre will help ensure that Wales exploits the global opportunities of digital transformation, provide a base for ground breaking research and will equip businesses of all shapes and sizes with the skills and knowledge they need to win a greater share of large regional and national projects.""

“I am confident that through our partnership with Thales and the University of South Wales we will work to stimulate and create employment in high value technology businesses - an ambition that is right at the heart of our Tech Valleys project.”

Speaking of the announcement, Gareth Williams, Vice President, Secure Communications and Information Systems, Thales, said:

“We are very pleased to be working with the Welsh Government, University of South Wales and Blaenau Gwent Council to develop and deliver the NDEC. This will act as a cornerstone of our cyber security capabilities in the UK, providing a test bed for our technology, whilst also providing a catalyst for regeneration in the region.

“This highly technical and accessible facility will be a centre of cyber and digital development and education, and a connection for South Wales to major technology centres across the United Kingdom.”

Professor Julie Lydon, University of South Wales (USW) Vice-Chancellor, said: “USW is already a recognised expert in cyber security, with our Newport-based National Cyber Security Academy (NCSA) working closely with businesses to give students real-life experience in the sector.

“This expertise in preparing students for a career in industry means we are ideally placed to support the NDEC’s aim of harnessing academic research and graduate education to develop market insight, enhance technological capability, and develop a skilled labour force in Ebbw Vale and the wider South Wales region through its educational outreach, CPD courses, and support for SMEs.

“This project will be a significant step in building the region’s reputation in the ever-expanding global market for cyber graduates and research expertise.”

The Tech Valleys project is a key commitment of the Ministerial Taskforce for the South Wales Valleys.

Last batch of Iridium NEXT satellites successfully launched - SatelliteProME.com,"Sun, 13 Jan 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vc2F0ZWxsaXRlcHJvbWUuY29tL25ld3MvbGFzdC1iYXRjaC1vZi1pcmlkaXVtLW5leHQtc2F0ZWxsaXRlcy1zdWNjZXNzZnVsbHktbGF1bmNoZWQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"With this eighth launch, the Iridium NEXT fleet is now fully deployed to low earth orbit. This means that no matter where users are on Earth, they will always be in the line-of-sight of at least one satellite.

The last batch of Iridium NEXT satellites, built by Thales Alenia Space, the joint company between Thales (67%) and Leonardo (33%), was successfully launched last week from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.

With this eighth launch, the Iridium NEXT fleet is now fully deployed to low earth orbit. The operational constellation comprises 66 satellites, at an altitude of about 780 kilometers, organised in six orbital planes, each containing 11 satellites, plus nine spare satellites in a parking orbit and six more ground spares.

Iridium has invested approximately $3 billion to replace its original satellite system with a new, state-of-the-art network, ushering in an era of financial and technological transformation for the company. At the core of this transformation is the dramatic change in cash flows as construction capital expenses end and a decade or longer “capex holiday” allows significant cash generation from existing and new services. These include Iridium Certus, which will provide the world’s fastest and global specialty L-band broadband connectivity, enabling highly mobile internet access using smaller and more cost-effective terminals, and the Aireon aircraft surveillance system, extending real-time visibility of aircraft for air traffic controllers and airlines to the entire planet for the first time.

“It has been an honour to deliver 75 new Iridium NEXT satellites to orbit. Matt and the entire Iridium NEXT team have been incredible to work with,” said Gwynne Shotwell, President and Chief Operating Officer at SpaceX.

The Iridium satellite constellation is presently the only communications network with pole-to-pole coverage of the entire planet. It comprises six polar orbiting planes, each containing 11 cross-linked satellites totaling 66 in the operational constellation, creating a web of coverage around the Earth. The 10 Iridium NEXT satellites launched as part of this final mission were deployed to orbital plane three. Since the launches began, the constellation has been undergoing a one-for-one replacement, new satellite for old, achieved through a highly choreographed in-space maneuver known as a “slot swap.”

The major challenge for Thales Alenia Space, as prime contractor for the Iridium NEXT programme, was to deploy a complex, end-to-end turnkey satellite system, while also ensuring compatibility between the old and new generations of Iridium Block One satellites. It marks the first time that an operator and a manufacturer have worked hand-in-hand to replace a complete constellation of 66 satellites, one-by-one, without any interruption in user service*.

The Iridium NEXT constellation, now completely in orbit, represents the current state-of-the-art in terms of technology and flexibility. It features global coverage and independence from the ground segment, since each satellite is linked to the four closest satellites: in front, behind, to the left and the right. No matter where users are on Earth, they will always be in the line-of-sight of at least one satellite, meaning that they can always establish a connection. This type of direct satellite access, whether for transmission or reception, provides communication capability at any given moment, even in the case of natural disasters, conflicts, or in isolated environments. It also ensures secure communications, with protection against intrusion and piracy**.

Denis Allard, Vice-President Constellation Projects at Thales Alenia Space, said: “Thales Alenia Space is very proud of this successful last launch. We have just delivered a constellation comprising 81 satellites – a daunting challenge, but one that our teams met with panache. The success of this program also confirms Thales Alenia Space’s global leadership in the constellation market, and further bolsters our unrivaled expertise as prime contractor for end-to-end and turnkey complex telecommunications systems.”

To date, new satellites make up 60 of the 66 satellites in operation, with the final six scheduled for activation in the coming weeks from the launch. Iridium NEXT satellites were designed by Thales Alenia Space, which serves as system prime contractor, and are being integrated by Thales’ subcontractor, Northrop Grumman. The production process features an 18-station, state-of-the-art assembly line system for all 81 Iridium NEXT satellites being built.

“Totally deployed, Iridium NEXT is now arguably the world’s highest performance and most sophisticated constellation which represents today’s state of the art in terms of technology and flexibility and Thales Alenia Space is so proud for having risen to this huge challenge. I would like to thank Iridium for having placed its trust in us, and thank everybody at my company, at Iridium and at our partners for having worked as “One Team”, all with the sole objective of delivering the constellation to orbit as quickly as possible, while guaranteeing top-flight quality”, declared Jean Loïc Galle, CEO of Thales Alenia Space.

In total, 81 satellites are being built with 75 successfully launched. Nine of the satellites launched will serve as on-orbit spares, and the remaining six will be ground spares.

* Slot swap

Thales Alenia Space handled satellite positioning and in-orbit testing from Iridium’s satellite control center in Leesburg, Virginia, near Washington, D.C. The satellites are launched in clusters of ten and, given their LEO orbit, ground stations have only ten minutes per orbit to send commands while the satellites are visible. This means that all teams had to be exceptionally well prepared and on top of their game to do everything needed during those ten minutes.

The new satellites are then placed in their final orbital position one by one, before control is handed over to Iridium’s teams for the actual “slot swap” operations, handled by Iridium with the support of Thales Alenia Space, based on procedures defined and tested by Thales Alenia Space. Each Iridium® NEXT satellite is fitted with a star sensor from Leonardo that guarantees orbital position-determination and control. The satellites were previously integrated by Northrop Grumman Corporation (the former Orbital ATK), a subcontractor to Thales Alenia Space based in Gilbert, Arizona, supervised by specialized teams from Thales Alenia Space and Iridium.

** Telecom signal routing in orbit

Each satellite has links to the four other closest satellites, in front, behind, left and right, making the service completely independent from ground networks. This in-orbit routing is completely software-driven by an onboard processor (OBP) and a platform computer (PFC). These software programs are the most sophisticated used to date on a constellation of satellites. They can also be uploaded from the ground, meaning that ground operators can send updates if needed, as well as deploy higher-performance versions, enabling Iridium to expand and enhance its customer services.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9997238516807556}",neutral,0.9997238516807556,0
Flight club: new High-G training and test facility for fast-jet pilots - Thales,"Wed, 30 Jan 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi91bml0ZWQta2luZ2RvbS9uZXdzL2ZsaWdodC1jbHViLW5ldy1oaWdoLWctdHJhaW5pbmctYW5kLXRlc3QtZmFjaWxpdHktZmFzdC1qZXQtcGlsb3Rz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"On 4 February 2019, the new, state-of-the-art High G Training and Test Capability Facility was officially opened at the RAF College Cranwell. As part of a £44 million project with the Ministry of Defence, the facility has been designed to improve fighter pilot safety and provide realistic training for pilots exposed to high G-forces during combat missions. It will be run by Thales UK, in partnership with the RAF Centre of Aviation Medicine (CAM).

At the High G Training and Test Capability Facility is a new human training centrifuge, which can accelerate from 1G to 9 G in just one second! Built by the leading global provider of high G training equipment, AMST, the centrifuge will allow pilots flying the Hawk, Typhoon or new F35 Lighting II aircraft to develop and maintain their ability to withstand high G-forces in a safe environment. Each pilot can take up to 20 minutes session on the centrifuge and learn how to manage high-G onset rate as well as optimal use of the aircraft anti-G system.

Modern day flying

The new facility replaces the current human training centrifuge at Farnborough, which dates back to the 1950s, to ensure today’s RAF and Royal Navy pilots are prepared for the demands of modern day fast-jet aircraft.

In addition to the much-increased G onset rate, pilots can also experience the presence of flight simulation in the new centrifuge with high-resolution, out-of-the-window displays – provided by 4K projectors – to fill the forward field of view. Further training tasks are provided by the centrifuge Visual Training Cue system which includes flight through a series of gates in the sky and a missile threat/radar warning receiver. With these capabilities, pilots can better understand how to deal with the accelerations, while flying a combat aircraft and managing the mission systems.

This is an important evolution in the training pilots receive. The latest generation fighter aircraft can perform advanced manoeuvres at high speed, with multi-axes motions, and this provides significant advantage and superiority in the air. However, it also exposes pilots to new combinations of high acceleration and rotational motion which can cause a pilot to lose consciousness and, in the worst case, cause fatalities.

With this new facility, pilots can develop their ability to withstand high G-force on the ground and experience training under much more realistic conditions. It will, ultimately, save the lives of more fast-jet pilots.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9568049907684326}",positive,0.9568049907684326,1

The city expects it will take a number of months to complete the evaluation, which it said includes a review of documentation and field testing to determine whether Thales has met its contractual obligations.

Edmonton Transit Service (ETS) will have replacement buses every 15 minutes on the Metro Line between NAIT and Churchill, including eastbound bus stops by Bay and Central stations. Capital Line replacement buses run every seven to eight minutes.

The problem-plagued Metro Line has experienced several issues since it opened more than a year late in September 2015, including crossing arms coming down on green lights and trains heading in opposite directions on the same set of tracks.

Earlier this year, the city issued a notice of default to Thales.

A new timetable was established to fix the remaining issues with the system, and Tuesday, Dec. 4, 2018, was the date to hand the system over to the city to operate.

Thales said the system is ready after it was tested over last summer. The city is now conducting its own testing.

SAMI signs 2 joint ventures to localize military industries - Saudi Gazette,"Wed, 30 Jan 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiKmh0dHBzOi8vc2F1ZGlnYXpldHRlLmNvbS5zYS9hcnRpY2xlLzU1ODA1N9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"RIYADH — Under the patronage and in the presence of Crown Prince Muhammad Bin Salman, deputy premier, minister of defense and Vice President of the Council of Ministers and Minister of Defense, the Saudi Arabian Military Industries (SAMI) inked the establishment of two new joint ventures with Thales and CMI Defence.



The agreement was held on the sidelines of the launch of the National Industrial Development and Logistics Program (NIDLP).



The scope of the joint venture signed with the French company Thales includes air-defense short-range and counter-rockets radars, C2s, multi-mission missiles, and inter-communication radios. The project aims to invest in the facilities and equipment in the local market, at a localization ratio of 70%, while around 2,000 direct and indirect jobs will be generated for Saudi youth.



The second joint venture agreement, which is signed with Belgium’s CMI Defense, includes delivering multifunctional high-power turret systems for armored vehicles and all related services, providing in-country research and development and prototyping, design and systems engineering, supplier and material management, manufacturing, assembly and test, fielding and support, and upgrades, and integration of other OEM products and services. The project is expected to realize a localization rate of 60%, in addition to offering more than 700 direct and indirect jobs for the Saudi youth.



Ahmed Al-Khateeb, Chairman of SAMI, said these two joint ventures would play a large part in helping to achieve the objectives of Saudi Vision 2030. He added that they would help realize the ambitious announcement already made by the Crown Prince who said that he wants 50% of all military spending to be based locally by 2030.



SAMI has successfully signed 18 high-level agreements in December 2018 with major global, regional and local companies in the fields of technology, defense, security, research and development. The agreements included MoAs, MoUs, and MoCs with world-class companies of the magnitude of Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Paramount, Hensoldt, L3 Technologies, BAE Systems, UK Defence Solutions Centre (UK DSC), Airbus, MBDA, Leonardo, Prince Sultan Defense Studies and Research Center, Elettronica, and King Abdul Aziz City for Science and Technology (KACST).



Al-Khateeb pointed out that all of these agreements support the creation of the integrated defense industries ecosystem by involving the energy, industry and research institutions. This will contribute significantly to further enhancing the readiness of the Saudi Armed Forces and increasing local content, in addition to creating new job opportunities and training for Saudi youth to increase their contribution and raise their role in this vital industry and the national economy in general.



SAMI has also announced earlier the signing of an MoU with Mubadala Investment Co. The agreement aims to enhance the cooperation in the fields of aviation industry including manufacturing, Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO), and engineering, in line with the industrial transformation ambitious plans adopted by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The plans also include development of strategies across the value chain for the aerospace industry. This MoU is considered as a historic leap for the global aviation industry, since it develops a strategy for a promising industrial partnership between the Kingdom and the UAE.



The National Industrial Development and Logistics Program is one of the most important programs to achieve the vision of the Kingdom, as it implements more than 300 initiatives and develops 11 industries, including the automotive industry, military, medical, aquaculture and fish industries, all aiming to raise the Kingdom’s exports to 50% of the non-oil exports. The program aims at transforming the Kingdom into a leading industrial power and a global logistics platform, by focusing on four vital sectors, namely, industry, mining, energy and logistics, to contribute to GDP by SR1.2 trillion and provide 1.6 million jobs, in addition to attracting investments estimated at SR1.6 trillion by 2030. — SG","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999896287918091}",neutral,0.9999896287918091,0
