Thales has been selected by Airbus to equip its commercial airliners with the most powerful and innovative flight management system on the market.

This new fully connected flight management system from Thales provides secure access to open-world data and offers airlines an array of new possibilities.

The new flight management system, which is based on the PureFlyt product and has been adapted to meet the specific requirements of Airbus, will process and share vast amounts of data to optimise flight operations, enhance interoperability and reduce environmental impact.

The new flight management system (FMS), which is based on the PureFlyt product and has been adapted to meet the specific needs of Airbus, will be developed by Thales to equip Airbus commercial airliners, and in particular the A320, A330 and A350, with service entry planned for the end of 2026. The new system will improve interoperability for airlines and pilots and optimise flight paths to help reduce the carbon footprint of airline operations.

With its expertise in avionics, connectivity and cybersecurity and air traffic management, Thales is the only European company to offer end-to-end onboard and ground-based solutions that help to meet the ambitious objectives of optimising flight operations in terms of the air transport sector's carbon footprint.

The FMS is the “brain” of the aircraft. It is used to prepare flights, calculate and provide the crew with the information they need, set flight parameters and ensure aircraft guidance throughout the flight and during approach and landing procedures, based on fuel efficiency factors and instructions from air traffic control. Designed from the outset to be connected and cybersecure, the system maximises the benefits of access to open-world data including real-time weather information. By linking the new FMS with non-avionics systems — such as the pilot’s Electronic Flight Bag and airline operational control centres — the solution makes it quicker and easier to analyse flight plan revisions, providing the pilot with the best route and simplifying interaction with air traffic control. It will help to ease airport congestion, cut fuel consumption, decrease noise pollution and reduce pilot workload.

PureFlyt draws on 40 years of experience in flight management systems and over 100 million flight hours with Thales’s current generation of FMS systems, enabling airlines to benefit from an optimal combination of flight safety, operational efficiency and fuel savings. This comprehensive solution includes navigation and performance databases for precise calculation of optimal flight paths and flight times. Airbus’s choice of a system that is compatible with all its aircraft will enhance fleet interoperability for airlines and make it easier for pilots to make the transition from one Airbus aircraft type to another. The new system, which is based on the PureFlyt product and has been adapted to meet the specific needs of Airbus, will also be available as a retrofit option for aircraft currently in service.

“As the only player in flight management technologies in Europe, Thales is proud to contribute to the digital transformation of the airways with our flight management system, and delighted to have this opportunity to continue to support our partner Airbus. Our connected and cybersecure solution will improve interoperability for airlines and pilots and optimise flight paths to help reduce the carbon footprint of airline operations.” Yannick Assouad, Executive Vice President, Avionics, Thales."
Thales finalizes acquisition of RUAG training and simulation unit - Defense News,"Wed, 04 May 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS9nbG9iYWwvZXVyb3BlLzIwMjIvMDUvMDQvdGhhbGVzLWZpbmFsaXplcy1hY3F1aXNpdGlvbi1vZi1ydWFnLXRyYWluaW5nLWFuZC1zaW11bGF0aW9uLXVuaXQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"STUTTGART, Germany — French defense technology firm Thales has completed the acquisition of Swiss company Ruag’s training and simulation subsidiary after beginning negotiations late last year, the companies announced Tuesday.

The purchase is expected to help Thales broaden its footprint in the land market by providing new training and simulation solutions to promote combat readiness, the firm said in a news release. Peter Hitchcock, Thales’ vice president for training and simulation, credited Ruag S&T as a “major player in live training, covering everything from prime contractor responsibilities to the individual sensors used, as well as delivering the services at combat training centers.”

He noted that Ruag S&T considers itself a “live” specialist, while Thales is more versed in “virtual” technologies.

“Coming together brings mutual reinforcement, greater critical mass and allows us to accelerate the convergence of technologies to build the next generation of hybrid live, virtual and constructive training solutions,” he added.

The acquisition aligns with armed forces modernization programs across the globe, and a move toward digitalization across land forces. Prior to the sale, Thales and Ruag S&T partnered on the French Army’s CERBERE program. That effort entailed developing a simulation system that could train and monitor various capabilities in a joint environment, to include assets such as the Griffon and Jaguar armored vehicles; upgraded LeClerc tanks, along with their munitions; the Scorpion program’s SICS information system; and radio units.

Negotiations for the sale began in November 2021, and the contract was signed this past January, according to Ruag. The next step is to integrate the two companies, Thales said. With the acquisition, Ruag S&T’s 500 employees will fall under the Thales umbrella, bringing together more than 1,400 employees across six countries: France, Switzerland, Germany, the United Kingdom, the United Arab Emirates and Australia.

Thales cited the first four nations as “priority” areas where the acquisition will help reinforce its existing footprint, and the company said it looks forward to increasing its presence in the UAE and Australia. Ruag S&T saw sales of approximately €90 million (U.S. $95 million) in 2021, per the two companies.

Thales is primarily focused on training and simulation solutions for military air, land and naval capabilities. It also builds and operates civil helicopter simulators, and offers operational training services for armed forces.

The sale to Thales was part of an enterprisewide realignment for the Swiss company, Ruag said. It recently reached an agreement for Australian company ASDAM to take over the Ruag Australia division, while General Atomics Europe took over Ruag’s Germany-based aircraft maintenance activities in 2021. It sold its aircraft maintenance sites in Geneva and Agno, Switzerland, to Dassault Aviation in 2019.

"Honeywell, Thales developing connected FMS for A320, A330 and A350 - - Runway Girl Network","Tue, 24 May 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMjIvMDUvYWlyYnVzLW5leHRnZW4tZm1zLWEzMjAtYTMzMC1hMzUwLWVmYi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has selected two longtime avionics competitors, Honeywell and Thales, to provide the nextgen flight management system for new A320, A330 and A350 twinjets, with service entry planned for the end of 2026. Airlines will have the option to choose either system when ordering their aircraft.

A key part of the European airframer’s plan is to link the FMS for these aircraft platforms with non-avionics systems, such as the pilot’s Electronic Flight Bag and airline operational control centers. The EFB will access onboard connectivity to deliver real-time weather and other performance-enhancing applications.

But granular specifics are still being thrashed out.

“Airbus plans to include connectivity via an onboard EFB, and Honeywell will be collaborating with Airbus to create and enable connected features and apps, but the exact details of the final product and the approach are to be confirmed,” a Honeywell spokesperson tells Runway Girl Network when asked if Honeywell expects that secure L-band satellite services from Inmarsat and Iridium will power the EFB or if there will be an opportunity to talk to the broadband connectivity pipes available to passengers.

A longtime provider of FMS systems to Airbus, Honeywell’s press release notes that its new system combines multiple current FMS offerings for the airframer into one single solution for the A320 family, A330 and A350. “Importantly, the new FMS hardware is 15 times more capable than current hardware and enables a path to future enhancements without hardware changes,” says Honeywell. A retrofit solution based on the same core hardware and common software is also planned for the A320 and A330.

For its part, Thales notes in a published statement that by linking the new FMS with non-avionics systems, the solution “makes it quicker and easier to analyze flight plan revisions, providing the pilot with the best route and simplifying interaction with air traffic control”.

In 2019, Thales unveiled the basis for this nextgen FMS, called PureFlyt, to various media outlets including Runway Girl Network. At that time, management spoke excitedly about the prospect of ultimately using a segregated channel of broadband cabin connectivity to ensure high-bandwidth applications can be supported, but it tempered enthusiasm by noting that a lot of standards and regulatory work still needs to be done before we can even consider such a reality.

Any true safety services, as defined by ICAO, will continue to be transmitted over approved pipes, noted Thales management at the time. Crucially, it said that by combining the integrity of the FMS and the agility and power of EFB flight functionalities, aircraft trajectory can be permanently controlled, adapted and enhanced, resulting in optimized flight, decreased fuel consumption and improved passenger comfort.

The current FMS on both the A320 series and A330 are understood to be selectable supplier furnished equipment (SSFE) with Airbus standard systems available from Honeywell and Thales.

In an informational brochure about its prior-release FMS systems for Airbus, Honeywell states: “While the core FMS functionality is specified by Airbus, the two offerings from the suppliers do have features and functionalities that differ somewhat. Some differences that exist in the software are attributable to the development programs operating independently and not in lock step, and stem from the fact that one supplier, Honeywell, generally leads FMS innovation activities reflected by the Airbus award of sole source supply to Honeywell for its most recent new aircraft programs (A380, and A350).”

When asked by RGN if there are any notable differences between the new Honeywell and Thales FMS systems for the A320, A330 and A350, and if an opportunity exists for Honeywell to differentiate itself with its nextgen platform, the Honeywell spokesman says: “ We are unable to comment on Thales’s systems and it is a question best addressed by them.”

Though Honeywell has clearly enjoyed strong positioning in the A350 cockpit, Airbus has in recent years turned to Thales for some new kit, for instance selecting the French multinational firm to provide an integrated touchscreen display for the A350 flight deck.

In their latest messaging about developing the new FMS across Airbus types, both Honeywell and Thales each speak about their legacies in providing avionics to Airbus platforms.

“Honeywell has been supplying flight management systems since Airbus’ first A300 went into service, and this win will extend our 35-year partnership well into the future,” says the aerospace giant.

“More than 6,000 aircraft worldwide are equipped with the current generation of Thales flight management systems,” a Thales spokesperson tells RGN. “These systems have clocked up a total of more than 100 million flight hours onboard ATR regional aircraft and A320, A330 and A340 commercial airliners, as well as military aircraft including the Atlantique 2 maritime patrol aircraft, the A400M transport plane, and UH-60V and S-76 helicopters.”

Thales and Ocius Tech inks Teaming Agreement for development of Bluebottle USV - Naval News,"Tue, 10 May 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uYXZhbG5ld3MuY29tL2V2ZW50LW5ld3MvaW5kby1wYWNpZmljLTIwMjIvMjAyMi8wNS90aGFsZXMtYW5kLW9jaXVzLXRlY2gtaW5rcy10ZWFtaW5nLWFncmVlbWVudC1mb3ItZGV2ZWxvcG1lbnQtb2YtYmx1ZWJvdHRsZS11c3Yv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales and Ocius Tech inks Teaming Agreement for development of Bluebottle USV Thales Australia and Ocius Technologies have entered a Teaming Agreement to advance the development and deployment of a scalable Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) capability equipped for Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) and surveillance missions – helping to protect Australia’s borders.

Thales press release

The Australian designed and manufactured Blue Sentry autonomous system, comprising a team of Ocius Bluebottle USVs integrated with Thales Australia’s new thin line Fibre Optic Towed Array capability, are deployed from shore to autonomously patrol large areas of Australia’s coastline, performing underwater ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance) missions for long periods of time at sea, and in extreme weather conditions.

Missions that would have previously required the deployment of peopled assets for many days to complete will be able to be conducted remotely using the Blue Sentry team of Autonomous Vessels at a significantly reduced cost of coverage.

Benefitting from more than 35 years of investment in sovereign towed array innovation in Australia by Thales, the Royal Australian Navy and DST Group, traditional Towed Array capability was first deployed on the Collins Class Submarine to enable advanced threat detection and classification at sea.

Fibere-optic cable roller of the USV

In both form and function, Thales’s sovereign thin line Fibre Optic Towed Array is a miniaturized version of a submarine Fibre Optic Towed Array, enabling autonomous detection, classification, and localization of craft on the surface or below the water that generates acoustic noise or produces acoustic reflections. The Blue Sentry system’s autonomous detection capabilities also enable covert communication to allies below the surface using long-range low frequency underwater communications. The newly developed thin line Towed Array is designed, developed and manufactured at Thales Australia’s Acoustics Centre of Excellence at Rydalmere in New South Wales.

Thales has been working collaboratively with Ocius since 2013 on the role of the USV in ASW – the Bluebottle is a standout USV platform for long-term maritime mission endurance.

“The detection and classification of modern undersea threats at tactically useful ranges requires a highly optimised balance between the sensor and the platform to ensure success in the most challenging of acoustic environments. The specialist teams within Ocius and Thales Australia have worked to bring their respective capabilities together into the Australian designed and manufactured Blue Sentry product and we look forward to taking it into the future.”

They found their solution from Persistent Systems LLC in New York City.

Thales and Persistent Systems have collaborated on a combined tactical communications solution, which the companies unveiled last week at the Special Operations Forces Industry Conference (SOFIC) in Tampa, Fla.

The U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) has wanted the ability to deliver a combination of MANET tactical networking and military radio to enhance communications and electronic control of unmanned vehicles in difficult terrain where hills and mountains can block radio signals.

MANET is a decentralized wireless network in which each communications node participates in routing by forwarding data for other nodes; even if one point-to-point radio link is blocked, the signal still gets through from other nodes that are repeating the message.

The combined Thales and Persistent Systems MANET and tactical radio capitalized on an advanced radio-over-IP capability to tether a Thales AN/PRC-148E Spear radio to a Persistent MPU5 wireless networking communications by bringing the Spear on to a digital network as an IP talk group.

""Imagine a helicopter transmitting on an AM frequency to a dismounted ground team,"" explains Shane Flint, vice president of business development at Persistent Systems. ""With traditional tactical radios, some users might receive the helicopter's transmission and other users might not. But with a Spear/MPU5-equipped team, if any single Spear radio receives the helicopter's transmission, the entire team will receive it.""

The Thales AN/PRC-148E Spear weighs 1.24 pounds and has programmable cryptography that supports the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) crypto modernization program.

The Spear radio connects to the MPU5 MANET device via a specially designed cable to enable the MPU5 to auto-configure wireless communications settings and channel presets on the Spear remotely to eliminate operator error and deliver plug-and-play capability.

""This capability was designed for combat operations, based on real-world feedback,"" Flint says. ""The goal was to deliver a simple no-fail solution that empowers the warfighter.""

With environmental challenges now a growing, global concern, Thales, the leader in high tech security, has developed solutions for a greener world, recently certified by Mastercard’s Sustainable Card Program. To date, Thales has deployed 30 million eco-friendly payment cards for banks and card issuers that address consumer concerns without compromising the user experience.

All eco-friendly cards offered by Thales are made with innovative and sustainable components. For example, one solution is a card made from 85% PLA (polylactic acid), which is produced from corn. Another innovative approach reduces the amount of new plastic while fighting sea pollution, with a card made of Ocean Plastic® collected by Parley for the Oceans. This innovative material comes from plastic waste collected from coastal clean-up operations, in partnership with “Parley for the Oceans”. Banks can also reduce their first-use plastic with a recycled PVC card that is made entirely with plastic waste from the packaging and printing industries.

Thales not only works to minimise the carbon footprint of all its products and services but also offers a carbon offset program to make the cards carbon neutral.

By assessing sustainability claims on behalf of the industry, the Mastercard Sustainable Card Program aims to pivot all card selection programs towards eco-friendly solutions, making sustainable choice the norm rather than the exception. This certification demonstrates that Thales solutions have an environmental advantage that is meaningful, verified and sustainable.

“A year ago, Findomestic became a pioneer BNP Paribas Personal Finance branch by adopting Thales eco-friendly cards made of PLA, with the goal of removing the use of PVC cards by 2024. This was a significant step to illustrate our commitment to social and environmental responsibility. This common environmental awareness shared with Thales enables us to deliver to our customers secure solutions that are respectful of the environment”. Donatella Ciambellotti, Card Development Officer at Findomestic

“The time is right to combine sustainability with the latest payment solutions by focusing on Reduction and Compensation. Indeed, Thales sustainable products and services cover every aspect of a bank card's life. Moving away from plastics isn’t simple when embedding sophisticated technology in the card, such as the contactless chip and antenna. But we are committed to finding new eco-friendly solutions for our customers and making them proud to do business with a responsible and sustainable player.” Sylvie Gibert, VP Payment Cards at Thales.

As Thales integrates RUAG Simulation & Training teams, Peter Hitchcock, Vice-President in charge of the Training & Simulation business line, reflects on what this means for the Group’s capabilities.

How do you feel as Thales completes the acquisition of RUAG S&T?

This is a key milestone for everybody involved! We’re excited by what the future holds for us and are very much looking forward to working on building it together as “One Force”.



As we enter this new era, can you provide a thumbnail description of what the Training & Simulation scope covers at Thales?

The three main areas in which we are active are the development and support of simulators for military air, land and naval markets; the development and operation of civil helicopter simulators; and the provision of operational training services to armed forces.

Where do Thales’s strengths lie?

The first is our ability to support our customers whatever it takes! This was particularly striking throughout the Covid crisis: our engineers and instructors, our products and systems all continued to deliver, and no training days were lost. Then there is our ability to couple technical expertise with operational knowledge. For instance, we’re currently delivering complex rear crew mission trainers for the French Navy (Atlantique 2) and Royal Navy (Crowsnest), drawing on not just our simulation expertise but also the mission expertise we have in the Group.

At a time when there is an increased demand for national sovereignty, being able to capitalize on Thales’s global footprint is key, whether through local units or joint ventures. We were recently awarded a Training contract in Poland, a success which can be attributed to the local presence of Thales in Poland. Finally, the scale of the Group enables us to be attractive to external partners and means we are able to talk with industry leaders in areas such as graphics and in Artificial Intelligence.

What are the key technological drivers in the Training & Simulation business?

A major trend is the increasing crossover of immersive gaming technologies to the professional environment, including progress in graphics and a reduction in the cost of hardware. Importantly, gaming technologies have brought massive multi-player environments where people can team up over huge distances to work collectively. Take the operational environments of our customers: individuals rarely work in isolation; they rely on team members, coalition assets, remote sensors as well as open source information. Therefore, training needs to be able to match that. So we are incorporating gaming-style building blocks in our systems and moving towards secure “training in the cloud” concepts that the next generation of users will come to expect.

What does the acquisition of RUAG Simulation & Training bring to Thales?

RUAG S&T is a major player in live training, covering everything from prime contractor responsibilities to the individual sensors used as well as delivering the services at combat training centres. They also have an excellent land simulation product lines. By combining our expertise, we can accelerate the development of live and constructive training, to create the best possible training environments.

This is timely because many armies are going through force modernization programmes. They are introducing a step change in capabilities which also requires them to transform how they train on new equipment, vehicles, and C4I (Command, Control Communications, Computer, Intelligence) systems to obtain even more insight, higher levels of performance and also addressing cost and environmental constraints through merged live and virtual systems.

That is why the CERBERE programme, on which we teamed with RUAG S&T, was introduced alongside the deployment of France’s Scorpion programme.

The capabilities offered by RUAG S&T in Switzerland, France, Germany, and the UAE will create opportunities with new and existing customers, and with the support of Thales’s global network we have ambitious objectives which we can share with local partners.

How would you sum up what this move represents?

Thales and RUAG S&T are very complementary with little or no overlap. The partnership is coherent and the logic is clear: RUAG S&T are “live” specialists whereas Thales background is primarily in “virtual” technologies. Coming together brings mutual reinforcement, greater critical mass and allows us to accelerate the convergence of technologies to build the next generation of Hybrid Live, Virtual and Constructive Training Solutions.*"

Interview with an Expert:

General Bernard Barrera

Land Defence Advisor, Thales

How would you describe the threat environment facing the armed forces today?

The world is changing. The strategic balance of power is being challenged in every type of conflict– on land, at sea, under the oceans, in the air, in space and in cyberspace. To meet future challenges in high-intensity airland combat, land forces need to develop new capabilities at a faster pace to ensure that hostile forces can be defeated, guarantee national sovereignty and keep populations safe.

Against this backdrop, the digital transformation, and the ability to harness its potential to deliver new effects, have become absolutely vital.

What types of new technologies do the armed forces need?

The digital transformation is affecting our lives a little more every day. We can see its influence on innovation, research and development, but it is also having a major impact on military operations in the field.

Digitalisation allows command centres to share and analyse critical information quickly and more effectively. Provided the necessary cyber protection is in place, high-data-rate connectivity, big data, artificial intelligence, the move to the cloud and the Internet of Things have the potential to radically speed up the OODA loop (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) and drive a deep-seated transformation of military affairs.

All the stakeholders in the defence community are seeking ways to leverage these technologies to meet their operational requirements in terms of decision support, collaborative combat, data analytics, multi-source intelligence data fusion, force protection, resilience, etc.

At the same time, as we have seen in the most recent confrontations, the use of robotic systems, and in particular drones, is changing the way that military operations are conducted in both conventional and asymmetrical conflicts.

How can Thales support land forces in these changes? And will it really make all the difference?

Thales supports the armed forces by training their personnel to use these new systems and technologies, and by putting in place robust supply chains that rely on trusted partners and local industries in each country or region.

Thales has the unique ability not only to design the overall architectures of the most complex systems in an end-to-end approach, but also to develop the individual pieces of equipment (sensors, effectors, connectivity, etc.) that make up these systems. The company's know-how spans multiple disciplines, from building intelligence into all types of platforms to integrating these intelligent platforms into the combat environment based on a clear understanding of how they are deployed and operated in the field. Thanks to these capabilities, collaborative combat is already a reality.

As a trusted partner to the armed forces across all domains, Thales helps its defence customers to achieve tactical superiority and maintain their strategic independence.

With its unflagging commitment to innovation and digital technologies, Thales ensures that all its solutions are cohesive and complementary and developed from the outset to guarantee interoperability between systems and compatibility between different generations of equipment.

Thales focuses its efforts on developing technologies and capabilities that are disruptive yet easy-to-use and solutions that will provide land forces with the operational and information superiority they need.

In the field of connectivity, higher data rates, lower latency and better range performance will enable forces to make decisions faster, and to do more with less. As the threat environment evolves, Thales technologies (cloud-based solutions, satcom terminals, allied interoperability, etc.) offer the armed forces a unique combination of agility, discretion, performance and protection of command capabilities.

New sensors not only offer better range and precision but also rely on artificial intelligence to extract useful information from very large volumes of data and support more effective decision-making. The use of interconnected sensors will rapidly improve situational awareness for units in the field, helping to dispel the fog of war.

In terms of intelligence, Thales aims to offer commanders a multi-dimensional view of the battlefield by correlating data from multiple sources, including imagery and electronic warfare systems as well as human and open-source intelligence. Here too, artificial intelligence will help analysts handle the huge volumes of data generated by multiple sources of intelligence.

At a tactical level, land and airland vehicle electronics, the Combat Digital Platform and secure cloud environments will enable communities of interest to share information in real time, making tactical manoeuvres more fluid and more transparent for mounted or dismounted forces with their soldier systems.

Thales is also developing new effectors with greater accuracy and agility to provide tomorrow's platforms with broader capabilities and reduce the logistics footprint of the forces in the field.

Last but not least, just like software-defined radios, software-defined networks and radar systems will be a real game-changer for land forces. With these new technologies, the software is regularly updated to take new threats into account and mitigate issues of equipment obsolescence.

Which Thales systems and equipment have been proven in combat?

From smart sensors and combat systems to soldier equipment and connectivity solutions for the digital battlefield, our systems deliver information superiority and enable deployed forces to stay in charge at every decisive moment. Combat-proven solutions in operational use on a routine basis include the CERBERE simulation system, satellite communication systems (VAB ML, HDTAC, Venus, Astride), tactical communication systems (PR4G, Melchior), mortar systems, radars, optical sighting systems for armoured vehicles and helicopters, solider optronics systems, drones (Spy'Ranger), and the GA 10 and SL2A protection systems deployed at French bases in the Sahel.

The French Army is making the transition to connected, collaborative combat with the SCORPION vehicle programme and the CONTACT software-defined radio programme.

These two programmes are part of a broader move towards the “battlespace Internet”, in which smart sensors and effectors will be interconnected to make the battlefield more transparent, increase the tempo of operations and ensure operational superiority."
Thales Australia and Ocius advance autonomous threat detection and surveillance - Thales,"Tue, 10 May 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi9jb3VudHJpZXMtYXNpYS9hdXN0cmFsaWEvcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZS90aGFsZXMtYXVzdHJhbGlhLWFuZC1vY2l1cy1hZHZhbmNlLWF1dG9ub21vdXMtdGhyZWF00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales Australia and Ocius Technologies have entered a Teaming Agreement to advance the development and deployment of a scalable Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) capability equipped for Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) and surveillance missions – helping to protect Australia’s borders.

The Australian designed and manufactured Blue Sentry autonomous system, comprising a team of Ocius Bluebottle USVs integrated with Thales Australia’s new thin line Fibre Optic Towed Array capability, are deployed from shore to autonomously patrol large areas of Australia’s coastline, performing underwater ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance) missions for long periods of time at sea, and in extreme weather conditions.

Missions that would have previously required the deployment of peopled assets for many days to complete will be able to be conducted remotely using the Blue Sentry team of Autonomous Vessels at a significantly reduced cost of coverage.

Benefitting from more than 35 years of investment in sovereign towed array innovation in Australia by Thales, the Royal Australian Navy and DST Group, traditional Towed Array capability was first deployed on the Collins Class Submarine to enable advanced threat detection and classification at sea.

In both form and function, Thales’s sovereign thin line Fibre Optic Towed Array is a miniaturised version of a submarine Fibre Optic Towed Array, enabling autonomous detection, classification and localisation of craft on the surface or below the water that generate acoustic noise or produce acoustic reflections. The Blue Sentry system’s autonomous detection capabilities also enable covert communication to allies below the surface using long-range low frequency underwater communications. The newly developed thin line Towed Array is designed, developed and manufactured at Thales Australia’s Acoustics Centre of Excellence at Rydalmere in New South Wales.

Thales has been working collaboratively with Ocius since 2013 on the role of the USV in ASW - the Bluebottle is a standout USV platform for long-term maritime mission endurance.

Chris Jenkins, Chief Executive, Thales Australia and New Zealand said, “The detection and classification of modern undersea threats at tactically useful ranges requires a highly optimised balance between the sensor and the platform to ensure success in the most challenging of acoustic environments. The specialist teams within Ocius and Thales Australia have worked to bring their respective capabilities together into the Australian designed and manufactured Blue Sentry product and we look forward to taking it into the future.”"

Chris Shepherd

We caught up with Chris Shepherd, Autonomy Technology Centre Director at Thales to hear about his latest thoughts on maritime autonomy.

Why is autonomy such an important technology for navies to master?

Putting machines to work on some of the most dangerous and dirty tasks that military forces encounter is a compelling benefit. Set this against a backdrop of budget constraints and recruitment challenges and the case for mastering autonomy is clear, but there is more.

Autonomous systems will allow navies to operate in increasingly complex and accelerated battlespaces across all domains. Enhancing situational awareness and delivering force multiplication for increased lethality and survivability.

There are some established use cases, such as mine warfare and surveillance. Others are emerging, for example seabed warfare, ship to shore logistics, anti-submarine warfare or off-board electronic warfare. The speed of transition to autonomy and the use case priority varies from Navy to Navy around the world, but what I can be certain of is that the prevalence of autonomous systems will continue to grow and fully autonomous complex vignettes will be operational in my working career.

What are the top three challenges to overcome in your view?

The main challenges for me are complexity, expertise and scalability.

Applied autonomy is hard! Factors such as operating environment, human interaction, integration of various systems and resilience to malicious agents increases the complexity. While the complex systems are the most exciting, we must all keep focussed on ensuring a user centric experience building trust in autonomy, delivered through resilience, security and safety engineered at the heart of our capabilities. Mastering this in fielded equipment in parallel to proving the art of the possible is of paramount importance if we are to see the real benefits of autonomous systems vs. impressive science projects.

The autonomy and AI technology boom and skills shortage is very real, with increased demand from across a broader range of industries than ever before. This creates a thinning of expertise across industry, academia and government. One of the hurdles this creates is a delay to legislative and regulatory reform as the experts are driving the leading edge technology. Working with schools and universities, we are proactively developing this future talent pool.

As autonomy becomes more mainstream and scales, different issues emerge such as de-confliction across heterogeneous systems, bandwidth allocation, launch and recovery at scale and operator workload. Emergent behaviours of uncrewed platforms interacting will become more common and the risk and operator workload could become unmanageable. Addressing these considerations appropriately now will ensure a smoother transition for all navies.

The use of autonomy will ultimately come down to trust. As a person, do you trust it to do the job? Too much trust and it could fail or you could have an excellent system that nobody trusts. An example of this is ubiquitous in technology in cars. Do we use all of the advanced driver aids built-in to modern cars?

How can industry support navies to realise an autonomous future?

We need to show up as a team - whether that means working with a wider network of suppliers or how you work with your customer, and increasingly both. I think this is starting to be the case but the importance of collaborating cannot be underestimated. Thales set up the Autonomy Technology Centre to do more of this in the UK, and it is spreading to other planned hubs globally.

The way we plan how we work needs to be different, for example building in iterative acceptance testing not building to a crescendo at the end. Working to operational requirements is also a key success factor so that you can speed up the transfer of technology into real operational environments.

A further consideration is where to perform acceptance testing. Do the facilities even exist? Thales invested £2million into a maritime autonomy centre at Turnchapel Wharf, Plymouth that opened in 2018. The site is an integral part of the MMCM programme and provides Thales, partners and customers with a place to experiment with new and disruptive technologies.

Finally, industry must be more open and willing to share learning and expertise especially real operational experience. Thales is hosting a Think Tank at the Combined Naval Event (Farnborough) to do exactly that. We want to share what we have learnt on our autonomy journey and work with navies around the world to understand what they need from us. In the UK, we have the Navy PODS concept, the Naval Strike Network and the future Type 32 / Multi-role support ship (MRSS) programmes to consider.

LinkedIn

The key role of satellites in surveying Earth and the impacts of climate change on its environment was in the spotlight on May 18 at the Prix Bulles Cardin awards — named for the Palais Bulles or “Bubble Palace” owned by the fashion house’s founder Pierre Cardin — that each year distinguish five works, personalities or actions seeking to foster sustainable development. On this occasion, House of Pierre Cardin and Thales Alenia Space underlined their shared belief in the need to focus attention on the climate emergency, notably through satellite imagery.

The Palais Bulles in Théoule-sur-Mer honored satellites built a few miles away in the clean rooms of Thales Alenia Space’s facility in Cannes. Projections of images acquired by the European Copernicus program’s Sentinel satellites illustrated a range of climate phenomena, from ice melt in Alaska to deforestation and rising sea level in the Maldives.

Space sentinels

The Sentinel satellites keep a daily watch over our planet, delivering precious data to the scientific community and to first responders in the event of natural disasters, while also helping to gage the effectiveness of national initiatives designed to curb global warming.

Thales Alenia Space has worked hand in hand with the European Space Agency (ESA) and the entire European space industry since the start of the European Commission’s Copernicus program, in which it is playing a key role on 11 out of 12 missions.

Thales Alenia Space is aboard five of the six new-generation Copernicus missions, leading three as prime contractor (CIMR, ROSE-L and CHIME), and supplying the payloads for two more (CO2M and CRISTAL). These new satellites are geared toward measuring human-induced atmospheric CO2 emissions, monitoring thickness of sea ice and snow covering it, supporting new optimized services for sustainable farming and biodiversity, observing sea-surface temperature and salinity as well as sea ice concentration, and strengthening land monitoring and emergency management services.

Thales Alenia Space’s involvement in the Copernicus program illustrates its Space for Life vision to build a better and more sustainable life on Earth. Some unexpected encounters, such as that between Pierre Cardin and Thales Alenia Space, open up new avenues for raising public awareness of the urgent need to develop a profitable and virtuous ecology.

With a total program budget of 350 million euros ($368 million), the French military will receive six PARADE systems over 11 years.

According to Thales, counter-drone systems are crucial since “millions of new drones” are projected to enter the skies over the next two decades, creating an “extremely complex” aviation ecosystem and heightened security challenges.

The PARADE system will reportedly have a “scalable, modular” design to effectively address evolving threats and protect people and military facilities.

Thales and CS GROUP said they will work closely with their European partners in developing the counter-drone system.

‘Highest Level of Safety’

Beyond providing 360-degree site protection, Thales explained that its PARADE system will be designed for easy transport by land, air, or sea, significantly increasing its scope of use and speed of deployment.

The armed forces will utilize the system to help secure events, people, infrastructure, and military operations overseas.

“Thales’ drone countermeasures solutions ensure safety and security at all levels of military and civil airspace,” Thales managing director Thomas Got said.

“The consortium led by Thales and CS GROUP enables us to offer a drone countermeasures solution that meets the requirements of the DGA and the French armed forces and ensures the highest level of safety and security for people.”

CS Group deputy chief executive officer Marie de Saint Salvy explained that the new system will guarantee permanent situational awareness and help the military determine the best way to respond to threats."

"Making electric car charging fast, safe and freely available - Thales","Tue, 31 May 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi93b3JsZHdpZGUtZGlnaXRhbC1pZGVudGl0eS1hbmQtc2VjdXJpdHkvaW90L21hZ2F6aW5lL21ha2luZy1lbGVjdHJpYy1jYXItY2hhcmdpbmctZmFzdC1zYWZlLWFuZNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Estimated reading time: 5 minutes

Demand for electric vehicles is soaring – with it, demand for charging stations. However, the charging network is fragmented, with many competing suppliers. In 2021, EV specialist Gireve teamed up with Thales to tackle these challenges. We spoke to Eric Plaquet, CEO of Gireve…

When the UK hosted the G7 Summit (June 2021) to discuss climate change, ""Zero Carbon Tour"" organizers hired an electric bus to travel from London to the summit in Cornwall. It seemed like great PR. Sadly, the bus got stuck before it could return home. It tried five different charging stations, but none of them worked.

The episode illustrates the huge importance of charging infrastructure to the future of sustainable electric driving. According to Fitch Solutions, electric car sales in Europe jumped by 72 percent in 2021. The market is booming. However, this growth will slow if EV (electric vehicle) drivers can't easily find a spot to power up.

Currently, many EV owners charge their vehicles at home using regular domestic plug points. Domestic charging is slow, but it is convenient. Drivers usually do it overnight.

However, public charging on streets, workplaces, car parks, petrol stations and motorway service stations is also available. Public chargers are usually quicker; obviously, they serve people who are travelling and those who cannot charge their EVs from home. According to the European Alternative Fuels Observatory, well over 200,000 of these points are across the EU.

Public charge points are run by competing operators that typically charge a monthly fee for access or offer pay-as-you-go (though credit card payments are often

not accepted). Many EVs now have associated apps that direct motorists to the nearest point. Typically, drivers need a smart card or phone app to unlock access.

Although the charging network is growing, it is still very fragmented. There are multiple competing suppliers, and the stations are not evenly distributed. Some areas are over-supplied, while others have scarcely any.

As the EV market expands, drivers will need plentiful and convenient access to public charging points. Ideally, the market also needs global standards and improved management of electricity delivery. As important, charging stations must offer simple and secure access and frictionless payments.



Gireve, the leading B2B digital platform for electric mobility, is now applying itself to these challenges. In December 2021, it announced a partnership with Thales to provide 'Plug & Charge' access and billing based on the recent ISO 15118 standard. The goal of the solution is to simplify the charging experience while also ensuring the highest level of security.

It works like this: drivers simply plug their ISO 15118-compliant electric car into any ISO 15118-compatible charging station. This technical standard defines the vehicle-to-grid communication interface. It enables automatic and secure identification of EVs for easy charging and single billing.

Drivers don't need a physical card to use the 'Plug & Charge' system. Instead, the charge point recognizes the subscription and the billing is automatic. This means drivers can freely choose their e-Mobility Service Provider (eMSP: the company that provides access to the charging points in a geographic area) and be confident that the transaction will proceed. They can access more charging stations and get a secure, friction-free payment experience.

Obviously, the solution can only work if each participant in the process – EV, eMSP and charge point – has a unique digital ID and related credentials. By verifying these credentials, they can recognize and trust each other.

This is where Thales Trusted Key Manager comes in. It ensures secure and instant mutual authentication between all of the participants. In the long term, as the EV market booms, Gireve/Thales' secure credentials solution can go beyond the car charging itself and enable further smart grid deployments, such as securely reselling extra energy credits to other applications requiring energy quickly.

In an exclusive interview, Thales talked to Eric Plaquet, CEO of Gireve, about the EV market and the partnership between the two companies…

The EV market keeps growing. When will there be more EVs than traditional cars?

Eric: eMobility is taking off faster than expected. A 2021 report by Eurelectric said one in five new vehicle registrations in Europe is now electric. That's one per cent of the 326 million total on the roads. Ernst and Young expects the EV number to grow to 65 million vehicles by 2030 and 130 million vehicles by 2035.

However, a lot will depend on factors such as incentives to EV drivers, affordability, and evolving customer attitudes. And then there's legislation. In the US, the government has announced a target of 50% EV sales by 2030. Meanwhile, the EU has proposed CO2 emission reduction targets of 100 per cent for new cars by 2035.



How can EV charging companies solve the problem of reaching EV car owners in flats and other inaccessible places?

Eric: The key point is less about the type of home and more about parking. Today's solutions largely focus on situations where the EV driver has a dedicated parking space. But when the parking spaces are public and shared, the charging infrastructure must also be shared. Obviously, there is a growing need for drivers that have no dedicated parking of their own. Gireve is certainly part of the ecosystem that is delivering the more accessible public charge points.

Will EV charging pressure the electricity supply at certain times of the day?

Eric: When EV charging develops at a massive scale, there could be a risk of grid pressure at peak hours. However, we believe smart charging can enable running all EVs without crashing local networks. This is why we're working with energy players. We want to work together to make EV charging more flexible and avoid grid overload and blackouts.

For example, we can use smart charging to program a charging schedule. This would be negotiated between the terminal and the vehicle and optimized according to technical constraints. It would effectively balance the driver's needs with any constraints in the electricity supply.

Can current electricity grids handle EVs easily through dedicated smart meters? Also, because ISO 15118 supports vehicle-to-grid charging (V2G), is there an opportunity for drivers with full batteries to sell power back to the grid when demand is high?

Eric: Using full EV batteries is a sensible way to match demand with supply. With Gireve's understanding of electricity distribution, charging stations and EVs, we can predict when there could be peaks and then act to flatten demand.

Actually, we are already working on this with several partners. We are running a vehicle-to-grid (V2G) project where we transfer energy from EV batteries to the distribution network.

What are the biggest current hacking and fraud threats to EV charging – and what are the best defences?

Eric: As EV adoption rises, there will certainly be more opportunities for hacking. We have to be ready for this. This is why we're implementing the ISO-15118 standard and 'Plug & Charge' solution with Thales' cybersecurity technology. Thales' tools will defend against cybercrime by embedding encryption-based security across all data exchanges and transactions.

What is the broader aim of the partnership between Gireve and Thales?

Eric: You look at the market, and you see there is more and more demand for electric cars and a growing charging infrastructure. So now, what is key is the quality of the global experience. The ISO 15118 standard sets the direction for more convenience and simplicity when charging. Using Thales' cybersecurity technology, applied through our way of intermediating transactions, will help us reach the quality and security level necessary for mass adoption.

Do you think there will be more EV-based car-sharing solutions as an alternative to EV ownership?

It does seem logical since EV volumes are expected to grow at such a fast pace. Renting cars is greener than owning them, and EV sharing is even more environmentally sustainable.

What are the next trends in the EV market?

Eric: There are plenty of improvements coming. For the batteries, there's an extended range, for example, which could extend to 1000km. In terms of charging, the industry is working hard on ultra-fast charging, dynamic induction charging and smart charging. There is also a high focus on sharing further data insights for better grid efficiency.

TIRIS™ Points Predict - a smart maintenance system for rail networks - Thales,"Tue, 10 May 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi91bml0ZWQta2luZ2RvbS9uZXdzL3RpcmlzdG0tcG9pbnRzLXByZWRpY3Qtc21hcnQtbWFpbnRlbmFuY2Utc3lzdGVtLXJhaWwtbmV0d29ya3PSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"TIRIS™ Points Predict - a smart maintenance system for rail networks Share this article



LinkedIn

Smart maintenance systems allow train operators to detect railway faults and alert them to danger. Yet many existing systems are outdated, prioritise maintenance and are not as accurate as they could be. This often leads to false alerts, significant delays and costly repairs – not to mention potentially hazardous situations.

Today, ongoing developments in technology are delivering more accurate and efficient solutions. The Thales Smart Maintenance Platform TIRIS™ offers predictive maintenance capabilities across a number of critical railway assets including point machines. It is designed to empower users by giving them access to extensive data on their chosen railway assets, which can support their decision-making process. The implementation of advanced algorithms helps operators and maintainers to go beyond traditional, remote, condition monitoring, and uses technology such as machine learning to automatically calculate parameters such as the asset health.

TIRIS™ Points Predict brings a new advancement. Already launched into international markets, TIRIS™ Points Predict is a smart maintenance service for rail network operators. It improves accuracy and alert detection by monitoring trackside equipment and learning performance norms.

Whereas current systems tend to work by “discovering” – enabling analysis/ad-hoc investigation into large volumes of data – TIRIS™ Points Predict’s algorithms introduce a “prediction” functionality (as the name suggests). By applying machine learning algorithms to multiple data streams, it automates diagnosis and prognosis of asset behaviour. The results generated by these ‘Predict’ solutions can be incorporated into alarm management systems to notify operators to high priority events. The system can also automate the raising of work orders against defective assets, for example – saving operators’ time.

Thus TIRIS™ Points Predict facilitates a more efficient and higher quality rail transport service by delivering a more intelligent, predictive fault monitoring and classification system. The result is:

fewer passenger delays and cancellations (due to less equipment failures)

decreased risk of fines from rail regulators (for delays)

less trackside work which in turn reduces the risk of worker injury

no constant need for asset expertise and complex data interpretation

operations staff are released from repetitive monitoring work to focus on other tasks.

TIRIS™ Points Predict is now being rolled out to new customers and geographies, building on success in international markets. TIRIS™ Points Predict offers a flexible solution, driven by the needs of the end customer. Plus, it is continuously evolving and is seamless to roll-out.

Thales offers Points Predict in two different ways. If there are no condition monitoring systems in place already, we can provide a turnkey solution through our software model. This means getting up and running almost immediately. If a system does already exist then we can integrate into that existing system and apply this new algorithm to the existing data.

LinkedIn

Installing high-capacity digital signalling on metros is one of the best ways to boost passenger satisfaction. How can deployment be made easier?

When it comes to improving the performance of existing metros and urban railways, one of the most effective steps an operator can take is to replace traditional signalling with Communications-Based Train Control (CBTC).

CBTC is transformative. Benefits include more trains per hour, faster journey times and enhanced reliability for both operators and passengers. Faster recovery from disruption is an added benefit. All of this contributes to increased passenger satisfaction, loyalty and ridership.



On top of this, CBTC delivers efficiency gains and opportunities for lifecycle cost savings. These are achieved through new ways of working, including the modernisation of operating methods and maintenance practices.

Switching to CBTC can also save energy. This is a key consideration for operators looking for ways to cut power bills and reduce carbon emissions. There are wider benefits too: high-performance rail transport provides an attractive alternative to car journeys, cutting congestion and enhancing the quality of life in cities.

Deployment without disruption

Installing new signalling on a working railway is a complex business because the operator has to ensure minimum network disruption. In fact, it’s such a delicate and complicated operation that it’s sometimes said to be like carrying out open-heart surgery while the patient is running a marathon.

Deadlines add to the pressure – particularly if new signalling needs to be ready in time for a major event, such as the Olympic Games. So how can deployment be made easier?

Two factors have a huge impact on how easy the deployment will be. These are the choice of CBTC technology and the migration strategy. Let’s take a look at these in more detail.

Choosing the best CBTC solution

One of the big decisions facing operators of existing (brownfield) lines is whether to deploy “pure” CBTC, or to choose a more complex “overlay” solution, which combines CBTC with conventional interlocking and train detection. Pure CBTC is easier to deploy, requires less equipment and is more reliable in the long run. Most operators now opt for pure CBTC.

Another factor is the maturity level of the proposed solution. Is the CBTC system offered by the supplier the best one for an existing line? Some CBTC systems are better suited to greenfield (new) metros. There is a strong case for choosing one that already has a track record as a resignalling solution – above all, one that is purpose-built to be migration ready.

Migration strategy

The migration strategy sets out how the CBTC deployment will be carried out, and it is based on the operator’s performance requirements and technological preferences. Key elements of the migration strategy include:

Rollout methodology – there are three possible approaches. Zone-by-zone migration is the most popular. A benefit of this approach is that it provides the operator with the freedom to choose where to start resignalling. Most operators opt to begin with a section of line that is less heavily used, for example, at the fringe of the network.

Another approach is one-shot migration with the entire line going live at once. The benefit is that interfaces between CBTC and legacy signalling are not required. The risk is that it leaves little room for manoeuvre if adaptations are needed or the plan needs to be changed. A variant of this approach is to use time migration, with CBTC initially used only during non-critical times, such as afternoons, late evenings and weekends.

Track access – one of the biggest challenges is getting access to the track to install new equipment. With many metros shifting to 24/7 operation, finding slots is getting harder and harder. Workarounds are possible. One approach is to establish temporary bi-directional operations, so engineering teams can work on one side of the track while trains run on the other. This approach has been used successfully on one of the world’s busiest metros.

Possession planning – this is the key to making the best use of scarce track access time. Engineering works are carefully structured to ensure the railway is restored to normal at the end of the shift, so that the morning’s services are not delayed. A 50/50 approach is the most effective. The first half of the shift is devoted to installation and testing, while the second half is completely focused on returning the system to its original state.

Migration accelerators

New tools and technologies are also helping to minimise disruption during resignalling. These include lidar surveys (to boost the speed and quality of trackside measurements), connected workforce tools (real-time information sharing with trackside teams), remote database and software uploads (managed from a central location) and shadow mode monitoring (for testing critical systems during normal operating hours).

Looking ahead, the transition to LTE and 5G paves the way for cable-free CBTC. And innovations such as Thales’ Next Generation Positioning promise further reductions in trackside equipment and faster migrations.

How can Thales help?

Thales knows more about upgrading existing lines than any other supplier in the market. We were the first to deploy CBTC for resignalling back in the 1990s. Over the past 30 years, we have accumulated vast experience with deployments on some of the world’s busiest lines in cities including London, New York and Singapore.

Our expertise is underpinned by our ability to adapt our solution to any type of operating environment, and to equip any type of train for CBTC operation. For cities preparing to meet future demand, Thales’ SelTrac™ CBTC provides the optimal solution for a seamless transformation – no matter how large or complex the project.

Lisa Daigle Assistant Managing Editor Military Embedded Systems

U.S. Air National Guard photo by Staff Sgt. Jorge Intriago/Released PARIS. Defense and aerospace contractor Thales has received an initial order to supply U.S. Air National Guard F-16 pilots with Scorpion helmet-mounted displays (HMD), under an agreement that will subsequently make the system available to NATO forces.

Under the terms of the contract, the Air National Guard will be supplied with Scorpion retrofit kits for its fleet of F-16 block 40 and 50 aircraft; the retrofit kits will replace the current Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS) .

According to the Thales announcement, the Scorpion digital platform offers pilots enhanced situational awareness as it sports full-color symbology, zero-perceived latency, and a single display for both day and night operations at lower cost over the life of the system. Additionally, Thales officials say, the Scorpion platform has improved motion-tracking accuracy compared with the JHMCS with the introduction of Scorpion’s precision Hybrid Optically-based Inertial Tracker (HObIT).

When complete, Scorpion will become the common HMD solution for the Air National Guard and U.S. Air Force Reserve’s fleet of F-16 block 30/40/50 aircraft; the contract will also enable NATO countries to order the Scorpion and all accompanying equipment needed to replace the outdated JHMCS HMD without the need for platform modifications.

Thales selected by NATO to deploy NCOP operational situational awareness system - EDR Magazine,"Thu, 19 May 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVkcm1hZ2F6aW5lLmV1L3RoYWxlcy1zZWxlY3RlZC1ieS1uYXRvLXRvLWRlcGxveS1uY29wLW9wZXJhdGlvbmFsLXNpdHVhdGlvbmFsLWF3YXJlbmVzcy1zeXN0ZW3SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"19 May 2022 – The NATO Communications and Information Agency (NCI Agency) has selected Thalesto install the NCOP system at 30 fixed and deployed command centres and to train end-users.

The land, air and naval units engaged in joint operations field many different types of command systems, all of which generate huge amounts of georeferenced operational information. NCOP will capture, aggregate and correlate all this information in a cybersecure environment to generate a single comprehensive picture of the theatre of operations, providing a Common Operational Picture (COP) that will ensure each entity has a shared view of the locations, actions and intentions of forces in the field.

To meet this requirement, Thales has developed a software system based on an open architecture, with specialised modules that draw on the company’s experience of different aspects of the command chain and are fully compliant with commercial and military standards. The system is designed to provide operational users with secure access to multiple COPs overlaid on a basemap.

Having been selected for Increments 1 and 2 of the NCOP programme, Thales is continuing to help NATO enhance its mission coordination, planning and command capabilities, and has now been selected in partnership with GEOS to deploy the software and provide training for users.

The NCOP 2 system is currently under development, and will be deployed in 2023 after field testing. The Thales teams will deploy this new NCOP 2 capability within NATO’s own infrastructure and will ensure continuity of operational service for end-users.

Jamaica picks Thales to upgrade voter identification system with biometrics - Biometric Update,"Mon, 16 May 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpb21ldHJpY3VwZGF0ZS5jb20vMjAyMjA1L2phbWFpY2EtcGlja3MtdGhhbGVzLXRvLXVwZ3JhZGUtdm90ZXItaWRlbnRpZmljYXRpb24tc3lzdGVtLXdpdGgtYmlvbWV0cmljc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales has been hired to modernize Jamaica’s electronic voter ID system, strengthening voter identification and authentication with fingerprint biometrics, reports the Jamaica Observer.

The diversified French manufacturer is supplying handheld mobile voter authentication terminals and fingerprint biometrics software. The Electronic Voter Identification System (EVIS) is also designed to enable maintenance of audit logs and the generation of statistical data, according to the Observer. Thales will support the training of personnel on managing the system.

Glasspole Brown, director of elections at Electoral Commission of Jamaica says the new system will “maintain the integrity of the electoral system.” Brown states that voter impersonation and individuals illicitly voting multiple times were common under the legacy system Thales is replacing.

Delivery of the hand-held fingerprint devices is expected in September, followed by a trial.

For the first quarter of 2022, ended in April, Thales reported gains in sales and order volume. The company announced it had deployed its technology in 15 different elections systems around the world as of last October.

In March, the Electoral Commission denied allegations that it was involved in improper biometric data sharing practices. The government said it does not sell or grant third-party access to its biometric database.

Thales’ Train Protection and Warning System (TPWS) has delivered excellent reliability and availability for over 20 years, reducing the likelihood and consequences of a Signal being Passed at Danger (SPAD)

The new TPWS Mk4 Single Cab Control Unit is compact in size, ideal for retrofit upgrades of the Mk1 and Mk3 systems

Ahead of Railtex 2022 exhibition in London, Thales announced the launch of its enhanced Train Protection and Warning System (TPWS) Mk4 Single Cab Control Unit, expanding on over 20 years of excellent reliability and availability, and delivering major enhancements, all through a simple, time-saving and cost-efficient software upgrade.

For years, TPWS has been designed to reduce the likelihood and consequences of a Signal being Passed at Danger (SPAD), automatically applying a train’s brakes if it approaches a designated point. Today, the solution must be able to interface with the European Train Control System (ETCS) and recognise the lines where ETCS is fitted, taking over as the priority safety system where it is not. TPWS Mk4 delivers just this, providing a protection and warning system with built-in suppression and un-suppression, so it can automatically recognise and adapt depending on the signalling system on the line.

The new system offers a host of additional features to ensure it continues as the go-to solution for train operators, train builders and rolling stock companies alike, including:

More compact system for Single Cab Installation: Mk4 Control Unit has been reduced to fit the same footprint as existing Mk1/Mk3 Control Units – the Single Cab Control Unit omits the connector for the second cab to save space

A future-proof solution: upgrading to Thales TPWS Mk4 paves the way to both ETCS and RBLS. Offering single and dual cab options, Thales TPWS Mk4 delivers a high degree of reliability and availability following the safety standards for the digital railway and provides In-Service Testing advocated by the Office of Rail and Road (ORR)

No configuration required: when installing or replacing Thales TPWS Mk4 equipment, no reconfiguration is needed, just run the routine proof test and the vehicle is ready to enter service

Easy to fit and run with existing systems in both single and dual cabs, with no need to change anything underneath the vehicle, TPWS Mk4 is a straightforward, cost-effective upgrade that requires minimal staff training, whilst ensuring interoperability with European Train Control System (ETCS).

“Train Protection and Warning System has served the industry well for over 20 years, offering an unprecedented reliability and availability track record, and we are excited to announce this latest upgrade. The new solution is designed for ease of use and made for the future of rail.” - Tristian Crawshaw, Head of Product Sales, Thales Ground Transportation Systems

Thales and GEOS have been selected by the NATO Communications and Information Agency (NCI Agency) to deploy Nato Common Operational Picture (NCOP 2) software at 30 sites.

The deployment of the NCOP 2 system aims to offer joint forces under Nato command with shared operational situational awareness.

As agreed, the software system will be installed at both fixed and deployed command centres.

During joint operations, the land, air, and naval units use different types of command systems. In turn, this creates huge amounts of geo-referenced operational information.

NCOP will collect, aggregate, and correlate all this information, and then generate a single comprehensive picture of the theatre of operations.

The Common Operational Picture (COP) will ensure every entity has a shared view of the locations, actions, and objectives of the forces in the field.

Credit: Thales.

Netherlands-based Airbus has selected a flight management system (FMS) from Thales to be deployed on its commercial airliners.

Based on the PureFlyt product, the new FMS will be designed according to Airbus’ requirements and will process and share broad data to optimise flight operations, cut down environmental impact and improve interoperability.

Expected to enter service by the end of 2026, the new system will be used in commercial airliners, such as the A320, A330 and A350.

Said to be the brain of the aircraft, the FMS helps prepare flights as well as calculate and deliver required information to the crew.

Using fuel efficiency factors and instructions from air traffic control, the system will help set flight parameters and provide aircraft guidance during flights as well as approach and landing procedures.

The system provides access to open-world data, including real-time weather information.

The FMS allows assessment of flight plan revisions and offers better routes to pilots.

Furthermore, it simplifies interaction with air traffic control when linked with non-avionics systems, such as the pilot’s electronic flight bag and airline operational control centres.

It is also expected to ease airport congestion and reduce fuel consumption, in addition to decreasing noise pollution and pilot workload.

Thales avionics executive vice-president Yannick Assouad said: “Our connected and cyber-secure solution will improve interoperability for airlines and pilots and optimise flight paths to help reduce the carbon footprint of airline operations.”

PureFlyt consists of navigation and performance databases for the accurate calculation of optimal flight paths and times. It can also be used as a retrofit option for aircraft presently in service.

In March, Thales won a contract from Dubai Aviation Engineering Projects (DAEP) to provide TopSky – Air Traffic Control (ATC) to Dubai International Airport."
Telesat to order 100 fewer satellites for LEO constellation - SpaceNews,"Fri, 06 May 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS90ZWxlc2F0LXRvLW9yZGVyLTkwLWZld2VyLXNhdGVsbGl0ZXMtZm9yLWxlby1jb25zdGVsbGF0aW9uL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"TAMPA, Fla. — Increasing costs and delays have forced Telesat to downsize plans for 298 low Earth orbit satellites by a third to keep within its $5 billion budget.

The Canadian satellite operator plans to order just 188 satellites plus 10 in-orbit spares from Thales Alenia Space, Telesat CEO Dan Goldberg said during the company’s May 6 earnings call.

That is still enough for the Telesat Lightspeed network to provide “something like 10 terabits of capacity” globally, according to Goldberg, which is more capacity than all current satellites in geostationary orbit combined.

Telesat had previously planned to provide 15 terabits of capacity with 298 operational LEO satellites for the government and enterprise markets it aims to serve.

However, Telesat had to rethink the constellation after Thales Alenia Space alerted the company in October that it had run into supply chain shortages, which have pushed out the service’s planned debut a year to 2026.

Despite downsizing Telesat Lightspeed, Goldberg expects the project will continue to cost $5 billion amid rising inflation.

He said Telesat has lined up 4.2 billion Canadian dollars ($3.3 billion) so far to fund the project from existing financial resources and Canadian government funding.

The company is waiting to get commitments for covering the rest of Telesat Lightspeed’s cost before signing an order contract with Thales Alenia Space.

Goldberg said he expects to have “a pretty good sense of where we’re sitting” with export credit agencies to complete the project’s financing by the end of June.

He said Telesat was close to securing these funds before having to pause discussions last year to update its constellation plans.

Changing NGSO landscape

The delay in ordering Telesat Lightspeed satellites gives Amazon’s proposed LEO constellation Project Kuiper more time to catch up with the company.

Amazon announced multi-billion dollar contracts April 5 for launching most of Project Kuiper’s 3,236 satellites over five years. Although Amazon did not say when launches will start, it must deploy half the constellation by July 2026 under its Federal Communications Commission license.

Project Kuiper is mostly focused on consumer broadband, similar to SpaceX’s rapidly expanding Starlink network that currently has more than 2,100 satellites in LEO, but could seek a share of Telesat Lightspeed’s enterprise and government markets.

OneWeb’s planned LEO constellation is focused on enterprise and government markets. The British startup had deployed 428 satellites, or 66% of its planned total fleet, before pausing launches in March after being caught up in sanctions following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

OneWeb has signed launch agreements with SpaceX and India’s space agency to resume satellite deployments this year.

Telesat has previously said its LEO constellation could capture 1% of a total addressable market worth 430 billion Canadian dollars, implying revenue of 4.3 billion Canadian dollars.

The company reported 186 million Canadian dollars in revenue for the three months to the end of March, a 2% decrease compared with the same period in 2021 when adjusted for foreign exchange rates.

The revenue drop was primarily due to less direct-to-home broadcast business in North America and a fall in equipment sales to Canadian government customers, according to Telesat.

Goldberg said U.S.-based satellite broadcaster Dish Network renewed a contract to use its Anik F3 Ku-band satellite for at least another two years but at a lower rate.

Dish Network is using “a little more than half” the capacity it had previously been taking on Anik F3, he said, and most of the remaining capacity it did not renew was sold to a mobility services provider for the maritime market."

Thales ’Scorpion system is a state-of-the-art display system. The choice is not accidental but proven, as the pilots of the A-10 Thunderbolt, F-16 Viper, AC-130W Dragon Spear, and the AT-6 from the US Air Force are already taking advantage of this display. Scorpion is also integrated into the F-18 of the Spanish Air Force, as well as in dozens of aircraft and helicopters such as F-22, OV-10, UH-60 / S-70, MD530G, H125M, H145M, and H225 of various air forces around the world.

The Scorpion system uses augmented reality. The system is built as open architecture and allows fast integration and installation. As a finished product Scorpion system consists of an Ethernet Databus and LRU that can be installed in the side console DZUS rail mount, inertial optical hybrid tracker, system interface, and system to provide data transfer cartridge with size up to 128 GB.

The Scorpion system has impressive features. Each video or symbol can be scaled during flight. The symbols can also be located in any of the four coordinate systems: Earth [Lat, Long, Alt], Airplane [azimuth, altitude, rotation], Cockpit [X, Y, Z relative to the designer’s eye], Helmet [azimuth, elevation, and rollover relative to the helmet sight].

The characteristic of the Scorpion system is that the integrators of the system can implement symbols and mechanization of the display at any time. Also, the pilot with the help of the integrator determines when and where to place the symbols or video in real-time. Another important feature is that the symbols are programmed by the integrator and downloaded from the aircraft launch system.

Mike Sheehan, president, and CEO of Thales Defense & Security says the F-16’s choice only proves the effectiveness, capabilities, and quality of Scorpion helmet-mounted displays. Last but not least, according to Sheen, is the color symbolism in the Scorpion display and the possibility of sharing with “unmodified night vision goggles”.

France orders 21 more TALIOS optronic pods - EDR Magazine,"Sat, 07 May 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVkcm1hZ2F6aW5lLmV1L2ZyYW5jZS1vcmRlcnMtMjEtbW9yZS10YWxpb3Mtb3B0cm9uaWMtcG9kc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"6 May 2022 – The French defence procurement agency (DGA) has placed a firm order with Thales for 21 additional TALIOS pods. The new target designation pods will equip Rafale aircraft currently in service with the French Air and Space Force and the French Navy.

As theatres of operations become more complex, maintaining an accurate picture of the tactical situation is becoming increasingly crucial to the ability of pilots and commanders to make timely decisions and achieve a strategic advantage. Shortening the time it takes between gathering intelligence and defeating targets of interest is a key objective for armed forces all over the world.

In an increasingly connected operational environment, the TALIOS [1] pod will enable Rafale F4 standard aircraft to perform both air reconnaissance and ground/surface attack missions. The pod provides a wide-area search and target identification capability and can then switch instantly into target acquisition and tracking mode. Its high-resolution sensors provide a colour picture of the tactical situation to simplify the tasks of Rafale pilots. Thales has also developed a new Vision Permanent™ mode, which superimposes real-time video on a 3D map of the operational environment, enabling air crews to observe and understand the tactical situation in a significantly shorter time.

TALIOS will ultimately incorporate artificial intelligence algorithms to provide an unprecedented level of assistance in target detection and recognition and further accelerate the decision-making process, particularly in high-intensity engagements.

This order for 21 additional pods underscores the continuing confidence of the French forces, which have deployed TALIOS multiple times on expeditionary missions since the first pods were delivered in 2019. The new pods will be delivered between 2024 and 2025, straight after fulfilment of the initial order for 46 TALIOS systems.

“The TALIOS pod’s new reconnaissance modes and automatic target detection and recognition algorithms will provide the French armed forces with an unprecedented level of operational superiority. Rafale pilots will be able to make better decisions with even greater speed at every decisive moment of their missions to detect, classify and safely engage a target and assess the results of a ground or surface strike.”Christophe Salomon, Executive Vice President, Land and Air Systems, Thales

According to Thales, the Scorpion sight displays information from the aircraft’s onboard sensors. It can also designate and track targets anywhere in the crew’s field of view i during daylight and nighttime missions.

The retrofit kits will replace the current Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS) employed by Air National Guard pilots of F-16 block 40 and 50 aircraft.

“Moving their entire fleet of F-16s to Scorpion is a testament to the capability, quality, and low life-cycle costs that Scorpion provides the warfighters and the Air Guard,” said Mike Sheehan, President and CEO of Thales Defense & Security.

A-10 pilots have already adopted the Scorpion system in the Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve. It is also expected to equip the pilots of the future F4 standard of the Dassault Rafale fighter jet, currently under development for the French Air Force.

Under this contract awarded by the NATO Support & Procurement Agency, NATO allies will be able to procure the Scorpion and all accompanying equipment required to replace the JHMCS HMD without the need for platform modifications."

Schoolchildren and top tech companies are working together to fight hackers from a former Welsh steelworks, with the next stage of a global cyber security hub opened today by the First Minister of Wales. ResilientWorks is the latest development on the former Ebbw Vale steelworks site, creating a technology campus with the National Digital Exploitation Centre, NDEC. The new £7m innovation cluster opened today is jointly funded by global technology company Thales and the Welsh Government’s Tech Valleys programme, with a research contribution from Cardiff University.

ResilientWorks is a living laboratory that enables leading tech companies to test and develop autonomous vehicle and power systems, with a scientific research programme bringing university researchers and companies together in facilities that include research laboratories, a test track, and model street complex. The initiative works alongside a major schools and colleges outreach programme, laying a pathway for the next generation of talent to go into the cyber industry.

ResilientWorks will expand the campus begun by NDEC, a £20m joint investment launched in 2019 by Thales, the Welsh Government and the University of South Wales. The first business developed on the former Ebbw Vale steelworks site as part of the area’s economic regeneration plan, NDEC has won work for Wales from Innovate UK and the UK Government, and is working with international companies such as EDF and Williams Grand Prix Engineering, and Welsh companies including Protecht and Awen Collective.

First Minister Mark Drakeford said:

Ebbw Vale was once a place that exported steel across the globe. Now we’re working together as government, industry and universities, joining forces to export knowledge around the world.

“ResilientWorks will help establish Wales as a centre of excellence for cyber security technology for critical national infrastructure and industry.""

“These are the jobs of the future in the industries of the future.”

The expanding Thales development at Ebbw Vale plays an important role growing both talent and high-tech jobs in the area. As well as directly employing 28 people so far and growing businesses in the local supplier base, it has created both PhDs and degree apprenticeships and shows a clear route to STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) careers for valleys children.

Thales is a founder company of the Cyber College Cymru initiative, a, partnership between industry and FE colleges that now educates over 100 students a year in Welsh FE colleges. Through outreach programmes for schools, for example, a weekly “Cyber Club” for Year 9 students at Abertillery Learning Community, Thales staff and research graduates work with schoolchildren to develop their cyber skills and career aspirations.

NDEC Business Manager Leanne Connor is a former student at the school:

“There’s no reason why people in this area can’t move into well-paid high tech jobs. The team here are real-life examples that it can be done.

“We’re delivering our commitment to the Welsh Government to work with schools and colleges to develop a pipeline for talent for the future. Our educational outreach is being very well received in schools and we’re really starting to have an impact.

“The number of female students going into STEM subjects and looking at cyber as career options is increasing. Local schools are delighted that a company like Thales wants to work with them.

“We’re starting to normalise the idea among young people in this area that they can have a career in cyber.”"
"TALIOS For Rafale – To Boost Targeting & Strike Capability Of Rafale Fighters, France Orders Additional Pods From Thales - EurAsian Times","Wed, 11 May 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cmFzaWFudGltZXMuY29tL3RhbGlvcy1mb3ItcmFmYWxlLXRvLWJvb3N0LXRhcmdldGluZy1zdHJpa2UtY2FwYWJpbHktb2YtcmFmYWxlLWZpZ2h0ZXJzL9IBZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cmFzaWFudGltZXMuY29tL3RhbGlvcy1mb3ItcmFmYWxlLXRvLWJvb3N0LXRhcmdldGluZy1zdHJpa2UtY2FwYWJpbHktb2YtcmFmYWxlLWZpZ2h0ZXJzLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In a bid to enhance the targeting and reconnaissance capabilities of the Rafale fighter jet, the French Defense Procurement Agency (DGA) has placed an order with Thales for 21 targeting long-range identification optronic systems (TALIOS) pods.

Thales, a French Defense company, announced on May 6 that the new target designation pods would be installed on Rafale aircraft in service with the French Air Force and Navy.

The latest order for 21 additional pods comes after DGA placed an initial order for 46 TALIOS systems, taking the total number of TALIOS systems to 67.

The company stated that the additional pods will be delivered between 2024 and 2025 once the initial deal for 46 TALIOS systems is completed.

Thales Land and Air Systems executive vice-president Christophe Salomon said, “The TALIOS pod’s new reconnaissance modes and automatic target detection and recognition algorithms will provide the French armed forces with an unprecedented level of operational superiority.”

“Rafale pilots will be able to make better decisions with even greater speed at every decisive moment of their missions to detect, classify and safely engage a target and assess the results of a ground or surface strike,” he added.

What Is TALIOS?

While theaters of operations get more sophisticated, pilots’ and commanders’ ability to make timely judgments and obtain a strategic advantage is increasingly dependent on an accurate view of the tactical situation.

A key goal for military forces all around the world is to reduce the time between obtaining intelligence and defeating targets of interest.

In line with this, the company developed the TALIOS system. It is an open-architecture aerial targeting and reconnaissance pod that was first developed in 2008. It can be used to detect, recognize, and identify targets day and night.

The pod has since been upgraded as part of the Rafale F4 standardization effort. The Vision Permanent function, for example, gives a virtual real-time 3D map overlay on an operational environment.

It also contains a new air-to-air identification mode, a new day color sensor with greater range coverage than the original pods’ thermal cameras, and additional tactical air reconnaissance modes.

The system is linked by a top-down datalink, which provides real-time data to ground forces. These features are extremely crucial for fighter aircraft pilots.

The TALIOS pod will allow Rafale F4 standard aircraft to execute both air reconnaissance and ground/surface attack missions in an increasingly linked operating environment. The pod can explore a large area for targets and identify them, then switch to target acquisition and tracking mode rapidly.

Furthermore, the high-resolution sensors provide a color image of the tactical situation, making Rafale pilots’ tasks easier.

Thales has also created a new Vision Permanent mode that superimposes real-time video on a 3D map of the operating environment, allowing aircrews to view and grasp the tactical situation in much less time.

TALIOS will eventually combine artificial intelligence algorithms, according to the company, and provide an unprecedented amount of assistance in target detection and recognition, as well as speed up the decision-making process, particularly in high-intensity encounters.

Rafale F4 Standard

Last year, the UAE agreed to buy 80 Rafale F4 fighter jets from Dassault Aviation of France. The UAE will be the first country after France to operate the Rafale F4 type as a result of the deal.

The Rafale F4 will be equipped with the RBE2 AESA radar, Talios targeting pod, front sector optronics system, and helmet-mounted display. As previously reported by EurAsian Times, the aircraft’s Spectra defensive system has been improved with more powerful jammers to preserve its ability to reject emerging threats.

The Rafale F4 aircraft will also include future improvements to the French SCALP-EG stealthy subsonic cruise missile, ASMP-A nuclear missile with a 300-kiloton yield nuclear warhead, MICA NG air-to-air missile, and a 1000-kg version of the AASM precision-guided bomb.

The revised Rafale’s architecture has been improved to allow for future technology upgrades and modifications as they become available.

The F4 variant will significantly increase the 4.5-generation fighter’s stealth capabilities, which were previously available but fell short of competing with fifth-generation combat aircraft.

Other stealth elements of the fighter jet include S-shaped air intakes, serrated edges, and a channel exhaust cooling system that reduces infrared signature. Like the Super Hornet and Typhoon fighter jets, the Rafale will have a radar cross-section (RCS) of around one square meter due to these abilities.

Dassault’s F4 version was initially ordered when the French military awarded Dassault a contract in 2019. It has already been pitched to numerous clients, including the Indian Air Force."

“With this new order, a total of 67 TALIOS pods will be in service with the French Air and Space Force and the French Navy by 2025,” Thales says.

Announced by France’s DGA defence procurement agency on 5 May, Thales says its latest contract involves pods with enhanced capabilities, “including a new air-to-air identification mode, a colour sensor and new tactical air reconnaissance modes ordered as part of the Rafale F4 programme”.

The latest version also incorporates its ‘Vision Permanent’ function, “which superimposes real-time video on a 3D map”.

“The TALIOS pod will enable Rafale F4-standard aircraft to perform both air reconnaissance and ground/surface-attack missions,” Thales says. “The pod provides a wide-area search and target identification capability and can then switch instantly into target acquisition and tracking mode.”

“Rafale pilots will be able to make better decisions with even greater speed at every decisive moment of their missions to detect, classify and safely engage a target and assess the results of a ground or surface strike,” says Thales executive vice-president, land and air systems Christophe Salomon.

Deliveries under the French defence ministry’s prior TALIOS contract commenced in 2019, with the DGA saying that 30 systems have been received so far.

“The new pods will be delivered between 2024 and 2025, straight after fulfilment of the initial order,” Thales says.

Thales says its continued development path for the targeting system “will ultimately incorporate artificial intelligence algorithms”."

The NATO Communications and Information Agency (NCI Agency) has awarded a contract to Thales for the installation of the NCOP system at 30 fixed and deployed command centres and the subsequent training of end users.

NCOP is designed to capture, aggregate and correlate georeferenced operational information collected from multi-domain operations, leveraging a cyber secure environment to generate a single comprehensive picture of the theatre of operations.

============== ==============

This is expected to provide a common operational picture (COP), capable of ensuring each entity has a shared view of the locations, actions and intentions of forces in the field.

Thales has reportedly developed a software system based on an open architecture, with specialised modules which can draw on the company’s experience across the command chain in compliance with commercial and military standards.

1

The system has been built to provide operational users with secure access to multiple COPs overlaid on a base map.

This latest contract builds on phases one and two of the NCOP program, with Thales tasked with helping NATO enhance its mission coordination, planning and command capabilities.

For this latest phase, Thales is expected to partner with GEOS to deploy the software and provide training for users.

The NCOP 2 system is scheduled to be deployed in 2023 after field testing, operating alongside NATO’s own infrastructure.

Thales and GEOS are also expected to deliver comprehensive training for system administrators and users as well as on-site technical and operational assistance throughout the system adoption phase.

“This new selection reinforces our historical collaboration with the NATO Communications and Information Agency,” Gérard Herby, vice president, protection systems, Thales, said.

“We will build on the ongoing development of the NCOP 2 system and demonstrate Thales’ ability to deliver fully integrated solutions for our customers.”

Up Periscope! Sub Scandal Resurfaces in Malaysia - Asia Sentinel,"Mon, 02 May 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFzaWFzZW50aW5lbC5jb20vcC9zdWJtYXJpbmUtc2NhbmRhbC1yZXN1cmZhY2UtbWFsYXlzaWHSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By: John Berthelsen

The announcement late last week that the French defense group Thales is under formal investigation in Paris as part of a long-running corruption probe tied to the 2002 sale of submarines to Malaysia is a reminder that before the 1Malaysia Development Bhd scandal, there was an equally ugly affair. It also involved the disgraced former Prime Minister Najib Razak and included allegations of blackmail, bribery, murder, kickbacks, influence peddling, misuse of corporate assets, and concealment.

Thales has denied the charges, which featured allegations of kickbacks amounting to €114.96 million (US$121.15 million) that were channeled by a subsidiary, DCN International, through a private company to the United Malays National Organization on the €$1 billion purchase of the Scorpene subs. Najib, the defense minister at the time, was the architect of the purchase. At least €36 million also flowed from the DCN subsidiary to Terasasi Hong Kong Ltd., whose principal officers were listed as a close Najib friend and his father. Terasasi only existed as a name on the wall of a Wanchai district accounting firm in Hong Kong.

Some of the misdeeds appeared to have taken place with the knowledge of top French government officials including then-foreign Minister Alain Juppe and with the consent of former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, according to documents made available to Asia Sentinel at the time which were presented to the French Prosecuting Magistrate at the Court de Grand Instance de Paris in May and June of 2011. The case, opened in Paris in 2010, is sensitive because of the possible involvement of top French government officials.

Asia Sentinel was awarded the top prize for excellence in investigative reporting in 2013 by the Society of Publishers in Asia, Asia’s equivalent of the Pulitzer Prize, for a series of articles on the scandal. The lead article can be found here. According to Reuters, the current charges involve contracts by Thales Asia and French state-controlled warship builder DCN. The French Financial Prosecutor's office said in an email to Reuters that Thales SA had been put under formal investigation for complicity in the active corruption of a foreign agent, as was DCNI.

Najib was convicted of all seven counts of criminal breach of trust, abuse of power, and money laundering for his role in the 1MDB scandal, in which the government-backed investment company was looted of billions of dollars and from which at least US$670 million appeared to have been routed into his own pockets. He was sentenced to 72 years in prison, to be served concurrently over 12 years. The appellate court, which upheld the judgment and sentence, called him “a national embarrassment.”

Najib has never been jailed, however, and remains free on appeal. Currently, there are intensive efforts on the part of UMNO leaders to keep him out of prison, including by attempting to discredit Court of Appeal judge Mohd Nazlan Mohd Ghazali, who was part of the court that refused to reverse Najib’s appeal. Najib remains a powerful kingmaker in Malaysian politics.

The Scorpene Story

The Scorpene story in essence began when Najib was appointed defense minister in 1991 and embarked on a massive buildup of the country’s military, arranging for the purchase of tanks, Sukhoi jets, coastal patrol boats and submarines, which kicked off a stiff competition between French, German, Swedish, Russian and Dutch manufacturers, who in turn went looking for the most effective cronies of the Malaysian leadership to help them out. DCN found Abdul Razak Baginda, a close friend of Najib’s. Many of the other contracts were riddled with corruption.

According to documents made available to Asia Sentinel at the time, DCN routed the payments to UMNO through a private company called Perimekar Sdn Bhd, wholly owned by Razak Baginda and which investigators said had been established with the sole purpose of receiving the kickbacks. Razak Baginda was then the head of a Malaysian think tank called Malaysian Strategic Research.

At the time, Razak Baginda, who was married, was dating a beautiful Mongolian international party girl named Altantuya Shaariibuu on the side. According to a private investigator’s report in Kuala Lumpur, she had previously been involved in an affair with Najib as well. She was named a translator on the deal and accompanied Najib and Razak Baginda on a visit to France, where she visited the DCN headquarters with them, according to documents.

She and Razak Baginda toured Europe in his Ferrari. But the romance didn’t last. As Asia Sentinel reported at the time, after Razak Baginda ditched her, she showed up in Kuala Lumpur to demand US$500,000 from Razak Baginda in ""blackmail"" although she didn't say what the blackmail threat referred to – her threats against the family or possibly her knowledge of the Scorpene transaction.

Shortly after that, two of Najib’s elite bodyguards abducted Altantuya from in front of Razak Baginda’s house, where she was shouting threats, and took her to a patch of forest outside of nearby Shah Alam. She was shot twice in the head, and then her body, believed to be carrying an unborn child, was blown up with military explosives.

Razak Baginda was arrested along with the two bodyguards but was almost immediately freed and decamped for Europe, where he remained for several years before returning. The two killers, Corporal Sirul Azhar Umar and Chief Inspector Azilah Hadri, were convicted and sentenced to death. Both have since in separate sworn statements said Najib had ordered them to kill the 28-year-old woman.

The bodyguards remain in custody today. In 2021, former Attorney General Tommy Thomas bluntly accused Najib of being personally responsible for the murder. The evidence amassed by prosecutors, he wrote in his autobiography My Story: Justice in the Wilderness,” “implicated not only Najib Razak as the person who gave [one of the bodyguards] the order to kill, but also his aide-de-camp, Musa Safri, for assisting or abetting Najib” in setting the bodyguards after her. Najib has threatened a defamation suit. Thomas dismissed the threat and reserved the right to demand costs if the case were to go to trial.

In February of 2020, the Pakatan Harapan coalition that took power as a reform government in 2018 was ousted from power. Almost immediately, Thomas was replaced as attorney general and any hope of further investigation vanished in Malaysia. Najib remains in danger of losing his appeal with the Federal Court, the country’s top tribunal, over the 1MDB matter, and his wife, Rosmah Mansor, also faces charges in a lower court. It is uncertain when the top court will act on Najib’s appeal.

In the meantime, Malaysia has been embarrassed in courts in the United States where 1MDB officials and officers of Goldman Sachs have been on trial in what has been called one of the biggest financial scandals in history. The French court may now have its turn with the Scorpene scandal."
"Space, lighter satellites that communicate with light: for the first time prototypes have made contact with infrared ""optical ... - Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna","Tue, 17 May 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHA6Ly93d3cuc2FudGFubmFwaXNhLml0L2VuL25ld3Mvc3BhY2UtbGlnaHRlci1zYXRlbGxpdGVzLWNvbW11bmljYXRlLWxpZ2h0LWZpcnN0LXRpbWUtcHJvdG90eXBlcy1oYXZlLW1hZGUtY29udGFjdC1pbmZyYXJlZNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Satellites become lighter and also learn to communicate through light. The complex electronic apparatuses inside them will be able to use light to communicate with each other, exploiting the technology “Optical Wireless Communication” (“OWC”) that ensures the transfer of data through light signals, thanks to LEDs and photodiodes (i.e. semiconductor optical devices) without using physical cables. This will result in significant savings in terms of mass to be transported in orbit and a reduction in assembly time. To study the feasibility of a communication system of this type and to produce the first working prototypes, the European Space Agency (ESA), with the support of Italian Space Agency (ASI), has funded the project “TOWS”, an acronym that derives from “Transmission of Optical Wireless signals for telecom Spacecrafts”, for an amount of about 700 thousand euro, under the coordination of Ernesto Ciaramella, Full Professor of Telecommunications at the Sant'Anna School.

The project has just reached a significant scientific milestone. In Rome, at the headquarters of the partner Thales Alenia Space (a joint venture between Thales at 63% and Leonardo at 33%), the leading company in the creation of satellite systems and orbiting infrastructures partner in the project, and specifically in its research and development laboratory Fablab, for the first time several prototypes within the same satellite, a few meters apart, exchanged data, using a communication protocol in use on all real satellites, without the presence of any cable, but only through the use of LEDs and photodiodes, which worked as infrared “optical antennas”.

Telecommunications, earth observation, navigation services and scientific experiments are just some of the applications of the thousands of satellites in orbit around the Earth. Each year, in fact, more than a thousand satellites are launched into orbit and the operation requires the movement of significant masses. The huge rocket and the big controlled explosion that allows to go out of the atmosphere and to reach the orbit, the propellant that generates the explosion able to lift the hundreds of tons of mass are scenes entered in the collective imagination, with economic implications too. As the mass increases, the amount of propellant needed increases and the costs are destined to rise.

The mass of a satellite is mainly due to its structure, photovoltaic units, instrumentation and cabling. All elements that are essential to its operation, yet - as demonstrated by the project funded by the European Space Agency - some of these components, even the most delicate, can be replaced with simpler and safer solutions, which - for communications - exploit precisely the light.

After the first successful test, according to the researchers involved in the project coordinated by the Sant'Anna School, there are many interesting implications of this result. “The cables on board a satellite are many, they cost, take up space and weigh. Reducing the number - explains the coordinator of the project, Ernesto Ciaramella - allows you to free space, reduce weight and production time. In addition, lighter rockets use less fuel, and result in fewer emissions. The same technology can also be applied to the assembly, integration and testing phases of the satellites themselves. In addition, light cannot pass through walls, so the 'optical antennas' represent an ideal solution for all situations that require high security and shielding from external interference, as well as for all environments in which radio waves can disturb the operation of other equipment”.

“In this project - continues Ernesto Ciaramella - solutions have been developed for communications within the satellite, but other lines of research also include optical communication between satellites and ground stations. In the latter case - concludes Ernesto Ciaramella - such technologies are necessary because there is a growing demand for bandwidth, for example for the purpose of transferring earth observation information”."
This “corrupt” French company has been linked to Najib. Here's what they're doing in M'sia. - CILISOS.MY,"Mon, 09 May 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vY2lsaXNvcy5teS90aGlzLWNvcnJ1cHQtZnJlbmNoLWNvbXBhbnktaGFzLWJlZW4tbGlua2VkLXRvLW5hamliLWhlcmVzLXdoYXQtdGhleXJlLWRvaW5nLWluLW1zaWEv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Malaysia’s got submarines. Two of ’em, in fact, and they were both obtained in a deal that can be traced back to 2002 involving a French defence group, Thales, and our ex-PM, Najib Razak. Cool, nothing to see here. Totally legit business transaction, we could probably use a sub or two. Except…

Some shenanigans were afoot, and apparently, Razak Baginda, an associate of Najib’s, received a(over RM500 million in today’s money) as “consulting work” and the money was reportedly. The investigations into the matter were closed earlier this year, and nine individuals have been charged by the French courts since then.

At this point, you might be thinking, ‘Well, the company’s in France, it’s not like they’re super involved with OUR country’s armed forces, right?’ Boy oh boy do we have news for you…

Thales has been operating in Malaysia for over 40 years

Yep, they’ve been here since 1981, and in 1995, Thales joined hands with Sapura, a local conglomerate, to form Sapura Thales Electronic (STE) Sdn Bhd. Being in the defence industry, they’ve supplied our Armed Forces with… y’know, defence stuff, for example:

Royal Malaysian Navy – Mostly sensors and radar systems on existing ships, like the Navy’s Second Generation Patrol Vessel Littoral Combat Ships

– Mostly sensors and radar systems on existing ships, like the Navy’s Second Generation Patrol Vessel Littoral Combat Ships Royal Malaysian Air Force – Electronic systems on the Air Force’s fighter aircrafts

– Electronic systems on the Air Force’s fighter aircrafts Malaysian Army – Thales is a vendor for DEFTECH, who sold the Army 257 armored vehicles in 2011, and 12 “mini tanks” in 2014.

And then there’s STE’s Call of Duty-esque future soldier program (which we’ve written about more extensively here) where it’s almost as sci-fi as it sounds – experimental platoons of the 12th Royal Malay Regiment (Mechanised) and 4th Mechanised Brigade were equipped with cutting-edge protection gear, spec ops weapons and portable communications systems. The program was almost scrapped in 2016 cuz it didn’t manage to secure funding from the government, but a local IT company, OpenApps Sdn Bhd, swooped in to the rescue and the program has subsequently been “going smoothly”.

That’s not all: even though their main ball game is in the defence sector, they’re kinda like Malaysia’s Stark Industries where they’ve got their hands in multiple cookie jars – even ones that you probably didn’t expect. Y’all have them to thank for:

The in-flight entertainment system on Malaysian Airlines’ flights The control systems for the Kelana Jaya & Ampang LRT lines Urban train & rail related courses in multiple local universities

Okay, that should paint a good enough picture of how involved STE is in the Malaysian ecosystem, but given Thales’s troubles with bribery on French soil, will history repeat itself? To find out, we bought STE’s company profile from SSM to see if any of their directors look sus, and it turns out…

None of STE’s directors are directly linked to Najib

Sorry ladies and gents, nothing saucy to see here. While Thales has been charged in French Courts, and Sapura Energy is busy trying to get a bailout from the government, the directors of STE don’t seem to have any ties to Bossku, as far as we can tell.

A few of them are holding high positions in other companies, like Questran and the Scomi Group, but one person being a director of multiple companies isn’t unusual or against the law. So, yeah, from our research, STE seems to be doing everything above board.

To close out the article, Francois-Xavier Boutes, one of the directors and CEO of STE said in an interview with New Straits Times last year that the company is going to be more and more entrenched in the local security scene, especially cybersecurity:

The push towards digital transformation is strong for many governments, including Malaysia. Thales, as a leading technology player, aligns with that ambition… For Thales, cybersecurity is inherent in the design of a solution. When we speak with customers, we are mindful that mission-critical systems need to be as resilient to cyber-attacks.

We guess only time will tell whether STE will maintain it’s controversy-free status, or they’ll surprise us with some skeletons falling out of their armored vehicles, cuz it’s not like that’s never happened before."

This includes using fibre optic telecoms infrastructure to cost effectively provide accurate train movement and position reporting, rail wheel and defects identification and trespass or trackside presence detection.

Such capabilities will ultimately improve the reliability of both passenger and freight rail services delivery.

Awarded previously to only one other partnership across the globe, ISO 44003 is a European standard that involves a structured approach to sharing resources, experience and skills.

The accreditation scheme is designed to benefit micro, small and medium enterprises through collaborative working.

David Taylor, of Thales, said there was a real synergy between the companies, even though Thales was a global brand, and Incremental was a small enterprise.

He said they shared the same ethos - to introduce new ways of working to deliver better, more cost-effective solutions to rail customers.

""We enjoy working with the team, who are passionate and proactive, and this was the perfect opportunity to better both our organisations and create a blue print for not only the rail industry, but for how global organisations work with MSMEs across any sector.”

Dan Lee-Bursnall, founder and CEO of Incremental, said: “The challenges SMEs face in the rail industry are widely known, a key one is being able to find the right people to speak to and get decisions made. Through our collaboration we have seen a real shift in the speed we can deliver projects thanks to the relationship we have with the Thales team.""

Charles Storr, economy and enterprise manager at City of York Council, said: “As one of the first companies in the UK to receive this accreditation, Incremental and Thales are putting York on the map as an example of collaborative working that can truly benefit small businesses operating in a huge sector, such as rail. With our commitment as a city to be the home of Great British Railways, this is testament to our ability to lead the way within the industry and we’re very proud that it’s happening here in York.”

John Osborne, associate director of the Institute for Collaborative Working, said: “The partnership between Incremental and Thales is a true reflection of collaboration at its best.

""The way the two companies work together to bring out the best in each other is something the Institute is delighted to endorse through its validation scheme based on the principles contained within the ISO 44003 Standard.

""As one of the first companies in the UK to receive the certificate, this demonstrates the commitment Thales and Incremental have shown to support the journey and progression of an SME, as well as Thales using the opportunity to reflect on the way it works and improve its own practices in the process.

""We’re thrilled to award the teams the certificate and look forward to seeing how they take this even further forward in the future.”"
Carbon fibre innovation for Australian manufacturing - Manufactures Monthly,"Thu, 19 May 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hbm1vbnRobHkuY29tLmF1L2NhcmJvbi1maWJyZS1pbm5vdmF0aW9uLWF1c3RyYWxpYW4tbWFudWZhY3R1cmluZy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Carbon Nexus Centre in Victoria’s south.

Defence contractor Thales Australia has entered into a collaboration with Deakin University and the Innovative Manufacturing Cooperative Research Centre (IMCRC) to develop a lightweight composite overwrap for gun barrels. Manufacturers’ Monthly speaks to the people behind the project.

After establishing the Commonwealth in 1901, the Australian government faced responsibility for the country’s defence for the first time. To be free of complete dependence of British munitions and armament supplies, the decision was made to build a factory to manufacture small arms in the New South Wales town of Lithgow.

In July 1914 – despite the centre only being in operation for two years – The Lithgow Small Arms Factory had to rise to a mighty challenge. During the first world war, over 1500 men worked at the facility, enduring cold winters and terrible living conditions to make almost 100,000 Short Magazine Lee-Enfield rifles and accessories over the next five years.

Graham Evenden, Thales Australia’s director integrated weapons & sensors, said from manufacturing the .303 and SLR to today’s Austeyr SA2 and the EF88, Lithgow has a unique heritage.

“The factory was designed specifically with steam powered, belt driven machines,” he said. “They were able to manufacture that rifle in less than half the time of the same rifle which was being manufactured back in England.”

Today, the facility designs new Australian weapons for military and civilian markets. Thales Australia recently invested $6.5 million in the first step to transform the factory into a modern manufacturing and integration hub for the design, development and precision manufacture of next generation weapons systems.

At the forefront of this push is an exciting new six-month, $234,000 research and development (R&D) project to deliver a carbon fibre overwrap that will reduce the thickness of the gun barrel, resulting in a lighter product with increased precision.

The research collaboration is a part of a wider R&D program for Thales and is in collaboration with Deakin University and the Innovative Manufacturing Cooperative Research Centre (IMCRC), based around two fundamental factors: taking an in-demand product to market and securing an onshore supply of the raw material.

“Weight reduction is critical,” Evenden said. “One of the key contributing subsystems for any rifle is the barrel which is usually a fairly large chunk of steel. The lightweight carbon overwrap seems like an obvious solution for that.”

The second, and for Evenden, most exciting reason behind the project is the opportunity to advance in-country composite manufacturing capabilities.

“Currently, the intermediate modulus carbon fibres suited to the overwrap are only available from overseas supply chains that face frequent disruptions. By developing these fibres on Australian soil, Thales is establishing an innovative capability that can be applied to other small arms products across civil and defence sectors,” he noted. “In these times, localising material is so important.”

Dr. Sarah Sharp heads Thales Australia’s integrated weapons and sensors business’ technology and engineering team, having been involved in the development and taking-to-market of new Australian products for many years. As part of Thales’ military rifle R&D program, Sharp has been looking for the right partners, which Deakin University fit perfectly.

“Deakin is our materials research and development partner and the industrialisation of the product is where we’ll be taking the lead,” Evenden said. “They play an absolutely critical role from a materials perspective and how the material is presented will influence the design of the product. We will work hand in glove with Deakin to upskill staff at our Lithgow Arms facility to work with composites, further contributing to sustainable growth within Australia’s manufacturing sector.”

Thales’ mechanical design engineers will be leaning on the company’s experience in working on lightweight carbon systems for aircraft and the defence industry. Evenden is immediately turning his attention on planning how to execute the design into a tangible manufactured product.

“At the beginning of the design phase our industrial team will be involved because at some point, we have to manufacture the product,” he added. “Quality engineering will also be involved from the start, so we can design a quality plan for testing and qualification. It’s important to embed those quality control assurance aspects from the beginning.”

The passion for engineering at the Lithgow factory stems from its rich history. Thales has a number of ex-military staff, but Evenden explained the devotion to providing for the defence industry goes way beyond personal experience.

“Some employees are the fourth generation working at the facility since it opened in 1912,” he said. “There are family with brothers, sisters and fathers working at the factory who carry the passion for manufacturing, so the team really cares about what goes out the door.”

CARBON NEXUS

Prof Russell Varley, professor of composite materials at Deakin University, said the IMCRC activate collaboration will draw on local knowledge and expertise to meet the growing global demand for lightweight, high-performance components.

“Deakin, through its Carbon Nexus research centre, is excited to support Thales in the development of new carbon fibre materials which, will be used to produce a composite demonstrator at Thales Australia’s Lithgow manufacturing facility,” he said.

The Carbon Nexus research centre is a purpose-built carbon fibre research facility committed to supporting the Australian composite industry and creating Australian carbon fibre. This project provides the ideal platform to do this, by growing our manufacturing and research capability, while creating jobs for Australia.

Prof Russell Varley said that Carbon Nexus is proud to be at the nexus of industry, research and teaching for the global carbon fibre community.

Almost 20 years ago, Australia was falling behind in new manufacturing opportunities amid increasing demand for lightweight, low-cost and energy efficient carbon fibre.

With the closure of iconic factories and large-scale employers in manufacturing in Geelong, such as the Ford Australia plant and Alcoa’s Point Henry smelter, the region embraced the opportunity to support local manufacturing.

Carbon Nexus has worked with some of the world’s largest and most important companies such as Vestas, Boeing, Ford and PETRONAS to name a few, whilst collaborating with many Australian companies looking to utilise more carbon fibre in their manufacture. Carbon Nexus provides research and development services across the entire carbon fibre value chain, from precursor and carbon fibre development to composite manufacturing delivered by a team of globally recognised, advanced materials experts. The centre continues to innovate, leveraging off its recent commercial success.

The pilot scale facility at Carbon Nexus, provides a unique advantage over other similar facilities, allowing technology developments to be scaled up in readiness for commercial exploitation.

“At a manufacturing capability of between 50 and 100 tonnes of carbon fibre per year,” he added. “any new technology, whether developed by or with an industry partner is able to take the next step towards the marketplace. .”

Prof Russell Varley believes that the Thales and Deakin’s R&D partnership will act as a testbed for future developments of Australian manufactured bespoke carbon fibres.

“We would love to see this really kick-start the nascent Australian carbon fibre industry,” he said. “And Carbon Nexus is the seed to do that given the difficulty of suppliers in sourcing the carbon fibre they need at the right price.”

Dr Matthew Young, manufacturing innovation manager at IMCRC echoes this sentiment.

“This collaboration will develop a niche, high-quality product with significant export opportunities. By partnering with an Australian world-class research facility on composite materials, this project will directly support growth within a key national manufacturing priority area,” he said.

“It’s a prime example of the role shorter-term R&D collaborations can play in strengthening the future of defence manufacturing within Australia.”"
"No Stormont? No full wages for MLAs then, says Prime Minister - Belfast Telegraph","Mon, 16 May 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJlbGZhc3R0ZWxlZ3JhcGguY28udWsvbmV3cy9icmV4aXQvbm8tc3Rvcm1vbnQtbm8tZnVsbC13YWdlcy1mb3ItbWxhcy10aGVuLXNheXMtcHJpbWUtbWluaXN0ZXIvNDE2NTYyMjYuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Johnson admits issues with NI Protocol must be fixed after meeting with five main parties

The Prime Minister has fired a missile across the bows of Northern Ireland’s MLAs by insisting he sees no reason why they should receive full wages as long as the Stormont stalemate continues.

Boris Johnson was in Northern Ireland to meet with the five main parties in a bid to solve the NI Protocol crisis which is stalling the formation of a new Assembly.

Following talks at Hillsborough Castle, the Prime Minister toured Thales missile factory in east Belfast. And while admitting the meetings were “robust” he was adamant that all five parties knew there were problems with the protocol that needed to be fixed.

“It was certainly robust in the sense that all five parties I spoke to today acknowledge that there are problems. All five of them want to get the government of Northern Ireland up and running again,” the Prime Minister said.

“That’s my priority and it’s where I come in as I’m the Prime Minister of the whole of the UK. I’ve got to find a way of getting the balance of the Good Friday Agreement respected and getting both traditions, both communities here in Northern Ireland to come together for the benefit of the people of Northern Ireland. That’s what today is all about.”

Mr Johnson said his plan to legislate to rip up Northern Ireland’s post-Brexit trading arrangements was an “insurance” policy if a fresh deal could not be reached with the European Union although he remains frustrated that talks with Brussels to resolve the protocol problems have not made sufficient progress.

“None of the parties, not one of them, likes the way it’s operating. They all think it can be reformed and improved,” the Prime Minister said.

“We would love this to be done in a consensual way with our friends and partners in Brussels, ironing out the problems, stopping some of these barriers to goods crossing the Irish Sea.

“But to get that done, to have the insurance, we need to proceed with a legislative solution at the same time.”

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss is expected to outline the government’s plans on Tuesday. In the meantime, earning the trust of sceptical politicians in Northern Ireland is another major obstacle.

“My priority is to get the Belfast Agreement institutions up and running,” said Mr Johnson when asked about trust issues.

“I think that’s crucial to government in Northern Ireland. Look at what’s really going on. We’ve got economic problems caused by a global spike in energy prices, People need focus on health care and education, all the things that matter. You can’t do that when you don’t have an Assembly or an Executive operational. Let’s get it done. Let’s get people back in to the Assembly. I said this to Sir Jeffrey and the DUP.

“But of course, I’ve got to do what I can to fix this, to make things work for people. We did it before when Sinn Fein had problems over the Irish language. We worked very hard to sort that out, we got them back in to the Executive. There’s a problem now with the protocol. It’s not operating the way that I want it to or thought it would.

“There are far too many checks on stuff coming from GB to Northern Ireland. It doesn’t need to be that way.

“Let’s work together to fix it. Let’s work with the EU to fix it. I want members of the Assembly to be back. I see no case for paying them full rations if they’re not back there,” he warned.

“We have to recognise that one group of people here in Northern Ireland are particularly hostile to the operation of the protocol. There’s a general understanding that the east-west dimension of the protocol is not working.

“My message to politicians here is let’s do that and we will do what we can to fix the protocol.”

Following the Hillsborough talks DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson reiterated his view that the time for talking is over.

What exactly is the Northern Ireland Protocol?

“I need action and that’s how I will judge what the Prime Minister does, not necessarily what he says,” the DUP leader said.

“In the past we have been reasonable, we have taken proportionate action, we have sought to give time for negotiations, to bring forward outcomes. That hasn’t happened and I think the time has come now for action.”

Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald described her meeting with the Prime Minister as “fairly tough”, claiming the government’s priority is “placating the DUP”. She also accused the government of co-ordinating the current impasse alongside the unionist party.

Alliance leader Naomi Long told the PM the only way to avoid the constant cycle of collapse and crisis at Stormont is to reform the institutions.

“We need to find a work around or else the people of Northern Ireland will continue to be held hostage,” she said. “That is not an acceptable way to do government and needs to change.”

SDLP leader Colum Eastwood added: “While I welcome his call for the resumption of power-sharing, the gulf between his actions over the last two years and his words today is so great that it makes it impossible to trust the Prime Minister. He has recklessly used this place to serve his own narrow political interests.”"
