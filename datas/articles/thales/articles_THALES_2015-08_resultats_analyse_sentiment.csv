The Birth of Philosophy — Thales and Homer - Stephen Hicks,"Mon, 31 Aug 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0ZXBoZW5oaWNrcy5vcmcvMjAxNS8wOC8zMS90aGUtYmlydGgtb2YtcGhpbG9zb3BoeS10aGFsZXMtYW5kLWhvbWVyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"[At the beginning of the new academic year, a re-visiting of the beginnings of philosophy.]

The standard claim is that philosophy begins with Thales.

When I teach this to my students, it’s a hard sell, for here are the founding texts in philosophy — ascribed to Thales by Aristotle:

“The first principle and basic nature of all things is water.”

and

“All things are full of gods.”

You can imagine how impressed my students are.

Clearly, some interpretation is necessary. Why do historians of philosophy get worked up over these lines?

To see their significance, let’s set a context by going back to the worldview of the awesomely great Homer. So brush up on The Iliad, which I want to use as our pre-philosophy-worldview contrast object.

Homer’s World: The Death of Hector

Homer is thought to have lived 800s-700s BCE, a century or two before Thales (born around 624 BCE). Homer’s The Iliad and The Odyssey are magnificent expressions of archaic Greek culture and of incalculable importance to the Greek way of thinking about human life and its place in the universe.

I want to focus on one major event in The Iliad to illustrate a pre-philosophical, yet sophisticated, view of reality.

Why did Hector die?

We can imagine his father Priam in anguish, asking this question. And his wife doing the same. And his son later when he grows up.

Hector died because Achilles killed him.

Why did Achilles kill him? The broad context is that the Greeks were at war with the Trojans. The specific context is that Achilles wanted revenge for Patroclus’ death. In each case, we can trace back a causal chain.

On the broad context: Why were the Greeks and Trojans fighting? Because Paris and Helen fell in love, Menelaus became a vengeful cuckold, Agamemnon had great ambition for power, Achilles wanted glory, and so on. In Homer’s world we have key motivations that drive human action — Love, Revenge, Power, Glory — played out through these key representative individuals.

On the specific context: Why did Patroclus get killed? Because he was a young man who wanted to prove himself, Achilles was sulking in his tent, Agamemnon had stolen a girl, and so on.

So far all of this is naturalistic explanation in terms of human agency. In a complicated interplay, human desire and motivation and action and reaction cause major events like the Trojan War and specific events like the death of Hector.

But Homer’s story is more complicated, because the gods are also an important part of the causal matrix.

As the great battle between Achilles and Hector is looming, Homer turns our attention to the gods and goddesses, all of whom are watching with great interest. Zeus sees Achilles chasing Hector, and he is torn between love for Hector and admiration for Achilles. Whom should he favor? Zeus finds the tension unbearable and calls upon the others for advice:

“Come you immortals, think this through. Decide.

Either we pluck the man from death and save his life

or strike him down at last, here at Achilles’ hands” (22:206-209)

Athena protests, and Zeus agrees with her that Hector should die, telling her:

“Go.

Do as your own impulse bids you. Hold back no more.”

So he launched Athena already poised for action —

down the goddess swept from Olympus’ craggy peaks. (22: 200-223)

Athena then tricks Hector by impersonating his brother Deiphobus, causing Hector to stop running and allowing Achilles to catch him and kill him.

Homeric Metaphysics

What then are the metaphysical lessons of Homer’s world?

First, naturalistic human agency alone does not cause events on earth. The gods and goddesses are active participants, and their desires, decisions, and actions are important: Zeus could have decided differently, Athena could have switched her affections, and, consequently, Hector’s fate and the outcome of the Trojan War could have been very different.

Second and closely related: In Homer’s world, the supernatural are the more powerful and important causal force. If the gods decide against something, it will not happen. And if the gods decide something will happen, it will. Human agency is a lesser power.

A third theme in Homer is that the gods and goddesses are often whimsical and divided among themselves. Zeus is often driven by his changeable passions. He gets into quarrels with Athena and the others. There is, consequently, no stable and predictable causal order in the natural world. (There is a notion of Fate operative in Homer, but it’s not consistent and its role is not clear — at least not to me.)

A fourth point worth mentioning concerns ethics in Homer’s world: humans worship the gods not because they are moral but because they are powerful. The gods are far from morally admirable and given to a wide range of vices and foibles. So what is the source and purpose of justice and other morally important realities? Concepts of right and wrong are not foreign to the gods, but the gods are not ethically clear or consistent, either in word or deed. And since humans are also not ethically clear or consistent, the place of morality in the universe is at best tenuous. Amoral power seems to rule both the natural realm and beyond.

Abstractly put, we have five implicit metaphysical and ethical theses in Homer’s worldview:

* Supernatural causation is part of the explanation for natural events.

* Supernatural causation is more powerful than natural causation.

* The supernatural is personal.

* Consequently, supernatural causation is sometimes whimsical and so inconsistent and so makes long range prediction unreliable.

* Consequently, ethics is a matter mostly of power — revere gods and kings not because they’re just but because they’re powerful.

Now we’re ready for the revolution initiated by Thales (ca. 624 – ca. 546 BCE).

What if we denied some or all of those five points? What would our account of the world look like?

Philosophy Begins: Thales’ Revolution

Let’s label the five abstracted Homeric themes as follows:

H1. Supernatural causation is part of the explanation for natural events.

H2. Supernatural causation is more powerful than natural causation.

H3. The supernatural is personal.

H4. Consequently, supernatural causation is sometimes whimsical and so inconsistent and so makes long range prediction unreliable.

H5. Consequently, ethics is a matter mostly of power — revere gods and kings not because they’re just but because they’re powerful.

Now let’s return to Thales and the birth of a new worldview:

“The first principle and basic nature of all things is water.”

Thales’ first principle is water. If it is water, then it is not the gods. The gods have become at most secondary, so we have at least an implicit challenge to H2.

Also, the basic nature of all things is water. Water is a natural phenomenon, not a supernatural one, so we have at least an implicit denial of H1.

Why water? No doubt Thales has observed the weather cycle, the flowing of rain into streams and eventually to the sea, the critical importance of water to all living things, that water can be transformed from liquid to solid and back and from liquid to gas and back — and that it does so with a regularity. It’s not that nobody had noticed regularities in nature before Thales. But if water is the first principle of all of things, then all of reality is regular. So we have at least an implicit challenge to H4.

We are well on our way to thinking of nature as a self-contained, self-governing, regular physical system of cause and effect.

It’s also clear that Thales’ statement is based on observations of transformations from liquid to gas to solids, and so on. So he is not basing his views on traditional stories handed down through the ages. And he is offering an explanatory hypothesis for those observations. Observation integrated with explanation is a hallmark of a naturalist, philosophical approach.

Subsequent Presocratics argued with Thales. (By contrast, who would ever argue with Homer?) Anaximenes held that fire was a better first-principle candidate than water, as did Heraclitus. Anaximander (my favorite Presocratic) held that having only one basic state of being, whether water or fire, was too reductionist, and so proposed that water, air, earth, and fire were in a cyclical transformation in and out of a “boundless” state. And others entered the fray.

The Presocratics are now using reason in a different way. It’s not clear that they are self-conscious about the new method of thinking. But they are no longer thinking in Homeric principles — and the new thinkers very quickly become incredulous and scornful when the Homeric and other stories are taken as more than fanciful literature. Hecataeus of Miletus (550-489), who died 19 years before the birth of Socrates, is representative:

“What I write here is the account of what I considered to be true. For the stories of the Greeks are numerous and, in my opinion, ridiculous.”

A new way of thinking has begun. Philosophy and the sciences have been launched and flourish quickly.

As for H5 and the development of a philosophical approach to ethics, that story is worth another article, and it involves the innovations of Hesiod and other giants.

"Siemens, Thales land NYCT QBL West Phase 1 CBTC contracts - RailwayAge Magazine","Thu, 27 Aug 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJhaWx3YXlhZ2UuY29tL2NzL3NpZW1lbnMtbGFuZHMtbnljdC1xYmwtcGhhc2UtMS1jYnRjLWNvbnRyYWN0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority has awarded Siemens Industry Inc. and Thales Transport & Security two 67-month contracts worth a total of $205.8 million to install communications-based train control (CBTC) on a portion of the New York City Transit (NYCT) Queens Boulevard Line (QBL).

The QBL , which incorporates portions of the E, F, M and R lines, is one of the busiest and longest subway lines, in terms of track-miles, on the NYCT system. The Siemens share of the contract is $156.2 million; the Thales share is $49.6 million.

Siemens is supplying its radio-communications-based Trainguard MT CBTC technology for QBL West Phase 1. The contract includes onboard equipment for 305 of 309 four-or five-car R160 units, and wayside signaling and train control technology (zone controllers) at 7 of 8 interlockings. NYCT employees will install the onboard equipment on 301 of the 309 units.

With a length of around 27 track-miles, the QBL is the second-longest line on the NYCT rapid transit network. It has 25 stations and stretches from Jamaica Station in the Borough of Queens to Manhattan. With a daily volume of more than 250,000 passengers, it is one of the most heavily used lines on the NYCT network, which carries more than 5.5 million daily passengers.

Prior to receiving the QBL West Phase 1 contract, Siemens successfully installed CBTC on MTA’s Canarsie “L” line that operates from Chelsea (Manhattan), through Williamsburg to Canarsie (Brooklyn). Also equipped with Trainguard MT, the Canarsie Line has been running in full ATO (automatic train operation) mode since 2009. NYCT’s Flushing/No. 7 Line (including the extension to 34th Street and 11th Avenue) is currently undergoing installation of a Thales-supplied system and is scheduled for completion in 2017. QBL West Phase 1 will be the third NYCT line to be equipped with CBTC.

CBTC will be installed on local and express tracks serving the E, F, M and R lines from north of the Kew Gardens/Union Tpke. E/F station to north of the 47-50 Sts./Rockefeller Center station on the F/M Lines and south of the 50 St. C/E station. It is the first phase in a project that will ultimately update the signaling and train control system for the entire Queens Boulevard Line. QBL West Phase 1 represents a change from MTA’s other CBTC projects, which have been installed on single subway lines such as the L and 7. QBL West Phase 1 encompasses four subway lines with multiple train overlays.

Design work on QBL West Phase 1 is estimated to begin later in 2015, with major installation work estimated to start in mid-2017. Once complete, NYCT says it will be able “to run more frequent subway service with fewer delays, which will be a major benefit to customers who commute to some of Queens’ most populated neighborhoods, major commercial destinations, and areas in Central Queens that are undergoing significant residential and commercial development. On the L Line, ridership has increased by 27% since CBTC was installed; capacity also is expected to increase on the 7 Line once CBTC becomes operational in 2017.”

“CBTC is a vital part of our plan to address issues of overcrowding, record ridership and service delays,” said MTA Chairman and CEO Thomas F. Prendergast. “CBTC represents the MTA’s efforts to bring advanced technology to a century-old subway system that, in some parts, has not been updated in decades. On the L Line, where CBTC has been installed for several years now, we have seen improved service and we have been able to increase capacity significantly. Once we’re done installing CBTC on the 7 Line, those customers will also benefit from similarly improved and increased service. The Queens Boulevard project is a continuation of our efforts to make those improvements system-wide.”

Siemens and Thales are currently the only two suppliers certified for CBTC on NYCT. Both contracted with the MTA to develop a standard CBTC system design as well as standardized specifications that will allow other suppliers to provide interoperable systems compatible with those specifications. The MTA has been facilitating the cooperation of various CBTC suppliers to develop interoperability standards and specifications. Siemens and Thales equipped NYCT’s Culver Test Track to create an integrated test facility for demonstrating the interoperability of their equipment and to allow other suppliers to demonstrate compatibility. The new CBTC specifications have now been codified and are required for all future NYCT CBTC procurements. As such, QBL Phase 1, which unlike Canarsie and Flushing is not a captive system, is the first implementation of the agency’s interoperability standards and specifications.

The MTA has now given the go-ahead to a third supplier, Mitsubishi Electric Power Products Inc. to demonstrate interoperability with Siemens and Thales by installing its own CBTC technology on the the Culver Test Track. Mitsubishi was awarded a 36-month contract over two other bidders, Ansaldo STS USA Inc. and GE Transportation Systems, and is doing the installation largely at its own cost, accepting what NYCT is calling a $1.2 million stipend to complete the project. NYCT had anticipated the cost of this project at around $20 million. (Editor’s note: Hitachi expects to complete acquisition of Italian conglomerate Finmeccanica’s two railway equipment subsidiaries, AnsaldoBreda and Ansaldo STS, by the end of October. In a complex deal that must meet regulatory and shareholder approval, GE intends to sell its signaling and communications business to Alstom, and acquire Alstom’s Thermal Power, Renewable Power and Grid businesses.)

CBTC, says Siemens, provides real-time data on vehicle position and speed conditions, allowing operators to safely increase throughput, resulting in greater train frequency those more passengers. CBTC also “reduces the amount of wayside equipment and, as a result, reduces maintenance costs and service disruptions,” Siemens says. “It employs backup systems, resulting in fewer instances of service disruption and in greater reliability. Through automated signals and sensors, CBTC provides continuous updates on system status that results in fewer delays, and up-to-date travel information shared with riders via public address systems, electronic screens and mobile applications.”

Siemens describes Trainguard MT as “the most extensively deployed automatic train control system, used by more than 20 metro operators around the world,” among them New York, Paris and Beijing. The NYCT Queens Boulevard Line Phase 1 contract is Siemens’ fifth CBTC project in the U.S.

Light single sim thrives in French Alps - Vertical Magazine,"Fri, 07 Aug 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvbGlnaHRzaW5nbGVzaW10aHJpdmVzaW5mcmVuY2hhbHBzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Thales simulator in Albertville has been certified to Level B/FTD 3 — providing an ideal ratio of training credits to costs. Nicolas Durano/Thales Photo

Thales’ expectations for its Airbus Helicopters H125/AS350 B3e Ecureuil/AStar full flight simulator in Albertville, France, seem to have been surpassed, as the training facility, the first for the type in Europe, is attracting pilots from other continents. The company has a partnership with a local helicopter operator, SAF, and is making the most of the latter’s knowledge of the aerial work world.

As of early June, one year after the first commercial virtual flight, Thales and SAF had found customers in Spain, France, India and Angola, among other countries. Initially, the location had been chosen for its close proximity to the Alps mountain range, where a number of operators fly Ecureuils for commercial work. But the appeal proved broader, as illustrated with Angola’s police, a commercial operator based near Bangalore, and a private pilot in France.

To make simulator training more affordable, Thales chose not to offer a Level D device, although the firm’s Reality H product line enables it. Rather, the simulator in Albertville has been certified to Level B/FTD 3 (under European Aviation Safety Agency standards, which are equivalent to the Federal Aviation Administrations’s FTD 6). “For a light helicopter like the B3e, we worked out a ratio of training credits to costs,” said Jean-Jacques Guittard, Thales Training & Simulation’s chairman. The Level B/FTD 3 standard meets 100 percent of recurrent training needs, he added.

To cut acquisition costs, the instrument panel is simulated and cheaper materials are used, and sound simulation is not as realistic as it is for Level D. Ingress is via stairs, as opposed to a more expensive drawbridge, and the actuators are not as long as those of a Level D simulator — and the cabin therefore stands at a lower height.

The motion system is based on electric actuators, thus getting rid of a hydraulic system. Compared to earlier-generation electric systems, it no longer uses compressed air. Therefore, support of Thales’ Hexaline actuator technology is said to be much cheaper — the maintenance technician on site is only a software expert.

On the visual system, the field of view is 210 by 70 degrees. The resolution is said to be “medium” —between three and 10 feet. Five high-resolution (one foot) insets are available, representing Marseille, Castellane, Le Lavandou, and Le Luc (cities of various sizes in Provence), as well as one high-mountain environment.

A large part of the software — namely, the flight control loops — is the result of an SAF-Thales cooperation. Thales Training & Simulation commercial director Cyrille Grandbastien said buying the data from Airbus Helicopters would have been too expensive, so the two companies performed data collection flights with an AS350 fitted with numerous sensors, mainly targeted at mountain flying. Thales thus managed to have a representative software program with realistic aircraft reactions to control inputs.

Customers can choose to lease the simulator with or without an instructor, and, in the latter instance, they may want to bring their own. Packages that include real flights are available. The simulator is suitable for training on the B3e type, as well as for those B3s powered by a Turbomeca Arriel 2B1 engine.

The Thales site is not an approved training organization (ATO), under EASA rules, but an FSTD (flight simulation training device) operator, a company executive explained. It is not supposed to provide student pilots with a full pedagogic system. This is the key of the relationship with SAF — the latter can supply instructors. SAF has an ATO and shares the building with Thales. Two simulators are housed in the same hangar — SAF’s Thales-built EC135 simulator and Thales’ own H125 simulator.

As simulators for light helicopters are still rare, Thales and SAF (which combine their marketing efforts) still have to educate pilots to the benefits of such training devices. In the world of single-pilot helicopters, the dominant culture is to train in the real aircraft, Thales executives noted. Fortunately, French and European authorities are being very supportive, they added.

Incidents and failures that may be trained realistically and safely in a simulator include autorotation with crosswind or at maximum takeoff weight, vortex ring state, hydraulic system failure and tail rotor failure.

Thales expects the simulator business in Albertville to become profitable after a couple of years, following a similar curve to SAF’s EC135 simulator. According to SAF managing director Christophe Rosset, the operation will be in the black this year for the first time, after having been established in 2012. Thales’ AS350 simulator is eventually expected to log 2,000 hours annually.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999673366546631}",neutral,0.9999673366546631,0

The Weststar Group Managing Director, Tan Sri Syed Azman said, “The deal involves MINDEF upgrading their existing missile defense system by capitalizing on the trade-in opportunity for the previous Starburst missiles with the much-improved Starstreak missiles. This has enabled MINDEF to realize substantial savings in the process.”

MINDEF is delighted with the procurement of the system, as it will be a key part of augmenting the capabilities of the nation’s air defense forces as a whole. The system is being procured in part of a trade-in program of the decommissioned Starburst missiles. The delivery of the integrated air defense system will come in a complete package that includes an air surveillance/engagement radar as well as a command and control system.

THALES has produced the fastest new generation very short-range air defense missiles that can accelerate to a peak velocity of Mach 3. These missiles boast the ability to fly a kilometer within a second. Furthermore, with the assistance of a laser beam, the operator controls all three of the dart-missiles simultaneously. As a result, the laser beam guide increases positive target and reduces the risk of collateral damage.

The STARStreak system has been designed to provide detection, threat evaluation, weapon allocation and engagement of a range of threats including fixed-wing, helicopters, missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles.

The Malaysian defense industry will benefit through the offset program offered by THALES. Among the benefits to be reaped is the transfer of technology in hardware and software applications that correlate to the system as well as in other related fields. In addition, THALES has also offered training packages for the operator and technicians to ensure smooth operation over the life cycle of the system.

Thales confirmed for Subsurface Tube line resignalling - Infrastructure Intelligence,"Mon, 03 Aug 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHA6Ly93d3cuaW5mcmFzdHJ1Y3R1cmUtaW50ZWxsaWdlbmNlLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2F1Zy0yMDE1L3RoYWxlcy1jb25maXJtZWQtc3Vic3VyZmFjZS10dWJlLWxpbmUtcmVzaWduYWxsaW5nLTDSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Transport for London has confirmed the award of the £760M Subsurface Tube line signalling upgrade to Thales. Thales were revealed as being in the frame in March.

The contractor picked up the contract for the four lines after the job was rebid when London Underground (LU) pulled the original deal with Bombardier in 2013 because it “could not deliver to the timescale we required” according to LU.

The original job, a key part of the £5.4bn subsurface line investment, had been due to finish in 2018. The new timetable is for completion in 2022.

Thales has just completed the highly successful Northern line signalling upgrade and before that the Jubilee line.

“Once completed, 60 per cent of the London Underground will have been modernised using Thales signalling technology"" - Patrice Caine, Thales.

Work on the Subsurface lines is the next major phase of the Underground’s modernisation and is promised to bring faster, more frequent and more reliable journeys to the 1.3M passengers who use the Circle, District, Metropolitan and Hammersmith & City lines every day. Trains will be able to run every two minutes. The lines make up 40% of the Tube network and include the oldest parts built in 1863.

Up to 1,100 jobs and 60 apprenticeships will be sustained or created, both in London and across the UK.

The improvements will boost capacity by an average of a third on the four lines and is needed in order to support London’s growing population, which is expected to increase from 8.6 million today to 10 million by 2030.

Work is expected to begin later this year and the main benefits, delivered by 2022, will see frequency of trains running during peak periods increase to 32 trains per hour in central London – a train every two minutes - with frequency increases at other times as well.

The cost per kilometre of re-signalling the four lines is 18 percent less than the modernisation of the Northern line, TfL said. This was around half the cost of the Jubilee and Victoria line modernisations delivered under the Public Private Partnership arrangements, ended by the Mayor five years ago.

Overall budget for the four line modernisation programme has been confirmed as £5.41bn, according to TfL. This is a reduction of £131M compared to an earlier estimate announced in March. This budget includes investment in 191 new modern air-conditioned walk through trains, built in the UK, and already introduced on the Metropolitan, Circle and Hammersmith & City and District lines.

The investment also includes further improvements to get the most out of the new trains, including new track, lengthened platforms and rebuilt train depots with advanced technology to ensure the highest levels of train reliability. This includes a train control system which will increase capacity further starting with the Circle line in 2021, with additional frequent services at peak times. During 2023 the final improvements will be delivered, with a further boost to peak and off-peak frequency on the Metropolitan line.

""We are ready to begin work to bring the next four lines into the modern era” Nick Brown, London Underground

These improvements will follow modernisation of other Tube lines in recent years. On the Victoria line train frequency is up to 34 trains per hour, while on the Jubilee line it is at 30 trains per hour – some of the most frequent services anywhere in Europe, according to TfL. Since the start of this year LU has increased capacity on the Northern line, making room for an extra 12,500 passengers each hour.

“Having successfully modernised three of the most heavily used lines on our network, we are ready to begin work to bring the next four lines into the modern era,” said managing director of London Underground Nick Brown.

“We have a very clear delivery plan and timetable for the work and, as we have done with the modernisation of the Northern line, we will keep London moving and growing as we do it. In parallel, we will continue to deliver a better, more reliable service every day which builds on the work over recent years to reduce delays to their lowest ever level.”

Thales was looking forward to taking on more LU work. “If the Jubilee and Northern lines’ success is any indicator, future travellers on the Circle, District, Metropolitan and Hammersmith & City lines will experience; faster journeys, reduced over-crowding and increased service reliability,” said its chairman and chief executive officer Patrice Caine.

“Once completed, 60 per cent of the London Underground will have been modernised using Thales signalling technology.”

The improvements will all be delivered within the existing TfL Business Plan and the programme is expected to have a benefit-cost ratio of around 4.7 to 1. Once the four subsurface lines have been completed, LU will then move on to introducing new trains and control systems for the Piccadilly, Central, Bakerloo, and Waterloo & City lines.

Thales awarded London Underground Sub-Surface Lines resignalling contract - Railway Gazette,"Mon, 03 Aug 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJhaWx3YXlnYXpldHRlLmNvbS90aGFsZXMtYXdhcmRlZC1sb25kb24tdW5kZXJncm91bmQtc3ViLXN1cmZhY2UtbGluZXMtcmVzaWduYWxsaW5nLWNvbnRyYWN0LzQxMjAyLmFydGljbGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"UK: Transport for London announced on August 3 that it had awarded sole bidder Thales a £760m contract to renew the signalling and train control systems on London Underground's Circle, District, Metropolitan and Hammersmith & City lines.

Collectively known as the Sub-Surface Lines, the four large-profile lines form a complex network of interlinked routes with numerous junctions which comprises 40% of the London Underground network and carries 1·3 million passengers/day.

Work is expected to begin later this year. The first increase in capacity would be on the Circle Line in 2021, with the ‘main benefits’ of the project to be delivered by 2022, when the peak train frequency would increase to 32 trains/h in central London. The final improvements would come in 2023, with an increase in peak and off-peak frequencies on the Metropolitan Line.

The deal replaces a £345m contract which TfL had awarded to Bombardier in June 2011. This was terminated in December 2013, with TfL saying the ‘complex nature of the railway’ meant Bombardier's programme ‘was simply not progressing and there was no guarantee it would have worked’. The contract with Bombardier had itself replaced a previous contract awarded by Metronet to Invensys under the London Underground public-private partnership.

The latest contract represents a significant increase in cost, but TfL said it would be 18% less per km than ‘the successful modernisation of the Northern Line which was around half the cost of the Jubilee and Victoria line modernisations delivered under the flawed public-private partnership arrangements, ended by the Mayor five years ago.’

'Once completed, 60% of the London Underground will have been modernised using Thales signalling technology’, said Thales Chairman & CEO Patrice Caine.

The overall budget for Sub-Surface Lines modernisation has been confirmed as £5·41bn, a reduction of £131m from an estimate announced on March 24. This total includes the cost of 191 S-Stock trainsets ordered from Bombardier, and related platform lengthening, track and depot works. The work is to be delivered within the existing TfL Business Plan, and the programme is expected to have a benefit-cost ratio of around 4·7 to 1.

The project ‘will transform the journeys of millions of our customers, significantly increasing service reliability and frequency’, according to London Underground Managing Director Nick Brown. ‘We have a very clear delivery plan and timetable for the work and, as we have done with the modernisation of the Northern Line, we will keep London moving and growing as we do it.’

Once the Sub-Surface Lines have been modernised, work would begin to introduce new trains and control systems for the Piccadilly, Central, Bakerloo and Waterloo & City lines.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.7425464987754822}",positive,0.7425464987754822,1
Drone manufacturers linked to Gaza war cross-examined in Scottish courts - bellacaledonia.org.uk,"Thu, 20 Aug 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi5AFodHRwczovL2JlbGxhY2FsZWRvbmlhLm9yZy51ay8yMDE1LzA4LzIwL2luLXZpY3RvcnktZm9yLWFjdGl2aXN0cy1kcm9uZS1tYW51ZmFjdHVyZXJzLWxpbmtlZC10by1nYXphLXdhci1jcm9zcy1leGFtaW5lZC1pbi1zY290dGlzaC1jb3VydHMtc2VlLW1vcmUtYXQtaHR0cG1vbmRvd2Vpc3MtbmV0MjAxNTA4YWN0aXZpc3RzLW1hbnVmYWN0dXJlcnMtc2NvdHRpc2hzdGhhc2gtMjNmd2ZzMXQtZHB1Zi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"After a gruelling fourteen day trial, a group of activists known as the Thales Ten,* received their verdict in Glasgow Sheriff Court last week. Five were convicted, and five acquitted, of the crime of breach of the peace.

The group scaled onto the roof and blockaded entrances to the Thales UK factory on 23rd September, 2014 in response to the war in Gaza. They hung a fifty foot Palestine flag and several banners. One read: ‘Another Scotland is Possible: Stop Arming Israel’. Another made the connection between the French arms company Thales, Israel’s Elbit Systems, and the UK Ministry of Defence.

The UK Government and the French and Israeli arms giants are cooperating over the delivery of the next generation of Watchkeeper drones. This evolution in unmanned aerial warfare will replace the Hermes drone, which has been used to deadly effect all over the world, notably in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen and Palestine. A common sight over the skies of the Gaza Strip, drones are frequently used by the Israeli occupation forces to survey and launch deadly attacks against Palestinians. Human Rights Watch documented 87 killings through drone strikes on the Gaza Strip during the Israeli named ‘Operation Cast Lead’ in 2008-9.

In a major victory for Palestine activists against the arms industry, a member of Thales senior management was summoned by the Scottish courts to answer questions as to the nature of their business. Activists cross-examined a Senior Manager of Thales UK, Ian Lindsay, in their defence. Mr Lindsay admitted that components manufactured on the Clyde in Glasgow are used in military drones.

Glasgow Palestine Action: “We have established that the UK Government are in cooperation with Thales and Elbit who are the largest arms manufacturer in Israel and are producing the next generation of Watchkeeper drones and we also established that components for that project are produced in Glasgow – is that correct?”



Mr Lindsay (Thales) “For Watchkeeper, yes.”

Glasgow Palestine Action: “So when you said we were labouring under the misapprehension that components for drones were made at the Glasgow site was that incorrect?”

Mr Lindsay (Thales): “I said you were labouring under the misapprehension that munitions were made at the plant.”

Glasgow Palestine Action: “But you do manufacturer components for drones at the plant in Glasgow?”

Mr Lindsay (Thales): “We do.”



This is a major admission for a number of reasons. The local community regard Thales as highly secretive as to what is manufactured in the plant. This is significant because in addition to a long history of weaponry and munitions manufactured on the Clyde, there is also a history of resistance. In 1974, Scottish workers at Rolls Royce plant in East Kilbride refused to service engines bound for Pinochet’s coup of Salvador Allende. An act that later saw Bob Fulton, John Keenan and Robert Somervilleawarded the highest honour by the Chilean Government.

It is also significant because it is rare that arms companies are called to face the courts as to the nature and legality of their business. In August, 2014, nine Palestine activists shut down a subsidiary, Elbit, UAV Engines Ltd. in Shenstone, England. Despite being charged with aggravated trespass, the Crown Prosecution Service dropped the case. It is widely believed that this was due to external pressure to avoid the arms companies being called upon to speak to the nature and legalities of their business.

According to their own trade regulations, the UK is not allowed to sell arms to countries that violate international law. Concerning arms sales, criterion six of the Consolidated EU and National Export Licensing Criteria compels the British government to take into account the buyer’s respect for international law. The United Nations mandated Goldstone Report, investigating the conduct of the belligerents during ‘Operation Cast Lead’, contained damning evidence of Israel’s violations of international law.

In a Ministerial Statement on 21 April 2009, then Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary David Miliband admitted that Israeli equipment used in Gaza in the 2008-9 conflict “almost certainly” contained UK-supplied components. One of the ways the UK government circumnavigates its own trade restrictions on arms is by selling components of weapons to be assembled into deadly weapons in other countries.

It is believed that the CPS dropped the Shenstone case is because activists were arrested for aggravated trespass, a charge which is based on the disruption of “lawful activity”. Had the case gone to trial, the nature legality of UAV Engines’s business would have been put under the microscope in a court of law. Something the British Government has a clear interest in preventing.

In the case of the Thales Ten, activists could not probe the legality of Thales business. The alleged crime was the breach of the peace (which does not exist in England): the only requirement for a conviction is the probability that fear and alarm could be caused to an individual, or that a serious community disturbance is likely. Delving into the legality of Thales business was deemed irrelevant to the case. However, activists were able to establish a clear link in court between Thales, Elbit Systems and the MOD, and also drone components manufactured in Scotland, and alleged war crimes in Gaza.

After the conclusion of the case, Glasgow Palestine Action vowed to keep up the pressure on Thales and other arms manufacturers in Scotland. A member of the group, Frida Grey said:

“Today was a major victory for Palestine activism in Scotland. We hauled Thales into court. We made them admit that they manufacture components of drones on the Clyde, and we confronted them with the devastating consequences of their business, in Gaza, and all over the world. There has never been a better time for us to push for an arms embargo on Israel, and boycott, divestment and sanctions against all companies which seek to profit from the devastation meted out on the people of Palestine.”

After the last Gaza war, Scottish Minister for External Affairs, Humza Yousaf, called on an arms embargo on Israel:

“The Scottish Government has demonstrated that we cannot stand idly by while innocent civilians are being killed. I am today, on behalf of the Scottish Government, calling for an immediate suspension of arms sales to Israel.”

The arms industry in Israel and its connection to Western economies is a major driver and sustaining force in the occupation, colonial and apartheid conditions in Palestine. The question for activists in Scotland (and across the UK) is given the Scottish Government’s stance regarding an arms embargo on Israel, is how can this be progressively exploited? Under the Scotland Act, trade is devolved to Westminster, however, with the political climate so charged for change, what more can be achieved towards justice for Palestine?

* The Thales Ten are members of Glasgow Palestine Action, a women, queer and trans*-led group, organizing and taking action against Israeli apartheid through boycott, divestment, sanctions, and other solidarity work.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9994819760322571}",neutral,0.9994819760322571,0

LU and Thales finalise contract for sub-surface railway resignalling - Rail Technology Magazine,"Mon, 03 Aug 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJhaWx0ZWNobm9sb2d5bWFnYXppbmUuY29tL1JhaWwtTmV3cy9sdS1hbmQtdGhhbGVzLWZpbmFsaXNlLWNvbnRyYWN0LWZvci1zdWItc3VyZmFjZS1yYWlsd2F5LXJlc2lnbmFsbGluZ9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LU and Thales finalise contract for sub-surface railway resignalling

Transport for London has finally hammered out the details of the contract to resignal London Underground’s four subsurface lines, 15 months after pre-selecting Thales to do the work.

Bombardier won the original contract in June 2011, but it and London Underground (LU) made the decision “mutually” to re-let it at the end of 2013

Thales was the obvious replacement, having been the contractor to deliver the (delayed) Jubilee Line resignalling and the (much more successful) Northern Line resignalling too, using its SelTrac CBTC (communications-based train control) system. It was the only company to submit a tender.

The £760m contract with Thales is just one element of the £5.41bn modernisation programme for the modernisation of the Circle, District, Metropolitan and Hammersmith & City lines, which also includes the new fleet of 191 S Stock trains and other improvements that have already been delivered. That overall estimate of £5.41bn is a reduction of £131m on the last forecast, announced in March, though still higher than the original £4.26bn.

RTM reported in June that some of the timetable changes associated with the resignalling of the SSR lines will not happen until the end of 2023, even later than originally thought (though the main benefits will be felt by 2022).

When the Bombardier contract was originally scrapped, there was still an insistence that the old 2018 deadline was feasible – though few industry commentators thought this likely.

TfL board papers recently called SSR resignalling “London Underground’s top priority” and says it will “provide a crucial contribution to the increased capacity of London’s transport network”. The current signalling system “belongs in a museum”, it said.

TfL says the contract will create or sustain 1,100 jobs and 60 apprenticeships, boost capacity by an average of a third across the four lines, and cut journey times.

Nick Brown, managing director of London Underground, said: “Having successfully modernised three of the most heavily used lines on our network, we are ready to begin work to bring the next four lines into the modern era. This will transform the journeys of millions of our customers, significantly increasing service reliability and frequency.

“We have a very clear delivery plan and timetable for the work and, as we have done with the modernisation of the Northern line, we will keep London moving and growing as we do it. In parallel, we will continue to deliver a better, more reliable service every day which builds on the work over recent years to reduce delays to their lowest ever level.”

Patrice Caine, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Thales said: “We are delighted to have been selected by Transport for London and to continue to bring our global expertise in the field of transportation systems to the London Underground. Our technology is in operation on over 80 metro lines in 40 of the world’s largest cities, including New York, Dubai, Shanghai and Hong Kong.

“If the Jubilee and Northern lines’ success is any indicator, future travellers on the Circle, District, Metropolitan and Hammersmith & City lines will experience; faster journeys, reduced over-crowding and increased service reliability. Once completed, 60% of the London Underground will have been modernised using Thales signalling technology.”

RTM recently interviewed the key players in the Jubilee and Northern Line resignalling (JNUP), including London Underground head of automatic train control Andy Bourne; LU’s then programme director of capacity upgrades, Stuart Harvey; Thales programme director Andy Bell; and Thales chief engineer for the upgrade, Andrew Hunter.

They said there are obvious benefits to having a close relationship, with a shared history between Thales and TfL (before JNUP, there was the implementation of SelTrac on the Docklands Light Railway in the mid-1990s, and the Connect radio communications contract, a 20-year PFI that runs until 2019, for example). But they acknowledged the dangers in becoming too reliant on one supplier. Bourne said: “We’re governed by EU procurement rules, so we can’t just award contracts to one supplier, however much we like them. Thales has a good product, but it doesn’t mean it will necessarily always be the best product around. We are committed to continuing to look to the market to come up with innovative solutions.

“Having said that, we recognise that we are in a situation where Thales is a very important supplier. That means we have to deal with them on a much more strategic level.”

That included, he said, bringing all the Thales-facing contracts and workstreams within LU together in one place, to find economies of scale and ensure strategic co-ordination.

Bell said: “It’s particularly pleasing that our good delivery track record and the relationship we’ve built up with LU on Northern Line has hopefully stood us in good stead for future contracts – SSR and so on. We plan to take the team that has successfully delivered Northern and move them across to SSR.”

Work is expected to begin later this year, and once completed, there will be trains every two minutes across much of this part of the network in central London.

Thales has received a contract from the Australian Department of Defence to supply F90 assault rifles to the Australian Defence Force (ADF).

Under the terms of A$100m ($73.6m) contract, the company will supply 30,000 F90 rifles and 2,500 SL40 grenade launchers, as well as spare parts and various ancillaries.

Two versions of the rifle will be delivered, including a standard rifle with a 20in barrel, and a carbine with a 16in barrel.

Thales Australia Armaments vice-president Kevin Wall said: “Our soldiers deserve the best possible equipment and the F90 delivers on all counts.

“Enhancing the Austeyr is the most cost-effective way to deliver a capability upgrade, and we’ve worked closely with defence and army units to design, test and manufacture this world-class weapon.

“The F90 is born from over 100 years of engineering and manufacturing expertise at Lithgow, and this is the latest chapter in Lithgow Arms’ long contribution to Australian military operations.”

Manufacturing work under the contract is scheduled to be carried out at the company’s facility in Lithgow, regional New South Wales.

Deliveries to the ADF are set to commence in the next few weeks and will take place over six years.

In ADF service, the rifle will be known as the Enhanced F88 (EF88), marking a significant enhancement of the original Austeyr F88, a modified version of the Steyr AUG used by the service since 1988.

The EF88 rifle will be equipped with an enhanced day sight, foregrip and a grenade launcher attachment for grenadiers, and is scheduled to be issued more broadly to ADF from 2016 as part of the rollout of LAND 125 Phase 3C – Soldier Enhancement Version 2-Lethality project.

Thales is currently exploring export opportunities for the F90 in various markets worldwide.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998314380645752}",neutral,0.9998314380645752,0
Thales lands £760m Tube signalling deal - Construction Enquirer,"Tue, 04 Aug 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbnN0cnVjdGlvbmVucXVpcmVyLmNvbS8yMDE1LzA4LzA0L3RoYWxlcy1sYW5kcy03NjBtLXR1YmUtc2lnbmFsbGluZy1kZWFsL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Transport for London has awarded a £760m contract to upgrade signalling and train control system on the next four London Underground lines to transportation systems provider Thales.

The project was first awarded to Bombardier in June 2011 for £354m. But Bombardier withdrew from the deal two and half years later, after admitting that the task of fitting new signals to some of the oldest lines on the network was too complex.

Thales will now deliver the programme to bring faster, more frequent and more reliable journeys for passengers on Circle, District, Metropolitan and Hammersmith & City lines.

As a result, up to 1,100 jobs and 60 apprenticeships will be sustained or created, both in London and across the UK.

Work will begin later this year and the main benefits will be delivered by 2022, when the frequency of trains running during peak periods will increase to 32 trains per hour in central London – a train every two minutes.

Nick Brown, Managing Director of London Underground, said: “Having successfully modernised three of the most heavily used lines on our network, we are ready to begin work to bring the next four lines into the modern era.

“We have a very clear delivery plan and timetable for the work and, as we have done with the modernisation of the Northern line, we will keep London moving and growing as we do it.”","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.8331537246704102}",positive,0.8331537246704102,1

Gemalto to implement new identification security system in Cameroon - Business in Cameroon,"Mon, 10 Aug 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luY2FtZXJvb24uY29tL3B1YmxpYy1tYW5hZ2VtZW50LzEwMDgtNTU2My1nZW1hbHRvLXRvLWltcGxlbWVudC1uZXctaWRlbnRpZmljYXRpb24tc2VjdXJpdHktc3lzdGVtLWluLWNhbWVyb29u0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"(Business in Cameroon) - Gemalto, French firm specialized in the establishment of security systems and also the leading manufacturer of SIM cards across the globe, signed on 31 of July 2015 a deal with General Delegate for National Security, Martin Mbarga Nguélé, to install a new identification security system in Cameroon.

The new system entails the production of more secured and non-falsifiable documents in the form of national ID cards, resident permits, refugee ID cards, professional cards of General Delegation for National Security staff and cards for retired personnel of the same institution with the possibility of extending to other administrations.

From this, it is deduced that scope of activities undertaken by the newly appointed French company is broader than that of the previous contracted firm, Thales Security. Indeed, Thales, for 10 years had been in charge of producing secure ID cards and resident permits.

The termination of contract with Thales and the signing of the agreement with Germalto follow multiple complaints addressed to previous ID cards manufacturer, mainly in relation to corruption and fraud practices, it has been blamed for.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999045133590698}",neutral,0.9999045133590698,0
