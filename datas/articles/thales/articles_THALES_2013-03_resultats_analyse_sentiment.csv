Thales Alenia Space Seeks Wider Market for Iridium Bus - SpaceNews,"Wed, 20 Mar 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS90aGFsZXMtYWxlbmlhLXNwYWNlLXNlZWtzLXdpZGVyLW1hcmtldC1mb3ItaXJpZGl1bS1idXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"WASHINGTON — Thales Alenia Space is looking for a wider market for the satellite platform it has developed for the Iridium Next low-orbiting mobile communications satellites, with the first intended customer being the French Defense Ministry for an electronics-intelligence satellite, Thales Alenia Space officials said March 20.

In a briefing here during the Satellite 2013 conference, company officials said they are making a joint proposal with Astrium Satellites to French defense forces for the Ceres satellite, which is the only major military space program on the horizon in France.

French government authorities have yet to determine a military program law and related budget for 2014 and the following years. A white paper on proposed military spending priorities is expected to be released in the coming weeks by the current French administration, which arrived in office in mid-2012.

Thales Alenia Space Chief Executive Jean-Loic Galle said his company and Astrium have agreed on a division of authority under which Thales Alenia Space will provide its EliteBus, and the Ceres electronics-intelligence payload, with Astrium Satellites handling the satellite’s integration.

EliteBus is the platform being used by Thales Alenia Space as prime contractor for the 81-satellite Iridium Next constellation. The first two 800-kilogram Iridium Next satellites are scheduled for launch in February 2015.

Galle said the Iridium production line has given the company the opportunity to offer exceptionally low prices for satellites using the same platform, or bus, but for different applications. Ceres is one example, but there are multiple other applications in low and medium Earth orbit for the platform.

EliteBus weighs up to 435 kilograms, not including fuel, with a payload that can weigh up to 500 kilograms. There are 2 kilowatts of on-board power.

Galle said the Iridium program is going so well that the manufacturer and the owner, Iridium Communications of McLean, Va., have agreed to move up the inaugural launch of two satellites by about two months, to February 2015.

Thales Alenia Space, which is majority-owned by defense electronics manufacturer Thales Group of France and minority-owned by Italian aerospace giant Finmeccanica, is awaiting the Italian government’s decision on a second-generation Cosmo-SkyMed radar Earth observation satellite system.

The contract, to be valued at more than 400 million euros, had been expected in late 2012 but fell victim to the Italian elections and, more importantly, the company’s aggravated public-finance crisis.

Luigi Pasquali, Thales Alenia Space’s deputy chief executive and the head of the company’s Italian division, said the Cosmo-SkyMed contract is now expected in the coming weeks, and will be for two satellites to start.

Globalstar

Thales Alenia Space is also hoping for a final six-satellite contract from mobile satellite services provider Globalstar of Covington, La., now that 24 second-generation Globalstar satellites are in orbit.

Relations between Globalstar and Thales Alenia Space have been fraught, mainly because of Globalstar’s difficult financial position. Globalstar still owes Thales Alenia Space some $50 million in contract termination fees following an arbitration procedure triggered by Globalstar.

Globalstar and Thales Alenia Space officials in the past have said their engineering studies have concluded that the mobile satellite services operator does not need to replicate the 48-satellite configuration of its first-generation system. Instead, they have said a 30-satellite architecture will offer the hoped-for coverage and capacity.

Galle said he was optimistic that Globalstar and the French export-credit agency, Coface, which provided guarantees for Globalstar’s second-generation constellation financing, would conclude an agreement permitting Globalstar to order six final spacecraft.

But in a March 20 panel discussion here during the Satellite 2013 conference, Globalstar Chief Executive Jay Monroe said Globalstar may not need the six more satellites. Instead, he said, the company’s planned upgrade of its ground network could be conducted so that only 24 satellites are needed.

Globalstar has been delaying payments to its ground-network suppliers, Hughes and Ericsson, even as it seeks to postpone a Coface-ordered loan repayment schedule, which starts in June.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999982118606567}",neutral,0.9999982118606567,0
"Boeing, Thales, and GS Yuasa rework 787 power systems - Military & Aerospace Electronics","Sat, 16 Mar 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pbGl0YXJ5YWVyb3NwYWNlLmNvbS9jb21tZXJjaWFsLWFlcm9zcGFjZS9hcnRpY2xlLzE0MjI2ODI3L2JvZWluZy10aGFsZXMtYW5kLWdzLXl1YXNhLXJld29yay03ODctcG93ZXItc3lzdGVtc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Four new or revised tests have been added to screen cell production, which now includes 10 distinct tests. Each cell will go through more rigorous testing in the month following its manufacture, including a 14-day test during which readings of discharge rates are being taken every hour. This new procedure started in early February and the first cells through the process are already complete. More than a dozen production acceptance tests must be completed for each battery.

Boeing, Thales, and GS Yuasa have also narrowed the acceptable level of charge for the battery, lowering the highest charge allowed and raising the lower level allowed for discharge. Two pieces of equipment in the battery system, the battery monitoring unit, and the charger are being redesigned to the narrower definition. The battery charger will also be adapted to soften the charging cycle to put less stress on the battery during charging.

Changes inside the battery will help to reduce the chances of a battery fault developing and help to further isolate any fault that does occur. To better insulate each of the cells in the battery from one another and from the battery box, two kinds of insulation will be added. An electrical insulator is being wrapped around each battery cell to electrically isolate cells from each other and from the battery case, even in the event of a failure. Electrical and thermal insulation installed above, below, and between the cells will help keep the heat of the cells from impacting each other.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9955384135246277}",neutral,0.9955384135246277,0
"Thales Deutchland, Atlas Elektronik to Modernize Three F-124 Frigates for the German Navy - Defense Update","Mon, 11 Mar 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL2RlZmVuc2UtdXBkYXRlLmNvbS8yMDEzMDMxMV90aGFsZXMtZGV1dGNobGFuZC1hdGxhcy1lbGVrdHJvbmlrLXRvLW1vZGVybml6ZS10aHJlZS1mLTEyNC1mcmlnYXRlcy1mb3ItdGhlLWdlcm1hbi1uYXZ5Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Atlas Elektronik and Thales Deutschland have jointly been commissioned to modernize the combat system of the German Class F124 frigates. The order comprises the three frigates “Sachsen”, “Hamburg” and “Hessen” as well as the Test and Training Centre (EZ/AZ) in Wilhelmshaven and the Reference Maintainer and Training Site (RMTS) in Den Helder. The work is to be organized and managed in such a way that the vessels will not need to be taken out of service. The modernization is scheduled to be completed in 2017.

The program will be managed under the “HW Regeneration CDS F124” consortium, formed by the two companies. Under the program the hardware of the Combat Direction System (CDS) will be refurbished, and receive software updates.

The activities include replacement of the outdated console processors, the data recording modules, and various network modules using components of the latest generation. Supportability of CDS components that are not regenerated yet critical for the system’s realtime response will, however, be ensured. It is expected that the new hardware will provide sufficient capacity for the integration of new subsystems and future CDS functionalities. The modernization will employ as much commercial off the shelf hardware and software modules as possible. Both companies were involved in the construction and equipment development of these vessels.

Volker Paltzo, Managing Director of Atlas Elektronik and Peter Obermark, CEO of Thales Deutschland recently signed the contract at the Federal Office of Bundeswehr Equipment, Information Technology and In-Service Support (BAAINBw) in Koblenz.

The F124 Sachsen class is Germany’s latest class of air-defense frigates. Although designated as frigates, they are in capability and size comparable to destroyers. The frigate incorporates the advanced multifunction radar APAR and SMART-L long-range radar, offering effective air and missile defense capability with the SM-2 Block IIIA missiles on board.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999994158744812}",neutral,0.999994158744812,0
Integrating European Radars with AEGIS/SM-3 Missile Defenses - Defense Update,"Mon, 11 Mar 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vZGVmZW5zZS11cGRhdGUuY29tLzIwMTMwMzExX2ludGVncmF0aW5nLWV1cm9wZWFuLXJhZGFycy13aXRoLWFlZ2lzc20tMy1taXNzaWxlLWRlZmVuc2VzLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Joint US and European testing of command, control, communications and radar systems are underway to demonstrate the feasibility of integration of European radars and command and control systems into a future missile defense systems based on the planned European Phased Adaptive Approach (EPAA) utilizing the several AEGIS destroyers or cruisers to be based in Spain, land-based SM-3 interceptors to be stationed in Romania and Poland, along with SPY-2 radars sites. These assets are to be complemented by a number of European deployed radar sites.

In recent weeks tests were carried out to evaluate such integration. Last week Raytheon reported about a recent trial that showed that a radar used by Dutch, German and Danish navies could provide target information to the interceptor. The current radar installed on the Dutch frigates is incompatible with the AEGIS/SM-3 link operating over S-band. The demonstration which took place at the Den Helder military test range validated a datalink that allows the missile to receive information from the Thales sensor while retaining the ability to communicate with Aegis combat ships used by the U.S. Navy. Generally, The Dutch, German and Danish navies datalinks are operating on X bands, while Norway, Spain and the U.S. operate AEGIS frigates communicating with their interceptors over the S band. To avoid unique configurations of missiles, Raytheon has developed a dual-band datalink which enables the same missile to communicate in both bands. This dual-band datalink was first tested in 2011.

In 2009, a joint U.S.-Netherlands study concluded SM-3 could be integrated with the Signaal Multibeam Acquisition Radar for Tracking-L (SMART-L) and Advanced Phased Array Radar (APAR) sensor suites, providing non-AEGIS ships a viable missile defense capability. 20 such radars (or their derivatives) are already deployed with frigates and destroyers of six NATO navies, including four DutchDe Zeven Provinciën class frigates, three German Sacsen frigates and three Danish Navy Iver Huitfeldt class frigates.

Six British Type 45 destroyers and four Horizon class frigates of the French and Italian navies are also employing similar radar technology from Thales. To further tighten such integration, the Royal Navy is planning to deploy one of its Type-45 destroyers to take part in a missile interception test to be conducted under the US Missile Defense Agency plan. Another recent test demonstrated datalink connectivity between a French-Italian SAMP/T missile defense unit and the NATO Ballistic Missile Defense Operations Center (BMDOC), using NATO standard Link 16 datalink.

On the recent test, Raytheon’s company-funded the development of the dual-band datalink which would play a key role in enabling more European ships to employ the full range of missiles within the Standard Missile family, including the Standard Missile-3. “Right now, few of Europe’s naval ships can participate in the ‘upper tier’ ballistic missile defense of NATO countries because their radars cannot communicate with the SM-3,” Wes Kremer, vice president of Air and Missile Defense Systems for Raytheon Missile Systems explained. “A common datalink that operates with both X- and S-band radars is a very affordable, near-term solution that allows Europe to take advantage of proven technologies available today.”

Using both sending and receiving signals, the test validated the ability of the dual-band datalink to communicate with the APAR X-band radar, which is part of a radar suite used by the Danish, Dutch and German navies. Integrating a dual-band datalink into any of the Standard Missiles is a ‘drop in’ replacement for the current hardware. “The dual-band datalink has significant implications for our U.S. Navy customers as well, because it allows them to save money by eliminating the need to maintain two separate inventories of Standard Missiles for the Zumwalt (X-band) and Aegis (S-band) ship classes,” said Kremer.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999943971633911}",neutral,0.9999943971633911,0
Turkmenbashi Airport income surges due to transit flights - AzerNews.Az,"Thu, 28 Mar 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiKWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF6ZXJuZXdzLmF6L3JlZ2lvbi81MTM2NS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The number of foreign aircraft landing for technical reasons at the international airport of Turkmenbashi almost doubled during the last year, Neutral Turkmenistan newspaper wrote on Thursday.

According to a decision of the President of Turkmenistan, over a year ago world airlines were offered an opportunity to refuel at discounted prices.

'Thanks to this far-sighted policy, currency revenue from the service of transit flights increased by 6.5 times', the article says.

Turkmenbashi Airport was created according to highest standards. Its new 3500-metres long and 60-metres wide runway allows it to serve all types of aircraft.

Special equipment from SIEMENS and Thales provide continuous monitoring not only of scheduled airliners, but also of transit flight in the airspace of the coastal region. A centralised fuelling station can simultaneously fuel eight aircraft.

The Neutral Turkmenistan newspaper notes that a favourable geographical location at the crossroads of maritime, air, rail and automobile routes, linking Europe, Caucasus and Central Asia should play a positive role in the development of air transport in the intensively developing seaside region.

In order to realise this potential, it is planned to start Ashgabat-Moscow-Astrakhan-Ashgabat, Ashgabat-Istanbul and other international flights via Turkmenbashi in the near future.

This international airport was commissioned in 2010. The project worth 125 million euros was implemented by the Turkish multi-sectorial company Polimex, which won the tender.

The project was funded by Turkmenistan's state budget. The capacity of the facility is about six aircraft per hour and 8000 passengers. The airport receives aircraft with a take-off weight of about 400 tons.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.643013060092926}",neutral,0.643013060092926,0
£226 million training facilities announced for new RAF transport planes - GOV.UK,"Mon, 04 Mar 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdvdi51ay9nb3Zlcm5tZW50L25ld3MvMzAwLW1pbGxpb24tdHJhaW5pbmctZmFjaWxpdGllcy1hbm5vdW5jZWQtZm9yLW5ldy1yYWYtdHJhbnNwb3J0LXBsYW5lc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Ministry of Defence is investing £226 million in a specialist training school at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire where the fleet of transport aircraft will be based.

It will house 2 full flight simulators to train RAF pilots, a specialist workstation to train loadmasters, a cockpit simulator to train engineers and a suite of computer-based training equipment.

The facility will allow all personnel who operate, support and maintain the aircraft to train in a replica environment, giving them the best and safest learning experience available.

The 18-year deal with A400M Training Services Ltd - a joint venture between Airbus Military and Thales Training and Simulation Ltd - will create and secure up to 300 long-term jobs, principally at RAF Brize Norton, but also at Airbus Military and at Thales UK’s facility in Crawley, West Sussex, where the simulators are being built.

The MOD is buying 22 A400M Atlas transport aircraft to replace the RAF’s fleet of C-130 Hercules, with the first aircraft entering service in late 2014.

Able to carry twice as much as the Hercules, the A400M Atlas can transport 32 tonnes of cargo over a range of 4,500 kilometres, providing unprecedented capability to support the UK Armed Forces.

The MOD is also able to announce today that £80 million is being spent on defensive aids for the A400M Atlas.

The contract is for the development, manufacture and installation of the modifications required to the aircraft so that it can operate the large aircraft infrared countermeasures defensive aids system when flying in hostile environments.

Flight Lieutenant Chris Aston, a future A400M Atlas pilot, said:

The A400M Atlas programme is incredibly exciting and one I’m delighted to be involved in. These facilities will give both aircrew and ground crew a unique training experience.

Having access to flight simulators, a loadmaster workstation trainer and cockpit maintenance operations simulator will ensure that we can get the most out of the aircraft.

On a recent visit to RAF Brize Norton to inspect an Atlas aircraft, Minister for Defence Equipment, Support and Technology Philip Dunne said:

Our air and ground crews have always been some of the best trained in the world and the facility at RAF Brize Norton cements that position for the RAF’s latest transport aircraft fleet.

The blend of real and synthetic training will ensure crews can be ‘hands on’ with the aircraft throughout their training.

The defensive aid suites will provide pilot and crew with an essential defensive capability and peace of mind when operating in hostile environments. Protecting our crews and the aircraft is paramount.

Alongside the C-17 Globemaster and the new Voyager aircraft now entering service with the RAF, the A400M Atlas fleet will give the RAF the ability to move people and equipment rapidly around the globe for military and humanitarian operations for decades to come.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.995578944683075}",neutral,0.995578944683075,0
