Thales wins Network Rail Traffic Management System contracts - Railway Gazette,"Mon, 02 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJhaWx3YXlnYXpldHRlLmNvbS9pbmZyYXN0cnVjdHVyZS90aGFsZXMtd2lucy1uZXR3b3JrLXJhaWwtdHJhZmZpYy1tYW5hZ2VtZW50LXN5c3RlbS1jb250cmFjdHMvMzk1NjUuYXJ0aWNsZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"UK: Infrastructure manager Network Rail has formally confirmed Thales UK as the winner of the first two contracts for the deployment of the national Traffic Management System.

Network Rail is planning to consolidate control of Great Britain’s rail network from more than 800 signalboxes into 12 rail operating centres over the next 15-30 years, and believes this will save up to £250m/year. It had selected Thales, the Signalling Solutions Ltd joint venture of Alstom Transport and Balfour Beatty Rail and Hitachi Rail Europe to develop prototype TMS offices based on their existing systems for testing.

Under the contracts worth a total of £28∙8m which were announced on May 29, Thales is to install its ARAMIS Traffic Management System at two Regional Operating Centres in Romford and Cardiff by December 2015. Thales said ARAMIS is already used to control more than 60 000 trains/day in 11 countries with ‘complex mixed traffic networks similar to the UK’.

Under a separate £3∙4m contract, SSL will develop, supply and support the interface between TMS and external systems.

Network Rail said contracts for the national roll-out of TMS will be the subject of separate competitions which will involve ‘all current traffic management framework holders’.

UK MoD awards Thales £48m FASGW(L) contract - UK Defence Journal,"Tue, 17 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vdWtkZWZlbmNlam91cm5hbC5vcmcudWsvdWstbW9kLWF3YXJkcy10aGFsZXMtNDhtLWZhc2d3bC1jb250cmFjdC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Philip Dunne, the UK’s Minister of Defence Equipment, Support and Technology has announced that a contract worth £48 million for the demonstration and manufacture of the Future Anti Surface Guided Weapon (Light) system (FASGW-L) has been awarded to Thales.

The contract reportedly covers development, qualification and eventual integration of the missile system for the Agusta Westland AW159 Wildcat helicopter.

The announcement was made during a visit to Thales’s Belfast, where both Lightweight Multi-role Missiles (LMM) and the FASGW equipment will be manufactured. THE contract is expected to sustain up to 60 jobs at the site.

Back in 2011, Thales received an initial production contract for LMM, to equip the UK’s next-generation AW159 Wildcat naval helicopters as their “Future Anti-Surface Guided Weapon – Light” (FASGW-L). The missile will fit niche somewhere below the popular Lockheed Martin AGM-114 Hellfire missile.

The missile will be a 13 kg/28 pound weapon, carrying a laser beam-riding missile with a range of up to 8 km/4.3 miles.

Victor Chavez, CEO of Thales UK, said:

“Some 450 of Thales’s 7,500 UK workforce are based at the Belfast site and we are proud that the company is an important source of high-technology and highly-skilled employment in the region. We are delighted with this award of the FASGW(L) contract as it will deliver a leading-edge weapons capability to the Royal Navy to defeat conventional and asymmetric threats.

Thales’s LMM is the first lightweight missile in the world to be designed to integrate onto tactical air, land and naval platforms and there is much global interest in the capabilities it can deliver. This contract award will provide a great boost for our overseas prospects, as it shows the trust that MoD has placed in Thales to deliver this new advanced weapon system.”"
Missile firm Thales lands £48m deal to help Royal Navy fight piracy - Belfast Telegraph,"Mon, 16 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJlbGZhc3R0ZWxlZ3JhcGguY28udWsvYnVzaW5lc3MvbWlzc2lsZS1maXJtLXRoYWxlcy1sYW5kcy00OG0tZGVhbC10by1oZWxwLXJveWFsLW5hdnktZmlnaHQtcGlyYWN5LzMwMzU4Mjg2Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Agusta Westland AW159 Wildcat Maritime Attack helicopters will be fitted with the new equipment

Equipment manufactured as part of a £48m deal for a Belfast arms firm will help the Royal Navy fight piracy on the high seas.

The Ministry of Defence has announced that Thales' Future Anti-Surface Guided Weapons Light programme will be fitted to the Navy's new Agusta Westland AW159 Wildcat Maritime Attack helicopters, which will be carried on frigates.

The system is designed to use the Thales Lightweight Multirole Missile (LMM), a precision strike missile designed to be fired from planes, helicopters, trucks, boats and even drones.

The system will be deployed by the Royal Navy and is aimed at combating threats from small ships and fast inshore attack craft.

French-owned Thales employs 450 people in Northern Ireland and 60 staff will work on the new contract.

David Beatty, managing director of the Thales plant in Castlereagh, spoke to the Belfast Telegraph on his way to show off some of the Northern Ireland-made equipment at the Eurosatory defence and security exhibition in Paris.

He said the new order, which was first mooted back in 2009, bodes well for future sales because of the UK's place in the global defence spending tables, and added that there will be support work opportunities for Belfast staff over the lifetime of the weapons.

Mr Beatty added that this was the first such application for the firm's products and that Thales was targeting similar business with other governments.

""This is the biggest order placed by the MoD for quite a number of years, but apart from the value, the contract gets us into another sector,"" said Mr Beatty.

""Our traditional sector is air defence and this is a new area for us, working on helicopters for naval applications.

""This weapons system will be taking on terrorists and insurgents, those who are regarded as an 'asymmetric threat'.

""The main targets would be pirates on the high seas who are posing a serious threat and causing serious problems.

""The missiles themselves are cleverly designed for precision strikes with low collateral damage.

""They are intended to focus very specifically on a target without impacting on civilians.""

Mr Beatty said that as the helicopters could be in use to 2040 and beyond, the scope for follow-up work for Belfast workers was huge."
Mumbai opens first metro line - International Railway Journal,"Mon, 09 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJhaWxqb3VybmFsLmNvbS9wYXNzZW5nZXIvbWV0cm9zL211bWJhaS1vcGVucy1maXJzdC1tZXRyby1saW5lL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Built at a cost of Rs 45bn ($US 762.7m), Line 1 is being implemented by Mumbai Metro One, a consortium of Mumbai Metropolitan Regional Development Authority (MMRDA), Anil Ambani-led Reliance Energy and Veolia Transport.

The 12-station line is expected to carry 1.1 million passengers per day – approximately 14% of the 7.5 million daily commuters which use Mumbai's suburban network– and offers an end-to-end journey time of 20 minutes compared with 1h 30min by road.

CSR Nanjing has supplied 16 trains for the line which can accommodate around 1500 passengers and operate at 3min 30s headways between 05.00 and 00.00. Siemens supplied signalling and Thales provided the line's telecommunications system. ABB supplied the 25kV ac power system as well as Scada and E&M systems.

The launch of the service is considered direct fallout of the recent change in national government, with the BJP-led coalition's new railways minister, Mr D V Sadanand Gowda, promptly giving clearances on pending safety and rolling stock certification to finally begin commercial operations three years later than originally envisaged.

With the line preparing to open, controversy emerged over the fare structure, which is yet to be resolved. The MMRDA – which comes under the Congress-led Maharashtra government – has continued to oppose moves by Reliance Energy to raise fares from the Rs 9-13 level outlined in the concession agreement. Mumbai Metro One has set a promotional fare of Rs 10 for the first month of the service and Chavan, who threatened to boycott the inauguration over the issue, says that the matter is now in court.

Opening of the metro line comes after the city inaugurated India's first monorail between suburban Chembur and Wadala on February 1. Mumbai also plans to develop the Charkop - Bandra – Mankhurd Line 2 and Line 3 from Santa Cruz to Bandra, City Centre and Cuffe Parade, although these projects, like Line 1, have suffered delays. Line 2 is currently entering a re-tendering process, while Line 3 is now not expected to be completed until 2020."
