Thales Papagiannakopoulos - Distinguished scientist in the fight against cancer - ellines.com,"Thu, 02 Feb 2017 02:53:49 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsbGluZXMuY29tL2VuL2FjaGlldmVtZW50cy8zMTIyMS1kaXN0aW5ndWlzaGVkLXNjaWVudGlzdC1pbi10aGUtZmlnaHQtYWdhaW5zdC1jYW5jZXIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales Papagiannakopoulos is an Assistant Professor of Biology at the New York University School of Medicine and a PostDoc at Koch Institute at MIT. The research team in which he participates at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and other institutions have discovered a sign of the early development of pancreatic cancer, an upsurge in certain amino acids that occurs before the disease is diagnosed and symptoms appear. Thales is a biologist at the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research of MIT.

The research was published by the journal Nature Medicine and Thales was honored for his contribution by the Academy of Athens, when they presented him with a special prize on December 22, 2015. Although the increase isn’t large enough to be the basis of a new test for early detection of the disease, the findings will help researchers better understand how pancreatic cancer affects the rest of the body, particularly how it can trigger the sometimes deadly muscle-wasting disease known as cachexia.

The researchers used blood samples collected years earlier from 1,500 people participating in large health-tracking studies. They analyzed the samples for more than 100 different metabolites – substances produced by the metabolic process – and compared the results from participants who had gone on to develop pancreatic cancer and those who had not.

“We found that higher levels of branched chain amino acids were present in people who went on to develop pancreatic cancer compared to those who did not develop the disease,” Wolpin said. (Branched chain amino acids are one family of amino acids, the building blocks of proteins.) The amount of time that would elapse before those individuals were diagnosed with pancreatic cancer ranged from two to 25 years, although the highest risk was in the several years before diagnosis, the researchers found. “These findings led us to hypothesize that the increase in branched chain amino acids is due to the presence of an early pancreatic tumor,” Wolpin remarked. This theory was confirmed in laboratory experiments performed by Vander Heiden’s group at the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research at MIT. Their experiments showed that mice with newly formed pancreatic tumors had above-normal blood levels of these amino acids.

As far as his curriculum vitae is concerned, Thales got his Bachelor in Science (Molecular Genetics) in the University of Sussex, in 2004, and his Ph.D. In Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology in the University of California in Santa Barbara (2010). He was a summer intern at the Scripps Research Institute and from there he became a Research Assistant at the same institute. He is now a PostDoc at the MIT Tyler Jacks Lab and currently an Assistant Professor in the New York University.

New UAE patrol ship presents a striking profile - Defense News,"Wed, 22 Feb 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS9kaWdpdGFsLXNob3ctZGFpbGllcy9pZGV4LzIwMTcvMDIvMjIvbmV3LXVhZS1wYXRyb2wtc2hpcC1wcmVzZW50cy1hLXN0cmlraW5nLXByb2ZpbGUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates – There is no question what the most unusual craft is here at the NAVDEX portion of the IDEX international Defense Exposition. It's a ship designed by the Dutch firm Damen, built in Romania, systems integration handled by France's Thales, and fitted out and completed in the UAE by Abu Dhabi Shipbuilding.



The brand-new offshore patrol vessel Arialah, delivered Tuesday to the UAE's Critical Infrastructure and Coastal Protection Agency (CICPA), has an incredibly tall, knifelike prow that towers over the pier. The forward edifice is capped by a BAE Bofors 57mm gun that almost fills the deck space around it. Immediately behind is the pilot house, itself topped by a fire control director, other sensors and a tall mast, all crammed in to about the forward one-third of the 67-meter-long hull. Amidships is a Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM) launcher followed by a long helicopter deck flanked by two high speed interceptor craft serviced by cranes.



The high, narrow-bow, superstructure-right-forward configuration is similar to some of Damen's ""sea axe"" designs for commercial ships, including oil field anchor-handling ships, standby and emergency rescue ships and large tugs, but it is unusual in naval and coast guard ships. But the CICPA agency combines military and coast guard functions to protect Abu Dhabi's petroleum industry infrastructure ""from any threats or any actions of violence,"" according to the CICPA web site.



To that end, Arialah is uniquely fitted with systems more common to naval units, such as the Raytheon Mark 49 Mod 2 RAM missile launcher, Thales STIR fire control and Thales Smart-S Mark 2 search radar, two OTO Melara MARLIN 30mm automatic guns and the Rheinmetall MASS Multi Ammunition Softkill System decoy system, all managed by the TACTICOS combat management system.





Other systems include a Mirador electro-optical system and Vigile electronic support measures.

With a crew of 42, the ship also has berthing for up to 35 troops along with a three-person helicopter detachment.

Crewmembers and officials for CICPA, Abu Dhabi Shipbuilding and Daman all declined to speak for the record about the Arialah, but a number of details were revealed in discussions on board and from earlier press releases.

With a beam of 11 meters and draft of 5.4 meters, the ship, according to some of those who’ve sailed in her, is remarkably steady, aided by active fin stabilizers on the chined hull with deep-V bottom.

Arialah is powered by four MTU diesels, each connected directly to its own fixed-pitch propeller. Three Caterpillar diesel generators provide shipboard power. Twin rudders and two bow thrusters aid close-in navigation. Top speed is more than 20 knots, with endurance about 21 days.

Damen, Abu Dhabi Shipbuilding and CICPA reached an agreement to build the Arialah and one sister ship in December 2013. The hull was built at Daman’s Galati shipyard, and the ship sailed under her own power to Abu Dhabi for final outfitting at ADSB’s Mussafah shipyard.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999936819076538}",neutral,0.9999936819076538,0

“Thales remains enthusiastic about India as it provides enormous opportunities across the markets in which the company operates. We are in discussion with a number of Indian companies to put in place Transfer of Technology, and this air show in itself is an opportunity to network with all key stakeholders. Thales has been present in this country for more than 60 years, started in 1953. Thales’ state-of-the-art equipment and systems for air, ground and naval combat continue to serve the critical needs of all three branches of the Indian armed forces. Going forward, Thales will continue to work towards its overall goal of ‘Make in India and export from India’ by building collaborations with the Indian industry, Ms Pascale Sourisse, Senior Executive Vice President (International Development), Thales, told Deccan Chronicle.

For the Rs 60,000-crore Rafale contract, Thales will supply the active electronically scanned array (AESA) radars, Spectra electronic warfare systems, communication navigation and identification systems (CNI), majority of the cockpit display systems, power generation systems and a logistics support component.

“For the existing Rafale contract we basically would involve Indian companies as sub-contractors and in addition we will have a look at transferring technologies that could lead to manufacturing products in India for potential future Rafale orders,” she added.

She said, “We are in talks with Reliance, our JV partners BEL and SAMTEL, HAL, DRDO and of course the supply chain partners with whom we have worked for five years for the Mirage 2000 mid-life upgrade programme. Our teams are working on potential agreements in order to fulfill our commitments. The air show is very important for us as we had discussions with heads of many Indian companies.”

At Aero India, Thales had some of its high-end capabilities such as rocket systems, air mission systems, communication systems, along with a display of state-of-the-art equipment onboard the Rafale and focused on new innovations such as Stratobus, an autonomous stratospheric airship that could be positioned at an altitude of 20 km over its theatre of operations and perform a variety of missions including surveillance of borders or high-value sites, on land or at sea, security, environmental monitoring and telecommunications, new broadband tactical software-defined radio SYNAPS and C4I systems, Spy’Ranger, a mini surveillance and reconnaissance Unmanned Aerial Vehicle.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.7095450758934021}",neutral,0.7095450758934021,0

Owned and operated by PT Telekomunikasi Indonesia TbK (Telkom Indonesia), the satellite is a replacement to Telkom-3 satellite, which was stranded in an unusable orbit after launch in August 2012.

Telkom-3S is located at an 118° east orbital position and offers high-definition television (HDTV) broadcasting, mobile and internet applications covering Indonesia, Southeast Asia, and parts of Malaysia. The satellite construction and launch operations were completed with an estimated investment between $200 and $250m.

Telkom-3S satellite design and development

Thales Alenia Space was awarded a $199m-worth contract to provide design, testing and in-orbit delivery of the Telkom-3S satellite in February 2014. The scope of the contract also includes providing early-orbit phase (LEOP) and in-orbit testing (IOT) services. The satellite was built in Thales’ facilities located at Toulouse and Cannes in France.

Based on Spacebus 4000B2 platform developed by Thales, the satellite is designed for a lifespan of 15 years. It has a length, height and width of 1.8m, 2.95m and 2.86m respectively, a launch mass of 3,350kg and payload power of 6.4kW.

The satellite was shipped from Cannes to the launch site in Kourou, French Guiana, for performing pre-launch tests and was fuelled for lift-off in February 2017.

Telkom-3S satellite communication capabilities

The Telkom-3S satellite carries 42 transponders, including 24 C-band transponders, eight extended C-band transponders and 10 Ku-band transponders. The C-band transponders offer coverage for Indonesia and south-east Asia.

The extended C-band beams cover Indonesia and parts of Malaysia, while the Ka-band transponders offer dedicated coverage of Indonesia.

The satellite increases Telkom Indonesia’s broadcast capacity and also provides key services for businesses, the interconnection of mobile networks and Internet backbones.

Telkom-3S satellite launch vehicle details

“Telkom-3S is located at an 118° east orbital position and offers high-definition television (HDTV) broadcasting, mobile and internet applications covering Indonesia, Southeast Asia, and parts of Malaysia.”

The Telkom-3S satellite launch operations were managed by Arianespace and the launcher was delivered by Airbus Safran Launchers. The satellite was launched on-board Ariane 5 designated flightVA235 along with SKY Brasil-1. The total mass of the 54.8m-high launcher at lift-off was 780t.

The launch mission from lift-off to satellite separation was completed in 39 minutes and 43 seconds. The rocket lift-off was enabled with the ignition of main stage cryogenic engine and two solid-propellant boosters. The launcher initially climbed vertically for 13 seconds and then rotated towards the east. The fairing protecting the payload was jettisoned after 202 seconds.

The trajectory of the launcher was controlled with the help of two on-board computers fixed in the Ariane 5 vehicle equipment bay (VEB). The computers optimised the trajectory in real-time and minimised propellant consumption after the completion of first part of the flight.

The launch operations of the satellite were carried out from Guiana Space Centre’s launch complex three (ELA 3) located at Kourou, French Guiana.

Ground control station

Kratos Defense and Security Solutions was contracted to provide Kratos’ satID® geolocation system with Kratos ISI to upgrade master control station (MCS) of Telkom in July 2015. The geolocation system supports the existing Telkom satellites Telkom-1 and Telkom-2, as well as the Telkom-3S satellite.

Accenture Launches Hardware-Based Security Solution to Simplify and Enable Blockchain Security for Large-Scale ... - Financial IT,"Wed, 08 Feb 2017 14:57:41 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jaWFsaXQubmV0L25ld3MvYmxvY2tjaGFpbi9hY2NlbnR1cmUtbGF1bmNoZXMtaGFyZHdhcmUtYmFzZWQtc2VjdXJpdHktc29sdXRpb24tc2ltcGxpZnktYW5kLWVuYWJsZS1ibG9ja2NoYWlu0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Accenture Launches Hardware-Based Security Solution to Simplify and Enable Blockchain Security for Large-Scale Enterprise IT Use

Accenture has unveiled a patent-pending solution that simplifies the ability of blockchain technology to integrate with the industrial-grade security systems that support sectors including financial services, healthcare and government. The solution creates a developer-friendly interface between emerging blockchain platforms and widely used hardware security technology. Accenture cooperated with Thales – whose hardware is currently used by most major banks globally to secure records and assets from cybertheft – to develop the solution.

Hardware security modules (HSMs) are crypto-processors that securely generate, protect and store digital keys. Keys stored in the Thales HSM architecture cannot be extracted or used except under a highly controlled protocol. The new solution is based on the widely used nShield HSM developed by Thales and creates a simple path to large-scale commercial use of blockchain technology.

“Blockchain is quickly maturing across industries and is set to profoundly change how businesses operate,” said Simon Whitehouse, senior managing director and head of blockchain technologies at Accenture. “But current applications cannot meet the high security standards of most mission-critical IT infrastructure. That is because the digital keys used to secure and validate messages and transactions historically have proven vulnerable to network attacks. Our solution provides the same kind of physical security that banks have relied on for decades to keep money and transaction records safe from cyberthieves. It will clear a wider path not only for banks but for governments, insurers, healthcare providers and others to do real-world deployments of blockchain technology.”

Currently, blockchain-based systems typically rely on “cyberwallets” to store digital keys for blockchains. But because those keys typically reside on software servers, they can become vulnerable to network breaches of the kind that have occurred on cryptocurrency exchanges in recent years. The solution makes it extremely difficult if not impossible for digital keys to be misappropriated because they are stored in physical isolation from IT networks and are architected with highly sophisticated, deterministic security mechanisms. In addition, the platform need only be installed once, allowing companies to secure each of their blockchain applications using the same solution – regardless of which blockchain software or application they use – versus crafting a code interface for each solution.

Jon Geater, Chief Technology Officer at Thales e-Security said, “The possibilities for blockchain are endless. In the financial sector everything from transactions to contracts and deeds could use a blockchain to legitimize and simplify the settlement process, and industries such as healthcare and federal government also stand to benefit from this technology. However, in order for blockchains to work, we need to believe and trust them, which means every participant must agree and anticipate how they will take part in the chain. Unfortunately innovation and vulnerability very often go hand-in-hand. Accenture has built trust and security into the technology of the chain itself, using Thales HSMs to protect the chain and prevent any nefarious activity. Thales continues to invest in blockchain delivering the ‘root of trust’ to this emerging technology.”

“The opportunity to benefit from blockchain technology within sectors like financial services and healthcare depends on an ability to protect digital keys using conventional standards of security,” said David Treat, managing director, financial services blockchain lead at Accenture. “While there have been bespoke blockchain integrations with HSMs before, this solution offers a simpler and more flexible standard to connect blockchain platforms with the leading HSMs. We are committed to delivering these types of real-world innovations that will serve as the stepping stones to make blockchain technology a reality for large-scale enterprises.”

The solution used Fabric, a Hyperledger technology and can be adapted for other leading blockchain technology platforms. Hyperledger is a global, open source collaborative effort of more than 100 major companies focused on advancing cross-industry blockchain technologies.

Solution highlights

Many security-conscious institutions rely on HSMs to safeguard and manage their digital keys and protect things like ATM machines, mainframe operations, point-of-sale (POS) machines and to verify and sign SWIFT messages – they are used in virtually any application that requires secure, verified digital signatures. While most people have no idea of the role of an HSM in securing sensitive information, it’s a technology used every day. For example, HSMs in a bank’s data center are used to validate your PIN when you withdraw cash from an ATM, or validate the transaction cryptogram when your purchase goods at a merchant POS terminal – in both cases only the HSMs under the bank’s control have access to the correct keys to perform the secure processing. Some of the benefits of an HSM include:","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998843669891357}",neutral,0.9998843669891357,0

This event marks a major milestone for DSNA, the French air navigation service provider (ANSP) and its industrial partner, Thales, the world leader in air traffic management, in their longstanding partnership to develop France’s next generation ATC system. For this operation, Coflight was directly connected to Network Manager Operation Centre (EUROCONTROL)’s data. It allows air traffic controllers to optimise trajectories and thus, deliver optimum performance to airspace users. Coflight uses the most advanced 4D trajectory processing enabling powerful 4-FLIGHT ATC tools. This live trial took place in stand-alone mode to respect the safety conditions validated by the National Supervisory Authority.



Elsa, controller-expert for 4-FLIGHT who handled the system during the live trial, explained with enthusiasm : ”Seeing 4-FLIGHT in operational use for the first time was a high point in my professional career and an insight into what our work will be in the future. It opens up a whole new, promising chapter in our operations!”



The objective of this exercise was to evaluate a first level of system integration, including technical monitoring and its new components. Several night and day live operations will be conducted at the two pilot sites, Reims and Marseille ACCs, in 2017 and 2018 in order to optimise the switchover process and to give operational users the possibility to gain first in-live experience with the new system. The next live trial for 4-FLIGHT / Coflight is scheduled to take place at Marseille ACC on the night of the 15th March 2017.



The 4-FLIGHT system, co-financed by the European Union, is defined by DSNA and developed by Thales. Coflight is defined by DSNA and ENAV, the Italian ANSP, and developed by the Franco-Italian Thales / Leonardo industrial consortium. In 2016, the French air navigation services handled 3 million flights. DSNA, the first European ANSP to have exceeded this threshold, is proud to pursue progress of the 4-FLIGHT programme with Thales in order to meet the challenge of the high increase in air traffic demand in France and Europe.



Jerome Nicolle, Director of the 4-FLIGHT & Coflight programmes group at Thales, commented on this first operational: “It was a great satisfaction to witness the system go live for the very first time. Thales has worked tirelessly to deliver to the DSNA operational personnel an efficient product that meets all Single European Sky requirements”. And Maurice Georges, DSNA’s CEO, concluded : “This first evaluation performed successfully with real traffic is a major step in the safe implementation of our future ATM system. It is also a source of great motivation for all our staff involved in this ambitious programme, whom we all congratulate”.

Carl Whittaker - Thales,"Fri, 10 Feb 2017 21:33:36 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9mci9jYXJlZXJzL3JlbmNvbnRyZXotbm9zLWNvbGxhYm9yYXRldXJzL2Nhcmwtd2hpdHRha2Vy0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"One of my first projects was to deploy certificate generating machines to different sites across the world – my introduction to legacy software which was probably written when I was at school! I had to reverse engineer some of the functionality from a current setup and upgrade the security to future proof the system. Since then, I’ve been part of a team in Cambridge responsible for bringing in an AGILE framework for developing our software. We adopted a scrum approach and I was selected as Scrum Master, which involved acting as a coach for the AGILE process. AGILE has now been rolled out across all Thales projects.

I’ve been working closely with one of our engineering managers to ensure that Thales e-Security continues to lead the way. I recently organised a 24-hour ‘hackathon’. It was open to all and people could work on anything they wanted. There were some brilliant suggestions for innovation methods and I presented them to the Thales UK software executive board, which gave me exposure to some of our most senior engineers. Given how well received the event was across the company, this is probably my biggest achievement so far in my Thales career.

I took part in the Big Bang fair, a large science and engineering exhibition for children. This is one of the many extra-curricular activities on offer at Thales that allow you to experience new things and provide something useful for others. I was part of a committee of graduates given full responsibility of our stand and a budget to spend. I took charge of designing a game for the event, which involved the children navigating a robot around a maze. A number of sites and different businesses were represented on the committee, giving me the chance to meet new people.

The social side of the graduate programme is really good as you get to meet so many people, some of them on a regular case at training. I went on a snowboarding trip this year with a group of graduates from different sites; next year, we’re looking at expanding and formalising the trip to make it available to everyone. On our site, we also have ‘Social Friday’ where a number of us attend a local pub for lunch and a chat about things other than work.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999940395355225}",neutral,0.9999940395355225,0

Major Sustainment Activity Certificate

Winner: Increasing the availability of the C-130J Hercules by Airbus Group Australia and Air Lift Systems Program Office

Both Airbus Group and the Air Lift Systems Program Office have worked hard to achieve the goals set out in the updated Planned Servicing Schedule Review, which has led to a significant increase in platform availability for the C-130J. The use of optimisation modelling for sustainment has seen a complete rethink of maintenance processes from both parties and an excellent outcome for the RAAF.

Minor Sustainment Activity Certificate

Winner: Classic Hornet Ageing Aircraft Systems Audit by QinetiQ and Jacobs Australia with the Tactical Fighter Systems Program Office

Given that the Classic Hornet Fleet will be age 36 when it retires, the work done by this team to completely audit the systems aboard the fleet was significant. The three-year audit process saw over 600 recommendations generated with 85 per cent adopted with the remainder to be actioned by the end of the year. The teams worked together to perform the audit with the least amount of damage to the aircraft while maximising availability during the process.

Essington Lewis Trophy – SME

Winner: KA350 Simulator Service Project by CAE Australia and Training Aircraft Systems Program Office

Both CAE Australia and the Training Aircraft Systems Program Office have worked together to introduce an innovative contracting solution to the RAAF’s training needs. Under a contractor-owned contractor-operated (CoCo) model, Defence is able to pay a monthly service fee for training at a state of the art KA350 simulator facility. The timeliness and budgetary savings of the approach are noteworthy as is the work done by both parties in addressing the requirement.

Essington Lewis Trophy – Prime

Winner: CN13 HMAS Success Sustainment by Thales Australia, Rolls Royce and KBR and the Amphibious and Afloat Support Systems Program Office

HMAS Success had been suffering from a lack of availability due to the ageing nature of the platform. Under this program, both industry and the DMO were able to work together to improve the number of ready days by 0 per cent in 2011-2012 to 100 per cent in 2014-2015. The successful collaborative nature of the program between all parties has seen an excellent outcome for the RAN to the point where the ship is now winning further performance awards and being deployed into the Middle East.

AIDN Young Achiever of the Year

Stephen Bornstein, BAE Systems, AIDN-Vic Finalist

Stephen Bornstein is a Mechanical Engineer – Weapon Systems at BAE Systems in Richmond. Stephen currently works on the mechanical design, manufacture and testing for NULKA and ESSM components.

To combat the asymmetric warfare from enemies such as Islamic State there is a large emphasis on special operations. The defence industry needs to align its products and services with the needs of special operations to ensure the ADF is well equipped for this fight.

Courtney Cole, QinetiQ, AIDN-ACT Finalist

Courtney Cole is a Principal Consultant with QinetiQ in Canberra. Courtney’s experience includes the provision of procurement and contracting support to the LHD SPO where she was a central figure in development and implementing the LHD sustainment strategy.

Courtney believes that the Defence industry continues to struggle with the retention of corporate knowledge, experience and technical know-how needed to support Defence in reaching its strategic goals and political objectives.

Fiona Yue Kan, TAE Gas Turbines, AIDN-Qld Finalist

Fiona Yue Kan is the Project Manager for TAE's Royal Malaysian Air Force Rolls-Royce Adour Engine, Test Cell Data Acquisition System and Facility Controls System Upgrade at Amberley, following her graduation with a Bachelor of Aerospace Engineering and a Bachelor of Science.

Fiona believes that one of the main issues facing the defence industry is the challenge of being able to employ sufficient people with engineering and/or other technical skills.

Tamara Perry, Thales Australia AIDN-NSW Finalist

Tamara Perry is an Acoustics Engineer for Underwater Systems with Thales, at Rydalmere. Her role includes prototyping and testing transducers.

The ability of Defence to meet its own Capability Plan is a persistent and continuing concern. Another key issue is the stifling of technical knowledge and innovation in Australia. There is a possibility of future projects looking off-shore for capability requirements, and of a ‘hiatus’ in design and manufacturing sectors that will cause a significant loss of skills.

Chanelle Pogas, General Dynamics Land Systems, AIDN-SA (DTC) Finalist

Chanelle Pogas is a Human Resources & Administration Manager at General Dynamics Land Systems, Australia. Her role is to maintain and improve an effective HR system, taking into account the operating environment of GDLS-A and legislative compliance covering all HR functions.

GDLS initially didn’t have dedicated WHS resources. Chanelle identified these issues and presented a business case to management and was given approval to recruit more resources. These resources were allocated and Chanelle and the team have worked together to overcome the challenges.
