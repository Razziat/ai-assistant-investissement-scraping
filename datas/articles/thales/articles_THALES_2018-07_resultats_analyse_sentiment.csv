The European Union said Monday it has launched an anti-trust investigation into the planned purchase by French aerospace and defence group Thales of SIM manufacturer Gemalto.

The European Commission, the 28-nation EU's executive arm, said it wants to determine whether the merger will increase prices as well as reduce choice and innovation for customers of hardware security modules (HSM).

An HSM is hardware that ""runs on encryption software to ""generate, protect, and manage encryption keys used to protect data in a secure, tamper-resistant module,"" it said.

""Our society is increasingly dependent on data security solutions to secure all sorts of social, commercial or personal information,"" the EU's competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.

""We are opening this in-depth investigation to ensure that the proposed transaction between Thales and Gemalto would not lead to higher prices or less choice in hardware security modules for customers looking to safely encrypt their data,"" Vestager added

In a deal valued at about 4.8 billion euros, Thales agreed in December to buy Gemalto, based in the Netherlands, outbidding French competitor Atos.

With the merger, Thales is aimming to become a global leader in digital security.

The commission expressed concern that the merger would reduce players in the market.

Gemalto is active in mobile platforms and services, mobile embedded software and products, smart cards, identification documents, government programmes, machine to machine communication, and enterprise security.

The Commission said it has until 29 Noveber to take a decision.

Climate Change & Satellites - Thales,"Fri, 13 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi93b3JsZHdpZGUvc3BhY2UvbmV3cy9jbGltYXRlLWNoYW5nZS1zYXRlbGxpdGVz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Acting together!



Scientists, government agencies and industry are teaming up as never before to design and build increasingly accurate instruments and satellites. Authorities naturally need reliable data to ensure the continuity of environmental surveillance and make the right decisions. Satellites are one of the most vital components in better understanding our planet. And it’s no accident that the latest edition of the book Climate Change & Satellites, published by Sud[s] Concepts for Thales Alenia Space, is entitled “Acting Together”.

Astronauts including Samantha Cristoforetti, Tim Peake and Thomas Pesquet have taken superb photos of our planet from the Cupola, part of the International Space Station with an observation window looking out over the Earth. Seen from above, the Earth’s atmosphere seems incredibly fragile. And when the elements go crazy, a phenomenon that’s happened several times in the last two years, these spaceborne snapshots immortalize very tangible evidence of how a deregulated climate can impact our lives. Unfortunately, climate change has become a societal challenge for the entire world.

According to climate expert Jean Jouzel, the surface temperature of the Earth has already increased by 0.6°C since the start of the industrial era, and carbon dioxide (CO2) levels continue to rise. If the temperature were to increase 4°C, the consequences could well be disastrous by the end of this century. Furthermore, despite the protests of climate change skeptics, these changes, coupled with increasing pollution in certain regions, already has a very real impact. The Great Barrier Reef is in the throes of agony, arctic ice is melting and certain species are disappearing. Climate change also has a very real impact on human activities, for instance in the form of the first “climate refugees”. In short, the climate is everybody’s business!

At Thales Alenia Space, we help further the understanding of our planet by contributing advanced satellite technology, especially Earth observation. Recent months have seen several milestones. We were delighted to see the Sentinel-3B satellite lift off very successfully in April. Following Sentinel-1A, -1B and -3A, Sentinel-3B is the fourth satellite built by Thales Alenia Space as prime contractor on behalf of the European Space Agency, for the European Commission’s Copernicus program. Sentinel-3B is now orbiting the Earth at an altitude of 815 kilometers, in conjunction with its twin brother, Sentinel-3A, to carry out a mission covering both sea and land in the fields of oceanography, land hydrology and vegetation monitoring.

We are now looking to the future, by working on Meteosat Third Generation (MTG) satellites. Over the decades, European meteorology has become increasingly accurate. With the first generation of Meteosat, images were updated every 30 minutes, a rate that dropped to 15 minutes for the second generation. With MTG, images will now be updated every ten minutes, making weather forecasts increasingly reliable. All of Europe’s geostationary weather satellites were built by Thales Alenia Space. Today, we are gearing up for other, equally fascinating programs, such as the SWOT space altimetry mission, on behalf of CNES and NASA, along with future Copernicus missions.

The upcoming political and societal choices, in Europe and worldwide, will clearly impact future generations, who will be inheriting a planet facing a very uncertain future in terms of the long-term viability of its resources.

“We face a daunting challenge, one that implies abandoning our current development-focused society and transitioning to a more carbon-stingy model” says Jean Jouzel. “Solutions do exist – energy efficiency, renewable energies, but they have to be deployed without further ado”.

Analyzing the huge streams of satellite data could help authorities make the best decisions, in particular to facilitate meeting our commitments within the scope of the Paris Climate Agreement, COP21.

Thales Alenia Space would also like to express its thanks to everybody who contributed to this book including ASI, CERFACS, CNES, ESA, EUMETSAT, GEO, Mercator Océan, Météo France, Telespazio and e-GEOS.

The solution is intended to track, trace and authenticate aircraft parts and materials. It uses the Hyperledger Fabric protocol as well as Internet of Things (IoT).

The solution includes multiple innovative technologies including Thales’s physically unclonable function. This involves adding a coating to a silicon chip which contains special particles which react to electricity.

Additionally, the application uses startup Chronicled’s cryptoseals. Cryptoseals are tamper-proof, and the startup developed the adhesive in conjunction with Cellotape. The seals contain a Near Field Communication (NFC) chip embedded with unique identity information.

Thales has a digital innovation program and used that to develop the application with Accenture jointly.

“The aerospace and defense industry has one of the world’s most vast and complex supply chains,” said John Schmidt, global managing director for Accenture’s Aerospace and Defense practice. “Blockchain technology offers a new, elegant and secure way for the industry to track and trace myriad components while deterring counterfeiting and improving maintenance capabilities. Used in combination with technologies like digital twins and digital threads, blockchain could ultimately be a game-changing innovation for this sector.”

Accenture’s recent research report concluded that 86 percent of Aerospace and Defence companies expect to use blockchain technology by 2021.

“Identifying counterfeit and grey-market goods in the A&D supply chain can be challenging,” said Gareth Williams, vice president for secure communications and information systems at Thales UK. “Using blockchain in combination with cryptoseals and physically unclonable functions allows you to build a trusted history behind parts. This demonstration builds on the strong relationship Accenture and Thales have created developing innovative digital solutions for a variety of industries.”

Accenture is involved in multiple supply chain blockchains. A few months ago they tested a solution in conjunction with Anheuser-Busch InBev, APL the shipping container company, and logistics business Kuehne + Nagel.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9978352189064026}",neutral,0.9978352189064026,0

Airbus extends Skywise to suppliers - Airbus,"Wed, 18 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOC0wNy1haXJidXMtZXh0ZW5kcy1za3l3aXNlLXRvLXN1cHBsaWVyc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"· 10 suppliers already collaborating as ‘early adopters’;

· New Skywise applications already demonstrating value for partners in strategic areas: on-time deliveries; quality and aircraft reliability;

· Providing suppliers with the unprecedented power to analyse their data.

Building on the successful launch of the Skywise open data platform for airlines at the Paris Air Show in 2017, Airbus is now extending the scope of cloud-based big-data analytics into the supply chain. The new offering will connect selected suppliers to the Skywise platform, to enable unprecedented improvements in their reliability, quality, and performance and, more generally, transform aviation through better performance. This is the first time that Airbus and suppliers are co-innovating with data sharing and analytics during an early adopter phase.



Marc Fontaine, Airbus’ Digital Transformation Officer said: “I’m very pleased to announce the next stage of uniting the aviation industry’s data, by connecting suppliers to the Skywise platform. The scope and power of data integration technology, which only became available recently, is now bringing productivity gains which benefit all stakeholders in the aviation ecosystem – from suppliers and airlines to OEMs. When our aircraft are reliable and flying passengers, we are all better off.”

‘Early adopter’ phase demonstrates power of the platform

Since late last year, Airbus has been working with selected suppliers during an early adopter phase to evaluate the features and functionalities. To date there are already 10 ‘early adopter’ suppliers working with Airbus to test and help mature the new supplier-related components of Skywise. These participants represent a very broad spectrum of commodities including cabin, propulsion, aerostructures, materials and equipment/systems. They were chosen not only for their strategic representation, but also for their overall willingness and ‘digital readiness’. Three of these are collaborating with Airbus on strategic ‘use cases’, encompassing three domains: Supply Chain, Quality and Aircraft Operability. For each of these domains, Airbus has developed dedicated applications with its Skywise partner – Palantir Technologies. These applications, described below, are already demonstrating success, and Airbus is expanding access to new platform members:

1. Supply Chain application: “Dispatch”

Skywise Dispatch will increase efficiency and responsiveness to supply chain disruptions. The application is designed to improve demand management, aircraft assembly configuration, and on-time delivery, notably to prevent line-stops. The application aligns supplier production planning and Airbus’ demand to create a single ‘source of truth’. This enables fast and easy root-cause analysis of recurring missing parts and anticipation, notably through a better visibility into production status. The lead partner in this pilot phase is Premium Aerotec. At the company, Skywise Dispatch is active across five functions where it is delivering 25% time savings, and full roll-out planned in Nordenham to 50 additional users.

Dr. Thomas Ehm, Chairman of the Executive Board of Premium Aerotec said: “By using the collaborative platform Skywise, the company takes a big step towards its smart factory vision. Skywise allows full transparency and big data analytics on a huge amount of data in order to recognize trends that require early actions to ensure a stable manufacturing process.”

2. Quality application: “Object Explorer”

Skywise Object Explorer improves the quality of suppliers’ services and commodities by reducing the cost of non-quality incurred by both Airbus and suppliers, reducing the occurrence of quality shortfalls by identifying such trends early and by accelerating resolution. The key partner is Thales, for whom the application has typically been delivering a 30% reduction in part removals due to non-conformities (on a per-component basis).

Gil Michielin, EVP Thales, Avionics GBU said: “Skywise echoes the mutual goals for disruptive technologies pioneered across Thales and Airbus. Thales has accompanied Airbus’ ambitions for decades and its scope of industry leadership spans all areas of the connected aircraft, from nose to tail and beyond. The cultural change of this new initiative perfectly complements Thales’s multi-billion dollar investment in digital technologies. We are pleased to be strengthening our robust and trusted relationship with Airbus through this thrilling endeavour which aims at accelerating digital transformation throughout the aerospace sector.”

3. Aircraft operability application:

This application brings together Airbus and suppliers in a platform where they can collaborate securely and in real-time to resolve in-service issues faster and more accurately by leveraging in-service aircraft data to identify the root-causes of operational issues and exploring how to improve predictive maintenance services for airlines. The pioneering team in this collaboration is the partnership between easyjet, Liebherr and Airbus. Each partner has already benefitted from the partnership on the platform.

Nicolas Bonleux, Managing Director and Chief Sales Officer at Liebherr-Aerospace & Transportation said: “The projects demonstrated that bringing together a wide range of data and conducting holistic analyses enable us to realise a much deeper and better understanding of the in-service behaviour of on-board systems and components, developed, manufactured, certified and serviced by Liebherr.”

Data Breaches Hit 50 Percent of Retailers Last Year - Tech.co,"Fri, 27 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaC5jby9uZXdzL3JldGFpbC1kYXRhLWJyZWFjaGVzLTUwLXBlcmNlbnQtcmV0YWlsZXJzLWxhc3QteWVhci0yMDE4LTA30gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Three-quarters of all U.S. retailers have suffered a data breach. That number is eye-opening enough, but worse still, half of these retail data breaches occurred in the past year alone, a new report out from Thales Security has revealed.

Clearly, retailers aren't immune from the cybersecurity hacks, attacks and alerts that have swept the globe in the past few years. But with consumers putting their personal financial details in the hands of retailers that are clearly vulnerable, there's added cause for concern.

It's not all bad news: according to the Thales Security report, U.S. retailers are retaliating, with 84 percent aiming to increase their IT security budget in 2018 — up from 77 percent past year, and solidly ahead of the global retail average of 67 percent.

What do retail data breaches look like? What can businesses, and the consumers whose data might be at risk, do about the problem? Here's a quick examination of the unstable cyber-ground U.S. retailers are sitting on.

2017's Biggest Retail Data Breaches

2017's highest profile retail data breaches are particularly scary to the average consumer, if due to the brand names alone: Plenty of consumers hadn't heard of Equifax before its massive breach, but far more people have eaten at Chipotle.

Most of that restaurant chain's roughly 2,250 locations were breached over the course of three weeks in 2017. Chipotle's cyber-defences fell to hackers who nabbed customer payment data via malware.

The breaches haven't slowed in 2018 so far. Some of the largest breaches have occurred within the first half of the year.

Under Armour was breached in 2018, losing data on around 150 million customers. Hackers attacked the sports company's diet and fitness app, MyFitnessPal, to extract the data.

Indeed, one of the reasons retailers are seeing so many breaches is this level of digital diversification. By dipping their toe into acquisitions and third-party SaaS deals, retailers open up additional points of entry that hackers might exploit. Another third-party firm, [24]7.ai, was breached in 2017, exposing companies including Sears and Best Buy.

Other retailers affected in 2018 so far include Macy's, Adidas, and even the café chain Panera Bread.

Four Reasons Retail Data Breaches Are Rising

While security breaches are a growing concern across the globe, they're increasing particularly fast in the United States, as the above graph from Thales' latest report indicates.

While 75 percent of U.S. retailers were breached at one point in the past, only 60 percent of retailers globally can say the same. So what's driving the 2017 boost in breaches?

1) Solving the Wrong Problems

One reason may be that U.S. retailers are trying to stop the wrong problems.

The U.S. retail sector invests the most into “endpoint/mobile defense solutions,” Thales notes, even though analysis/correlation tools and “data-in-motion” defenses would be more effective.

2) Cloud Security Concerns

U.S. retailers are also both more likely to store data in the cloud, yet less likely (at 26 percent, against a global 30 percent average) to use cloud encryption. In short, spending a U.S. retailer's cybersecurity budget more wisely would likely go far towards closing the gap.

3) Third Party Weakspots

Evolving retail practices could also contribute to the rise in breaches: Retailers are increasingly relying on external third-party businesses, from software to platform to infrastructure services, all of which are additional entry points for a hacker hoping to gain retailer data. These innovations can't be rolled back: Retailers need to evolve their security measures to cover the online tools and services they rely on.

4) The Reduced Friction Paradox

But the final reason retailers suffer from cybersecurity hacks could be their own success when creating smooth customer experiences. Retail websites are great at reducing friction in order to improve the user experience. Everything from logging in to single-click checkouts makes modern online retail great for consumers.

But, that expectation of quick response and one-click access can breed poor security practices. Thanks in part to that low friction, a 2018 report from cybersecurity firm Shape Security found, between 80 and 90 percent of their traffic are hackers attempting identity fraud.

‘Retailers are reluctant to impose any security measure that could lead a customer to abandon their cart' – Shape Security report

The result? Such fraud is collectively costing retailers nearly half a million dollars per month.

How Retailers And Consumers Can Protect Their Data

In 2018, both retailers and their customers need to reconsider their approach to security to remain safe.

Retailers everywhere are taking the first step they need in order to combat rising breaches: Boosting budgets on their cybersecurity efforts. But even more important for these companies is ensuring that they're spending on the channels that will prove the most effective: An informed audit of their own past cybersecurity focus would be the next step to take.

Consumers, meanwhile, can't assume that retailers will protect their data flawlessly. Any individuals hoping to protect their account information in 2018 should start with password managers. A high-quality manager can store passwords safely. Remember, if you re-use a password and email address combination on multiple sites, you are at real risk should a data hack to any one of those sites happen. Even if hackers can access some of your account information from a retail data breach, an impenetrable password can keep away real harm, and password managers can generate unique passwords for every site you use.

Try password managers like 1Password, Dashlane or LastPass, or just take a look at our password manager review to compare the best options yourself.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9989997744560242}",negative,0.9989997744560242,-1
First guided firing of Thales's BAT-120 laser-guided lightweight munition - EDR Magazine,"Mon, 30 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVkcm1hZ2F6aW5lLmV1L2ZpcnN0LWd1aWRlZC1maXJpbmctb2YtdGhhbGVzcy1iYXQtMTIwLWxhc2VyLWd1aWRlZC1saWdodHdlaWdodC1tdW5pdGlvbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In June 2018, a BAT-120 GL laser-guided lightweight munition prototype equipped with its guidance system was successfully fired for the first time from a French Air Force Mirage 2000D at the French defence ministry’s Biscarrosse test range in Western France.

The firing was the first opportunity to test the BAT-120 GL prototype guided by a trajectory correction system derived from the laser-guided rocket developed by Thales. The munition was launched from the aircraft and corrected its trajectory in flight as anticipated in the test protocol.

The BAT-120 GL is a lightweight (35 kg) munition that would provide forces with a highly effective precision-guided weapon ideally suited to modern conflict situations, particularly in urban environments. The key operational requirement is to reduce to a zero level the risk of collateral damage while increasing the weapon carriage capacity of combat aircraft This concept allows to take a larger number of ammunition than today with bombs from 250kg to 1000kg.

Testing of the BAT-120 GL prototype will continue shortly with a guided firing of a metric-precision munition.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.8878725171089172}",positive,0.8878725171089172,1
South Africa: Zuma Court Case Adjourned - OCCRP,"Fri, 27 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9jY3JwLm9yZy9lbi9kYWlseS84Mzk3LXNvdXRoLWFmcmljYS16dW1hLWNvdXJ0LWNhc2UtYWRqb3VybmVk0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This is the third time Zuma appeared before a judge. Zuma’s legal team has delayed proceedings by filing interlocutory applications until now, according to Eyewitness News.

Zuma's his asked the judge to allow a permanent stay of prosecution.

Judge Mjabuliseni Madondo granted the Zuma legal team's request to file a stay of charges, and set the date of November 30th for the state to respond to the request.

Zuma faces 16 counts of corruption, fraud, racketeering, and money-laundering in relation to an arms deal with French arms company Thales, who the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) is building a case against in relation to the Zuma investigation.

The current investigation flagged 783 questionable payments received by Zuma from 1995 to 2005 as part of the US$2.5 billion arms deal with Thales.

However, it was only in February 2018, following raids of the homes of the Gupta family --close associates of the Zumas-- a declaration by the South African public protector that Zuma’s dealings with the Guptas and other associates resulted in state capture, and a request from the African National Congress Party (ANC), that he resigned.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9992423057556152}",neutral,0.9992423057556152,0

France’s Thales is confident of creating more than 3,500 high-end jobs in India over the next three years, as it executes $1 billion (Rs 6,850 crore) worth of offsets over the Rafale fighter jet deal in partnership with local companies Bharat Electronics and Reliance Defence.The company, which had revenue in excess of $17 billion in 2016, is looking at India as a major hub for international orders, and has pledged to transfer key technology for radars, optronics and integration of systems to partners here, with a top executive saying that it would mean creation of thousands of jobs.“We are talking of thousands of jobs. Today we are at 1,500 and plan to be in the range of 5,000 in the next three years. We are taking of high-end jobs that require (world class) engineering competencies. We are in partnership with institutions like IITs and the Indian Institute of Science to skill people for these,” senior executive vice-president Pascale Sourisse told ET.Globally, the company has 65,000 employees and is a major contributor to Dassault’s Rafale fighter jet that has been ordered by India. As part of the contract, it has to invest $1 billion in the Indian defence and aviation sector. Sourisse said the company recently obtained final clearances for its joint venture with Reliance Defence and would now start building facilities at Nasik.“We have received final approvals a few days ago and now will build facilities that will implement technology transfer. We will work with Reliance and other players a well. We are transferring core technologies for the aircraft particularly in the radars and electronic warfare domain to Bharat Electronic s Limited.”The plan is to leverage the company’s JVs in India for international orders, with the executive saying that the idea was to address global demand with exports from India, following the technology transfer. For future plans in India, Thales plans to target long-range radars, sonar systems for the navy and air traffic control systems with dual use.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999919056892395}",neutral,0.999919056892395,0
Sonartech to provide subsystems for Collins - Australian Defence Magazine,"Wed, 11 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1c3RyYWxpYW5kZWZlbmNlLmNvbS5hdS9zZWEvc29uYXJ0ZWNoLXRvLXByb3ZpZGUtc3Vic3lzdGVtcy1mb3ItY29sbGluc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Sonartech ATLAS has signed a contract with Thales Australia to supply sonar subsystems into the major upgrade project for the Collins Class submarines.

The contract, which will see Sonartech deliver its four subsystems to all six of the submarines and the associated shore based reference systems, is an advancement to work begun almost two years ago with Thales and the government.

The development, which is taking place in the company’s Sydney facility, represents the next generation of a number of systems the company has previously delivered to the Navy.

In a statement, Sonartech said that being selected to deliver the sonar data recording, acoustic analysis, self-noise monitoring and integrated intercept subsystems is a significant milestone.



Whilst Sonartech was not involved in the original build program for the Collins submarines, the company became a significant supplier of sonar processing and related sub-systems through the Collins Combat System Augmentation and Replacement Combat System programs.

""The contract is recognition of the outstanding capabilities of our team and the systems they build,"" managing director Mark Baker said.

""In the broader local industry perspective, it’s a demonstrable commitment in developing the capability and helping to enhance its role within the Australian Submarine Enterprise, a role which is not just about enhancing the capability of the Collins Class but also delivering the systems for the Future Submarine.”

Sonartech, which celebrated 30 years of operation last year, delivered the first Ping Intercept Passive Ranging Sonar (PIPRS) system to the RAN. The company went on to develop a range of other sonar processing systems which were installed in the Oberon and Collins class submarines.

The company now supplies processors for a range of submarine sonar arrays, including bow, distributed, flank and towed.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9586448073387146}",neutral,0.9586448073387146,0
Proposed sonar testing facility for Tasmanian lake - CONTACT magazine,"Wed, 18 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbnRhY3RhaXJsYW5kYW5kc2VhLmNvbS8yMDE4LzA3LzE4L3Bvc3NpYmxlLW5ldy1zb25hci10ZXN0aW5nLWZhY2lsaXR5LWZvci10YXNtYW5pYW4tbGFrZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales Australia, the University of Tasmania, Australian Maritime College and AMOG Consulting today signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to investigate the establishment of a new state-of-the-art trials and test facility for submarine and surface-ship sonar systems.

Minister for Defence Industry Christopher Pyne said potential locations being investigated for the facility were located in the federal seat of Braddon and would create jobs and develop world-leading expertise for the region.

It just so happens there’s a federal by-election in the seat of Braddon in just 10 days time – a seat that was won by Labor from the Liberals at the last election. The recent Labor member, Justine Keay, resigned earlier this year amidst the dual-citizenship debacle, and is re-contesting the seat against the former Liberal member Brett Whiteley.

“This initiative further demonstrates the Turnbull Government’s investment in shipbuilding capability and sustainment is a truly national enterprise,” Minister Pyne said.

“Sonar systems are the eyes and ears of our submarines and ships and are key to giving them the edge they need.

“The Collins-class sonar upgrade program is boosting defence industry confidence around Australia.

“Contributions to Australia’s military capability from our defence industry come from all around the country and are not confined to our big cities.

“Congratulations to everyone involved in delivering this great opportunity for the region.

“Initiatives like this help build Australia’s capability to deliver the Turnbull Government’s Naval Shipbuilding Plan.

“Thales Australia advises the use of Tasmania’s deep, cold and acoustically quiet lakes for the proposed acoustic testing capability could enable sonar systems, including those currently delivered by Thales to be tested to new levels of accuracy,” Minister Pyne said.

EDITOR’s NOTE: CONTACT has no knowledge or expertise on this topic and is in no way suggesting that Tasmania’s deep, cold and acoustically quiet lakes are not suitable for this project. However, we find this announcement to be in very poor form – but not at all shocking or surprising – that the Minister for Defence Industry would issue a press release on this topic deliberately and blatantly leading with a statement on jobs and development in a currently contested Federal electorate in which the government needs a swing in their favour to take back. Far too many defence-industry/defence-spending announcement are used first and foremost as party-political statements on governmental hubris, with talk or explanation of the specific defence capability taking a very secondary role.
