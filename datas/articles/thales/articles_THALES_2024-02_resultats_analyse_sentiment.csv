Thales inks $2B deal to improve British Royal Navy's maintenance - Defense News,"Mon, 05 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS9pbmR1c3RyeS8yMDI0LzAyLzA1L3RoYWxlcy1pbmtzLTJiLWRlYWwtdG8taW1wcm92ZS1icml0aXNoLXJveWFsLW5hdnlzLW1haW50ZW5hbmNlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LONDON — Thales has signed a 15-year deal with the U.K. to use artificial intelligence and virtual reality to improve maintenance of the Royal Navy’s fleet, the Defence Ministry announced.

The £1.8 billion (U.S. $2.3 billion) contract with the French-based company’s U.K. arm got underway Jan. 1 but was only revealed Feb. 2 during a visit by British Defence Secretary Grant Shapps to the Devonport naval base in southwest England.

The support program will see Thales use data technology, including AI and virtual reality, to provide more proactive and predictive maintenance, replacing a more traditional engineering repair service the company previously ran with the Royal Navy.

Known as the Maritime Sensor Enhancement Team, the effort will see Thales support sonar systems, periscopes, masts and electronic warfare equipment deployed on existing and under-construction vessels across the surface and submarine fleets. In almost all cases, Thales is the original supplier of the equipment.

The contract is part of a wider drive by the Royal Navy to maximize the availability of its fleet during a time of increasing maritime demand in places like the Red Sea.

Thales said the new predictive model is more advantageous than the old approach of reacting when problems emerge.

“Over the life of the contract, it will deliver an average reduction in Turn Around Times of 100 days per repair, spares lead times will be reduced by an average of 44 days and reliability improved by 10%.,” Thales said in a statement.

Alex Cresswell, CEO of Thales UK, said the contract “will help keep more Royal Navy ships at sea for longer, by harnessing the latest developments in artificial intelligence, data analysis and improved dockland facilities.

The contract also involves improvements to waterfront facilities at major naval bases in Devonport and Portsmouth in England; Faslane in Scotland; and in Bahrain where the Royal Navy has a permanent base.

The Defence Ministry announced in November efforts to improve infrastructure at Devonport with £750 million in funding. That district is, among other things, home to Britain’s only nuclear submarine repair facility.

Thales Alenia Space to supply NEO Surveyor communications equipment - SpaceNews,"Fri, 16 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS90aGFsZXMtYWxlbmlhLXNwYWNlLXRvLXN1cHBseS1uZW8tc3VydmV5b3ItY29tbXVuaWNhdGlvbnMtZXF1aXBtZW50L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"SAN FRANCISCO — Thales Alenia Space won a contract from Ball Aerospace, prime contractor for NASA’s Near Earth Object (NEO) Surveyor, to provide key communications components for the spacecraft destined Earth-sun Lagrange point 1.

Under the contract announced Feb. 13, Thales Alenia Space will supply NEO Surveyor’s S-band transponder, K-band modulator and K-band traveling wave tube amplifier to transmit data 1.5 million kilometers between L1 and Earth.

“The entire company is very excited to be part of this mission,” Ken Fischer, Thales Alenia Space director of business development for North America, told SpaceNews. “The NEO Surveyor program has been a long time coming.”

NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory manages the NEO Surveyor mission scheduled to launch no earlier than September 2027. The spacecraft will be equipped with an infrared camera to scan the solar system to measure and characterize asteroids and comets more than 140-meters across traveling within 50 million kilometers of Earth orbit.

Changing Trajectories

In 2022, NASA’s Double Asteroid Redirect Test succeeded in modifying the orbit of Dimorphos, a moon orbiting near-Earth asteroid Didymos.

“DART demonstrated that you can change the trajectory of an asteroid, but it is important to locate them,” said Miriam Catalan, Thales Alenia Space business development manager for international markets.

If an asteroid with a 140-meter diameter struck Earth, it would release hundreds of megatons of energy. NEO Surveyor addresses that threat, which has “a small probability of occurring, but very bad effects if something were to happen,” Fischer said.

Thales Alenia Space, a joint venture between Thales of France and Leonardo of Italy, declined to comment on the value of the NEO Surveyor equipment contract.

Communications from L1

Thales Alenia Space will produce NEO Surveyor transponders in Madrid and modulators in Toulouse, France. Traveling wave tube amplifiers will be manufactured in Charleroi, Belgium.

NEO Surveyor communications presents a few challenges. Equipment must take into account radiation levels and receiver sensitivity required for spacecraft at L1. “But those are all issues that we strive to make routine,” Fischer said.

Emmanuel Terrasse, Thales Alenia vice president equipment, said in a statement, “We are thrilled to provide key communications equipment for the NEO Surveyor mission, which will represent a significant advance in NASA-led planetary defense efforts to protect our planet from hazardous asteroids and comets.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999969482421875}",neutral,0.999969482421875,0

Thales and BLS, a major Swiss railway company, have signed a contract to modernise the BLS rail lines. This new project for Thales involves supplying electronic interlockings with optical signalling to BLS over the next ten years.

By choosing Thales to supply new electronic interlockings, BLS maintains the continuity of rail services. ​ BLS can utilise a number of synergies from the 23 stations that Thales has already installed on its railway network since 2003. These synergies include the planning, implementation and operation of the system along with employee training. This enables BLS to implement future projects more efficiently, as the employees are already familiar with the systems.

The annual electricity consumption of the retained solution has been a key strategic factor, as BLS it has consistently evaluated the environmental impact of this modernisation over 40 years of operation. Together, Thales and BLS decided to test the power consumption of the proposed Thales solution. Measurements taken on installed systems showed that the Thales system is highly efficient and confirmed the lower power consumption.

Finally, Thales’ efficient and cost-effective solution will allow BLS to go further in modernising its railway lines. Thales’ system offers also the ability to convert existing Thales interlockings to cab signalling ETCS L2 (European Train Control System Level 2) without replacing the interlocking indoor equipment. This approach will enable BLS to migrate existing lines to the modern ETCS-L2 train control system at lower cost in the future.

“We are very pleased to again collaborate with BLS and to modernise this Swiss railway with Thales electronic interlockings, providing a mature and reliable system and ensuring high usability and efficiency to save energy. This new contract reinforces our excellent, long-standing relationship, which dates back more than 20 years and marks a great success for Thales Transport in Switzerland.” Kurt Sauerwein, Managing Director Ground Transportation Systems, Thales in Switzerland","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.8346803188323975}",positive,0.8346803188323975,1

Under the multi-year agreement, Jakarta will gain access to BlackSky’s high-revisit imagery and analytics and will own two of BlackSky’s next-generation Earth observation satellites. The satellites represent the beginning of a future constellation that could include a mix of imaging satellites provided by BlackSky and others built by Thales Alenia.

BlackSky operates a constellation of 16 electro-optical imaging satellites.

Thales Alenia Space and BlackSky will work under contract to PT Len Industri, Indonesia’s state-owned defense company, which selected the European firm to construct the satellite system.

Agreement bundles services and hardware

BlackSky under a separate contract from PT Len is supplying Indonesia’s MoD imagery and analytics services. The new agreement bundles services, hardware and ground-systems software.

Thales Alenia Space — a joint venture between the French technology firm Thales Group and Italian defense conglomerate Leonardo — was an early investor in BlackSky. Thales Alenia and BlackSky are co-owners of LeoStella, a satellite manufacturer based in Seattle that produces spacecraft for BlackSky and other customers.

Brian O’Toole, CEO of BlackSky, characterized the partnership with Indonesia as a model for how governments can harness commercial innovation rather than spend billions of dollars and decades developing indigenous platforms.

“We are seeing tremendous demand from international governments looking to rapidly acquire the benefits of space-based information,” O’Toole told SpaceNews. “This partnership helps Indonesia secure leading remote sensing capabilities today rather than wait years attempting to establish a sovereign satellite infrastructure.”

O’Toole said Indonesia’s program reflects a growing trend of allied governments integrating commercial satellite imagery into defense planning and operations.

Satellites to be delivered in two years

BlackSky expects to deliver two third-generation electro-optical imaging satellites to the Indonesian MoD in about two years, O’Toole said. Thales Alenia Space will develop the synthetic aperture radar satellites.

The company’s current constellation is made up of Gen-2 satellites that provide 1-meter resolution imagery. The Gen-3 version will produce sharper 50-centimeter resolution imagery. The Gen-3 satellites also have dual optical-infrared sensors that allow for imaging at night and in low-light conditions.

Indonesia has not disclosed how many satellites it intends to buy. O’Toole said BlackSky hopes to get more orders. “We expect that over time, they will continue to add more of their own satellites, either from us or from Thales into a very robust sovereign system.”

“This is the start of a long-term relationship with these types of customers,” he said, “where we’re integral to their architecture and evolution, not just leveraging the satellites, but leveraging our software and AI.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9992984533309937}",neutral,0.9992984533309937,0
Telit Cinterion Partners With Thales to Enhance Its IoT eSIM Provisioning Services - Yahoo Finance,"Tue, 27 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy90ZWxpdC1jaW50ZXJpb24tcGFydG5lcnMtdGhhbGVzLWVuaGFuY2UtMDgwMDAwMDY2Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"credit > sergray

Telit Cinterion, an end-to-end IoT solutions enabler, integrated Thales Instant Connect (TIC) services in its IoT modules for remote eSIM activation.

Comprised of a Thales eSIM with integrated TIC client, the solution enables instant worldwide activation of IoT eSIMs. It is extremely useful for industrial devices such as smart meters, security systems, healthcare equipment, and payment systems.

Aidon, a leading provider of advanced smart metering and smart grid solutions, is the first customer to deploy Telit Cinterion eSIM provisioning services with TIC.

MEUDON, France, February 27, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Telit Cinterion IoT modules featuring Thales Instant Connect can be remotely activated for cellular connectivity at the time of device installation or during in-field operation. This streamlines IoT deployments as it simplifies supply chain, device installation and maintenance, helping to keep IoT devices connected anywhere, and at all times. Aidon, a leader in smart metering solutions, is the first to benefit from this partnership and solution, deploying IoT modules and initial connectivity from a single vendor, Telit Cinterion.

By integrating Thales technology into Telit Cinterion modules, enterprises can enjoy instant out-of-the-box connectivity activation irrespective of the grid of available mobile networks. The collaboration between the two companies on this innovative solution enables them to get their IoT connected products in the market quickly, allowing them to reap the benefits of digital transformation that is at the core of the IoT promise.

The way the solution works is that, at the end of device production or when it is deployed in the field, the Telit Cinterion module uses the initial connectivity provided by Thales Instant Connect, to download the target local connectivity from the network operators selected by the IoT service provider. This allows device manufacturers and service providers to postpone selecting a connectivity provider until after the device is manufactured and throughout the deployment process. It can also be used during in-field operation, enabling deployed devices to stay connected throughout unexpected cellular network outages. This flexibility is particularly beneficial in situations where the devices are deployed across different regions or countries, as it allows for seamless integration with local network operators.

Story continues

""Helping our enterprise customers to quickly launch and monetize IoT is our mission at Telit Cinterion. Adding the Thales eSIM to our modules in combination with our SIM provisioning and global MVNO services to streamline the final connectivity provider selection is a game changer in the industry. This powerful solution delivers unparalleled adaptability to changing circumstances and simplifies supply chain and logistics because it is based on a single eSIM with Thales Instant Connect, which can be shipped anywhere in the world,"" said Manish Watwani, Chief Marketing and Product Officer at Telit Cinterion.

""The IoT eSIM solution is an important innovation, ensuring production flexibility and connectivity of our smart meters, even in rural areas, and all without the need for physical handling of SIMs. The solution provides a true operator selection and provisioning at any stage of the product lifetime. It is improving our ability to get smart meters connected, stay connected and adapt to new metering as-a-service business models,"" said Petri Ounila, Director, IoT Devices, Aidon.

""Thales aims to support IoT adopters and streamline device deployment with our eSIM with initial connectivity via Thales Instant Connect service. This simplifies and accelerates large scale IoT deployments for device makers, benefiting all stakeholders in the value chain. Thales is pleased to work with Telit Cinterion to support its success in cellular connectivity and speed up device deployment,"" said Guillaume Lafaix, Senior Vice President Mobile Connectivity Solutions at Thales.

Thales Alenia Space, the joint venture between Thales (67%) and Leonardo (33%), has signed a contract with prime contractor Ball Aerospace to supply communications equipment for NASA’s NEO Surveyor mission.



The main goal of this five-year mission, scheduled for launch in 2028, is to advance efforts to defend our planet against near-Earth objects like asteroids and comets, specifically within 50 million kilometres of Earth’s orbit.



NEO Surveyor will employ an infrared space telescope designed to discover and characterise at least two-thirds of the near-Earth objects more than 140 m across that would be capable of causing significant damage should they impact Earth.



Managed by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), NEO Surveyor will journey 1.5 million kilometres to a region of gravitational stability – called the L1 Lagrange point – between Earth and the Sun, where the spacecraft will orbit during its five-year primary mission.



From this location, NEO Surveyor will view the solar system in infrared wavelengths – light that is invisible to the human eye and mostly blocked by the Earth’s atmosphere. By using two heat-sensitive infrared imaging channels, its space telescope will be capable of detecting both bright and dark asteroids, which are the most difficult type to find, and to make accurate measurements of NEO sizes and gain valuable information about their composition, shapes, rotational states and orbits.



Thales Alenia Space will provide S-band Transponder, K-band Modulator and K-band Travelling Wave Tube Amplifier (TWTA) equipment for the NEO Surveyor spacecraft. The S-band Transponders are the units in charge of receiving the telecommands sent from NASA’s Deep Space Network, and transmitting the spacecraft’s telemetries back to Earth, as well as the ranging signals used to measure the spacecraft’s distance. The K-band Modulators and Power Amplifiers are in charge sending to Earth the images captured by the NEO Surveyor telescope.



Emmanuel Terrasse, Vice President Equipment of Thales Alenia Space, said: “We are thrilled to provide key communications equipment for the NEO Surveyor mission, which will represent a significant advance in NASA-led planetary defence efforts to protect our planet from hazardous asteroids and comets.



“We are grateful to prime contractor Ball Aerospace for their choice and trust in Thales Alenia Space. For more than 40 years, Thales Alenia Space has contributed to hundreds of missions providing critical communications technologies, from low Earth orbit to deep space, including flagship NASA missions to explore the universe such as the James Webb Space Telescope and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999876022338867}",neutral,0.9999876022338867,0

Thales and Indra sign collaboration accord to spur fielding of cutting-edge defence technologies - European Security & Defence,"Tue, 27 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vZXVyby1zZC5jb20vMjAyNC8wMi9tYWpvci1uZXdzLzM2NzU4L3RoYWxlcy1pbmRyYS10by1jb2xsYWJvcmF0ZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"France-headquartered Thales and Spanish company Indra signed an agreement on defence collaboration on 23 February 2024, with the aim of accelerating the development of cutting-edge European technologies and leveraging synergies to compete in Spain and international markets. The accord was announced in a joint press release on 27 February.

The two technology houses already have a history of collaboration on major technology programmes ranging from the Galileo global navigation satellite system and European Defence Fund projects to work on the Franco-German Future Combat Air System (FCAS).

“Both companies want to take advantage of the business opportunities that are arising both nationally and internationally, especially those related to radar systems, cyber security, communications systems and simulation,” the companies stated. “In the field of cyber defence, both companies will strengthen collaboration in EU-driven programmes such as AIDA (Artificial Intelligence Data Analysis), as well as other initiatives with European and international customers.

“In the area of communications systems, in which both companies have previously worked together, they will continue to reinforce their collaboration in terms of synergies and technological complementarities,” the press release added.

To promote these actions, a joint Steering Committee will be created to define the strategy, analyse opportunities and set up specific working groups.

The agreement between the two companies is in line with the EU Security and Defence Policy goal of strengthening Europe’s defence-industrial base. The policy is committed to a more open defence market, capable of rationalising investment and getting the most out of every euro spent on research and development and innovation. This is intended to increase capacity, shorten the time it takes to bring innovation to market and to deliver the new systems that European armed forces require.

“Technological changes occur at a non-linear speed, and companies must collaborate and co-create to equip customers with the necessary capabilities in this fast-evolving environment,” Thales Senior Executive Vice-President for International Development Pascale Sourisse was quoted as saying in the Thales press release. “This agreement between Indra and Thales confirms our mutual commitment to combine our complementary strengths in resolute contribution towards a stronger European defence industry.”

Indra CEO José Vicente de los Mozos added, “We are living in a true technological revolution in which advances are happening at breakneck speed. Industrial collaboration is absolutely critical for Europe to maintain its leadership and have a voice in deciding where our future is going. This agreement is about finding synergies, delivering better systems and developing new state-of-the-art technologies.”","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9983252882957458}",positive,0.9983252882957458,1

Kigen, VALID and RedTea Mobile were recognized as ‘Leaders’, while Eastcompeace, WORKZ and Oasis Smart SIM were seen as ‘Challengers’.

Seoul, Beijing, Boston, Buenos Aires, Fort Collins, Hong Kong, London, New Delhi – February 22, 2024

G+D, Thales and Idemia have emerged as ‘Pacesetters’ in Counterpoint Research’s Global eSIM Enablement CORE (COmpetitive Ranking and Evaluation) report for 2023.

Senior Research Analyst Ankit Malhotra said, “The global eSIM landscape continued to expand rapidly in 2023, after reaching an inflection point in 2022. Close to half a billion eSIM-capable devices were shipped in 2023. Operator support for eSIM also continued to grow and now more than 350 operators globally support eSIM. Consumer eSIM devices showed maximum growth while the number of IoT-M2M devices (including automotive) with eSIM support remained stable as the industry awaits implementation of SGP.31/32 standards.”

Malhotra added, “We have analyzed and evaluated key companies in the eSIM value chain using our proprietary CORE framework, which maps active players according to their capabilities and success in execution. The ‘capability’ parameter covers criteria such as firmware, compliance, interoperability and supply chain prowess, while the ‘ecosystem’ parameter covers geographical reach, partnerships and market share.”

Commenting on the research findings, Associate Director Mohit Agarwal said, “G+D, Thales and Idemia have emerged as pacesetters in our eSIM enablement rankings. The pacesetters have better all-round capabilities and lead in terms of execution, helping them achieve significant market share compared to others. G+D led the way in terms of consumer shipments, with its solution seen in Apple’s iPhones, including the eSIM-only iPhone 14 and 15. Thales led the shipments in the automotive space while no significant difference was seen among the pacesetters in the IoT/M2M space.”

Kigen, VALID and RedTea Mobile have been named as ‘Leaders’ as, along with great platform capabilities, they have managed to pull ahead of others in terms of execution in the marketplace. Kigen, one of the fastest-growing leaders, stood out for its iSIM solution and expertise in the IoT market. It is now augmenting its portfolio with consumer solutions as well. VALID, one of the incumbents, is also moving quickly and growing fast in consumer and automotive categories.

Eastcompeace, WORKZ and Oasis Smart SIM emerged as ‘Challengers’. Eastcompeace and WORKZ were the most improved players in 2023. Oasis Smart SIM is well-positioned with a strong platform and is expected to move strongly after the acquisition by TATA Communications. These players have excellent features and capabilities and as they grow their market presence, they are likely to graduate to ‘Leaders’ of tomorrow as the market for eSIM devices continues to grow.

Blair Canavan, Thales & Dr. Vladimir Soukharev, InfoSec Global

The advent of quantum computers poses a substantial threat to various industries due to their potential to compromise standard encryption methods that protect global data, communications, and transactions. This vulnerability could expose sensitive enterprise information to risk. Even before quantum computers possess this compromising capability, adversaries have initiated Harvest Now, Decrypt Later (HNDL) attacks, seizing potentially sensitive data for future adversarial decryption. To counter HNDL, migrating critical systems to Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) provides encryption and authentication methods resistant to an attack from a cryptographically relevant quantum computer (CRQC). This looming threat prompted InfoSec Global to collaborate with Thales to provide the market with the ability to kick-start their journey toward quantum safety by collecting granular relevant information on their current cryptographic posture.

Our blog will highlight the significance of utilizing analytics-driven solutions to efficiently discover, manage, and protect cryptographic assets within an organization’s environment, including keys and certificates, algorithms, ciphers, libraries, etc. We will describe the value in providing granular cryptographic insights provided by AgileSec™ Analytics into Thales products like CipherTrust Manager (CTM) and Luna Hardware Security Modules (HSM) which will ensure enhanced security, compliance, and operational efficiency. We also revisit the PQC standardization process and its implications for businesses worldwide.

The NIST PQC Initiative

Standardization bodies have been working hard to provide much-needed guidance and resources to facilitate the transition to quantum safety worldwide. In the U.S., The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has long played an active role in shaping cybersecurity best practices. Notable examples include the widely utilized Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm, the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) algorithm, and, more recently, the Secure Hash Algorithm 3 (SHA-3). Recognizing the looming quantum threat in 2016, NIST embarked on a process to standardize Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) algorithms, as illustrated in this timeline detailing the events for this initiative.

From the outset, NIST acknowledged that this undertaking would be notably more intricate compared to the processes for AES and SHA-3. One reason is the increased complexity of requirements for public key cryptography (key encapsulation mechanisms and digital signatures) compared to symmetric cryptography. Another challenge stems from the extensive range of proposed solutions derived from research. Evaluating such diverse approaches presents unique challenges, including considerations of security, key sizes, latency, bandwidth, and the ease of secure implementation. Nevertheless, the standardization process has made great strides, and finalized quantum-safe algorithms will likely be released sometime in 2024. NIST recommends starting the migration process by mapping existing critical systems and building a comprehensive cryptographic inventory as an essential element for this undertaking.

A Mission Unlike Any Other

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to work on some of the most advanced naval technologies in the world. You must then get through military guards to climb aboard a Royal Navy warship, meet the Government’s Secretary of State for Defence, before stepping out to be interviewed on camera with a pack of broadcast media…..

Real-Life Heroes, Not Just On-screen

A day in the life of Tom Cruise or Daniel Craig? No, just in the week in the lives of four Thales apprentices from Templecombe who suddenly found themselves playing in a key role in the announcement of the biggest contract for Thales in the UK. Not a bad way to kick off National Apprentice Week.

In the Spotlight: Thales' Future Innovators

Mia Pitman, Ellis McCullagh, Evan Lovell and James McIntosh were asked to support the UK Ministry of Defence announcement in Devonport, where Thales was awarded a massive £1.8 billion, 15 years contract for the Maritime Sensor Enhancement Team (MSET) to deliver game-changing technologies and support to keep ships and submarines at sea for longer.

The Backbone of Naval Defense

The Maritime Sensor Enhancement Team (MSET) contract will directly support the Royal Navy’s eyes and ears – sonar, electronic warfare and optronic/periscope technology for the next 15 years.

Aboard HMS Somerset: A Stage for Innovation

The ship chosen for the event was HMS Somerset, a type 23 frigate and one of the most formidable anti-submarine warfare warships in the world. Fitted with Sonar 2087 from Templecombe and electronic warfare and communications systems from Crawley, the ship is designed to track down enemy submarines.

Leadership and Learning: A Unique Intersection

The Rt Hon Grant Shapps, UK Defence Secretary was going to announce the contract on the bridge of Somerset as communication teams from the MOD, Royal Navy and Thales made their plans with invited media. Key to that was a certain four Templecombe apprentices who were about to be taken out of their comfort zone.

Behind the Scenes with Thales' Apprentices

Matt Bliss, the MSET Programme Director, travelled with them down to Plymouth and takes up the story. He said: “We knew it was going to be a big announcement and there was an ambition to have Thales apprentices there to show the strength and breadth of the Thales team.

A Showcase of Commitment and Flexibility

“With a long-term contract and a shortage of STEM resources, it’s essential that we develop our own staff. Opportunities like this don’t happen in many lifetimes! I can’t emphasise how flexible Mia, Ellis, Evan and James were in their ambition to support the event. They moved everything from college, work commitments and holiday at short notice.

The Spotlight Moment

After making the announcement and being interviewed by the media, Mr Shapps was introduced to the four who stepped onto the bridge for a photocall in front of cameras from the BBC, ITV and BFBS.

Ambassadors of Thales' Future

Matt added: “The Defence Secretary was amazing, he really engaged with all four about their career choices, how they were managing their studies and work. He was really interested in their experiences as apprentices.

A Natural Talent for Leadership

“After that, all the journalists wanted to interview them all – they were literally going from camera to camera with the press wanting to know more about their careers. They were born naturals, calm and very articulate. They were just fantastic ambassadors for Thales for the whole event.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999932050704956}",neutral,0.9999932050704956,0

AVANT Up and Optiq in real life

At Economy Class and beyond, we’ve used the AVANT Up IFE System with the Optiq screens at Aircraft Interiors Expo,

I used Optiq seatback, trying out some of the system’s features (not just the display technology), and it is pretty impressive, to put it mildly, with the displays capable of impressive resolution and delivery.

The dual-Bluetooth pairing is great for sharing content or hogging the two connections to yourself with a headset and game controller (and this was a standard Xbox controller being used in this demo).

It’s also impressively thin – reducing the weight of the system installed on the aircraft.

But the issue won’t be the technology – it will be with content.

Don’t forget the Content

We’ve all been on flights where the content is blocky or stretched, with IFE systems delivering DVD-quality content…on a good day (what could be called 480p content). On larger displays, there is some HD content – but it can be a struggle to have suppliers deliver content at the high resolutions needed to play this – as well as the storage servers on the aircraft to deliver this content.

It’ll be interesting to see how Air India addresses this with their suppliers to deliver HDR and 4K content to the seat – and what its requirements will be.

As well as the size of the storage server.

For Air India passengers, it’s going to be a giant leap forward in passenger experience in terms of visuals alone.

Implementing the Thales solution with Eseye’s Infinity platform provides eSIM-based devices with out-of-the-box connectivity, streamlined operations across manufacturing and logistics, while complying with security standards.

MEUDON, France–(BUSINESS WIRE)–







Eseye provides IoT cellular connectivity services worldwide, and TAC brings connectivity management of IoT devices remotely to make it far easier for its customers to roll-out and support major projects in areas such as: smart utilities, supply chains, logistics, and automotive. Indeed, any kind of IoT device can be deployed and connected in any region or country without being configured beforehand.

TAC is remotely managing the eSIM automatic configuration to provide the best local connectivity from its first usage and throughout its lifespan on the field. With Thales, Eseye can ensure they all connect to the preferred mobile network whenever it is needed. For example, deployed IoT devices can be switched to another mobile network remotely, over-the-air, at any time. The Thales solution fully complies with GSMA eSIM IoT standard SGP.32, ensuring security, reliability, and future proof capability for massive IoT use cases.

Thanks to the Thales connectivity offer for eSIM-based devices, Eseye will be able to operate and manage flexible, end-to-end connectivity from the factory to the field, and throughout the device lifecycle. Which means the entire operation, including manufacturing, logistics, and connectivity, is streamlined and simplified.

“Eseye are delighted to be partnering with Thales to take forward this leading-edge, innovative new IoT solution. Combining SGP.32 and SGP.41 support will ensure future IoT device deployments can deliver optimum efficiency and value to our customers. Not only do Enterprise customers get a completely future proofed eSIM platform, but it also enables maximum choice of either personalising devices for local mobile networks ahead of deployment or using TAC to do this for them in the field” said Adam Hayes, Chief Operating Officer at Eseye.

“Eseye is a dynamic partner with whom we have also worked on a Proof of Concept for customers interested in in-factory provisioning (IFPP) for their devices. This enables profiles to be securely provisioned during the device manufacturing process. For example, a blood sugar monitor device that has been configured at the factory will have a substantially longer battery life since there is no need for an in-field local profile download. This solution, which meets the latest market specifications (SGP.41), retains all of the benefits of an automatic and cost-effective connection to the preferred local network,” said Guillaume Lafaix, VP of Connectivity Solutions and Embedded Products at Thales.

Thales is proud to be part of Type 31 project for the Royal Navy, for which the first frigates are currently being built in Rosyth by Babcock. Within this collaboration, Thales is responsible for the delivery of the Mission System (MS) for the Inspiration Class Type 31 frigates.

This responsibility includes the combat management system TACTICOS, as well as communications, bridge and navigation systems and the integration of this equipment into the Babcock built platforms. The Mission System provides the platform warfighting capability and is critical to achieving the operational capability of these new ships.

Successfully completing the three main system level Factory Acceptance Tests (FAT) was a key target for the Royal Navy’s new Type 31 frigate during 2023. This included the following events:

The FAT for the Integrated Communication System (ICS) was conducted in September. The ICS provides the platform with both internal and external communication capability and is being delivered by Thales SIX in Crawley.

During November, the Combat System (CS) FAT passed. Built around the TACTICOS Combat Management System (CMS) it includes the main radar, electro-optical sensors and integration with the ships missile and gun systems. The CS is produced by Thales in the Netherlands.

Finally, later in November, the Integrated Bridge and Navigation Systems (IBNS) FAT was successfully completed. The IBNS provides the navigation functions together with the outfit of the ship’s bridge equipment. This is provided by Anschuetz UK, Portsmouth who are supply partners selected by Thales to provide this critical system.

The successful completion of these milestones bring us to the next stage in the project, and closer to the delivery of the ships. Construction of the first ship, HMS Venturer, is underway at the Babcock shipyard at Rosyth, Scotland.

Thales now looks forward to the installation, integration and testing activities, which will enable completion of the vessel and handover to the Royal Navy.

Nigel MacVean, Thales Managing Director Above Water Systems UK said, “Working closely with our Royal Navy and Babcock colleagues we are delighted to have successful completed this critical stage in the development of the Royal Navy’s new Type 31 frigates.”

Dirk Jan de Bruijn, Thales Vice President Above Water Systems said:

The completion of these factory acceptance tests is a major milestone for the project. We are proud to have been able to share these successes with our partner Babcock and of course the UK Ministry of Defence.

Derek Jones, Type 31 Managing Director at Babcock said: ‘“Type 31 is an incredibly important programme for Babcock, our Royal Navy and Ministry of Defence customer and for the wider UK Shipbuilding industry. The success of this programme is founded on the strong relationships with Thales and we are united by the mission we jointly share - to strive for excellence each and every day.”

Royal Navy’s Rear Admiral Ivan Finn said: It was a pleasure to visit Thales’ Hengelo facility. I welcomed the opportunity to witness the T31 Combat System setup in-situ; this technology will be installed on the first of class, HMS Venturer, being built in Rosyth.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9994202852249146}",neutral,0.9994202852249146,0

This allows device manufacturers and service providers to postpone selecting a connectivity provider until after the device is manufactured and throughout the deployment process. It can also be used during in-field operation, enabling deployed devices to stay connected throughout unexpected cellular network outages. This flexibility is particularly beneficial in situations where the devices are deployed across different regions or countries, as it allows for seamless integration with local network operators.

“Helping our enterprise customers to quickly launch and monetize IoT is our mission at Telit Cinterion. Adding the Thales eSIM to our modules in combination with our SIM provisioning and global MVNO services to streamline the final connectivity provider selection is a game changer in the industry. This powerful solution delivers unparalleled adaptability to changing circumstances and simplifies supply chain and logistics because it is based on a single eSIM with Thales Instant Connect, which can be shipped anywhere in the world,” said Manish Watwani, Chief Marketing and Product Officer at Telit Cinterion.

“The IoT eSIM solution is an important innovation, ensuring production flexibility and connectivity of our smart meters, even in rural areas, and all without the need for physical handling of SIMs. The solution provides a true operator selection and provisioning at any stage of the product lifetime. It is improving our ability to get smart meters connected, stay connected and adapt to new metering as-a-service business models,” said Petri Ounila, Director, IoT Devices, Aidon.

“Thales aims to support IoT adopters and streamline device deployment with our eSIM with initial connectivity via Thales Instant Connect service. This simplifies and accelerates large scale IoT deployments for device makers, benefiting all stakeholders in the value chain. Thales is pleased to work with Telit Cinterion to support its success in cellular connectivity and speed up device deployment,” said Guillaume Lafaix, Senior Vice President Mobile Connectivity Solutions at Thales.

The primary goal of this five-year mission is to advance efforts to defend our planet from near-Earth objects, such as asteroids and comets located within 50 million kilometers of Earth's orbit.





Neo Surveyor will employ an infrared space telescope designed to discover and characterize at least two-thirds of near-Earth objects larger than 140 meters in size, capable of causing significant damage upon impact with Earth. The Neo Surveyor mission, operated by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Southern California, will travel 1,5 million kilometers to the L1 Lagrange point of the Earth-Sun system, an area of ​​gravitational stability where the spacecraft will remain for five years. From this position, Neo Surveyor will observe the Solar System in the infrared band, invisible to the human eye and partly absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere. Thanks to two heat-sensitive infrared imaging channels, the Neo Surveyor space telescope will be able to detect comets, bright asteroids and even the harder-to-find dark ones, and will make accurate measurements of their sizes, while also acquiring valuable information on their composition, shape, state of rotation and orbit.

Thales Alenia Space will supply the S-band transponders and K-band Traveling Wave Tube Amplifier (Twta) modulators and amplifiers for the Neo Surveyor mission. S-band transponders are the units dedicated to receiving commands sent by NASA's Deep Space Network (DSN) and transmitting the spacecraft's telemetry data to the ground segment, to determine, among other things, its position exact orbit and its distance from Earth. The power amplifiers and K-band modulators will instead transmit the images acquired by the telescope to the operators. Emmanuel Terrasse, Vice President Equipment at Thales Alenia Space, said: “We are excited to provide important equipment for NASA's Neo Surveyor mission, which will represent a significant step forward in the planetary defense effort to protect Earth from dangerous asteroids and comets . We are grateful to prime contractor Ball Aerospace for choosing Thales Alenia Space and placing their trust in us. For over 40 years, Thales Alenia Space has provided essential communications technologies for hundreds of missions, from low Earth orbit to deep space, including prestigious NASA missions to explore the Universe, such as the James Webb Space Telescopes (Jwst ) and Nancy Grace Roman.”

Montreal metro Blue Line CBTC contract awarded - International Railway Journal,"Mon, 19 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJhaWxqb3VybmFsLmNvbS9wYXNzZW5nZXIvbWV0cm9zL21vbnRyZWFsLW1ldHJvLWJsdWUtbGluZS1jYnRjLWNvbnRyYWN0LWF3YXJkZWQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"MONTREAL Transport (STM) has awarded a $C 217.2m ($US 161.9m) contract to Thales Ground Transportation Systems Canada to install and maintain CBTC on the metro Blue Line, including a 6km extension where early construction is underway.

STM says installing CBTC on the existing 9.7km Blue Line as well as the extension is necessary as the existing track-circuit-based system, which was installed when the line opened in 1986, is outdated and could not be used on the extension.

The project is financed primarily by the government of Quebec with some support from STM.

“By 2030, 93% of the STM’s infrastructure will be more than 40 years into its useful life,” says Mr Éric Alan Caldwell, chair of the STM board of directors. “We need to take every opportunity to modernize our network, which is what we’re doing by replacing the train control system.”

The extension project will add five new stations to the Blue Line, running east from the existing terminus of Saint-Michel to Anjou. The Blue Line project office is currently evaluating bids for the contract to excavate tunnels and build some of the stations. The preferred bidder is due to be announced this summer.

The line is expected to boost ridership by 15,000 passengers per day and is scheduled for completion in 2030.

The new recruits will support key activities at GIDP – from ship maintenance and repair works to critical sustainment activities for the Royal Australian Navy (RAN).

This cohort brings a breadth of skills, expertise and passion to their apprenticeship and traineeship at Thales as well as varying degrees of experience. First year apprentices, fourth-year apprentices, and Project Management trainees, sat alongside those who were further along in their trade as well as those who changed paths after an established and long-standing career.

At Thales, Apprentices and trainees play a vital role in ensuring a diverse pipeline of talent and critical skills development. Over the past 10 years, Thales’s Garden Island Defence Precinct (GIDP) workforce has assisted over 100 apprentices and trainees qualify in their chosen field, building true Australian Industry Capability; supporting Royal Australian Navy personnel to remain equipped and safe at sea.

“It was a pleasure to welcome such a large intake of apprentices and trainees into the Thales family. This team represent hard evidence of longer-term Commonwealth contracts equating to greater investment in an enduring sovereign sustainment capability. These team members will support delivery of Regional Maintenance Provider East (RMP-E), Dock Operation and Reticulated Services Contract (DORSC) and other programs in 2024 and well into the future. Their enthusiasm, hunger to learn and curiosity is infectious!” Anthony Burrows, Program Director East.
