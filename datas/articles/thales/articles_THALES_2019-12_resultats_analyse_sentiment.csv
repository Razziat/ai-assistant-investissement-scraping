Thales Alenia Space received a contract from Egyptian satellite operator NileSat to build a new geostationary communications satellite. The Franco-Italian manufacturer will build the NileSat-301 satellite using its Spacebus 4000-B2 platform, along with ground control infrastructure. NileSat-301 has a projected weight of 4,100 kilograms and is expected to launch in January 2022. It will eventually replace NileSat-201, which retires in 2028. NileSat-301 has a design life of 15 years. The contract follows a week after the launch of the Egyptian government’s TIBA-1 satellite, for which Thales Alenia Space provided the communications payload. [Egypt Independent/Thales Alenia Space]

Two military communications payloads passed their critical design review, keeping them on track for a December 2022 Falcon 9 launch aboard the semi-commercial Space Norway satellites. The Enhanced Polar System Recapitalization payloads are now cleared to begin production at Northrop Grumman, the U.S. Air Force said Dec. 3. Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems has a $410 million contract to develop the payloads, which will provide protected tactical communications over the arctic. Space Norway is including the payloads on its twin Arctic Satellite Broadband Mission satellites, which will also carry communications payloads for the Norwegian Ministry of Defence and British commercial satellite operator Inmarsat.

The launch of Saturn Satellite Networks’ first NationSat satellite has slipped to the second quarter of 2021 due to a delay from its launch provider. Saturn CEO Tom Choi said the rest of the small-GEO program is on track. He didn’t name the launch provider, but Saturn Chief Technology Officer Ken Betaharon identified it as SpaceX during a June presentation in Indonesia. Choi estimated the size of the small-GEO market at six or more satellites a year, of which Saturn hopes to win two annually. He said the company is also working on products for low- and medium-Earth orbits. [Via Satellite]

A new study on space debris says that deorbiting low Earth orbit satellites within 25 years of retirement is insufficient to avoid collisions. The University of Southampton study simulated LEO constellation activity over the next 1,000 years and concluded that, for altitudes above 1,000 kilometers, the rate of destructive satellite collisions doubled every 200 to 300 years. “At the beginning of a simulation, catastrophic collisions above 1000 km were occurring roughly every 50 years,” Southampton professor Hugh Lewis said. “By the end, the interval was down to six years despite the fact that only one or two satellites had been added to this region each year.” Lewis said the study also showed an increase in collisions at lower altitudes, since satellites performing deorbiting maneuvers created additional traffic on their way to Earth’s atmosphere.

Blue Origin is continuing to expand the number and size of its facilities. The company has opened an office in the Los Angeles area to work on propulsion systems, tapping into the expertise in the area, although only a few of its approximately 700 job openings companywide are for that new office. Blue Origin is continuing to work on an expansion of its headquarters in the Seattle suburb of Kent, as well as a new engine production factory in Huntsville and launch vehicle facilities in Florida.

Israeli satellite operator Spacecom has selected Satellite Mediaport Services in Great Britain as a ground segment partner for its recently launched Amos-17 satellite. Satellite Mediaport Services will help Spacecom by enabling C- and Ku-band uplinks to Amos-17 for television and broadband internet connections in Africa. Amos-17, a Boeing-built satellite, launched in August on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. The satellite’s coverage reaches Europe, Africa, the Middle East and parts of Asia, including India.

Globalstar says a recent refinancing of its debt should stabilize the company’s finances through the mid-2020s. The company announced last month it borrowed $199 million led by fleet operator EchoStar and Thermo, Globalstar’s largest shareholder, using the money to make three payments toward the company’s French loans and to negotiate more favorable terms for future payments. Globalstar’s revenues had been failing to keep up with loan payments, and efforts to monetize its S-band satellite spectrum for terrestrial applications were taking longer than anticipated. With the refinancing in place, the company believes it will have sufficient cash flow through 2025. [SpaceNews]

Hughes Network Systems received contracts from SES and Speedcast for Jupiter ground segment infrastructure. SES will use a Jupiter system, including data centers and hub equipment, to provide broadband services from SES-17, a satellite Thales Alenia Space is building for a 2021 launch. The satellite is designed to provide Wi-Fi on aircraft and boats, as well as to office buildings and network operators. Speedcast is deploying a Jupiter gateway and 3,000 satellite terminals to provide Wi-Fi in public areas throughout the Philippines as part of a Filipino government program supported by the United Nations.

Northrop Grumman believes that its financial stability should be a strength in an Air Force launch competition. In a speech Tuesday, Charlie Precourt, Northrop Grumman’s vice president of propulsion systems, said that its ability to leverage existing assets for its OmegA rocket, along with a diversified product line, means it would not need many Air Force launches to remain a viable supplier. That, he said, would allow it to better deal with future downturns in launch demand than competitors that are more dependent on government and commercial customers for launch services. Northrop is one of four companies competing for two Air Force launch services contracts. [SpaceNews]

Thales integrated sonar suite selected for Spanish Navy's F-110 Frigate - Naval News,"Thu, 12 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdmFsbmV3cy5jb20vbmF2YWwtbmV3cy8yMDE5LzEyL3RoYWxlcy1pbnRlZ3JhdGVkLXNvbmFyLXN1aXRlLXNlbGVjdGVkLWZvci1zcGFuaXNoLW5hdnlzLWYtMTEwLWZyaWdhdGUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales integrated sonar suite selected for Spanish Navy’s F-110 Frigate Thales sonars and acoustic systems will provide the Spanish Navy's five F110 frigates with a latest-generation anti-submarine warfare (ASW) capability. The key components of the integrated suite are the BlueMaster (UMS 4110) and CAPTAS 4 Compact sonars, the TUUM-6 underwater communication system, and the BlueScan digital acoustic system already in service with other European navies.

The General Directorate for Armament and Material (DGAM) and the naval shipyard Navantia have selected Thales technologies for the Spanish Navy’s five new multi-mission frigates.

The vessels’ anti-submarine warfare (ASW) capability, based on two world-class sonars, the CAPTAS 4 Compact and the BlueMaster, and the BlueScan digital acoustic system, will be integrated through Navantia Combat Management System SCOMBA F110 and will enable the service to conduct maritime surveillance, search and protection missions in any theatre of operations.

To protect their maritime territory and security interests around the world, States need to counter all types of threats in any environment or theatre of operations. Naval forces need reliable, high-performance systems to assert national sovereignty and accomplish their ASW missions with optimum effect. The choice of Thales technologies, which have been extensively proven in service with navies around the world, provides the highest levels of protection available today.

Spanish industry partners will supply some of the high-tech equipment under a decisive transfer of technology programme put in place by Thales.

BlueScan is a collaborative ASW solution that processes significantly higher volumes of sonar data from various different platforms to provide the operator with a complete overview of the acoustic situation in real time. The solution leverages Big Data analytics and artificial intelligence technologies to bring naval forces a tactical advantage.

Under this contract, key underwater acoustics technology will be transferred to Spanish industry, in particular for the supply of the TUUM-6 digital underwater communication system and acoustic arrays.

“ After two years of talks with the Spanish Navy and Navantia about this contract to equip five F110 frigates, we welcome Spain’s decision to join other NATO countries (the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Norway) and Australia in placing their trust in Thales for their anti-submarine warfare (ASW) capabilities. To help their naval forces conduct their missions in today’s heightened underwater threat environment, Thales has invested for many years in Australia, France and the United Kingdom to develop a unique set of digital sonar data processing and analytics technologies. Given the complexity of the underwater environment and the level of sophistication of the adversary, digitalisation and data fusion techniques are the only effective way to counter undersea threats in the 21st century. With our Spanish partners, and with Navantia in particular, we are very pleased to have the opportunity to strengthen our cooperation on this programme, in which local industry will play a significant role in producing, integrating and maintaining the systems alongside the Spanish Navy.”

The victim worked for the French aerospace company Thales, which is among exhibitors attending Colombia's Expodefensa trade fair.

Bogota police major Robert Mendez told reporters that the street shooting late on Monday was an ""assassination perpetrated by a hitman.""

""We reject the hypothesis of a robbery,"" said Mendez.

The 45-year-old engineer, whose identity was not initially made public by the French Embassy, was shot dead as he left a restaurant with a French colleague in Bogota's upscale district of Chapinero.

He was approached from behind. Only the Thales engineer and not his colleague was shot, said a police source quoted by the French news agency AFP, adding the engineer had been due to return to France on Wednesday.

Hosting defense exhibition

Bogota is currently hosting Expodefensa , a defense and security trade fair, attended this year by 269 exhibitors from 24 countries, including Thales .

The Paris-based aerospace and defense group expressed shock at the killing, saying the victim's colleague was ""immediately supported by the relevant authorities and Thales management on the spot.""

A team sent to Bogota was in ""contact with local authorities and the diplomatic corps,"" a Thales spokesman added.

Widespread protest wave

Colombia is currently embroiled in widespread demonstrations against economic trends, a funding shortage for education and killings of community leaders by armed groups.

On Monday, President Ivan Duque's government accepted a request for exclusive talks from a strike committee comprising trade unions and civil society groups.

Colombia's unrest, which has claimed at least five lives, echoes protest over inequalities that has also swept Ecuador, Chile and Bolivia.

[Provided to China Daily]

Thales Group, the French industrial conglomerate, will deepen its presence in China by supplying air traffic control solutions and digital security products.

It will increase China investments to build innovation resources over the next five years, said a senior executive.

Demand is surging from airports in China that are keen to upgrade their infrastructure to accommodate wide-body passenger aircraft. Ground transportation players are also seeking to improve their efficiency and make breakthroughs in digital technology, said Pascale Sourisse, president of Thales International.

As China has begun to develop its CR929 wide-body jetliner to meet the demand for international and regional civil aviation, the company hopes to supply avionic solutions for the CR929 aircraft, Sourisse said.

""We always had strong interest in providing cockpit display systems as well as the integrated modular avionics systems. These are domains where we have a lot of capabilities,"" she said, adding the company is ready to partner with Chinese players such as Aviation Industry Corp of China, or its subsidiaries, to co-develop solutions that will be suited for the project.

For the CR929, Thales has been discussing with Commercial Aircraft Corp of China, and with the joint venture between COMAC and Russia's United Aircraft Corporation. It has already submitted offers to the parties concerned.

For the newly inaugurated Beijing Daxing International Airport, Thales and its joint venture Beijing EasySky Technology Ltd or BEST provide air traffic management systems to increase its safety, capacity and efficiency in air traffic management.

In addition to supplying these systems to secure more than 60 percent of China's air traffic, it provides urban rail signaling systems to 33 metro lines in 14 cities through another joint venture - Thales SEC Transport.

Supported by over 2,300 employees across China, the company runs three joint ventures, three plants, two innovation hubs and two R&D centers in cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Dalian, Chengdu and Shenzhen.

Sourisse said together with its Chinese partners, the company also exports its products made at its China factories to other parts of the world, including economies participating in the Belt and Road Initiative.

Sourisse believes that China's growing demand for digital security and identity would boost the application of embedded SIM cards, the latest technological evolution for connecting devices.

The traditional SIM card is evolving toward a miniaturized embedded element soldered in the equipment which would replace or complement the removable SIM card.

""It is based on secure software integrated into a piece of hardware and basically this tiny technology enables not only new generation of connected devices, smartphones but also wearables and PCs. We also demonstrate what we do in the field of IoT(internet of things),"" she said, stressing one of the technologies that is important to Thales in China is biometrics, in particular, for authentication and identification use-cases.

Thales has invested more than 7 billion euros ($7.71 billion) in digital technologies since 2014, including artificial intelligence, big data analytics, connectivity with internet of things as well as cybersecurity.

""We are developing, in particular, all these competences in China, because we believe China is also a fantastic country to grow all these competences,"" she said.

The group's headquarters is located in La Defense, a business district in Paris. It employs over 80,000 staff worldwide, including 3,000 researchers and 28,000 engineers dedicated to R&D, in 68 countries and regions.

The firm generated 19 billion euros in sales revenue globally in 2018, from its business portfolio spanning aerospace, defence, transportation, digital identity, security and space markets.

As a newcomer to the second China International Import Expo held in Shanghai from Nov 5 to 10, Thales showcased its full range of different civil market activities.

To enhance its strength in digital technology, Thales acquired Gemalto, a major player in digital security, in April. It provides technologies and services to authenticate people, transactions and objects, encrypt data and create value for software - enabling businesses and governments to deliver secure digital services for users.

Sourisse said this big-ticket acquisition has created a strong opportunity for the group to help China to achieve certain national objectives like developing competencies in domains that are promising for the future, including digital technologies, aerospace, ground transportation and security. All these domains pack in a lot of potential for future growth, she said.

Sun Fuquan, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Science and Technology for Development in Beijing, said companies from France, Germany, Japan and the United States have discovered that it is time to invest more in China's research and development, design, high-end manufacturing businesses. He said these new growth opportunities will present themselves as the economy becomes more sophisticated.

Under the government's policies, foreign companies are encouraged to invest in high-end, smart and green manufacturing, set up innovation centers and strengthen cooperation with domestic peers. They will also be allowed to join China's national science and technology programs.

""New technologies such as artificial intelligence and 5G will change the way we manage, secure and exchange data, creating new opportunities to seize,"" he said. ""Major multinational companies have already spent more on innovation and new technologies, to reinforce themselves and maximize the value for their customers.""","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9995185136795044}",positive,0.9995185136795044,1

(EPA:HO) shareholders, since the share price has fallen 12% in that time. But that scarcely detracts from the really solid long term returns generated by the company over five years. In fact, the share price is 107% higher today. To some, the recent pullback wouldn't be surprising after such a fast rise. The more important question is whether the stock is too cheap or too expensive today.

Check out our latest analysis for Thales

While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.

During five years of share price growth, Thales achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 4.8% per year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 16% per year, over the same period. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth.

The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).

ENXTPA:HO Past and Future Earnings, December 30th 2019

We know that Thales has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? If you're interested, you could check this free report showing consensus revenue forecasts.

What About Dividends?

When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Thales's TSR for the last 5 years was 127%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!

A Different Perspective

Investors in Thales had a tough year, with a total loss of 5.6% (including dividends) , against a market gain of about 32%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 18%, each year, over five years. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. Before forming an opinion on Thales you might want to consider these 3 valuation metrics.

A spokesperson for Thales told the Eagle that the company “is deeply sorry for the impact this problem has had on New Yorkers and their reliable use of the 7 Line under adverse weather conditions.”

“All our teams are fully resourced, mobilized and committed to deliver and deploy the solution as quickly as possible in order to offer New York commuters the best level of service and avoid speed reductions in such weather conditions,” the spokesperson continued.

This isn’t the first time that Thales’ transponders have been foiled by inclement weather, according to Byford. The company has been aware of the transponder issue since March 2019 and has been working on installing plastic covers on its transponders. However, in his letter, Byford called that solution “too slow, inadequate in its scope, and unacceptably ineffective. He also promised commercial consequences for Thales if the issue is not quickly resolved.

There are 498 transponders on the No. 7 line, 110 of which are potentially at risk for snow/slush issues, Gothamist reported. A majority of the No. 7 line’s Queens stations are located outdoors.

Byford contrasted Thales’ transponders to those installed by Thales’ competitor Siemens on the L line, another partially outdoor line that is the only other line in the system that operates via CBTC. Those transponders, Byford said, have “worked flawlessly on the L line under identical weather conditions.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.5899547338485718}",neutral,0.5899547338485718,0

Slush shuts down subway's pricey new signaling system - New York Post,"Wed, 11 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDE5LzEyLzExL3NsdXNoLXNodXRzLWRvd24tc3Vid2F5cy1wcmljZXktbmV3LXNpZ25hbGluZy1zeXN0ZW0v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The MTA’s pricey new subway signaling system was done in by a little slush Wednesday morning, sending transit boss Andy Byford off the rails.

Transit officials said the Communication Based Train Control system, which is supposed to speed up service on the 7 line, was thwarted by wintry weather, bringing eight trains to a near-crawl.

The system was part of Byford’s plan to modernize the system, which otherwise relies on signaling technology that dates to the 1930s.

But Byford pointed the finger at Thales, the French company that built and installed the new system.

“I almost went through the f–king roof,” Byford told reporters after Wednesday’s glitch. “We need suppliers to give us equipment that works right out of the box.”

The MTA has spent $600 million on CBTC upgrades, with Thales’ portion of the contracts totaling $344 million.

The system, which went online in November 2018, is supposed to signal the exact location of trains so that more can run on a single line.

Byford insisted the problem was with Thales’ product and not the tech itself, because a CBTC system installed by Siemens on the L line has “worked flawlessly.”

Wednesday wasn’t the first time Thales’ system on the 7 line has been interrupted by snow gumming up its transponders — it was also shut down Dec. 2, he said.

Byford said Thales has known about the problem since March, but has failed to fix it.

The company has begun putting covers on the 498 transponders that are out in the open, but Byford said that work isn’t been done fast enough. Eighty were covered after the Dec. 2 malfunction, and 40 more after Wednesday’s mishap, the MTA said.

“This failure is wholly inexcusable and constitutes a woeful inability on the part of Thales to address a known issue within an acceptable timeframe,” Byford wrote in a terse letter to Thales executive vice president of ground transportation Millar Crawford.

He said he also met Wednesday with Gregoire Sulmont, head of Thales’ New York operations, for “an extremely robust meeting where it was made crystal clear to him that this situation has to be resolved.”

A Thales spokesperson said in an email Wednesday that the company was “deeply sorry for the impact this problem has had on New Yorkers.”

“All our teams are fully resourced, mobilized and committed to deliver and deploy the solution as quickly as possible,” the statement said.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.5989020466804504}",negative,0.5989020466804504,-1

The F110 frigates will be fitted with the CAPTAS 4 compact and the BlueMaster sonars, and the BlueScan digital acoustic system for anti-submarine warfare (ASW) capability.

They will be integrated through Navantia’s combat management system SCOMBA F110 and will enable the service to conduct maritime surveillance, search and protection missions in any theater of operations.

BlueScan is a collaborative ASW solution that processes significantly higher volumes of sonar data from various different platforms to provide the operator with a complete overview of the acoustic situation in real time. The solution leverages big data analytics and artificial intelligence technologies to bring naval forces a tactical advantage.

Under this contract, key underwater acoustics technology will be transferred to Spanish industry, in particular for the supply of the TUUM-6 digital underwater communication system and acoustic arrays.

“After two years of talks with the Spanish Navy and Navantia about this contract to equip five F110 frigates, we welcome Spain’s decision to join other NATO countries (the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Norway) and Australia in placing their trust in Thales for their anti-submarine warfare (ASW) capabilities,” Alexis Morel, Vice President, Underwater Systems, Thales.

Navantia will build the five frigates under a 4.3 billion euro contract which was approved by the defense ministry in December 2018.

The first ship of the new class is expected to be delivered in 2025 and the final one 2030 or 2031.

In addition to ASW sonars, the frigates will receive new solid-state S-band radars delivered by Lockheed Martin.

The ships will be 145 meters long and displace 6,100 tons. Equipped with a 5-inch main gun, Harpoon missiles, torpedo launchers, two 30mm guns and a 16-cell vertical launch system, the F-110 frigates will be replacing the Spanish Navy’s Santa Maria-class frigates.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999057054519653}",neutral,0.9999057054519653,0

CHEOPS: characterizing exoplanets

CHEOPS is an exceptional European scientific mission, developed through a partnership between the European Space Agency (ESA) and Switzerland. Designed to characterize exoplanets (planets outside our solar system), this satellite will observe the suns around which these planets revolve, in order to measure the slight variations in brightness induced by the passage of a planet in front of the stellar disk. Engineers at Thales Alenia Space in Switzerland played a significant role on this program, working throughout the AIT (assembly, integration, testing) phase in Spain to support Airbus Defence & Space teams.

Leonardo as well played a crucial role in the CHEOPS mission by providing the “eyes” of the satellite. Through the collaboration with INAF Padova and Catania, Leonardo designed and produced the telescope’s optical system that will enable the mission to study the characteristics of extrasolar planets

China Eastern Airlines took delivery of the first aircraft with this option installed on 18 December 2019. The system, developed by Thales and certified by EASA last month, brings pinch-zoom and panning gesture controls familiar to smartphone and tablet users the world over on to the flight deck for the first time in a commercial aircraft.

Thales’s integrated touchscreen is the first touchscreen to be certified by EASA for commercial aviation, on A350. It is a landmark in the cockpit evolution offering pilots a new user experience and enabling airlines to accelerate their digital transformation thanks to our long-term partnership with Airbus. – Jean-Paul Ebanga, Vice President, Flight Avionics, Thales

The A350 flight deck interface includes six large LCD screens. With the touch screen option three of these – the outside pair and the bottom center screen – become interactive. The screens integrate with an electronic flight bag application to ease a number of common pilot tasks. Airbus highlights a trio of usage scenarios where the touch screens are expected to reduce pilot workload and improve interaction between the crew:

Before take-off: for computing take-off performance while entering data into the flight management system “FMS”

In-flight/cruise: for accessing en-route navigation charts

During approach preparation: for consulting the terminal charts before entering FMS data

The flight deck is not a forgiving work environment and the touch screen hardware involved must meet stringent requirements. Among the challenges Thales identified, the new screens must offer low reflectivity, operate in dense electromagnetic environments, withstand high levels of vibration and sustain their high performance characteristics throughout the product lifecycle.

The system must also remain usable and precisely track inputs even during turbulence or other challenging flight scenarios. Less critical to certification, but perhaps more significant to crew, will be the screens’ resistance to fingerprints and smudges.

The touch screen option is the second major upgrade to flight control systems introduced by Thales in recent weeks. In late November the company announced its PureFlyt flight management system. That solution is still a ways out from flying (ETA for certification is 2024) but it is another way Thales is modernizing the flight deck experience.

Thales Alenia Space confirms position at forefront of space robotics

Cannes, December 11, 2019 – The I3DS project coordinated by Thales Alenia Space within the scope of the European Commission’s vast Horizon 2020 research program, won an Etoiles de l’Europe (“Stars of Europe”) award at the 7th annual ceremony, held yesterday in Paris, with the French Minister of Higher Education, Research and Innovation, Frédérique Vidal, in attendance.

Sensors for tomorrow’s space robotics

The I3DS project was tasked with developing a suite of sensors for space exploration missions. A European Commission H2020 project, it was conducted by Thales Alenia Space in collaboration with European partners, and was successfully completed in February 2019. In particular, I3DS enabled the development of the navigation systems needed for tomorrow’s robotic systems. The idea was to design a dozen sensors, along with a control unit, capable of carrying out measurements in three dimensions and in real time. Above all, the I3DS concept is intended for missions involving a rendezvous with another vehicle or an object in space to support Thales Alenia Space’s new In-Orbit Servicing* solution, or to allow the return of samples from other planets. The same suite of sensors could also be mounted on vehicles such as the rover used in the ExoMars 2020 mission, or on an “astromobile” for lunar exploration. The innovative solutions used on I3DS include cameras fitted with light or laser flashes, designed to take measurements in the visible or infrared bandwidths, along with sensors for mechanical contact measurements. Bringing together mechanical, electronic, computer and optical technologies, the I3DS project successfully integrated these basic building blocks to build two demonstrators: an orbital module and an astromobile.

The Etoiles de l’Europe award for this H2020 project was given to Sabrina Andiappane, as manager of the Thales Alenia Space team that coordinated I3DS.

“I’m very proud that our H2020 project I3DS, combining robotics and space technologies, was recognized at the seventh Trophée des Etoiles awards ceremony,” said Patrick Mauté, Chief Technical Officer of Thales Alenia Space. “At the recent ESA Ministerial meeting, member states approved the development of extraordinary exploration missions, such as the Lunar Orbital Gateway, dedicated to lunar exploration, and Mars Sample Return, an iconic mission that aims to bring Martian soil samples back to Earth. In both cases, the technologies developed through the I3DS project will be used as basic building blocks to design tomorrow’s robotic space systems.”

*In-Orbit Servicing: spacecraft designed for In-Orbit Servicing will be able to carry out a wide range of operations in orbit, including deorbiting space debris, robotic manipulation, extending the service life of satellites, refueling in orbit, inspections and much more. These new vehicles represent a real paradigm shift in space: upcoming systems will no longer be “abandoned to their fate” once in orbit, but can evolve over their lifetime. Thales Alenia Space is one of the leading pioneers in the trend towards In-Orbit Servicing, which signals the advent of a new approach to space access. When humanity considers the possibility of building lunar bases sometime in the future, the company’s I3DS and In-Orbit Servicing technologies will underpin the solutions developed to transport and assemble the constituent elements.

Maritime Autonomy autonomous systems Artificial intelligence Share this article



LinkedIn

Earlier this year, Thales and the University of Southampton announced they had formed a major partnership to collaborate in the research and development of the next generation of maritime autonomous systems. Ten months in we have caught up with Professor Stephen Turnock to hear more about the uses of autonomous technology at sea and what the joint team have been working on.

What opportunities do you see for autonomy in the maritime environment?

“There’s a whole range of opportunities across the spectrum of human maritime activity, for autonomous systems to replace people operating in dangerous environments, and there are opportunities where there's the factor of cost.

“If you look at the marine renewables sector, we already have thousands of offshore wind turbine structures been installed, with many hundreds of kilometres of sub-sea cabling as well as the vital electrical interconnects, optical fibres, oil and gas pipelines to name just a few. How we look after that infrastructure in a cost-effective way will drive new markets for products and services.



“Managing fishing stocks and quotas at the moment is a fairly costly with a costly patrol vessel only a pinprick across the wide ocean, but if you can use cheaper vehicles continuously stationed at sea to monitor what’s going on and collect evidence, we’ll have a better insight into what's happening.”

Professor Stephen Turnock

Stephen was also excited at the prospect of autonomy enabling leaner manning in larger ships, cutting monotonous chores and 24-hour watches while creating a new breed of experts who would embark and disembark only when needed for particular tasks, spending less time away from home.

Maritime autonomy could play an ecological role in keeping the seas cleaner by enforcing a cleaner carbon agenda, with drones able to “sniff” the exhaust of ships to determine if they were burning illegal, dirty fuels.

Currently, removing plastics from the oceans using manned vessels is too expensive, but Dr Turnock believes that autonomous vessels, free from the need to transit to and from clean-up areas for refueling or crew changes, and using appropriate sensors and mapping technology, scavenging their energy from wind, waves and solar could stay on station in accumulation areas, making clean-up operations cost effective.

What is the team currently working on?

“Most recently the team from Thales and the University of Southampton has been focused on a particular challenge, getting vehicles in multiple domains to work together in a secure way and making better use of human resources. At the moment, a mission using an autonomous system requires many people to prepare and operate a single vehicle,”

“The future will require many different vehicles collaborating in the maritime environment with some operating in the air, some underwater and some on the surface. Missions will not be cost-effective unless we can work out ways of how to be much more productive, with fewer people operating more vehicles whilst being able to trust that the mission will be completed in a safe and secure manner. This is at the heart of our recent research trials led by Dr Jon Downes”

Thales and the University of Southampton are currently looking for PhD students in the following areas.

• Effective Fusion of Spatially and Temporally Sparse Data

• Supporting Accountable Decision Making of Humans in Human Machine Teams

QUEENS, NY — Wednesday's slushy snow storm was too much for subway infrastructure along the 7 line, slowing trains to a crawl during morning rush hour, MTA officials said.

Slush covered transponders that sit on the tracks, part of the 7 line's pricey new signal system installed last year, thwarting their ability to communicate the exact location of several trains. As a precautionary measure, eight trains slowed to 25 miles per hour from their typical pace of 45 to 50 mph, Gothamist reported.

While the transponders are a key component of the line's new signal system, called communications-based train control or CBTC, NYC Transit President Andy Byford says the blame lies not with the technology but with Thales, the company that provided the infrastructure. Byford claims Thales has known about its transponders' inability to deal with slush since March 2019 but has been slow to solve the issue by covering the equipment.

Similar problems hit the 7 line just over a week ago when a light dusting of snow fell on the city. ""This failure is wholly inexcusable and constitutes a woeful inability on the part of Thales to address a known issue within an acceptable timeframe,"" Byford wrote in a Dec. 11 letter to the company.

""While I'm aware that work has been undertaken to provide protective covers on a number of transponders, that remedy has been too slow, inadequate in its scope and unacceptably ineffective."" Byford threatened ""severe commercial consequences"" if the company doesn't immediately remedy the situation.

Thales has a $344 million contract with the transit authority to provide the signal equipment, according to the New York Post. A Thales spokesperson said the company ""is deeply sorry for the impact this problem has had on New Yorkers and their reliable use of the 7 Line under adverse weather conditions,"" the Post reported.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.5737835168838501}",negative,0.5737835168838501,-1

Polish Navy Commissioned OPV After Waiting for 18 Years - Naval Post,"Tue, 03 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vbmF2YWxwb3N0LmNvbS9wb2xpc2gtbmF2eS1jb21taXNzaW9uZWQtb3B2LWFmdGVyLXdhaXRpbmctZm9yLTE4LXllYXJzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Polish navy has commissioned new offshore patrol vessel (OPV) dubbed as “ORP Ślązak” (Pennant Number : 241) 18 years after the keel-laying ceremony, Polish Ministry of Defence announced via Twitter on 28th November.

“We witnessed a historic moment. It is important for the Navy to develop ” said the head of the Ministry of National Defense Mariusz Błaszczak in the port of Gdynia.

Slazak was initially expected to be the first ship of a new class of Gawron-class corvettes. Despite the vessel’s hull being launched in 2009, the entire project was cancelled in 2012. The government subsequently made the decision to convert the corvette into an offshore patrol vessel.

Originally Ślązak was designed to be a multi-mission corvette with anti-aircraft and ASW assets, as well as anti-ship missiles, integrated onboard. The keel for that vessel was laid back in 2001. Back then no decision was made with regards to missile systems and combat system. With the project being financially understated since the very beginning, this has been the cause of prolonged build. Numerous technical issues were troubling the builders during the process. Financing was also being limited, despite the fact that it has been insufficient since the very beginning of the process.

The converted vessel was to be delivered to the navy by November 2016. After that deadline was not met, Polish media reports indicated July 2018 as the new delivery date. Long story ended at 28th November and the ship is delivered to Polish Navy.

ORP Ślązak will become part of the Polish Navy’s 3rd Ship Flotilla, its main strike force.

Thales Group Realized the Vision of Polish Navy :

To realize its vision the Polish Navy turned to Thales for a robust patrol capability. They had already collaborated on Poland’s Orkan class fast attack craft, bringing Thales’s breadth of systems know-how, and long experience in equipping leading navies, to the Polish fleet. Among the carefully scrutinised competitors for this project, the navy considered that Thales’s approach of combining technical excellence with a long-term commitment to its customers was the right fit to its values of technical rigour and deep understanding of its systems.

Building on an already successful partnership, the navy selected Thales to supply and integrate the entire mission suite for ORP Ślązak. The scope of the work was considerable, with Thales’s Tacticos Combat Management System (CMS)—with its open architecture and latest-sensor design—central to successfully integrating a range of leading-edge equipment on board. Thales’s Sting-EO Mk2 Fire control Radar, MIRADOR electro-optical system for observation and target tracking, LINK 11/16 tactical data link system, Automatic Identification System (AIS), and CCTV, are also integrated into the vessel.

ORP Ślązak was delivered to Polish Navy placed in Thales as its main systems partner borne out in successful and highly satisfactory acceptance tests. The ship’s commissioning represents another milestone in Poland’s enhancement of its maritime capability, and in Thales’s developing role in helping deliver this.

Polish Navy’s partnership with Thales seems to continue, with an upgrade of the Orkan class ships currently under exploration.

"India a 'melting pot' of ideas, Thales discovering new opportunities: CEO - Business Standard","Sun, 01 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzcy1zdGFuZGFyZC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9wdGktc3Rvcmllcy9pbmRpYS1pcy1hYm91dC1jb21wZXRlbmNpZXMtYml6LXByb3NwZWN0cy1kaXNjb3ZlcmluZy1uZXctb3Bwb3J0dW5pdGllcy10aGFsZXMtMTE5MTIwMTAwMjk3XzEuaHRtbNIBnAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzcy1zdGFuZGFyZC5jb20vYW1wL2FydGljbGUvcHRpLXN0b3JpZXMvaW5kaWEtaXMtYWJvdXQtY29tcGV0ZW5jaWVzLWJpei1wcm9zcGVjdHMtZGlzY292ZXJpbmctbmV3LW9wcG9ydHVuaXRpZXMtdGhhbGVzLTExOTEyMDEwMDI5N18xLmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Expanding its presence in India, which is an ""interesting melting pot"" of ideas, Thales Group is discovering new opportunities in the Indian market as it is about competencies as well as business prospects, according to a senior official.

Thales Chief Technology Officer Marko Erman said India is scientifically a very mature country with big ambitions and the company is increasing the number of people working in the country to explore more innovative activities.

The sprawling French Group, with interests in aeronautics, defence, space, transport, digital identity and security segments, already has more than 1,500 employees, including at its joint ventures, besides two engineering centres in India.

""India is very important for us. It is not just about competencies but also about the business prospects there. I think the pluses override the minuses.

""... the software, data competencies are very relevant. This has already contributed to the business... We have been increasing a lot. We are learning how to connect local forces to Thales. On the agenda is how do we expand our engineering,"" Erman told PTI in an interview here.

Present in India for more than 65 years, Thales has joint ventures with Indian players, including Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL), Bharat Electronics Ltd (BEL) and L&T Technology Services.

""There is still room for expansion on that one (open source hardware). That is on the short term. With greater presence in India, we are also discovering new opportunities... We will add initiatives but will discover what makes more sense for our partners and our interests,"" he said.

Describing India as an ""interesting melting pot"" of ideas, Erman said Thales is spending time at the highest level of the management to learn more about the country as it then would be much easier to do business.

When asked about projects related to India, especially in the digital innovation space, Erman said Thales is in a phase of increasing its footprint in engineering and development in India.

""Part of it is in digital. It is a recognition of talent and importance of the country for Thales globally... India has a few places where there are strong open source hardware initiatives. This is a field we are entering into today. We are cooperating with one of the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT),"" Erman noted.

Thales has been present in India since 1953. Its two engineering centres in India is spread across three locations -- Noida and Gurgaon in the National Capital Region (NCR), and Bengaluru. The centre in NCR is focused on digital identity and security, while the one in Bengaluru, started in February 2019, is into defence, aerospace and transportation.

""We are increasing our engineering footprint, digital competencies... we are moving towards innovation-driven approach with India as well. We are increasing the number of Thales people working in India to explore more innovative activities,"" Erman said.

According to him, the engineering footprint is not just about using Indian talent but hopefully grabbing Indian ideas, Indian innovation as well. There are local innovations and would like to make these available for Thales as well as bring value to the country, he noted.

""This is a scientifically very mature country (India) with big ambitions,"" he said even as he added that the country is very different, the processes can be slow to its standards and ""slow may be because we don't understand... that is on the difficult part"".

""I think the perception of time in India is different from the perception of time in Europe. So, things might take time... Surely, it is a country different from the country we are born or working in,"" he emphasised.

On the positive side, India is open to many countries. Despite the gap in how different the countries are, India is open to Europe and is a kind of open market, he said.

The French group generated 19 billion euros in 2019 and had 80,000 employees across 80 countries.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.5605322122573853}",neutral,0.5605322122573853,0

Agency boss Dr Megan Clarke (pictured) has been acive signing alliances and said its new agreement with space and defence giant Thales will further strengthen Australia’’s international space connections and create more local jobs.

Industry minister Karen Andrews said the agreement of strategic intent and co-operation with Thales was another step in the federal government’s plan to create opportunities for Australian industry.

She aid: “Engaging with big international players like Thales will allow Australian businesses, including our advanced manufacturers, to carve out a place in the international space supply chain.

“Space is very much an international game and for Australia to succeed we need to play to our strengths and have our businesses and researchers working co-operatively.”

Like most of the agreements to date there was little detail in the announcement of the hook up with Thales.

The statement was designed to mutually identify key areas of investment as well as potential research, development and commercial opportunities.

Chief executive of Thales Australia Chris Jenkins said: “Together, Thales and the Australian Space Agency can build and develop the Australian workforce and SME sector to meet the future needs of the growing space economy.”

The Australian Space Agency has signed agreements with major international companies such as Boeing, and Maxar Technologies, local businesses such as EM Solutions, satellite communications company Myriota, and XTEC Ltd.

One agreement that focused on a clear outcome was that with US space agency NASA, with that body’s Moon to Mars mission the focus.

An agreement signed with Canberra space, communications and defence company Electro Optic Systems (ASX: EOS) was a little more specific on intent.

EOS Space Systems will establish further laser ranging sensors across Australia to increase the volume of space objects they track from 10,000 to 100,000 each week.

NileSat CEO Ahmed Anis and Martin Van Schaik, Senior Vice President at Thales Alenia Space, inked the deal yesterday.

Ahmed Anis said the signing of the deal follows the selection and approval of Thales Alenia Space as the prime contractor by the Board of Directors of NileSat over four other foreign satellite manufacturers that submitted bids.

The process of developing the new satellite began almost three years ago, Anis said, adding that feasibility and technical studies took about two and a half years.

Space in Africa had earlier reported that NileSat formed a selection committee comprising of industry experts and an international consultant to evaluate the bids submitted by satellite manufacturers to ensure it secured the latest technology at a budget price of USD 300 million, citing a statement released by the Cairo Stock Exchange.

With a development timeline of 25 months, NileSat 301 is planned for launch in January 2022, replacing NileSat 201 which will near the end of life in 2025.

The satellite will have a minimum lifespan of 15 years in orbit and will deliver communications and satellite broadband services to Egypt and neighbouring countries in North Africa and the Middle East.

NileSat has reportedly secured additional frequencies under a lease agreement with French satellite operator Eutelsat.

NileSat 301 will be NileSat’s fourth satellite in space. The first, NileSat 101, was launched into space in 1998, followed by NileSat 102 which was launched two years later. Both satellites were built by the defunct French aerospace company Matra Marconi, now Airbus Defence and Space. NileSat’s third satellite, NileSat 201, was built by Thales Alenia Space.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999988079071045}",neutral,0.9999988079071045,0
