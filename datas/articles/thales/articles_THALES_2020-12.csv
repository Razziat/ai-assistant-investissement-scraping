Thales Working on SAMDIS Sonar Integration Aboard A18-M UUV - Naval News,"Fri, 04 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdmFsbmV3cy5jb20vbmF2YWwtbmV3cy8yMDIwLzEyL3RoYWxlcy13b3JraW5nLW9uLXNhbWRpcy1zb25hci1pbnRlZ3JhdGlvbi1hYm9hcmQtYS0xOG0tdXV2L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales Working on SAMDIS Sonar Integration Aboard A18-M UUV Thales is currently looking at integrating its SAMDIS sonar aboard ECA Group's A18M UUV as part of the SLAMF/MMCM mine warfare program.

The information surfaced last week during conference call between Thales and several media outlets about the latest contract award for the SLAMF/MMCM program.

As we recently reported, the A27 Espadon UUV was used for the demonstration phase of SLAMF/MMCM. The exact type of AUV that will be procured for the program still needs to be formally confirmed as it was just turned down by the Royal Navy. Details of this initially surfaced in an “information report” on the ten years of the Lancaster House agreements by two French MPs. You may read more about this, including the likely reasons why the A27 was turned down by the Royal Navy at this link.

During the conference call on 27 November, Naval News asked Alexis Morel, Vice President – General manager, Underwater Systems business line at Thales, whether one of the solution being considered by Thales is the integration of the SAMDIS sonar aboard ECA Group’s new A18M UUV or if this is not technically feasible. Morel replied “it is technically feasible and it is one of the solutions that we are studying”. Alexis Morel could not comment on the other solutions being studied.

A18M UUV

A-18M UUV. ECA Picture.

A18M is ECA Group’s latest generation of mid-size UUV and is one generation ahead of the A27 used for the demonstration phase of SLAMF/MMCM. The A18M was already selected by the Belgian Navy and Royal Netherlands Navy for the rMCM program and by the Latvian Naval Forces for the upgrade of existing minehunters. In addition, the A18M is much smaller and lighter compared to the A27 UUV.

SAMDIS

SAMDIS, is Thales’ latest-generation high-resolution synthetic aperture sonar. With its multi-aspect functionality, the SAMDIS sonar views targets from three different angles. According to the French defense company, only Thales’s multi-aspect technology is capable of delivering high detection and classification performance against modern mines. Thales recently announced that it won a contract for the delivery of SAMDIS sonar systems for the JMSDF’s OZZ-5 UUV. SAMDIS technology has also been selected for two export program in Asia.

Specific French Navy need for “stealthy mine warfare”

The A27 UUV by ECA Group with Thales SAMDIS payload onboard.

As we previously reported, based on several French and British sources, the Royal Navy found the A27 AUV as being too large and heavy (at 1 ton) since the early stages of the program. Reason for which, the service last summer issued a pre-contract information notice (PIN), in order to procure three UUV to conduct mine warfare missions from USV.

But the requirement for a larger UUV appear to have come from French Navy requirements:

“The role of the surface drone as an ‘underwater drone taxicab’ is a function that the Belgians requested and which answers a Belgian need but which does not answer the French need. The underwater drone [ed. note: for SLAMF program] is used for long transits, for amphibious operations. As a consequence, France and the UK would like to have a drone with long endurance, with a lot of reach to be able to reach very discreetly a theater of operation. Nowadays if you have a small boat with a nice acoustic and electromagnetic signature, you are not very stealthy. The Belgians are interested in this cab function, France is not interested in it. That is why we need for France an [underwater] drone with very long endurance.”



Alexis Morel, Vice President – General manager, Underwater Systems business line at Thales

Morel added that Thales’s role will be to integrate the future UUV in the global SLAMF and MMCM system no matter what the French and Royal Navy end up selecting for their UUV solution. Naval News understands that the French Navy and Royal Navy may end up with different UUVs. The final decision of each navy should be announced in 2021.

MMCM / SLAMF in details

With the recent contract award, Thales will launch the production of the SLAMF (Système de lutte anti-mines futur) / MMCM (Maritime Mine Counter Measures) program, under Phase 2. Phase 1 initiated in 2015 was to demonstrate and qualify the technology. The SLAMF / MMCM mine warfare system will allow French and British sailors to operate remotely and stay out of the mine field through the use of unmanned systems.

Here is in details what Thales, together with its main partners (ECA Group, L3Harris and Saab) is set to deliver to each navy from 2022:

What about the SLAMF / MMCM Motherships ?







Artist impressions / rendering (screencaptures from a video) shown during the Forum Innovation Defense organized this week by France’s DGA. It is not clear if this vessel if the BGDM, BBPD NG or just a vessel of opportunity.

In addition to eight Unmanned systems (details above) including 4 to be delivered by 2024, the French SLAMF program consists in:

6x motherships for UAV/USV/UUV known as “bâtiments de guerre des mines” (BGDM)

5x EOD divers support vessels known as “bâtiments base plongeurs démineurs nouvelle generation” (BBPD NG)

1x Mine Warfare Data Operating System (SEDGM).Mine Warfare Data Operating System (SEDGM).

During the Forum Innovation Defense organized this week by France’s DGA, the first “previews” of the BGDM mothership were shown in a video about the SLAMF program (pictures above). Whether this is the final design of the vessel remains to be seen. It seems unlikely because the vessel appears to be very basic, similar to an offshore supply vessel. According to French blogger Fauteuil de Colbert, this could actually be representative of the BBPD NG.

On the British side, information came out this week that the new Type 32 will serve as mothership for unmanned systems."
Thales Alenia Space Delivers Euclid High Gain Antenna For Satellite Integration – SatNews - SatNews,"Thu, 10 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5zYXRuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDIwLzEyLzEwL3RoYWxlcy1hbGVuaWEtc3BhY2UtZGVsaXZlcnMtZXVjbGlkLWhpZ2gtZ2Fpbi1hbnRlbm5hLWZvci1zYXRlbGxpdGUtaW50ZWdyYXRpb24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales Alenia Space, a joint venture between Thales (67%) and Leonardo (33%), has delivered the K-band high gain antenna to be integrated with the rest of the Euclid satellite in its plant in Turin.

Thales Alenia Space in Spain is responsible for the deep space communications system, which comprises the communications panel delivered in 2019 and the high gain antenna, built by Thales Alenia Space in Rome. Thales Alenia Space in Italy is the satellite prime contractor of the Euclid mission and also responsible for the service module while Airbus in France as main industrial partner is developing the instrument.

Euclid, an astronomy and astrophysics mission of the European Space Agency (ESA) scheduled for launch in 2022 on a Soyuz rocket from Europe’s Spaceport in French Guiana, will survey the sky with a 1.2 m diameter space telescope to explore dark energy and dark matter and understand the origin of the accelerating expansion of the Universe. Euclid will map the general structure of the Universe over 10 billion light years to show its expansion and growth during the last three-quarters of its history.

The mission is designed to address two of the most important questions in cosmology today: How did the Universe originate and why is it expanding at an accelerating rate, rather than slowing down due to the gravitational attraction of its constituent matter?

Communicating at 1.5 million kilometers, Euclid will map the 3D distribution of up to two billion galaxies and associated dark matter during a six-year mission, covering most of the observable sky outside our Milky Way. The complete survey consists of 150 thousands high definition images with associated color and spectral information, resulting in close to a petabyte of data to be downlinked.

This huge amount of data will be transmitted by the satellite from its orbit around the L2 Sun-Earth Lagrangian point at a distance of 1.5 million kilometers from the Earth using its K-band (26 GHz) radiofrequency data transmission system to the ESA’s 35m deep space stations located in Cebreros, Spain, and Malargüe, Argentina. Euclid also incorporates an X-band system to control and monitor the spacecraft, and measure its distance to Earth.

Eduardo Bellido

The contract for the development of Euclid’s communications system has been one of the largest contracts of the company in its 30 years of activity in Spain. Eduardo Bellido, CEO of Thales Alenia Space in Spain, said, “The high gain antenna completes the delivery of the communications system in this important mission, one of the flagship programs of the European Space Agency, which will help us improve our understanding of the Universe. A milestone of which we are very proud and that consolidates Thales Alenia Space in Spain as a European reference in space communication systems.”"
"Thales, G+D, ST Micro Lead eSIM Enablement Landscape - Counterpoint - Counterpoint Research","Wed, 16 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvdW50ZXJwb2ludHJlc2VhcmNoLmNvbS9pbnNpZ2h0cy90aGFsZXMtZ2Qtc3QtbWljcm8tbGVhZC1lc2ltLWVuYWJsZW1lbnQtbGFuZHNjYXBlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"While Idemia, Valid and Truphone are fast-emerging enablers with growing reach, Workz and software-based eSIM providers Kigen and Oasis are this year’s dark horses in the eSIM enablement space

Seoul, Hong Kong, New Delhi, Beijing, London, Buenos Aires, San Diego – December 16, 2020

More than 6 billion eSIM (eUICC- and iUICC-based) capable devices will be shipped cumulatively over the next five years, according to the latest research from Counterpoint’s ETO (Emerging Technology Opportunities) Service. The uptake of eSIMs is poised to grow across a gamut of connected devices over the next decade, led by the flexibility, cost efficiency, security and other myriad benefits offered by the technology.

Commenting on the key eSIM technologies, Senior Analyst Karan Dasaor said, “The eSIM enablement space continues to hum with activity, with an array of companies offering eSIM solutions for diverse applications. These companies fall into three broad categories: 1) eUICC OS embedded in a hardware-based tamper-proof MFF2 or Wafer Level Chip Scale Packaging (WLCSP), miniaturized leadless package form-factors soldered into the PCBs; 2) Software-based eUICC in TEE (Trusted Execution Environment), sometimes called as soft-SIM or virtual SIM; 3) The relatively newer space of integrated UICCs, also called iSIM or iUICC, where the iUICC OS is integrated into a secure enclave within the System-on-Chip (SoC).”

“As it stands, only the hardware-based MFF2 and WLCSP form-factors are compliant with the security standards defined in GSMA’s SGPv.01/02/21/22 specs. Vendors engaged in supplying these chips are required to be GSMA SAS-UP (Security Accreditation Scheme for UICC Production) certified. Non-compliant proprietary software-based eSIM solutions (mostly iSIM and soft-SIM) are available from various ecosystem players, including component vendors, device manufacturers and operators. The iSIM is seeing a rising adoption, particularly in IoT applications, and is being evaluated to make it a part of GSMA specifications in future. On the other hand, the soft-SIM has seen greater adoption in markets such as China, within smartphones for international roaming services monetization by OEMs, and in IoT applications which are not that security-sensitive.”

Counterpoint has used its proprietary CORE (COmpetitive Ranking and Evaluation) framework to help the industry better understand and identify key players driving the thriving eSIM ecosystem. The deep-dive analysis and evaluation focuses on the relevant capabilities based on several interviews with different players. It showcases their strengths, ecosystem reach and several other criteria.

Companies such as Thales, G+D (Giesecke & Devrient), IDEMIA and VALID are the leading hardware-based eSIM enablement players integrating their GSMA-compliant eUICC OS into the MFF2/WLCSP chipsets supplied by the likes of ST Micro, Infineon and NXP. Players such as Truphone, Kigen (Arm spinoff), Oasis and RedteaMobile have also partnered with chipset players, module vendors, device OEMs and MNOs to offer eSIM and iSIM solutions expanding the supplier landscape.

Commenting on the competitive landscape, Research Vice-President Neil Shah said, “Conventional SIM card players Thales and G+D continue to lead the eSIM enablement race, driven by end-to-end secure GSMA certified eSIM solutions, technology contribution, diverse partnerships across the value chain and growing customer base. They are followed by IDEMIA and VALID in third and fourth spots respectively, scoring well across the board. Wuhan Tianyu, which is among the handful of Chinese vendors fully compliant with GSMA’s SAS-UP and SAS-SM certifications, has taken notable strides towards eSIM applications leveraging the IoT boom in China.”

Shah added, “The upstart eUICC players such as Kigen, Oasis and Workz are the dark horses looking to challenge the leaders with unique offerings, broadening partner and customer base with greater focus on IoT applications.”

Semiconductor companies such as STMicroelectronics, NXP and Infineon have been the key suppliers of secure hardware eSIM chipsets, partnering with the eUICC OS vendors as above and in some cases having own in-house integrated solutions. ST Micro, for instance, has seen a marked growth in its eSIM solution adoption for consumer and IoT deployments, whereas Infineon has been the key supplier for eSIM in mobility applications.

Commenting on the future evolution of eSIM form-factors, Research Director Dale Gai added, “Players such as Sony Semiconductor (Altair Semi), Sequans and Qualcomm have played a key role in driving iUICC implementations in partnership with different ecosystem players to bring iSIM solutions across IoT applications. As we move towards the iSIM era, players designing SoCs, from Qualcomm to MediaTek to Apple, will dominate and drive the integrated SIM capabilities within their chipsets, helping save board space, and have more control with the ability to scale across consumer, mobility and IoT applications.”

Paris. The European arms procurement agency signed Nov. 16 a contract worth some €300 million ($358 million) with Thales to build an unmanned surface and underwater minehunter system for the British and French navies, a source close to the deal said Nov. 27.

A production deal for an operational system, dubbed Maritime Mine Counter Measure, was seen as giving the British and French partners an edge in a highly competitive world market, with US industry the closest competitor.

The British part of the program was worth £184 million, the UK ministry of defense said in a Nov. 26 statement. That will cover four systems and service.

The overall value of the order was some €300 million, with the French part making up the rest, the source said.

The French armed forces minister, Florence Parly, said Nov. 26 the MMCM deal marked close ties between Britain and France fostered by the Lancaster House defense treaty signed 10 years ago.

“So, we are proud, with secretary (Ben) Wallace, to announce today, before the community of the Franco-British Council, the signing, which took place November 16, of a production contract for the Franco-British minehunter program,” she said at the opening of the virtual meeting of the high-level defense council.

The MMCM deal directly supported the French deterrence and helped “guarantee our sovereignty,” she said. “The proof, if any were needed, that combining our forces does not threaten our independence.”

Minehunters played a vital role in clearing the waters for the nuclear ballistic missile submarine and aircraft carrier, as well protecting ports, deployment of the naval task force, and sweeping contested waters, the French defense ministry said in a statement.

The MMCM unmanned system will eventually replace the present fleet of minehunters sailed by the Royal Navy and the French sister service.

France made an initial order for three systems, with the fourth to be placed next year. The latter order will be for the prototype with upgrades, including doubling the depth of an undersea drone to 200 meters.

The MMCM phase 2 order comprised eight systems, equally split between France and the UK, and followed a phase 1 2015 development contract worth €165 million. BAE Systems had been a partner on the initial deal but left in 2016.

Thales was prime contractor, with ECA, Kongsberg, L3 Harris, and Saab among subcontractors on the development contract. Thales signed the phase 2 contract with the European procurement agency Organisation Conjointe de Coopération en matière d’Armement (OCCAr).

Thales designed the system and will supply its SAMDIS sonar, the company said in a statement.

An MMCM system can cover an area as large as 30,000 football grounds and detect threats as small as a credit card, Alexis Morel, Thales vice president for underwater systems, said Nov. 27 in a telephone press conference. The British and French play soccer, so there was no confusion over feet or meters, he said.

For France, a new system will consist of one 12-meter long unmanned boat from L3 Harris and Thales, dubbed Unmanned Surface Vehicle, linked to a towed Thales sonar to detect and locate mines, and a Saab Remote Operated Vehicle (ROV) to place charges and destroy threats.

There will be a mobile operations center, which can be airlifted by A400M or C-17. France has ordered a training simulator.

ECA supplied six Espadon A27 Autonomous Underwater Vehicle drones for the prototype systems for Britain and France. Each navy had a demonstrator system, with three ECA AUV drones on the system.

The Royal Navy accepted the three ECA drones on its demonstrator but is expected to open next year a tender for new drones for the production contract.

First delivery of the MMCM was due by end-2022, with last shipment in 2025.

There was close interest in the MMCM from navies around the world, including the US, Australia, India, and the United Arab Emirates, Morel said. There were potential sales of tens of systems by the end of the decade.

There was marketing advantage in supplying the system to the British and French navies, seen as first class services, he said. The system avoided use of US components to bypass Washington oversight over exports through the International Traffic in Arms Regulations.

“With this contract, French and British navies equip themselves with the world’s first fully integrated unmanned mine countermeasures system of systems,” Thales said in a statement.

In the UK, the MMCM deal will support 215 jobs at Thales operations in Somerset and Plymouth, while L3 Harris works in Portsmouth, the defense ministry said.

In France, Thales will work on the program in Brest, western France."

The Australian designed and developed technology is tailored to the unique requirements of the Royal Australian Navy with optimised operational capability in warm shallow water. This contract expands upon the ongoing sonar upgrade of the Collins Class being rolled out to the fleet which includes a full replacement of the prime sonar arrays of the submarine.

Thales press release

Australia’s Collins-class submarines will increase their operational effectiveness in hazardous, shallow waters through the delivery of sovereign Mine and Obstacle Avoidance Sonar (MOAS) and High Frequency Intercept Array (HFIA) systems.

Thales Australia and the Commonwealth of Australia (CoA) have signed a $23.7M contract to deliver these next generation systems on the Collins-class Submarines.

The Heron MOAS is an Australian designed and developed system and the result of more than 20 years of investment in Australia by Thales, the RAN and Defence Science and Technology to develop sonar systems tailored to Navy’s unique operating requirements.

Mine and obstacle avoidance capability is critical to sustain naval operations due to the rapidly evolving threat of mines, as well as other navigational hazards in the shallow, poorly charted waters that are prevalent throughout Australia’s maritime region.

The Herron system provides enhanced detection, coupled with a low false alarm rate, against dangers ranging from small mine-like objects to reefs, shoals, and hazardous objects like displaced shipping containers.

The High Frequency Intercept Array (HFIA) will enhance the submarine’s ability to detect high frequency emissions like sonars, and emerging undersea threats.

“These advanced systems are designed, developed, integrated and sustained in Australia. Enhancing our world leading sovereign industrial capability in sonar systems. Together, these contracts will support approximately 30 jobs at our Rydalmere site in western Sydney and additional jobs with our supply chain partners”.

Thales Alenia Space in the UK will lead the study to discover previously unseen pristine comets.

December 14, 2020 – In the UK, Thales Alenia Space, the joint venture between Thales (67%) and Leonardo (33%), has been selected by the European Space Agency (ESA) to lead one of two parallel studies for the Comet Interceptor mission.

The Comet Interceptor mission consists of one spacecraft and two small probes. It was selected by ESA in June 2019 to combine breakthrough technology in new comet discoveries to reveal information about pristine comets entering the inner Solar System or an interstellar object passing through the Solar System. The scientific mission was originally proposed by an international team led by UK academics from University College London and the University of Edinburgh, among others.

The three elements of the mission are a mothercraft, provided and operated by ESA and two small probes, (B1) provided by the Japanese Space Agency JAXA and (B2) by ESA, carried as payloads aboard the mothercraft.

The mission will launch in 2028 and wait in orbit for a suitable target; the composite spacecraft will travel together before the three modules separate a few days prior to intercepting the comet. Each module will be equipped with science instruments, providing different perspectives of the comet’s nucleus and its gas, dust, and plasma environment. Such ‘multi-point’ measurements will greatly improve the 3D information needed to understand the dynamic nature of a pristine comet while it is interacting with the constantly changing solar wind environment.

The mission’s instruments will be provided by consortia of research institutes and will draw on heritage from previous ESA missions such as Giotto and the currently flying ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter with its dust, fields and plasma instruments, as well as a mass spectrometer, like those that flew on Rosetta.

During the study phase, Thales Alenia Space in the UK will be responsible for the spacecraft design as well as the preparation for the development phase that encompass the Assembly Integration and Test of the space segment, the support for launch operations and commissioning in orbit. In order to secure the science of the mission, Thales Alenia Space in the UK will lead an international consortium composed of world class partners in critical areas for COMET-I. This team will include Thales Alenia Space in Italy and France for their unrivalled experience in Sun-Earth Lagrange2 mission, Thales Alenia Space in Spain for the Communications sub-system, and GMV for the sophisticated Guidance, Navigation & Control sub-system.

Science Minister Amanda Solloway said “The UK’s space industry is thriving and this out-of-this-world mission is testament to our world-leading expertise. I am very proud that scientists and engineers in Bristol and Harwell will be designing the Comet Interceptor spacecraft – their incredible work will not only further our understanding of the evolution of comets but help unlock the mysteries of the universe.”

Andrew Stanniland, CEO of Thales Alenia Space in the UK commented “I am delighted ESA has once again placed its trust in our scientists and engineers at Thales Alenia Space in the UK who have excellent heritage from previous scientific missions such as Giotto and Rosetta. We all look forward to supporting this exciting and unprecedented scientific mission to uncover more information about the origins of our Universe.”

Comet Interceptor.

Comet Interceptor has been selected by ESA’s Science Programme as a Fast track mission in its Cosmic Vision Programme for a nominal launch in 2028, on a shared Ariane 6.2 flight, with the ESA mission ARIEL. The ‘Fast’ refers to the implementation time, with a total development duration from selection to launch readiness of about eight years. F-class missions, which have a launch mass of less than 1000 kg, will share the ride into space with a medium-class mission, taking advantage of additional space in the launcher and the boost to the Sun-Earth Lagrange point L2, which is 1.5 million kilometers ‘behind’ Earth as viewed from the Sun.

A major step forward for the European reentry vehicle road map

Space Rider is Europe’s next-generation reusable transportation system for low Earth orbit

Turin, December 9, 2020 – Thales Alenia Space (Thales 67 %, Leonardo 33 %), and AVIO as co-contractor, signed a contract with the European Space Agency (ESA) for the development of the automated reusable Space Rider transportation system, designed for deployment by the new Vega C light launcher into low Earth orbit (LEO). The total worth of the contract is 167M€ .

Space Rider is Europe’s solution for its own affordable and reusable end-to-end integrated space transportation system for unmanned missions and for routine access and return from low orbit. It will be used to transport a variety of payloads into different low Earth orbit (LEO) altitudes and inclinations.

Designed as a free-flying orbital platform, Space Rider is capable of remaining two months in orbit, safely re-entering the atmosphere and landing on the ground with a precision of 150 metres. It can be recovered along with its payload, refurbished, and reused for up to six missions.

Leading a consortium of European manufacturers, research centers and universities, Thales Alenia Space is responsible for the development of the reentry module (RM), the most challenging of the project derived from the IXV, experimental space shuttle made in Italy with the strong support from the Italian space agency ASI and tested in 2015. AVIO is in charge of the propulsions system and the expendable service module. Space Rider will be launched into space aboard the Vega C launcher, developed by AVIO for the European Space Agency.

“Space Rider will pave the way for Europe to a more accessible and agile use of Space in Low Orbit and the contract signed today demonstrates once more Thales Alenia Space’s leading role in atmospheric reentry systems, since it combines the capabilities of orbital free-flying satellite platforms with reusability, and marks a crucial step of great technological value for European space industry” – said Massimo Claudio Comparini Senior Executive Vice President Observation, Exploration and Navigation at Thales Alenia Space. “It will confirm that Thales Alenia Space is mastering all the technologies needed to further explore the Moon, Mars, and beyond in the Universe, and that the company is now ready to extend its expertise to future applications for point-to-point flights, spaceplanes, and even space tourism. This leadership starting from our Turin facility combined with the strong and decisive support of the Italian institutions, places the country at the forefront of the space economy and will boost the huge development opportunities offered by the space domain”.

“Space Rider is a unique system that expands the capabilities and uses of the Vega launcher also in the activities of orbital missions extended over time and in the return from space. Many other applications are possible starting from this platform, such as in-orbit servicing activities. We are happy to pursue this fascinating future together with Thales Alenia Space and with the support of the Italian Space Agency and the European Space Agency ""said Giulio Ranzo, CEO of Avio.

More about the mission

Planned to be launch on 2023 by Vega C light launcher from the Guiana Space Center, Space Rider system overall length is 9.7m; it records 2430 kg wet mass and can accommodate up to 600kg of payload inside a 1.2 cubic meter cargo bay. The re-entry vehicle will reach Mach 28 speed at 90 km of altitude, and sustain maximum temperature of 1700K at the nose heat stagnation; subsonic parachute will open at 16 Km altitude at around 0.73 Mach decelerating the vehicle down to 50 m/s; final part of the descent is under parafoil which has the function of energy management and aero brake (flare maneuver) to limit the landing run after touch down.

Derived from Cygnus 10-year success story with Thales Alenia Space flight proven technologies

With HALO, Thales Alenia Space is strengthening its contribution to the Lunar Gateway

Turin, December 7, 2020 – Thales Alenia Space, the joint company between Thales (67%) and Leonardo (33%), has signed a contract with Northrop Grumman to develop the pressurized module for HALO (Habitation And Logistics Outpost) that will be one of the first two elements to form the lunar Gateway which will be launched in late 2023.

HALO is planned to be launched together with the Power and Propulsion Element (PPE) and will be the initial habitat for astronauts visiting the Gateway. Its primary purpose is to provide basic living space for astronauts and prepare for their trip to the lunar surface. It will provide command, control and data handling capabilities, energy storage and power distribution, thermal control, communications and tracking capabilities. It will be equipped with 3 docking ports for visiting vehicles and future modules, as well as space for science and stowage. With NASA’s Orion spacecraft docked, it will be able to sustain up to four astronauts for up to 30 days as they embark on, and return from, expeditions to the lunar surface.

Thales Alenia Space will be responsible of the design and manufacturing of the HALO primary structure (the pressurized module), the module and vestibule pressure control, part of the meteoroid protection system as well as the structure interfacing the NASA docking systems. The HALO design is derived from Northrop Grumman’s Cygnus spacecraft, which Thales Alenia Space is a longstanding partner on. Cygnus is a human-capable vehicle that delivers supplies, spare equipment and scientific experiments to the International Space Station with 14 successful missions to date. HALO will have the same 3m diameter as Cygnus, but will include a 1m stretch in length to meet habitable volume needs for visiting crews, bringing the total HALO length to about 7m. HALO will also benefit from the heritage of the Cygnus Pressurized Module design and production process already in place.

“It is a great, fantastic challenge for our company to again be part of the amazing adventure of moving back to the Moon - in particular paving the way of the lunar outpost by being involved in one of the first 2 Gateway elements to be launched, in addition to providing the European contribution with ESPRIT and I-HAB. “We see this result as a concrete step towards future exploration missions and thank again Northrop Grumman for the long and unalterable trust they put in Thales Alenia Space technologies, capable of meeting the boldest challenges”, declared Massimo Claudio Comparini, Senior Executive Vice President Observation, Exploration and Navigation at Thales Alenia Space.

Walter Cugno, Vice President Exploration and Science Domain at Thales Alenia Space added “By leveraging the active Cygnus production line and flight proven expertise, Thales Alenia Space will bring to Northrop Grumman the unique capability of providing an affordable and reliable HALO module in the timeframe needed to support lunar exploration. This more than 10-years success story as well the strong Thales Alenia Space expertise in deep space habitats, will allow us to design and manufacture this new lunar Gateway module in the respect of safety and comfort for the astronauts”.

About Artemis: moving forward to the Moon in 2024! The Artemis program will proceed in three phases: Artemis 1, a non-crewed flight to test the launch system and the Orion spacecraft together; Artemis 2, a first crewed flight of Orion; and Artemis 3, to land astronauts on the Moon in 2024. The program will set up sustainable structures on the Moon and in lunar orbit to carry out further human exploration of the surface and various scientific investigations. The Gateway will be a key to this program: it will be used as an outpost for astronauts on their way to the Moon, and as a laboratory to carry out scientific research, and thus support the development of sustained Moon exploration by the end of the decade.

About lunar Gateway: This outpost in lunar orbit is one of the pillars of NASA’s Artemis program, supporting sustainable exploration to the Moon and beyond. It is being implemented through international cooperation, currently involving NASA (United States) andESA (Europe). Discussions with other international partners continue. The Gateway, weighing about 40 metric tons, will be automatically assembled piece by piece and will be placed in a near rectilinear halo orbit (NRHO)* around the Moon. The configuration will mainly comprise habitation modules for the crew, power and propulsion systems, logistics modules, communications with the Earth and Moon, a robotic arm and docking ports. It is not intended for permanent occupancy, but as it evolves, it will be able to host 4-person crews for periods of one to three months. Gaining new experiences on and around the Moon will prepare NASA to send the first humans to Mars as early as 2030s, and the Gateway will play a vital role in this process.

About Thales Alenia Space involvement in the moving forward to the Moon challenge

Already providing the thermo-mechanical systems for Orion European Service Module and strongly involved in European Space Agency contribution in the Gateway with ESPRIT and I-HAB, Thales Alenia Space is also involved in NASA’s Human Landing System (HLS) initiative, as part of the Dynetics-led consortium recently chosen by NASA as well as in VIPER, the rover that NASA will send to the South Pole of the Moon in search for water.

*NRHO: an eccentric orbit with an apogee at 70,000 km and a perigee at 3,000 km, enabling the space station to revolve around the Earth at the same speed as the Moon, so that from Earth it will be seen as a lunar halo.

Thales Alenia Space in Spain is responsible for the Euclid communications system, one of its major contracts in 30 years of activity in Spain

The mission, to be launched in 2022, will study dark energy and dark matter to help understand the origin of the accelerating expansion of the Universe.

Madrid, December 10, 2020 - Thales Alenia Space, a joint venture between Thales (67%) and Leonardo (33%), has delivered the K-band high gain antenna to be integrated with the rest of the Euclid satellite in its plant in Turin. Thales Alenia Space in Spain is responsible for the deep space communications system, which comprises the communications panel delivered in 2019 and the high gain antenna, built by Thales Alenia Space in Rome. Thales Alenia Space in Italy is the satellite prime contractor of the Euclid mission and also responsible for the service module while Airbus in France as main industrial partner is developing the instrument.

© Thales Alenia Space

Euclid, an astronomy and astrophysics mission of the European Space Agency (ESA) scheduled for launch in 2022 on a Soyuz rocket from Europe’s Spaceport in French Guiana, will survey the sky with a 1.2 m diameter space telescope to explore dark energy and dark matter and understand the origin of the accelerating expansion of the Universe.

Euclid will map the general structure of the Universe over 10 billion light years to show its expansion and growth during the last three-quarters of its history. The mission is designed to address two of the most important questions in cosmology today: How did the Universe originate and why is it expanding at an accelerating rate, rather than slowing down due to the gravitational attraction of its constituent matter?

The contract for the development of Euclid's communications system has been one of the largest contracts of the company in its 30 years of activity in Spain. Eduardo Bellido, CEO of Thales Alenia Space in Spain, said: “The high gain antenna completes the delivery of the communications system in this important mission, one of the flagship programs of the European Space Agency, which will help us improve our understanding of the Universe. A milestone of which we are very proud and that consolidates Thales Alenia Space in Spain as a European reference in space communication systems.”

Communicating at 1.5 million kilometers

Euclid will map the 3D distribution of up to two billion galaxies and associated dark matter during a six-year mission, covering most of the observable sky outside our Milky Way. The complete survey consists of 150 thousands high definition images with associated colour and spectral information, resulting in close to a petabyte of data to be downlinked. This huge amount of data will be transmitted by the satellite from its orbit around the L2 Sun-Earth Lagrangian point at a distance of 1.5 million kilometers from the Earth, using its K-band (26 GHz) radiofrequency data transmission system to the ESA's 35m deep space stations located in Cebreros, Spain, and Malargüe, Argentina. Euclid also incorporates an X-band system to control and monitor the spacecraft, and measure its distance to Earth.

© Thales Alenia Space

Thales Alenia Space in Spain is specialized in satellite communications, building on a long heritage in TT&C and data transmission systems for all type of space missions, including missions in low Earth orbit, geostationary orbit, lunar orbit (Smart-1, KPLO, ESPRIT), the Moon’s surface (VIPER, NOVA-C), science missions orbiting around the L2 Lagrangian point (Herschel, Planck, Euclid, WFIRST, PLATO) and missions to asteroids (HERA).

The Euclid K-band deployable and steerable high gain antenna draws on Thales Alenia Space in Italy’s unique expertise in this domain in exploration missions to the Solar System, like Cassini-Huygens (Saturn), BepiColombo (Mercury) and ExoMars (Mars).

Thales Alenia Space in Italy has also provided the X-band Transponder, while the X-band and K-band Traveling Wave Tube Amplifiers (TWTA) have been developed by Thales Alenia Space in Belgium.

The Service Module and the Payload Module are currently under their final integration tests, respectively in Thales Alenia Space in Turin and in Airbus in Toulouse.

After the mating of the 2 modules and the large Sunshield Solar array, expected in Thales Alenia Space in Turin in the third quarter of 2021, the full flight model spacecraft will be subjected to the environmental test campaign, paving the way to its launch.

The new Thales Gemalto Intelligent ID Card Reader is the first reader designed for inspecting both sides of an ID document simultaneously in the cloud, thus simplifying the ID verification process.

The new document reader enables accurate ID card and driving license authentication to speed up people onboarding and protect business from ID fraud.

It answers Covid-19 hygiene recommendations by providing contact-free ID verification for end users and operators.

Thales showcases the world’s only double-sided ID card reader, the first to be able to examine ID cards or driving licenses in the cloud1 in less than four seconds. The design of the intelligent reader allows to speed up the process, while guaranteeing a high security level, and offering cost benefits to the operators. It simplifies the process of ID verification and offers a touchless check, which is all the more important in the Covid-19 era.

The Thales Gemalto Intelligent Double-sided ID Card Reader CR5400i enables fast, secure and remote identity document verification. The reader protects businesses (airports, casinos, hotels, stores, etc.) from fraud and forgery thanks to sophisticated mechanisms for superior document authentication. The “i” version permits multiple intelligent readers to be centrally connected via WiFi - ideal for organisations that need to deploy a fleet of readers such as retail stores and financial institutions. The compact device can also be set up, managed and serviced remotely.

Using the device is very easy: the user simply inserts their ID card into the reader which reads both sides of the card simultaneously. Once this action is complete, a LED changes from blue to green and the ID is ejected and returned to its owner with no physical interaction between the user and operator. It provides a better customer experience while capturing and authenticating scanned data.

Cannes, December 29, 2020 – Following the launch of CSO-1 in December 2018, the CSO-2 military observation satellite was successfully launched today by Arianespace using a Soyuz rocket from the Guiana Space Center, Europe’s Spaceport in French Guiana. Featuring a very-high-resolution optical instrument built by Thales Alenia Space, the joint company between Thales (67%) and Leonardo (33%), the satellite was developed by Airbus Defence and Space as prime contractor for the Armament General Directorate (DGA), with French space agency CNES as delegated contracting authority.

CSO, the optical space component

Developed within the scope of MUSIS (Multinational Space-based Imaging System for surveillance, reconnaissance and observation), the CSO (Composante Spatiale Optique) family comprises three observation satellites in Sun-synchronous orbit, each fitted with a very-high-resolution optical instrument. This system, a successor to Helios 2, is intended for French defense applications, and will help enhance the country’s capabilities in intelligence and operational support. Featuring higher image resolution than the previous generation, the instrument operates day and night, and also offers greater agility to take successive images of crisis zones. In addition, it can deliver a greater number of images taken in a single pass over a given zone.

Thales Alenia Space supplies the very-high-resolution optical observation instrument for the three CSO satellites, as it did for the six satellites in the Helios 1, Helios 2 and Pleiades families.

The company also developed key equipment, including the solar arrays, high-throughput image telemetry, the encryption/decryption modules for uplinks and downlinks as well as the telemetry, tracking and command transponders.

The most powerful “space camera” ever built in Europe

The CSO instrument offers significant improvements over Helios 2, including new detectors in the visible and infrared bands, more highly integrated video electronics, a new cooling system for the infrared channel and a new ceramic frame for the telescope to ensure exceptional stability. Robust, reliable and stable, the very-high-resolution optical instrument on CSO satellites can take razor-sharp photos of scenes despite the highly demanding orbital environment, while traveling at 25,000 km/hour from Low Earth orbit.

“Today we are celebrating the launch of CSO-2, featuring the most powerful ‘space camera’ ever built in Europe,” said Hervé Derrey, President and Chief Executive Officer of Thales Alenia Space. “We are very proud to have built its telephoto lens and electronics, the brains of the satellite. To develop this instrument, we called on the full sum of our experience in building the optical instruments for the six satellites in the Helios 1, Helios 2 and Pleiades families, allowing us to offer an instrument with unrivaled performance.”

“This year has been an extremely successful one for Thales Alenia Space’s Earth observation activities,” said Massimo Comparini, Head of the Observation, Exploration and Navigation business at Thales Alenia Space. “After having won five contracts for Europe’s vast environmental monitoring program, Copernicus Expansion, including three as prime, one contract to build two additional COSMO-SkyMed Second Generation satellites, we’re closing out the year on a high note with this impressive launch. The CSO-2 instrument is the state-of-the-art in very-high-resolution optical payloads for intelligence and defense operations support.”

It will shortly reach Venus to perform its first flyby of five around the shiniest planet in the Solar System!

Perhaps you recognized the two well-known song titles, which encapsulate the purpose and path of this unprecedented mission.

Walking on Sunshine, first stop… Venus!

As part of the European Space Agency’s “Cosmic Vision” program, Solar Orbiter is indeed “Walking on Sunshine”, as the 1985 hit by Katrina and the Waves so eloquently put it. It’s designed to observe the Sun from close range, including from high-latitudes, to provide the first images of the Sun’s uncharted polar regions.

Because it will be operating so close to the Sun, this mission is a key to better understanding the heliosphere and its impact on Earth.

However, Solar Orbiter’s route to the Sun is long and complicated, taking seven full years from its launch in February 2020 to complete the journey.

Solar Orbiter is taking advantage of the famous gravity assist, or slingshot effect. In short, this means using the relative movement and gravity of a planet or other astronomical body to alter the path and speed of a spacecraft, typically to save propellant.

As our space probe might say, I’m your Venus, I’m your Fire, especially if it were a big fan of the 1969 hit “Venus” by Dutch rock band Shocking Blue.

In addition to the five planned flybys, Solar Orbiter may perform three more if the mission is extended. And in November 2021 it will again come close to the Earth, giving us a last chance to say goodbye before it gets up-close and personal with the Sun.

The mission in a nutshell

Launched from Cape Canaveral on February 10, 2020, Solar Orbiter is a joint international space mission between ESA and NASA, using a spacecraft developed by Airbus Defence and Space. A number of partners from both industry and academia have contributed to the spacecraft, with Thales Alenia Space playing a critical role.

Thales Alenia Space designed and built an innovative and highly efficient heat shield to protect the spacecraft and its instruments from the tremendous heat, while also enabling a direct view of the Sun. Its high-temp black painted shield is made of several protective layers of titanium and it is further isolated from the satellite by a combination of thermal blankets, an aluminum honeycomb core and titanium star brackets.

Thales Alenia Space teamed up with OHB Italy as co-prime to supply Metis, an innovative chronograph that will take simultaneous pictures of the corona in both visible and ultraviolet wavelengths. This will reveal unprecedented structural and dynamic details of the solar atmosphere at a range from 1.7 to 9 solar radii from the Sun’s center, allowing scientists to investigate the link between the behavior of these regions and space weather in the inner Solar System.

These observations, based on the instruments’ unprecedented temporal coverage and spatial resolution, will enable us to study the structure and dynamic behavior of the corona and its features, finally separating their intrinsic characteristics from the effects of solar rotation.

Metis was proposed by an international scientific consortium led by Ester Antonucci from the INAF-Osservatorio Astrofisico di Torino (Turin Astrophysics Observatory), and is supported by the Italian space agency (ASI). The principal investigator is Marco Romoli, from the University of Florence.

LinkedIn

Thales Australia has recently presented the world’s most advanced Mine Counter Measure (MCM) Mission Management Systems to the Commonwealth.

Hosted at Thales’ Rydalmere facility in Sydney’s western suburbs, the visit included a demonstration of M-Cube, the MCM Mission Management System, combined with the Mission Analysis tool, MiMap. The core design of both MiMap and M-Cube reduces the cognitive load on Commanders and Operators, allowing them to deliver effective, efficient decision making within a mine threat environment. Together, these systems are now in use with two of the most proficient MCM Navies in the world, the UK’s Royal Navy and the French Marine Nationale.

M-Cube – a dedicated MCM mission planning and mission execution system tool, receives real-time marine environmental data, mission objectives and integrated artificial intelligence to assist in goal-based planning providing the end user a complete view of the operating area.

MiMap – a mission analysis system, critical in optimising and accelerating any MCM mission, takes the captured information from the mission assets and analyses the synthetic aperture and side scan sonar data generated by towed sonar or autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV). MiMap then collates this information and provides end users with a clear picture of the underwater environment to aid in the detection, classification, and localisation of any potential threat. Taking the load from the operator to process the huge volumes of data generated by multiple autonomous vehicles, both M-Cube and MiMap work together to simplify the information presented, ultimately reducing the cognitive load, and in turn, increasing the rate of threat clearance.

Complementing these two systems is Thales’ SONIA product – a modelling platform that takes information from the mission planning data and environmental conditions entered into M-Cube and provides commanders with a highly accurate simulation of likely mission outcomes. Planning can then be adjusted in M-Cube again before mission execution – a critical element in reducing risk.

“This really is the most capable and agile Mine Counter Measures C2 system in the world, with the potential to provide a significant technological advantage to the user,” says Thales’ Underwater Systems Business Development Manager and former Royal Australian Navy Mine Warfare and Clearance Diving Officer, Gavin Henry.

“Both systems take the complexity out of what is already an incredibly challenging mission environment, and is only going to get more so with the advent of autonomous capability. M-Cube and MiMap are also at the core of the French/UK Maritime Mine Countermeasures Program which has been successfully tested and demonstrated at sea.”

“With all these systems being built around an open, generic architecture, functions can be added, updated and improved as technology advances and threat environments change,” said Tim Cain, Thales Underwater Systems Technical Director. “Additional software applications will be developed to suit Australia’s unique operating and strategic environments and Navy’s assets.”

“If our partners within defence, academia or industry develop enhanced MCM vehicle assets or MCM software applications these can be plugged in and utilised – ensuring both M-Cube and MiMap are constantly evolving under sovereign control.”"
Cutting-edge sonar and substantial cost savings? Yes we can - Thales,"Fri, 04 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGFsZXNncm91cC5jb20vZW4vd29ybGR3aWRlLWRlZmVuY2UtbmF2YWwtZm9yY2VzL3VuZGVyd2F0ZXItd2FyZmFyZS9tYWdhemluZS9jdXR0aW5nLWVkZ2Utc29uYXItYW5kLXN1YnN0YW50aWFsLWNvc3TSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By the end of the 1980s, Eastern Bloc regimes were crumbling—and along with them the old certainties that had defined anti-submarine warfare (ASW) for decades. As new threats unfolded—and Mediterranean security and force projection took on heightened importance—the French and Italian navies’ needs evolved rapidly. Both countries were clear that they needed to substantially enhance their fleets. France was set to replace its ageing F67-class frigates, and Italy had taken the strategic decision to add Variable Depth Sonar (VDS) to its capabilities.

By the early 2000s, these needs had been framed in the joint European Multi-Mission Frigate (FREMM) Programme. Its level of ambition was formidable: the creation of a fleet of frigates equipped with cutting-edge sonar, while—at the same time—driving substantial cost savings.

To tackle these contrasting objectives, the programme’s management organisations – OCCAR, the DGA and NAVARM – turned to Thales. The company’s long experience in both hull-mounted and towed sonar, as well as its recent success in meeting the British Navy’s ASW needs for Type-23 frigates, made it well placed to satisfy the navies’ demanding requirements for technical excellence. In addition, Thales’s expertise as a systems integrator meant it could adapt the solution to the very different combat management philosophies and interface requirements of the French and Italian navies—something critical to unlocking economies of scale from a common sonar system while fully meeting country-specific needs. What’s more, the company’s close relations with a global network of specialist suppliers, and its ability to support and manage long-duration contracts, meant it could commit to the high manufacturing volumes required to drive substantial cost savings.

Drawing on its strong UK operations base, Thales organised working sessions and demonstrations that connected French and Italian naval experts with the up-to-date CDS design being produced for the British Navy . While these quickly built confidence that the solution could more than meet the programme’s strong performance needs, the real challenge would be taking design and manufacturing to a new level that could deliver the programme’s ambitious value objectives.

Recognising the scale of the challenge, Thales set about the wholesale remodelling of both the variable-depth and hull-mounted sonar systems earmarked for the FREMM frigates. It comprehensively re-engineered their components—right down to the most detailed levels; engaged experts at its UK site in Cheadle to ensure the Italian navy’s MMI interface requirements were met; and tasked Thales’s acoustic centres of excellence with adapting the sensors. This type of concerted effort, coupled with innovative approaches, like identifying and transferring relevant know-how from the rail sector for the transmitter power systems and the new breakthrough Tam Tam transducers for the Hull Mount Array, generated the sustained momentum needed to deliver across-the-programme savings.

The results are clear: 20 FREMM frigates have now been constructed, and the entry into service of Normandie, in June 2020, expands the French Navy’s FREMM fleet to six frigates engaged on anti-submarine warfare. Each is fitted with state-of-the-art sonar that’s smaller, cheaper, and more powerful than previous generations—and yet gives the frigates a lasting edge over the detection capabilities of even the most advanced submarines. The US Navy has also been impressed by the frigates’ capabilities and recently awarded the French Navy its Hook’Em award for ASW excellence."

The contract also includes partnering arrangements with Australian industry.

According to the Australian DoD, the outboard flank array forms part of the Sonar Subsystem, which is used when the submarine is submerged. This vital piece of equipment acts as the submarine’s eyes and ears, providing situational awareness for the crew.

Defence electronics company Thales is recognized as an expert in the field of sonar systems and has already designed and supplied the flank arrays for the Royal Navy’s Astute-class and French Navy Suffren-class submarines. The company is also upgrading the sonars fitted aboard the existing Collins-class submarines of the Royal Australian Navy.

Minister for Defence, Senator the Hon Linda Reynolds CSC said the design of the outboard flank array is vital to the operational effectiveness of the Attack-class submarine and its regional superiority:

“Thales is a global leader in underwater systems and the world’s top exporter of sonars and related systems for naval forces. This contract builds on the work Defence already has with Thales to upgrade the sonar suite of the Collins fleet. “Following a competitive tendering process, Thales is committed to establishing the Australian industrial capability needed to support the sovereign build, operation and sustainment of the Attack class submarine. This is a significant step in the right direction to build up Australian capability for the Future Submarine Program. By bringing together the best underwater sensing technology with local industry, it will ensure we deliver a sovereign regionally superior submarine.”



Senator the Hon Linda Reynolds CSC

Thales will support and promote Australian Industry Capability by:

Conducting a proportion of the design phase in Australia by engaging one of three Australian‑based companies, Thales Australia, Babcock Australia, and BMT Group, through a competitive process;

Leveraging existing in-country capabilities that support other Australian Defence Force assets, including the Collins class submarine, for the assembly, integration and sustainment phases;

An industry development package for the transfer of industrial capability to Australia to enable the provision of critical sub-assemblies and line replaceable units for both initial supply and sustainment.

Following the successful completion of the design phase, further work will be contracted for the manufacture of the subsystem from 2023.

About Australia’s Attack-class Submarine

Construction on the first ship of the class (the future HMAS Attack) is expected to start in 2022 and its delivery should take place in the early 2030ies. The next units will follow with a cadence of one submarine every two years.

The Australian Government selected Naval Group (then known as DCNS) as its preferred international partner for the design of 12 Future submarines for the Royal Australian Navy on April 26 2016. In the SEA1000 project, DCNS was competing with the Shortfin Barracuda design against Germany’s ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems (TKMS) Type 216 and Japan’s Soryu-class designs. Based on the new Barracuda nuclear-powered attack submarine (SSN) of the French Navy (the first ship of the class is set to be launched this summer), Australia’s Attack-class submarine will be 97 meters in length and 8.8 meters in diameter.

"Mission to ""ambush"" pristine comet enters new study phase - New Atlas","Mon, 14 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3YXRsYXMuY29tL3NwYWNlL2NvbWV0LWludGVyY2VwdG9yLXRoYWxlcy1lc2Ev0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The European Space Agency has selected Thales Alenia Space in the UK to lead a study for the planned mission to ""ambush"" a passing comet. Called Comet Interceptor, this cosmic brigand represents a new strategy for exploring comets fresh from the Oort cloud by lying in wait, perhaps for years, before embarking on a rendezvous mission.

The past four decades have been marked by a series of ambitious deep-space missions to comets in our solar system. In 1986, an armada of five probes from Europe, the USSR, and Japan flew by Halley's Comet, with the British-built Giotto probe coming within 370 miles (596 km) of the nucleus. Since then, probes have visited several comets, taking samples of their tails of gas and dust, and even landing on the surface.

These missions required years of planning and preparation, so all of the comets visited so far have been ones with very short orbital periods. That means these comets have remained relatively close to the Sun, periodically passing through the inner solar system. It also means that the ice on the surface has sublimated away, leaving behind a crust of dust rather like an aging snowbank on a city street.

While much has been learned from these short-period comets, what scientists really want is one that is in pristine condition. Ideally, one which has only recently, in cosmic terms, had its orbit disturbed and is hurtling toward the Sun on its first and, possibly, only visit.

The problem is that there would be so little warning about the approach of such a comet that conventional missions would never have a chance to prepare, much less launch.

Announced by ESA in June 2019, Comet Interceptor is intended to overcome this by parking in orbit for what could be several years, awaiting the appearance of a new comet suitable for interception.

The composite spacecraft will consist of a mothership and two small probes about 30 cm long that will be deployed as soon as it's on its way to the comet. Flying ahead, they will make a very close pass to help the Comet Interceptor build up the first 3D map of such an object.

ESA has selected Thales Alenia Space in the UK to lead a study to design the mothership, while JAXA will work on the probes.

Comet Interceptor is one of ESA's new ""fast"" missions designed to weigh under 2,200 pounds (1,000 kg) and be launched as a piggyback payload on another mission. It is slated for launch in 2028.

Italy orders second pair of Cosmo-SkyMed radar satellites - SpaceNews,"Wed, 16 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9pdGFseS1vcmRlcnMtc2Vjb25kLXBhaXItb2YtY29zbW8tc2t5bWVkLXJhZGFyLXNhdGVsbGl0ZXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"WASHINGTON —The Italian government has ordered two additional Cosmo-SkyMed radar imaging satellites from Thales Alenia Space and tapped Telespazio to upgrade the constellation’s ground segment under a contract announced Dec. 15.

Thales Alenia Space spokeswoman Sandrine Bielecki said the contract provides nearly €300 million ($365 million) to build two second-generation Cosmo-SkyMed satellites scheduled to launch in early 2024 and early 2025 — likely aboard a Vega C or Soyuz rocket.

The Italian Defense Ministry and Italian Space Agency (ASI) jointly fund Cosmo-SkyMed, which provides synthetic aperture radar imagery to military and civilian users. Commercial Cosmo-SkyMed imagery products are sold by Telespazio via its e-Geos venture with ASI.

Thales Alenia Space and Telespazio said the just-ordered pair of satellites will complete the second-generation Cosmo-SkyMed constellation and allow Italy to retire its first-generation Cosmo-SkyMed satellites. The first-generation satellites launched between 2007 and 2010 and all four are operating well beyond their intended lifetimes.

Italy struggled for years to find the money for a second-generation Cosmo-SkyMed constellation, waiting until late 2015 to put one satellite under contract while making a downpayment on a second spacecraft.

Italy launched the first of those initial second-generation satellites in December 2019 from the Guiana Space Center in French Guiana aboard a Soyuz rocket booked through Arianespace. The second satellite in that batch is scheduled to launch from the South American spaceport in late 2021 on an Arianespace-operated Vega C.

Thales Alenia Space said the two additional satellites and Telespazio-led ground segment upgrades guarantee Cosmo-SkyMed continuity and promise better image quality and more responsive tasking than the current system.

This story was updated Dec. 16 with more information about the contract."

Indra and Thales partnership to offer next generation tactical communications system to Spanish Armed Forces - EDR Magazine,"Fri, 18 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lZHJtYWdhemluZS5ldS9pbmRyYS1hbmQtdGhhbGVzLXBhcnRuZXJzaGlwLXRvLW9mZmVyLW5leHQtZ2VuZXJhdGlvbi10YWN0aWNhbC1jb21tdW5pY2F0aW9ucy1zeXN0ZW0tdG8tc3BhbmlzaC1hcm1lZC1mb3JjZXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Madrid 18 December 2020– In response to Spain’s decision to renew the country’s existing infrastructure, Indra and Thales, two of Europe’s leading high-tech Defence sector companies, have signed an agreement to work in partnership to offer a next-generation tactical communications system to Spain’s Armed Forces. The new communications system will notably enhance interoperability during international missions, and ensure Spain’s full sovereignty and technical autonomy over strategic military communications.

Superiority over the enemy in today’s theatre of operations depends on the rapid, agile and secure exchange of information. Platforms and vehicles are becoming increasingly intelligent, equipped with extremely accurate sensors, which collect a high volume of information and operate in a network with other systems. Joint action with forces from other countries brings even greater technological complexity to the theatre: software-defined radio (SDR) represents a key factor for success for the modern army in such a scenario. The most cutting-edge forces will turn to SDR in the coming years for its transmission capability, speed, secure information exchange and flexibility to interoperate with other allied forces.

A unique offer combining sovereignty, support and a robust industrial plan for Spanish industry

The offer from Indra and Thales comprises the development of new high-technology products and solutions in Spain, based on a proven Thales solution. The new products will be based on Thales’ SYNAPS radio product family, enhanced with new features to be developed jointly with Indra.

Indra and Thales’ extensive radio hardware and software expertise, as well as their experience in operations, mean both companies will be able to provide services support to the Spanish Armed Forces throughout the product lifecycle.

The industrial plan included as part of the offer is designed to boost the specialisation of Spanish companies in higher value-added activities, going beyond manufacturing and assembly of third-party solutions. If implemented, it will enable Spanish companies to better compete on the international market and support sustainable employment in the country, while strengthening Spain’s technological know-how and autonomy.

The partnership will bring significant mutual benefits for both companies, strengthening Indra’s solutions portfolio, and consolidating Thales’ industrial footprint in the defence sector in Spain.

"Nexter, Thales et Arquus succeed in presenting the 128 GRIFFONs planned for 2020 - EDR Magazine","Wed, 23 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVkcm1hZ2F6aW5lLmV1L25leHRlci10aGFsZXMtZXQtYXJxdXVzLXN1Y2NlZWQtaW4tcHJlc2VudGluZy10aGUtMTI4LWdyaWZmb25zLXBsYW5uZWQtZm9yLTIwMjDSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"December 23, 2020 – On December 18, 2020, Nexter, Thales and Arquus, as part of the temporary grouping of companies (GME) EBMR (Engins Blindés Multi-Rôles), presented the 128th GRIFFON planned for 2020 to the French Delegation for Armaments (DGA). Under the terms of the SCORPION program, and despite an unprecedented health crisis that profoundly affected production, the three manufacturers were able to take the challenge and meet their contractual objectives.

After this step, the last GRIFFONs will have to be submitted to the verification operations carried out by the DGA’s quality department. The vehicles will then be transported to the Canjuers site where the Army will proceed to take them into account; it is then that the DGA will formally receive them. To date, 90 GRIFFON have completed this route, adding to the 92 GRIFFON delivered in 2019. From January 2021, the last vehicles that left the production line in December will join them in the regiments, catching up very early in 2021 with the delay due to the health crisis.

From March 2020, Covid-19 has indeed strongly disrupted the industrial organization of the program. The site of Roanne, where the GRIFFON and JAGUAR are assembled, was forced to suspend its activity from March 20 to 30 in order to allow the installation of a structure adapted to the resumption of the activity under maximum safety conditions. Since then, two teams have been working on the lines in shifts of eight consecutive hours (2×8) to ensure that the lines are operational during these 16-hour days. Closely linked to their government contacts and after consulting their suppliers, the members of the GME quickly reviewed the initial schedule: the 2020 objectives were maintained for GRIFFON; the first deliveries of JAGUAR were postponed to April 2021; and this, while preserving the amount of deliveries at the end of 2021.

The year 2020 was marked by the passage of several major milestones for the GME. In September, the DGA notified the third conditional tranche of the EBMR contract, enabling the second batch of vehicles (271 GRIFFON and 42 JAGUAR by 2023) to go into production. In November, the GRIFFON command post vehicle (EPC) was qualified. Thus, among the 128 GRIFFONs of 2020, 35 examples of this new variant were presented to the administration, an additional difficulty that the EPC teams overcame. Finally, the new-generation T1 remotely operated turret that will arm the GRIFFONs was also qualified by the DGA.

Nexter, Arquus and Thales would like to pay tribute to the exceptional commitment of their teams. Their sense of duty and creativity have enabled them to meet the expectations of the French Army and its combatants as best they could, while greatly limiting the impact of the health crisis.

Thales and StandardAero Successfully Achieve the Industry’s First 4-Axis Autopilot Flight Test for Airbus AS350 and ... - EDR Magazine,"Tue, 01 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lZHJtYWdhemluZS5ldS90aGFsZXMtYW5kLXN0YW5kYXJkYWVyby1zdWNjZXNzZnVsbHktYWNoaWV2ZS10aGUtaW5kdXN0cnlzLWZpcnN0LTQtYXhpcy1hdXRvcGlsb3QtZmxpZ2h0LXRlc3QtZm9yLWFpcmJ1cy1hczM1MC1hbmQtaDEyNS1oZWxpY29wdGVyc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"30 November 2020 – Thales and StandardAero have announced the successful first flight test of a revolutionary compact autopilot system that will bring Airbus AS350 and H125 helicopters into a new era of performance and safety. The achievement of this key milestone lays the groundwork for this important phase of the Supplemental Type Certification (STC) process and the launch of an unparalleled autopilot solution to the light helicopter market by mid-2021.

Flight testing, which will continue throughout this winter at StandardAero’s Langley, British Columbia, Canada facility, demonstrates Thales’ and StandardAero’s commitment to develop and certify a compact, advanced 4-axis helicopter Autopilot System. Earlier this year, StandardAero/Thales previously announced that WeatherTech, the well-known automotive accessories company, has agreed to be its launch customer. The Autopilot will initially be certified for installation on both the Airbus AS350 and H125 helicopter platforms.

“The launch of this flight test program is a key milestone for StandardAero and Thales. This product combines Thales’ Autopilot experience, based on billions of flight hours accumulated and outstanding customer satisfaction, with StandardAero’s extensive aftermarket capabilities in aircraft modification and certification. We aim to bring a user-friendly solution offering an unparalleled level of safety and reliability to the light helicopter market,” said Jean-Paul Ebanga, Thales Vice-President of Flight Avionics activities.

The Thales/StandardAero compact autopilot is an intuitive automatic flight control system on the AS350/H125 that increases safety through reduced pilot workload. It provides stability augmentation, attitude retention and flight director modes such as altitude or heading hold and reduces the risk of aircraft incidents.

“This state-of-the-art, 4-axis autopilot system has been designed as a straightforward retrofit and provides pilots with simplified operation that will help reduce wear and tear on the helicopter while making flying in normal and adverse conditions much easier and safer for the crew and passengers,” said Elvis Moniz, Vice President of Product Development for StandardAero’s Helicopters business unit.

“Moreover, with the increase in EMS flying and recent CFIT related helicopter accidents, anything that can help pilots navigate more safely is of paramount interest.” says Moniz.

StandardAero and Thales bring complementary expertise to the collaboration. Thales produces the essential components, including the advanced control management systems, four trim actuators, three intelligent linear actuators and the data concentrator/control panel.

StandardAero brings superior expertise in aircraft modification and certification, which enables them to manage the detailed design of the mechanical and electrical systems integration. With their comprehensive FAA (Federal Aviation Authority) certification plan, certification approval is expected mid-2021.

The company stated that it is working with Army Headquarters to support the service’s emerging dismounted combat requirements, with potential outcomes including a Close Combatant Assault Rifle, Light Machine Gun, and associated ammunition.

The collaboration aims to develop working level prototypes for the weapons and assess weapon and ammunition performance, with the expectation that both weapon systems are ready to compete for the Close Combatant Family of Weapons in Tranche 2 of the Lethality System Project (LAND 159) by late 2023.

“As we seek to evolve the soldier combat system, the lethality component is a critical sub system,” said Colonel Stuart Davies, Director Dismounted Combat Program, Army Headquarters.

“There are many challenges to ensure we have a capability edge over current and emerging threats, and the Australian Army welcomes the opportunity to explore some emerging disruptive technologies associated with complete weapon system design,” he added.

Other development partners include the Lethality System Program at the Australian Department of Defence’s (DoD’s) Capability Acquisition and Sustainment Group (CASG)

Thales Australia is also supplying the Australian Defence Force’s (ADF’s) incumbent service rifle, the 5.56×45 mm calibre Enhanced F88 (EF88) Austeyr, which was fielded from mid-2016 under an A$100 million contract for 30,000 units along with around 2,500 Steyr Mannlicher SL40 integrated grenade launchers. An additional order for 8,500 rifles was placed in July 2020.

The company earlier announced in August 2020 that it will double the size of its Small Arms Research & Development team in Lithgow to address the future technology requirements of a more digitised battlespace for the ADF, and aims to leverage on new manufacturing processes, novel materials and artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance production operations.

Boosting the digital economy

Bridging the digital divide

Brussels, December 23 2020 - The European Commission has selected a consortium of European satellite manufacturers, operators and service providers, telco operators and launch service providers to study the design, development and launch of a European-owned space-based communication system.

The study will assess the feasibility of a new initiative aiming to strengthen European digital sovereignty and provide secure connectivity for citizens, commercial enterprises and public institutions as well as providing global coverage for rural and ‘not-spot’ areas. Complementing Copernicus and Galileo, this new EU flagship programme, once given the green light, would fully exploit the synergies of the technological potential akin to the Digital and Space industries. The contract value of the year-long feasibility study amounts to € 7.1 million.

The European space-based connectivity system, advocated by Commissioner Breton, is set to provide secure communication services to the EU and its Member States as well as broadband connectivity for European citizens, companies and mobility sectors, strengthening EU digital sovereignty. It will build upon the European Union’s GOVSATCOM programme of pooling and sharing satellite services, and will ensure a high level of reliability, resilience and security not currently available in the market; it will also leverage the EuroQCI initiative that promotes innovative quantum cryptography technology.

More specifically, the study phase awarded by the European Commission will consolidate the user and mission requirements and provide a preliminary architectural design and service provision concept, as well as associated budgetary estimates. A Public-Private Partnership (PPP) scheme will be considered and assessed during this phase.

The study will look at how the space-based system could enhance and connect to current and future critical infrastructures, including terrestrial networks, strengthening EU capability to access the cloud and providing digital services in an independent and secure way, which is essential for building confidence in the digital economy and ensuring European strategic autonomy and resilience.

It will leverage and strengthen the role of satellites in the 5G ecosystem, assessing interoperability whilst also taking into account the evolution towards upcoming 6G technologies.

This European sovereign infrastructure is set to benefit a large range of sectors, including road and maritime transport, air traffic and control, autonomous vehicle development as well as many Internet of Things (IoT) applications. It is intended to offer enhanced security in the transmission and storage of information and data supporting the needs of various users such as governmental agencies, finance & banking companies, science networks, critical infrastructures and data centres.

The consortium members are: Airbus, Arianespace, Eutelsat, Hispasat, OHB, Orange, SES, Telespazio and Thales Alenia Space.

Interview: Thales Alenia Space Team - UK Aviation News,"Sun, 13 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vdWthdmlhdGlvbi5uZXdzL2ludGVydmlldy10aGFsZXMtYWxlbmlhLXNwYWNlLXRlYW0v0gE7aHR0cHM6Ly91a2F2aWF0aW9uLm5ld3MvaW50ZXJ2aWV3LXRoYWxlcy1hbGVuaWEtc3BhY2UtdGVhbS8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The number of off-world projects currently in development is staggering.

Earlier this month China’s Chang-E 5 landed on the moon to collect up to 2kg of regolith samples and return them to Earth.

This is a short mission – Get up, Get rocks, Get home – but even this takes years of planning.

Mankind’s need to explore is palpable. But the planning and calculations involved in making this happen take time.

Using mobile telephones as a comparison – Many people renew their devices annually to keep up with the latest technology.

Progress is such that as soon as a product is sold, improvements are well underway. The updates keeping apps running smoothly come almost daily.

Exploration technology isn’t that different – but for one key factor;

Space agencies need to be ahead of the game.

Once hardware leaves the ground it must be adaptable, upgradeable, and most importantly with global awareness of consumption of resources, sustainable.

The most famous example of such a demand is Voyager 1 & 2.

Launched over 40 years ago, and now travelling beyond our solar system through interstellar space, we are still able to communicate with these machines.

Voyager 2, for example, failed to complete a scheduled task in January 2020. This resulted in a frenzied, but successful, reboot of the craft by staff from 11.5 Billion miles away.

This distance is so vast that communication between NASA and Voyager 2 involved a nail-biting wait. Instructions from Earth took approximately 17 hours to reach the temporarily lame craft. A response was received 34 hours after each message sent.

This type of scenario is one of countless possibilities considered during development of all space missions.



Following news last month of Airbus’ selection as “one of two primes” in the development of the European Large Lunar Lander (EL3), it is essential that we look at the other party selected.



Thales Alenia Space has extensive experience within this industry.

Elements of well-publicised missions and crucial components of long term exploration projects were designed, created and built by Thales Alenia Space. This includes supplying over 50% of the pressurised components that make up the International Space Station (including Columbus Lab and Nodes 1 & 2).

They have also provided the veteran Soyuz craft with range safety systems for launch, ensuring destruction of the vehicle in the event of course deviation.

Telecommunications, thermal control and electrical distribution systems required by Bepi Columbo, launched in 2018 bound for Mercury, were also undertaken by Thales Alenia Space.

This incredible leader in technology is marked to replace the Russian Soyuz vehicles – which has carried cargo and crew for over half a century – with Arianne 6, targeted for service by 2023.

Questions regarding both current and future missions were posed to Thales Alenia Space in order to get the most intimate understanding of their plans.



The following interview involves

Walter Cugno: Vice President – Exploration and Science Domain at Thales Alenia Space

Federico Massobrio: Head of Advanced Exploration Programs at Thales Alenia Space

(l) Federico Massobrio (r)Walter Cugno



1. Thales Alenia Space has documented vast experience in crucial build development (ISS Columbus, Cygnus, etc).

However, 2020 has seen huge growth in public awareness of reusable components in all areas. Has this influenced or changed any design concepts? If not, what is the anticipated service duration of craft and components under Thales Alenia Space charge?

Walter Cugno: We can all surely notice growth and public awareness on utilizing reusable components, mainly driven by the need to reduce the costs and utilize well-proven products. However, the Moon exploration as well as the exploitation of the Low Earth Orbits opportunities requires the development and supply of reliable and advanced systems based on well-proven concepts. They have to be performing as never before, and it’s all becoming possible thanks to innovative technologies and design solutions.

Federico Massobrio, Head of Advanced Exploration Programs at Thales Alenia Space: Reusability and sustainability are indeed key concepts becoming very popular in recent times, and apply very well to Lunar exploration concepts and products. Cislunar orbital outpost (the Lunar Gateway, international habitat iHAB and communication package ESPRIT, designed by Thales Alenia Space) will provide logistic support for the ARTEMIS manned missions for tens of years; Lunar landers will be conceived to be exploited also after landing. For instance, in support to the Lunar night survival and, in a further stage, possibly be reused as supporting “shelter” for the astronauts.

Refuelling and reusability of some transfer stages will be examined from economic sustainability of the system, and associated improvement of their performances. Surface logistics will also play a substantial role to facilitate interactions between different elements of the lunar infrastructures.

Their lifecycle shall be designed for maximum reusability.

2. The first ESPRIT, I-HAB & HALO modules are anticipated in under 3 years. Where does Thales Alenia Space stand with the current development stage of these tasks?

Walter Cugno: Halo and IHAB contract have been recently signed. The design activities are now at full speed to achieve the first important milestone which is represented by the System Preliminary Design Review.

ESPRIT Contract is going to be signed before end of 2020. It is a new industrial challenge to provide the solutions to bring the first woman and the next man to the Moon, but it is an even bigger one to enable shortly a semi-permanent life around its orbit and on its surface.

Halo will be one of the first modules to be launched, as it is supposed to be placed already in 2023. But the time is short even for Esprit and IHAB, planned to be released respectively in 2026 and 2027.

This astonishing infrastructure, being quite different from the ISS, will allow human presence for a consecutive period of 3 months. Thus, solutions are studied to guarantee an efficient remote control of its functionalities. But Thales Alenia Space contribution to the Artemis program goes beyond the mere pressurized modules.

Indeed, we are involved in the development and manufacturing on the backbone of the Orion Spaceship. We are strongly participating to the design of the future of crucial Moon vehicles like the Human Landing System, the Europeans Logistic lander (EL3) and CLTV – the Cislunar Transfer vehicle.

We’ve always believed and sustained humanity ambitions to explore and to push always a little bit further human’s limits.

Building the station and its lunar ecosystem, thinking and studying the future Lunar Infrastructures, clearly shows that we are on the side of ESA and NASA to bring humans to Mars in the next 20 years.

3. Given the widely misconstrued public perception of “defence” and “surveillance” technologies, and Thales Alenia Space’s incredible achievements in these fields, how do these tasks align with the development of human space exploration?

Public tensions are currently especially high due to Covid19.

Can you demonstrate the importance of these fields in progress in off-world challenges?

Recently we signed important contracts in the field of Earth Observation, in the frame of the Copernicus mission extension with the purpose of a better climate monitoring and prevention of natural calamities.

Space Exploration is also crucial to enable a better life on Earth.

Past and recent discoveries in the field of (among others), medicine, technology and survival under extreme conditions, have been possible thanks to investments made in Space.

It is not a causality that for each dollar spent on Space there is a return on investment of 8 more. Studying our universe and other planets will help us better understand who we are and what to expect in the future.

One of the major pillars of the NASA Artemis Program is the exploitation of resources on the Moon. This will lead to better preservation and more efficient use of Earth’s ones.

To conclude, in regards to the new space economy, thanks to​ private investments in Space, we have to expect a new wave of unprecedented discoveries. The opportunity for companies to test their products under the unique conditions of Space will surely be a milestone for creating a stronger bond between Earth and Space than ever before. This, overall, is what we call “Space for Life”.

4. What goals and targets does Thales Alenia Space have for future extraterrestrial development? Are there plans for specific tasks going forward (eg. 10-year plan) independently of contracts with external agencies such as ESA? Or does Thales Alenia Space have any influence in suggesting new goals?

Clearly, Thales Alenia Space has a road map for developing systems and products required to support the exploitation of the Moon, in the context of Government initiatives, as well as developing opportunities for commercial ones, and then contributing with our intrinsic capability for playing a key role regarding Human and Robotic missions to Mars preparing for the human colonisation of the Red planet.

Additional questions regarding EL3 were answered by Federico Massobrio:

Head of Advanced Exploration Programs at Thales Alenia Space

1) EL3’s Research & Development project has been allocated to Thales Alenia Space and Airbus as two independent projects.

What specific elements have been assigned to Thales Alenia Space?

The same elements have been assigned to the two independent projects, although different declinations are expected by the two consortium based on specific background and development roadmap.

The key element Thales Alenia Space has been assigned is the Lunar Descent Element, the core of the lander system.

This is conceived to be as general purpose as possible to cope with a variety of missions from Lunar surface logistics in support of the ARTEMIS program, to scientific robotic missions on the Lunar southern pole, to ascent and recovery of samples from the surface towards the cislunar Gateway and so on.

A further main element which has been assigned to the Thales Alenia Space consortium will be the multifunctional Cargo Payload Adapter, which shall be able to tailor the lander functionalities towards the different mission applications.

1a) Two “Prime” studies are being undertaken independently.

At what point will both companies combine efforts, building the first testable product? What specific elements are being undertaken prior to this stage?

So far the ESA planning does not foresee joint efforts to combine the two conceptual ideas until the end of the engineering phase “B1”, to be concluded by a review of the system requirements by ESA.

Specific elements may, however, be built for development or demonstration purposes, like landing system elements or guidance & navigation software. Critical technologies from the development point of view are tracked, and associated pre-development or breadboarding activities may be considered to mitigate development risks."

The partnership is intended to bring significant mutual benefits for both companies, strengthening Indra’s solutions portfolio, and consolidating Thales’ industrial footprint in the defence sector in Spain, according to the companies."
Digital Onboarding in Banking (Best Practices) - Thales,"Mon, 07 Dec 2020 14:42:28 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGFsZXNncm91cC5jb20vZW4vbWFya2V0cy9kaWdpdGFsLWlkZW50aXR5LWFuZC1zZWN1cml0eS9iYW5raW5nLXBheW1lbnQvZG9jdW1lbnRzL2Jlc3QtcHJhY3RpY2VzLWZvci1kaWdpdGFsLW9uYm9hcmRpbmfSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A user-centric approach: the urgent need to reconsider customer onboarding

The digital-first path is rapidly becoming the ""new normal"" in banking.

The connected consumer of today expects to be able to open a new account online using their tablets, laptops, and smartphones.

However, many FIs either offer a fragmented approach - where you still have to sign a final document in-branch- or deliver an unfriendly complex online experience.

The result?

Processes are taking way too long and leading to a high abandonment rate. In other words, potential new customers give up and may never return.

A frictionless digital onboarding experience is a must-have for customers and their banks.

ID verification and facial match

The challenge starts with document authentication at the initial phase of the digital onboarding process. Needless to say, the digital authentication process eliminates costly and time-consuming manual verifications. Advanced ID checks will be used for online ID verification and represent a solid barrier to fake IDs. Live facial identification is one of the most important features of online identity proofing. It ensures that the document's actual owner is present during identity proofing.

There's more. ID and selfie checks are complemented with liveness detection.

Liveness detection ensures that a person is physically present and would detect any spoof attack. It's an additional security layer to confirm genuine presence.

FIs should make sure that their provider has extended expertise.

Combined expertise in documents, identification, online authentication, advanced biometrics, and security are essential in ID verification. Managing a rich solution from a single provider is easier than a patchwork of solutions.

Regulatory compliance and audit trail

Banks must verify their clients' identities and backgrounds. They must take the necessary KYC measures to onboard only eligible clients to comply with legislation such as AML6.

They also need to be able to reassess the account holder regularly over time.

Additionally, KYC digital onboarding solutions can help certify that banks comply with regulatory frameworks and national laws when processing information and providing services.

Audit trails will protect banks against legal claims and disputes. Banks can prove they applied all due diligence when onboarding new clients.

But diligence steps can increase the level of friction during customer onboarding.

So, businesses should look for solutions in compliance with industry and government regulations that can be easily integrated and create no disruption to the legitimate customer journey.

Risk assessment and multi-layer ID service approach

A risk-management engine will identify, assess and control threats. It represents a solution that can significantly reduce the risk of fraud.

Risk parameters such as the device, email, and IP address can be analysed, allowing the bank to score the individual more accurately.

This process is called identity affirmation and is key to flagging suspicious activity or fraudulent behaviour.

FIs can define business rules via policy management and decide whether to accept or reject an application for an account.

By combining risk-based identity affirmation with an identity verification solution, FIs can drastically reduce ID fraud at the account opening stage.

FIs need several layers of verification for the onboarding process and usual online access.

With ID verification and affirmation solutions in SaaS mode (Software as a Service), the software is accessible directly from the cloud. It enables FIs to configure the necessary verification flows depending on the results, scores, or business rules that apply to the service.

This pay-as-you-go model provides beneficial cost savings and flexibility.

Cloud services can offer an optimal approach to providing these verification services without FIs having to reorganise their business entirely.

Customer retention strategies

A flexible and evolving KYC identity verification solution that combines best-in-class technologies can help FIs develop a more compelling customer retention strategy as they nurture an optimised user experience.

It makes sense when you think about it.

For example, biometric data such as face or fingerprint can be used for further customer authentication in other services the FI may want to offer during the entire account lifecycle (mortgages, loans, insurance, payment cards, and international remittances).

A comprehensive KYC digital onboarding solution that creates minimum customer friction can be a business opportunity. It should contain all the ingredients to enrich retention schemes.

The High Frequency Intercept Array is designed to help detect high frequency emissions like sonars, and emerging undersea threats.

The upgrades are expected to enhance the capability of the Collins-class submarines while boosting the Australian Defence industry.

Australian Defence Minister Senator Linda Reynolds CSC said that the Mine and Obstacle Avoidance System and High Frequency Intercept Array are important parts of the upgrades to the Collins sonar system.

Reynolds added: “Our six Collins Class submarines are a highly capable and regionally superior capability that are only halfway through their operational life.

“To ensure this capability maintains its edge, we are upgrading and improving its systems including through sonar upgrades.

“With more than 20 years of investment in Australia by Thales and Defence, these upgrades will complement broader improvements to the sonar capability of the Collins Class, ensuring the regional superiority of the fleet into the future.”

Australian Minister for Defence Industry Melissa Price said: “Once again, we are backing Aussie businesses and creating jobs in our defence industry, which is in turn helping the national economy on its road to recovery after Covid-19.”"

The outboard flank array forms part of the Sonar Subsystem, which is used when the submarine is submerged. This vital piece of equipment acts as the submarine’s eyes and ears, providing situational awareness for the crew.

Australian Minister for Defence, Senator the Hon Linda Reynolds CSC said the design of the outboard flank array is vital to the operational effectiveness of the Attack class submarine and its regional superiority.



Thales develops sonar suites based on open, interoperable architectures to accommodate future capability and minimize the cost of ownership. These solutions incorporate high-performance acoustic sensors, integrated processing electronics, and advanced user interfaces.



By combining subsystems such as bow-mounted sonar, flank array sonar, obstacle avoidance sonar, intercept sonar and passive towed-array sonar, Thales builds comprehensive, cohesive and integrated solutions that provide submarines with all-round situational awareness together with the ability to detect, locate and classify all types of threats at short, medium and long-range across a broad spectrum of frequencies.



On 26 April 2016 Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull announced DCNS (now Naval Group) from France as the preferred international design partner for Australia’s FSP. The successful design is the Shortfin Barracuda Block 1A conventional submarine, which is based on the French Barracuda nuclear-powered submarine.



The acquisition cost of the 12 Future Submarines is estimated at over $50 billion in constant dollars and around $80 billion in out-turned dollars. The sustainment costs for the life of the program out to 2080 are roughly estimated at more than $50 billion in constant dollars and $145 billion in out-turned dollars. Construction of the first Future Submarine is expected to commence in 2022–23 and is scheduled to enter service around 2032–33."

In the UK, Thales Alenia Space, the joint venture between Thales (67%) and Leonardo (33%), has been selected by the European Space Agency (ESA) to lead one of two parallel studies for the Comet Interceptor mission.

The Comet Interceptor mission consists of one spacecraft and two small probes. It was selected by ESA in June 2019 to combine breakthrough technology in new comet discoveries to reveal information about pristine comets entering the inner Solar System or an interstellar object passing through the Solar System. The scientific mission was originally proposed by an international team led by UK academics from University College London and the University of Edinburgh, among others.

The three elements of the mission are a mothercraft, provided and operated by ESA and two small probes, (B1) provided by the Japanese Space Agency JAXA and (B2) by ESA, carried as payloads aboard the mothercraft.

The mission will launch in 2028 and wait in orbit for a suitable target; the composite spacecraft will travel together before the three modules separate a few days prior to intercepting the comet.

Each module will be equipped with science instruments, providing different perspectives of the comet’s nucleus and its gas, dust, and plasma environment. Such ‘multi-point’ measurements will greatly improve the 3D information needed to understand the dynamic nature of a pristine comet while it is interacting with the constantly changing solar wind environment.

The mission’s instruments will be provided by consortia of research institutes and will draw on heritage from previous ESA missions such as Giotto and the currently flying ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter with its dust, fields and plasma instruments, as well as a mass spectrometer, like those that flew on Rosetta.

During the study phase, Thales Alenia Space in the UK will be responsible for the spacecraft design as well as the preparation for the development phase that encompass the Assembly Integration and Test of the space segment, the support for launch operations and commissioning in orbit. In order to secure the science of the mission, Thales Alenia Space in the UK will lead an international consortium composed of world class partners in critical areas for COMET-I. This team will include Thales Alenia Space in Italy and France for their unrivalled experience in Sun-Earth Lagrange2 mission, Thales Alenia Space in Spain for the Communications sub-system, and GMV for the sophisticated Guidance, Navigation & Control sub-system.

Science Minister Amanda Solloway said: “The UK’s space industry is thriving and this out-of-this-world mission is testament to our world-leading expertise. I am very proud that scientists and engineers in Bristol and Harwell will be designing the Comet Interceptor spacecraft – their incredible work will not only further our understanding of the evolution of comets but help unlock the mysteries of the universe.”

Andrew Stanniland, CEO of Thales Alenia Space in the UK commented: “I am delighted ESA has once again placed its trust in our scientists and engineers at Thales Alenia Space in the UK who have excellent heritage from previous scientific missions such as Giotto and Rosetta. We all look forward to supporting this exciting and unprecedented scientific mission to uncover more information about the origins of our Universe.”"

The two contracts, worth around A$23.7 million, are for the design and implementation of the Mine and Obstacle Avoidance System and the High Frequency Intercept Array for the submarine fleet. The upgrades will not only enhance the capability of the Collins Class fleet but will provide a boost to Australian Defence industry and support Australian jobs.

Minister for Defence Linda Reynolds said both the Mine and Obstacle Avoidance System and High Frequency Intercept Array are important parts of the upgrades to the Collins sonar system. “Our six Collins Class submarines are a highly capable and regionally superior capability that are only halfway through their operational life,” Reynolds said. “To ensure this capability maintains its edge, we are upgrading and improving its systems including through sonar upgrades. The purpose of a Mine and Obstacle Avoidance System is to acoustically detect obstacles, including mines, which pose a threat to the submarine. The High Frequency Intercept Array detects high frequency noises including sonar transmissions. With more than 20 years of investment in Australia by Thales and Defence, these upgrades will complement broader improvements to the sonar capability of the Collins Class, ensuring the regional superiority of the fleet into the future.”

Minister for Defence Industry Melissa Price said Thales had extensive experience working on the Collins fleet and other Australian-based companies would be engaged throughout the contracts. “These contracts will include about 80 per cent of work being completed by Australian industry,” Price said. “We can expect these contracts to support 30 new jobs with Thales Australia in Rydalmere, NSW and additional jobs along the supply chain – jobs that will continue throughout the contracts.”

NSW Minister for Jobs, Investment, Tourism and Western Sydney, Stuart Ayres said, “Thales Australia has a long history of supporting the Royal Australian Navy with sonars, periscopes and other electronic systems proven with the fleet at sea. The sonar systems developed by Thales Australia represents a major contribution to an enduring sovereign sonar capability for the nation.”"
