During the special gala event held on June 14, 2022 at Aircraft Interiors Expo, Thales was recognized by the Crystal Cabin Award Association for its’ winning innovation, Pulse dynamic power supply.

The Crystal Cabin Award is the world’s leading prize in the field of cabin innovations and on-board products.

In the Material and Components category, Thales wins with Pulse, the smart power supply solutions designed with the passenger in mind, allocating power where they need it all while reducing weight and total cost of ownership.





The Crystal Cabin Award is the world’s leading prize in the field of cabin innovations and on-board products. Winning ideas shape the future of travel. Thales was honored to have both its power supply and Optiq in-seat display from its’ AVANT Up solution make it to finalist for this award. During the special gala event held on June 14, 2022 at Aircraft Interiors Expo, Thales was recognized by the Crystal Cabin Award Association for its’ winning innovation, Pulse dynamic power supply.

Pulse is the revolutionary new power solution from Thales, it uses a patented power management technology to dynamically allocate power ensuring every passenger can charge their devices on- wing. Pulse is the only linefit solution that eliminates today’s ‘first come, first serve’ power allocation to guarantee all devices get power, regardless of who plugs in first. Pulse alleviates the feeling of ‘low battery anxiety’ that comes with not being able to charge your personal device.

Thales’ new power solution delivers 350W of power while also supporting the at-home charging preferences of USB-A, USB-C, and wireless charging for passengers to use on the aircraft. Pulse is right sized, meaning it can fit within the seat beams, giving an average of 200 square inches of space back to the passenger.

With dynamic power allocation, less weight and reduced operational cost, this solution improves power delivery in almost every way possible.

“We are very honored to win the 2022 Crystal Cabin Award with our Pulse dynamic power supply in the category of Materials and Components. This award recognizes innovation and technological superiority in the aircraft cabin; a great recognition for our team. At Thales, we are all proud to innovate leading-edge solutions that shape the future of travel.” Said TK Kallenback, Chief Executive Officer, Thales Inflyt Experience","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9991683959960938}",positive,0.9991683959960938,1

Thales DIS BPS has Cleverly Managed the Semiconductor Shortage - RFID & Wireless IoT Search,"Mon, 06 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJmaWQtd2lvdC1zZWFyY2guY29tL3RoYWxlcy1kaXMtYnBzLWhhcy1jbGV2ZXJseS1tYW5hZ2VkLXRoZS1zZW1pY29uZHVjdG9yLXNob3J0YWdl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Supply Bottlenecks have been Absorbed Well

The pandemic-related supply bottlenecks have made Thales DIS BPS even more aware of its dependence on the Asian semiconductor industry. Thales was still well positioned in this regard, says Steffi Lasch, Sales and Marketing Manager at Thales DIS BPS: ""We ordered larger quantities than usual in good time, openly communicated any problems with our customers and took countermeasures through a series of actions.""

As a result, there have been no delays in delivery to date. Materials planning had also been handled with foresight. Here, however, as in the procurement of chips, permanent changes are on the horizon.

Hope for Semiconductors “Made in Saxony”

Against this background, semiconductor production in Saxony offers real prospects. GLOBALFOUNDRIES, Infineon and Bosch operate some of the most modern and largest semiconductor plants in the world in Dresden. Already, the Saxony region is Europe's largest microelectronics / ICT location and the fifth largest worldwide. Every third chip produced in Europe bears the imprint ""Made in Saxony"". At the moment, of course, the demand for chips far exceeds the supply from Saxony. With the European Commission's Chip Act on the way, this will change in the future.

Dual-Interface Technology DIS Enables Even More Secure Programming

The result of intensive research and development efforts over the past two years is Thales Dual-Interface Technology DIS. The in-house copper-wired antenna technology and the in-house soldering process for this card are used to embed the dual-interface module. Combinations of LF / HF / UHF transponders in addition to the PKI dual interface DIS are possible. Secure applets allow access to the PKI dual-interface chip, and the security levels of the cards can be programmed according to the environment.

""We recognized early that we have to develop and offer secure software to guarantee the security of data,"" says Steffi Lasch.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.8894942998886108}",neutral,0.8894942998886108,0
SpaceX's Falcon 9 pushes the Thales Alenia Space-built SES-22 satellite up from Cape Canaveral SFS – SatNews - SatNews,"Wed, 29 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5zYXRuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA2LzI5L3NwYWNleC1yZWxlYXNlcy10aGUtc2VzLTIyLXNhdGVsbGl0ZS1mcm9tLWVhcnRocy1ncmF2aXR5LXdpdGgtYS1zdWNjZXNzZnVsLWZhbGNvbi05LWxhdW5jaC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The launch from Cape Canaveral SFS of the SES-22 satellite by SpaceX. Image is courtesy of the SpaceX simulcast of the launch.

The SES-22 satellite was successfully launched into space onboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from SpaceX’s Space Launch Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station (SFS) in Florida, United States, at 5:04 p.m., local time for SES.

Artistic rendition of the SES-22 and SES-23 satellites on-orbit, image is courtesy of Thales Alenia Space.

Built by Thales Alenia Space, the first of SES’s C-band satellites dedicated to freeing up the lower 300 MHz of C-band spectrum will operate in the 135 degrees West orbital slot. The satellite will deliver TV and radio to millions of American homes and provide other critical data transmission services, with satellite operations is expected to start by early August of 2022.

The SES-22 spacecraft had a fast on-ground delivery time as satellite manufacturer Thales Alenia Space shipped it only 22 months after it was ordered. SES-22 is the seventh SES satellite launched by SpaceX over the last 10 years. This was the second launch and landing of this Falcon 9 booster, which previously supported the launch of one Starlink mission.

The launch of SES-22 is part of a broader Federal Communications Commission (FCC) program to clear a portion of C-band spectrum to enable wireless operators to deploy 5G services across the contiguous U.S. (CONUS). In response to a mandate from the FCC, satellite operators, such as SES, are required to transition their existing services from the lower 300 MHz to the upper 200 MHz of C-band spectrum to make room for 5G.

To meet the FCC’s accelerated deadline of clearing C-band spectrum across the U.S. by December of 2023 while maintaining uninterrupted services, SES will launch five satellites – SES-18, SES-19, SES-20, SES-21 and SES-22 in 2022.

“We are thrilled with the successful launch of SES-22, thanks to our partners at Thales Alenia Space and SpaceX,” said Steve Collar, CEO of SES. “The launch of SES-22, together with other upcoming C-band satellite launches scheduled this year, will enable us to continue providing the high-quality services that our customers have been accustomed to over the last several decades, while freeing up spectrum that will enable the US to rapidly unlock the promise of 5G.”

“The successful launch of SES 22 is the result of our long-standing and fruitful collaboration with SES,” said Hervé Derrey, President and CEO of Thales Alenia Space. “This achievement reflects the robustness and flight-proven heritage of our Spacebus 4000 B2 platform combined with our ability to timely and quickly deliver SES-22, two key elements leading to the decision of SES working with us to replace its existing C-Band fleet.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999868631362915}",neutral,0.999868631362915,0
French arms firm busts sanctions to help Russia build weapons - Yahoo News,"Tue, 21 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vdGhhbGVzLWZyYXVkZS1lbi1mcmFuLWFpcy0wNzAwMDAyNDEuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It was the BMD-4 with the Thales-made Catherine FC thermal imaging camera that took part in the shelling of Ukrainian civilian cars in Bucha.

I saw a post by volunteers on a social network, and together with my fellow lawyers we launched our own probe into the French manufacturer's involvement in Russia's military aggression against Ukraine.

Oleksandr Dubilet,

Chairman of the Board of CB ""PrivatBank"" (1997-2016), Financial and banking expert

So-called exemplary company

In France, Thales is not just a public company. There are three arguments to support this assertion.

1) The company specializes in the manufacture of systems for military, aerospace and maritime purposes

2) The company's shares are listed on the Paris Stock Exchange

3) It is not so much the private shareholder (the Dassault family with its 24.62% share) that is important, but the French government and its 25.67% share. Simply put, a company that is more than a quarter controlled by the French government, exports components that kill Ukrainians.

Thales

According to open sources, Thales supplied Catherine FC thermal imaging cameras to Russia, which were used to manufacture the Essa, Plissa and Sosna-U thermal sighting systems. They enhance the combat capabilities of modified Russian T-80, T-90, T-72 tanks and other military vehicles.

Conscious violators

After photo and video evidence of ""fruitful"" cooperation between Thales and Russia appeared on the Internet thanks to volunteers, my fellow lawyers and I have found real evidence that Thales supplied these combat components after the imposition of sanctions related to Russia's annexation of the Crimea.

Since this model of equipment was created in 2016, foreign manufacturers had to supply components at least a year earlier. Consequently, Thales sold military goods and technologies to Russia after the introduction of the first wave of sanctions (Council Regulation (EU) No. 833/2014 of July 31, 2014).

Catherine FC

Are these sanctions significant? Undoubtedly. In 2015, Thales failed to sign a $1.3 billion deal to supply two helicopter carriers to Russia. Instead, both ships were sold to Egypt.

I will also talk about a lesser-known episode of illegal but profitable cooperation between Thales and the aggressor state. The French company Sofradir, a subsidiary company of Thales, specializes in the manufacture of infrared detectors for military, space and commercial use.

According to NGO Disclose, in 2016, the company supplied 83 infrared detectors (S24) and 258 infrared detectors (S02) to Russia's CJSC TPK Linkos.

What is Linkos? According to the Arms of Russia information agency, Linkos specializes in the development and production of computers and communications equipment, optical, optical and electronic and microwave systems and complexes, night vision equipment and quantum electronics products.

In addition, Sofradir supplied 138 infrared detectors (S10) to JSC NPO GIPO, the Russian state institute of applied optics, which develops and manufactures optical and electronic systems. Since 2008, GIPO has been a part of the Rostekhnologii state corporation.

Mutually beneficial cooperation between this subsidiary of Thales and Russian military institutions is evidenced by two decisions (documents 1 and 2) of the 2016 Inter-ministerial Commission for the Study of Military Exports (CIEMMG) of France. According to the documents found by our team, French officials allowed Sofradir to supply military technology and goods despite the sanctions.

In 2019, Sofradir and Ulis merged and created a new company – Lynred. The well-known Thales is a 50% shareholder in Lynred.

The conclusion is simple: Sofradir actually misled the Inter-ministerial Commission by concluding an additional agreement ""to fulfill the contract."" The additional agreement extended the contract and aimed at circumventing sanctions for further supplies of military technology to Russia.

I and my colleagues found information that proves that Thales violated the sanctions in both the first (thermal imaging cameras) and the second (infrared detectors, through the subsidiary Sofradir) episodes, in the public domain (!). In my opinion, this illustrates the perception of sanctions very well. That is, the above French companies did not even bother to conceal evidence of their sanctions violations.

Demanding action

An EU Council decision bans the supply of dual-use goods and technology to Russia. However, you may be interested to know that this document has a loophole that reads as follows: the authorized state body may issue a license to supply such goods under contracts concluded before August 1, 2014.

And the French company Thales took full advantage of it, deliberately extending the old contracts through additional agreements and actually supplying military goods in 2015-2018.

My team of lawyers is working on each of two episodes of criminal cooperation between Thales and its subsidiary Sofradir with Russia. We have sent statements to the EU Council as the body that imposed the sanctions, as well as informing the law enforcement agencies, in particular, the French prosecutor's office. Our goal is to open criminal cases based on these statements.

Having revealed the corporate structure of Thales and identified the shareholders (in particular, the French government), we plan to address the shareholders of this company, French banks, secondary monitoring bodies and stock exchanges and demand that they take appropriate action against sanctions violators.

As in the case of our legal ""hunt"" for the Belgian company New Lachaussee, which supplied ammunition equipment for the Kalashnikov concern, the purpose of international lawsuits against Thales is to punish violators of sanctions and show the toxicity of any cooperation with the aggressor state.

At a time when Ukrainians are dying for European values, Europe must be completely on our side.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9995545744895935}",neutral,0.9995545744895935,0

Press Release: Thales launches revolutionary airport scanner HELIXVIEW - Runway Girl Network,"Wed, 15 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMjIvMDYvdGhhbGVzLWhlbGl4dmlldy1haXJwb3J0LXNjYW5uZXIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airport security checkpoints are synonymous with the stressful and complex process of having to juggle with bags, liquids, and electrical appliances. Passengers are rediscovering the pleasures of flight… along with some of the more laborious aspects of catching a plane such as that delicate phase at the security checkpoint where liquids and electronic items have to be removed from our hand luggage and scanned separately. In this context, Thales has developed a new scanner named HELIXVIEW, which could revolutionize the airport experience for both passengers and airlines companies.

HELIXVIEW, based on Thales expertise in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Cybersecurity, is a stationary, compact, and lightweight EDS CB C3-compliant scanner (the next standard applied to the certification for EDS CB) that combines X-ray nanotechnology-based electronic scanning and 3D imaging reconstruction.

With this solution installed in checkpoints, passengers will no longer need to remove their items from luggage. The technology is fine-tuned to detect all forms of prohibited items, whether explosives, knives, or even weapons that have been dismantled and positioned in separate parts across several bags.

Artificial Intelligence capabilities are leveraged to detect and interpret threats. The system then instantly provides the operator with a threat/no threat instruction for the bag.

Security airport concerns remain as present as ever for airport staff and airlines, who need to be able to ensure precise and failsafe threat detection. Checkpoints need higher degrees of security and, by association, higher levels of technological requirements and more powerful new-generation equipment. With a reduced size, weight and overall footprint, HELIXVIEW will enable airports to optimize the space at their disposal.

Instead of heavy and cumbersome parts that require two people to lift them out of the machine for repair, the mechanics of this system are simple and motionless; there are no moving parts or vibrations. Anything that needs to be replaced can be done quickly, easily and no physically demanding.

“I am very pleased to present HELIXVIEW, our new airport scanner. I am sure that passengers will appreciate this new smoother and faster security checks using attractively and ergonomically-designed systems. This new technology will bring higher security and comfort with an optimal cost-performance ratio” – Yannick Assouad, Executive Vice President, Avionics, Thales

The HELIXVIEW product is aiming for certification by the end of 2023.

This new solution beneficiates from the support of BPI through i-demo project initiative.

Finland's Hyperco's first acquisition: an Equinix & Thales-occupied data center in Helsinki - DatacenterDynamics,"Thu, 16 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYXRhY2VudGVyZHluYW1pY3MuY29tL2VuL25ld3MvZmlubGFuZHMtaHlwZXJjb3MtZmlyc3QtYWNxdWlzaXRpb24tYW4tZXF1aW5peC10aGFsZXMtb2NjdXBpZWQtZGF0YS1jZW50ZXItaW4taGVsc2lua2kv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The company announced this week it had acquired the property from TS-Yhtymä, a Finnish family office, at a total transaction value of over €35 million ($36.4m).

The property, located at Myllynkivenkuja 4 in Vantaa, has two long-term tenants: Equinix and Thales.

The industrial building, located next to a power plant, totals 16,900 square meters (181,900 sq ft) of leasable area, and has potential for a 6,500 sqm (70,000 sqft) extension.

Equinix offers colocation from the site, listing it as HE4 and offering 1,840sqm (19,805 sq ft) of colocation space across two floors.

Hyperco was formed less than a year ago, and this is its first acquisition. The company said that it plans to invest in both existing data centers as well as large build-to-suit developments in the next couple of years, both locally and in other Nordic countries.

A real estate credit fund managed by Morgan Stanley Investment Management provided senior financing for the transaction.

“We see plenty of potential for development at the property as it features valid industrial zoning, plenty of unused building rights, and excellent fiber and electricity connections. A 10-20MW data center could be developed on the site, and we are currently planning the extension”, said Hyperco CEO, Timo Pohjanpalo. “We see plenty of exciting investment and development opportunities in Finland and the Nordics, particularly now, as power and land availability issues are constraining supply in other markets. Having committed and sophisticated blue-chip investors, now and in the future, support us in executing on these opportunities via hands-on work is important for us”

Helixview is a C3-compliant scanner (next EDS CB standard) that combines x-ray nanotechnology-based electronic scanning and 3D imaging reconstruction. With this solution installed at checkpoints, passengers will no longer need to remove items from their luggage.

The technology can detect all forms of prohibited items: explosives, knives or even weapons that have been dismantled and positioned in separate parts across several bags. Artificial intelligence (AI) is leveraged to detect and interpret threats. The system then instantly provides the operator with a threat/no threat instruction for the bag.

Thales has endeavored to reduce the size, weight and overall footprint of Helixview to enable airports to optimize their space. Instead of heavy parts that require two people to lift them out of the machine for repair, the mechanics of this system have no moving parts or vibrations. This means that anything that needs to be replaced can be done so quickly and easily. The Helixview product is aiming for certification by the end of 2023.

Yannick Assouad, executive vice president of avionics at Thales, said, “I am very pleased to present Helixview, our new airport scanner. I am sure that passengers will appreciate the new smoother and faster security checks using attractively and ergonomically designed systems. This new technology will bring higher security and comfort with an optimal cost-performance ratio.”

On June 14th, 2022, Arquus, Thales and NTGS have officially presented the new Sherpa A2M (Advanced Mobile Mortar), during a ceremony organized on Arquus’ booth at Eurosatory 2022.

The Sherpa A2M is an adequate answer to the tactical challenges met and created by artillery in the high-intensity warfare: mobility, protection, close support to the troops on the ground and mobile counter-battery options at the fraction of the price of a Self-Propelled Gun (SPG).

The alliance of Arquus, NTGS and Thales allows the application of a truly complete solution delivering a unique indirect fire support solution, suitable for infantry support, collaborative armed forces troops and Special Forces, as well as autonomous artillery units looking for a high level of mobility and protection.

The Sherpa A2M combines the excellent mobility of a Sherpa Light, the proven Deployable Mortar System by NTGS and the 120mm rifled mortar barrel by Thales, into one full fully integrated new solution.

Thanks to Thales capability, the vehicle embeds 120 mm rifled ammunition and in the future the mortar laser guided ammunition. The rifled mortar barrel is three times more precise than smoothbore mortar. ​



Sherpa A2M

Due to this superior efficiency and accuracy, it can achieve similar operational effects with much less shots; around 4 times less rounds needed than for a smoothbore mortar.

NTGS provides its skills in global systems with the fire control system in the back of the vehicle. This system conveys information about targets and points of interest, which represents a significant strategic advantage. Thanks to their expertise, the A2M Sherpa delivers control across all mission operations and is already combat proven. The mortar and tube from NTGS and Thales are qualified both by NATO and by different armies.

The Sherpa Light is a multipurpose, 4x4 armored vehicle, designed by Arquus to provide with a wide array of versions and customizations for all needs and missions, built on a single, proven base for increased commonality and ease of maintenance. It is a modern, mature, new-generation vehicle, which is built on many years of industrial experience, operational deployments on the battlefield and maintenance.It is protected against ballistic and mine as well as improvised explosive device threats with a STANAG 4569-certified protection, which ensures a high level of safety for the crew inside the vehicle during operations.

The Sherpa A2M can carry 40 rounds of 120mm mortar ammunition in the rear and possibly additional ammunition in the cabin, depending on user requirements. It has a range up to 8,2 km with standard rifled ammunition and up to 13km with a rocket assisted projectile, allowing it to enhance the protection of the embarked soldiers by engaging units without being hit (Shoot & Scoot).

Combining the expertise of these three companies’ expertise ensures the highest level of quality for each of the Sherpa A2M’s features: protected tactical mobility, ruggedness, superior firepower and accuracy, as well as easy deployable systems and intuitive fire control.

At Eurosatory 2022, the Sherpa A2M is presented with a Hornet Lite RCWS fitted with a 7.62mm MG for the vehicle's self-protection.

The Sherpa A2M can be seen on the Arquus booth, Hall 5A F281.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9988747239112854}",positive,0.9988747239112854,1

Airservices Australia has chosen Thales as its primary system integrator for an Integrated Drone Surveillance System (IDSS) trial at Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport.

The system of systems provided by Thales for the IDSS program integrates several sensors and an advanced command and control system to classify, recognise and identify potential threats in airspace around aerodromes.

At the core of the system, is a 3D holographic radar system, trusted by customers from international airports around the world including the United Kingdom, South East Asia and Oceana, for its safety, reliability, and excellent detection performances and classification of all types and sizes of drones.





Thales has been selected by Airservices Australia, an Australian Government-owned organisation responsible for the safe and efficient management of 11 per cent of the world’s airspace, as the prime systems integrator to launch an Integrated Drone Surveillance Trial utilising the company’s advanced drone surveillance solution.

With the use of drones for commercial and leisure purposes expected to grow exponentially, it is becoming a necessity to identify and efficiently manage their activity near airports.

A world leading systems-of-systems and solutions integrator for over 50 years, Thales is pushing technology boundaries with partners and airports to deliver advanced integrated drone surveillance systems for any airport configuration. Thales will commence a trial in 2022 at Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport, one of the busiest aerodromes in the world. ​

Thales’ solution uses a multi-layered sensor approach and advanced command and control for the detection, monitoring and identification of drones, as well as being able to pinpoint the location of the drone pilot. The entire system provides a comprehensive picture of the airspace in real time around the airport. At the core of the system is a radar, designed to detect, track and classify small, slow, low UAVs from the smallest remote-piloted drones to more sophisticated autonomous drones, in particular for the glide path where the biggest risk exists. ​

Since its launch in 2019, the solution has been deployed at several airports around the world in Europe, America and Asia. For more than 30 years, Airservices Australia has trusted and relied on Thales as the supplier of key ATM infrastructure and solutions, including the OneSKY program, the largest transformation of Australian ATM systems to date.

“Airservices, in partnership with Australian Government agencies, implemented drone detection capabilities at major airports across Australia several years ago. As uncrewed aircraft technologies continue to evolve and increase in use, we are investing in solutions that keep pace with latest developments. Our partnership with Thales allows us to trial next-generation drone detection capabilities to enhance the safe operation of crewed and uncrewed flights operating together in Australian airspace.” Peter Curran, Chief Customer Experience and Strategy Officer, Airservices Australia.

“We are looking forward to starting trials in partnership with Airservices Australia, to enhance their detection capabilities of drones. This partnership strengthens our collaboration of more than 30 years and represents a key building block for our strategy. Over the years, Thales has developed a strong expertise and experience to master the entire drone ecosystem to offer cutting-edge solutions. Indeed, we have demonstrated our ability to be a strong player in the field of airport air surveillance and anti-drone systems, through various worldwide references to date and our 3D holographic radar system solution is becoming a ‘game changer’ in protecting aircraft from rogue drones whilst maintaining airport operations.”Christophe Salomon, Executive Vice President Land and Air Systems, Thales.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999576807022095}",neutral,0.9999576807022095,0

LinkedIn

The 24th Congress of the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, also encompassing space information sciences, took place this week in Nice. Thales Alenia Space was one of the event sponsors, and our teams showcased the company’s wide range of solutions, innovations and technologies in these areas.

Earth observation and remote sensing

We provided an overview of European programs involving Earth observation satellites and sensors, including imagers, spectrometers and interferometers. One of the leading programs is of course Copernicus, conducted by the European Commission, with a series of Sentinel satellite families developed by the European space industry for the European Space Agency (ESA). These spacecraft play a key role in environmental monitoring for Europe. Our company contributes to 11 of the 12 Copernicus missions, working hand in hand with ESA and the entire European space industry.

There are now six families of Sentinel satellites: Sentinel-1 provides radar data continuity with ERS and Envisat; Sentinel-2 and -3 monitor land and oceans; the Sentinel-4 and -5 instruments are designed for meteorology and climatology missions; and Sentinel-6 ensures operational continuity with Jason altimetry satellites.

Thales Alenia Space is prime contractor for the Sentinel-1 and -3 families (4 satellites each): in charge of the image ground segment for Sentinel-2; contributes to the imaging spectrometer on Sentinel-5P and the Poseidon-4 radar altimeter for Sentinel-6. In addition, we have been chosen for five of the six new Copernicus Expansion missions, as prime for three of these missions (CIMR, ROSE-L and CHIME), and payload supplier for two more (CO2M and CRISTAL). These new satellites will be used to measure carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from human activities, to check the thickness of the ice pack and overlying snow, to support advanced new services for the sustainable management of farms and biodiversity, to monitor sea surface temperature and salinity, as well as ice pack concentration, and to strengthen land monitoring capacity and emergency management services.

About smart space telescopes

In recent decades, government programs have developed state-of-the-art optical technologies and equipment combining high value and industrial efficiency. Thales Alenia Space has built on its long legacy in high and very-high resolution optics to deliver extremely competitive and high-performance smart telescope solutions. These telescopes are perfectly suited to the emerging market of spaceborne optical observation spacecraft featuring high revisit rates.

MTG infrared sounder

The congress also allowed us to focus on a state-of-the-art instrument, the infrared sounder, that will pave the way to future Earth observation systems. We reviewed the latest test results of the central spectrometer to spotlight its radiometric and spectral performance qualities.

The Meteosat Third Generation (MTG) family comprises six satellites: four imagers and two atmospheric sounders, capable of providing a 3D map of the atmosphere. This is a world first and a transformational breakthrough. These sounders will allow us to detect extreme climate phenomena a full half-day earlier than before. Also, by using the entire MTG system, meteorologists will be able to fine-tune weather forecasts up to eight days in advance – a major step forward in warning communities at risk when dangerous events are detected. MTG will not only help save lives, but also pave the way for new types of services that will benefit people in both Europe and Africa. Once the entire MTG fleet is in orbit, Eumetsat will deliver the world’s best-performing weather forecasting services.

Flexible satellite solutions, configurable in orbit

New platforms must meet market expectations and the specific requirements for remote sensing payloads. The key criteria that have to be designed into any new project include agility, flexibility, durability, innovation and a drastic reduction in development time and cost. We have been able to solve this difficult equation by applying co-engineering and co-production approaches with the other companies involved, through partnerships.

Artificial intelligence on observation satellites: examples, results in orbit and outlook

Thales Alenia Space, along with partners in the Saint-Exupéry Technological Research Institute (IRT), coordinated and funded the Responsive and Autonomous Imaging Chain (CIAR) project. CIAR tests the technologies needed to deploy artificial intelligence for image processing by embedded systems, whether on robots, satellites, drones or other vehicles.

The project was chosen for ESA’s OPS-SAT technology demonstrator, which aims to show the improvements in mission capability once satellites are equipped with computers as powerful as those down on Earth. This cubesat is a real flying lab, used to test new techniques concerning mission control and onboard systems. The program was conducted by the Austria’s Graz University of Technology as prime contractor, in conjunction with European partners.

In 2021, the CIAR consortium, working with ESA, successfully downloaded a neural network via a field programmable gate array (FPGA) device in a satellite. This was the first time a neural network had been deployed in orbit on this type of equipment – an achievement spotlighted during the previous congress.

This year, we’re focusing on another application: the detection and classification of vessels from space (architectures used, performance before and after deployment).

AI will allow us, for example, to process and/or analyze images, detect any potential anomalies, obtain information concerning the trajectory of a platform, and analyze communications signals to detect jamming. Used in Earth observation, satellite navigation or telecommunications, AI would significantly expand the scope of application. AI will of course make satellites even smarter. Tomorrow’s satellites with AI-based technologies could carry out tasks such as automated detection of anomalies, predictive maintenance and root cause analyses, even up to decision making. In short, artificial intelligence is an unrivaled gateway to autonomous satellite operation.

With a passion for scientific study and research, as well as a life-long love affair with target rifle shooting, Emma Coen says the path that led her to work as a Senior Research and Design Engineer in the Research & Development Team in Australian Munitions was one of many happy accidents. Moving from the bright lights of Sydney to regional New South Wales, Emma has spent the last 15 years contributing to an industry she loves and is proud to be a part of. Here is her story.

Emma started her professional career as a theoretical polymer chemist, applying her knowledge in the pharmaceutical industry by developing inhalable insulin for a biotechnology start-up in the early 2000s. During this time, she also obtained a PhD from the University of Sydney and a Post Doctorate from the University of New South Wales, conducting research into high pressure gases and their unusual properties. Emma then moved into pharmaceutical formulations, in a biotechnology start-up. As with many start-ups, the company was experiencing financial challenges and Emma decided to pursue opportunities elsewhere. When Emma saw an ad for a position at Australian Defence Industries, she thought to herself “it’s a far cry from my work in polymers but I’ve been target rifle shooting since I was 14 so I know a bit about bullets.”

In 2007, she started working as a Product Development Scientist in the Research & Development team for Thales Australia in regional NSW. She was heavily involved in the development of mining boosters, a product that become very commercially successful. “When you’re in the lab mixing things in a beaker, you’re so concentrated on the job at hand, you don’t think much about the flow on effects. However, it’s been very gratifying to know I was part of something that has hugely benefited Thales and led to job creation, which is so important in small country towns.” During this time, she was selected to study and obtain a Master of Science in Explosive Ordnance Engineering from Cranfield University in the United Kingdom. “I’m never one to shy away from taking on extra studies to increase my knowledge so I loved my time there and am very grateful to have been given the opportunity.”

After another two years, Emma started to look for new opportunities within Thales to broaden her skills and experience. “I didn’t have to look very far or hard because as soon as I saw the high explosives plant, it was love at first sight.” She took on the role of Production Engineer – High Explosives and considers learning to be a shift engineer for the plant as one of her career highlights, likening it to driving a cruise ship - “challenging but so, so beautiful.” As much as Emma enjoyed her role, she realised that shift production work is difficult as a single mother with an energetic five-year-old and made the decision to return to her former team of Research & Development, in the role of Senior Research and Development Engineer.

One of the major projects she’s currently working on is the bilateral collaboration between Defence Science and Technology Group (DSTG), the Advanced Rocket Motor Technology Demonstrator. Emma explains that DSGT had spent eight years developing advanced rocket motor technology in the lab - Thales is now industrialising it to be made on a commercial and industrial scale. Emma is working on the propellant for larger rocket systems - one of the challenges when scaling up is ensuring the rocket fuel interacts properly with the rocket because the fuel starts curing as it is being made, “we have to mix the propellant ingredients fairly quickly to make sure we can pour it into the cases before it hardens,” explains Emma, ‘also, to ensure we keep a safe distance, we are in a building that’s a fair distance away when the ingredients are being mixed together, which means we can’t physically see and check its consistency. We have to rely heavily on advanced process control, and on our experience.”

Once the rockets are made, the team will start the testing program – both static burning and flight trials, in conjunction with DSTG and our Australian SMEs supporting this program. “If the rockets perform as we expect, then we may look to make even larger rockets. It’s a long-term strategically importance program, and is very exciting.”

More broadly, Emma and the team are looking to bring in the next generation of scientists and engineers into the Research & Development Team to support growth in sovereign capability. There is no university in Australia that teaches explosive ordnance engineering and so the Thales Australia’s strategy is to hire smart, passionate people to train and mentor whilst working with the education ecosystem to develop these courses. “It’s such a fascinating field and I encourage anyone who is interested in the field to just go for it,” Emma says before adding “It’s a male dominated industry, no doubt about that, but in all the years I’ve been in the industry, no one’s ever told me I couldn’t do something because of my gender. The Research & Development team hires talent based on merit and intellect. We value people who are passionate and are creative problem solvers.”

Southern Launch takes Australia's aerospace capability to new heights - Thales,"Wed, 01 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi9hdXN0cmFsaWEvbmV3cy9zb3V0aGVybi1sYXVuY2gtdGFrZXMtYXVzdHJhbGlhcy1hZXJvc3BhY2UtY2FwYWJpbGl0eS1uZXctaGVpZ2h0c9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Southern Launch is taking entrepreneurship to new heights in South Australia. By aligning their business goals with defence industry priorities, they are demonstrating a new approach to innovative, technology-driven solutions in a forward-focused industry.

With the release of the Commonwealth’s Force Structure Plan in July 2020, that identified $100 Billion to be spent over the next 15 to 20 years on Guided Weapons and Hypersonics, Thales has been working hard to accelerate our Guided, Space and Hypersonic activities across a range of programs to support the government initiative to enhance Australia’s sovereign capability and sustainment of guided weapons.

Following the 2020 Defence Strategic Update’s new policy framework, the Advanced Rocket Motor Technology Demonstrator (ARMTD) Program is being accelerated to further develop Australian sovereign capabilities with Australian suppliers and create Australian jobs. Thales, Defence Science and Technology Group (DST) and Australian supply chain partners are working together to validate and demonstrate advanced rocket motor technology and create an advanced military-relevant rocket motor capable of hypersonic flight.

Southern Launch, as Australia’s only approved space agency launch facility, has a unique part to play in this program, and are contributing significantly to the testing phases.

They offer an end-to-end service for both Australian and international clients, and have demonstrated their capability to manage preparation and operations including mathematical flight performance simulations, safety management and logistics for launch testing.

Founded in 2017, Southern Launch have established two alternative launch ranges, Koonibba Test Range (KTR) and Whalers Way Orbital Launch Complex (WWOLC), and developed two major areas of business – design as a service, and launch facilities and operations.

Partnering with Thales for the ARMTD program has seen Southern Launch combine its two specialities, design and launch. Southern Launch modelled the dynamics of the flight vehicle and designed the onboard avionics and flight systems to support Thales’ rocket motor.

Lloyd Damp, Chief Executive Officer, Southern Launch

A key aspect of this process included Southern Launch securing the necessary permits to take the technology to the launch facilities and be able to test it in a physical environment. In order to test new products and receive approval from regulators, the rocket design and operation is required to be safe and have a low environmental impact. Achieving this is difficult without experienced engineers like the team at Southern Launch who have been able to accelerate the approval process using experience, and through strong stakeholder and government engagement.

Partnering with Thales has been an exciting opportunity for Southern Launch. The close working relationship, which continues to grow as the program develops, has seen a true collaboration established.

“The level of inclusion on the decision-making process has been exceptional with Thales. They have truly taken us under their wing and said, “let’s do this amazing work together”’ said Lloyd Damp, Chief Executive Officer of Southern Launch.

As Southern Launch begins to mature as a company, and with the establishment of longer-term contracts such as the ARMTD program, they are looking to expand their team of 27 by offering traineeships and career pathways. Mr Damp is also currently looking to hire more specialised engineers and said the aerospace industry is often intimidating to those not from a traditional space background.

“The key elements we look for are a desire to be challenged, a willingness to push the envelope, and look outside the text book. We can train for specific roles, but recruit from a broad range of skillsets from boilermakers to engineering PhDs” said Mr Damp.

Southern Launch is hopeful that the ARMTD program will help to accelerate the aerospace industry and Australia’s sovereign GWEO capabilities. As Thales continues to source key weapon components and services from Australian SMEs, job opportunities in the supply chain will likely increase. According to research by Accenture, over half of the supply chain jobs that Thales is supporting through their Australian programs are from SMEs.

“Partnering with Southern Launch has seen accelerated development of Australian sovereign capabilities within the Guided, Space and Hypersonics enterprise. We are proud to further support this rapidly growing industry and look forward to collaborating to shape the future of High-Speed weapon systems from Australia” said Duncan Watt, General Manager of Guided Weapon Systems at Thales Australia.

“We hope that Southern Launch is front and centre in supporting Australia’s sovereign Defence capability,” said Mr Damp

“I believe we are at the crest of a wave that will develop something unique for Australia and will be marketable to the broader international market.” By developing a space launch capability, Southern Launch are creating accessibility to space for all Australians, so we can advance and improve how we operate technology and communications, not just for the Defence industry, but beyond.

Contact Thales to find out how you can partner with us to deliver Australia’s Sovereign Guided Weapons Enterprise program and contribute to local job creation and industry growth.

How to enhance resilience by addressing human factors - Thales,"Tue, 07 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi91bml0ZWQta2luZ2RvbS9uZXdzL2hvdy1lbmhhbmNlLXJlc2lsaWVuY2UtYWRkcmVzc2luZy1odW1hbi1mYWN0b3Jz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"How to enhance resilience by addressing human factors Share this article

Amanda Widdowson

By Amanda Widdowson, Head of Human Factors Capability at Thales in the UK

This article was originally published in Cyber magazine.

Cyber security incidents are often attributed to ‘human error’. Amanda Widdowson says organisations can reduce risk by applying a human factors approach.

In 2020, a study found “95% of cyber security breaches are due to human error”. Therefore, addressing cyber security, without considering the human element, would be like locking all the windows on your house but leaving the front door wide open. Changing employee behaviour can be difficult, time-consuming, expensive and arguably unethical. However, human factors experts have identified practical actions to enable organisations to minimise the risk of human-related cyber security incidents.

Two new papers by the Chartered Institute of Ergonomics and Human Factors (CIEHF) provide guidance regarding behaviour change, cyber security maturity levels, organisational resilience, board decision-making and presentation of cyber security information. The Human Affected Cyber Security (HACS) framework paper identifies categories of risky human behaviour. Organisational causes were found to be at the root of most of them. Some behaviours and solutions follow.

User validation violations

The use of passwords for user validation is heavily reliant on limited human memory capacity. A typical user will require many passwords for personal and professional applications and websites. There is a risk that people will use the same, easy to remember password for several applications, so if one is compromised, the rest are too. Biometric technologies may be a better solution because they eliminate reliance on human memory. Fingerprint and facial recognition systems are common on smart phones, but could be better utilised in commercial computer equipment and applications.

Information sharing and misuse of technology

If cyber security policies are too strict employees are likely to find workarounds, such as transferring information using personal email accounts or unauthorised memory storage devices. Blaming users is not helpful. Instead, the procedures need to be designed around jobs and, if possible, the most secure way to perform a task should also be the easiest way. To achieve this, employees need to be consulted in the design of procedures.

Information shared in public areas, and online, fuels targeted phishing campaigns. This can be monitored by open-source intelligence surveys.

A common observation from Cyber Vulnerability Investigations is a tendency for employees to rely on their IT department to protect them from cyber-attacks. In a mature culture, everybody takes responsibility for their own cyber security. Cultural change programmes can help to achieve this.

Training

Reasons for poor cyber security awareness include a lack of accessible, well-designed, relevant training. Effective training uses examples of consequences that are meaningful to the target audience. The aim is to frighten, but provide solutions. A competence management system can be used to monitor training completion and understanding.

Poor monitoring and incident management

Employees need to be able to report incidents easily and without fear of blame or punishment. Significant or common incidents should be monitored, investigated and associated lessons, captured and applied. Incident investigation should cover human factors considerations with the help of a competent practitioner. Organisations need to be prepared to respond to an attack.

Neglecting physical environment security

Although it may not seem like an obvious part of cyber security, an important attack route, especially for ‘air-gapped’ systems which are not connected to the Internet, is the physical working environment. Attackers may gain unauthorised access by ‘tailgating’; following authorised personnel through entry points. They then seek access to electronic systems through unprotected server rooms, unlocked computers, and inserting memory sticks. Paper-based information left on desks, printers or in unlocked storage facilities, may also be targeted.

An understanding of human factors can help identify and reduce the vulnerability of the physical environment. If people are used to seeing strangers in their working environment, they might be less likely to challenge an unauthorised attacker. Good visitor identification can mitigate this. Tailgating can be alleviated by turnstiles and security personnel at entry points. Politeness can prevent employees from checking credentials before allowing access, so clear allocation of this responsibility to security personnel can help. The security of remote working environments also needs to be considered.

Deliberate, malicious attack

Although statistics show the majority of ‘insider threat’ incidents are caused by non-malicious behaviours , the framework also addresses deliberate attacks. If employees feel unappreciated, at risk of redundancy, or disagree with an organisational policy, the risk of them compromising the organisation increases. It is therefore prudent to provide emotional support mechanisms, assess morale using engagement surveys and conduct monitoring.

Conclusion

With the rise of cyber-attacks that circumvent technical defences, arguably the best defence is to consider the human. Cyber resilience strategies need to incorporate human factors if they are to fully address risk.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9996967315673828}",neutral,0.9996967315673828,0

It is a follow-on contract for the SICRAL 3 secure satellite communications system and its ground segment.

This latest contract covers the development of phase D2. It continues a complex, process that started with the initial phases 0/A, followed by phases B and C and several implementation phases, leading up to the launch of SICRAL 3A by 2026 and subsequently the launch of SICRAL 3B.

SICRAL, the Italian System for Secure Communications and Alerts, comprises geostationary satellites for strategic and tactical communications, which support various defense missions, both in Italy and abroad. The new SICRAL 3 system is designed to meet Italian defense communications and interoperability requirements. It will ensure continuity with the current SHF and UHF-band telecom services provided by the SICRAL 1A, 1B and SICRAL 2 satellites, while expanding its range of services with a new Ka-band payload, as well as supporting security, public rescue and civil protection services.

“Thanks to SICRAL 3, Italy and NATO can continue to count on safe, effective satellite communications. Leonardo and Thales, through the Space Alliance, are very proud of SICRAL. It‘s a textbook case of complex space program management and the sterling collaboration between industry and the Ministry of Defense. By continuing this program and expanding the services provided, especially with the new Ka-band capacity and the IW (Integrated Waveform) platform, the Italian Ministry of Defense will deploy the required operational capacity and consolidate its existing partnership with industry on UHF services,” Luigi Pasquali, Leonardo’s Space Activities Coordinator and CEO of Telespazio, said in a statement.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9940595626831055}",neutral,0.9940595626831055,0

Thales Alenia Space, the joint venture between Thales (67%) and Leonardo (33%), has signed a new contract with the EU Agency for the Space Programme (EUSPA) to develop, qualify and deploy the new European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) version.

Thales Alenia Space has also just reached a new milestone in the Galileo program with the integration of a new satellite into Galileo’s Ground Mission Segment (GMS) which will improve positioning service for 3.3 billion users.

EGNOS Upgrade

Thales Alenia Space will provide EUSPA and the EU navigation community with a new version of EGNOS (V243). Its operations will be secured by a new state-of-the art Navigation Land Earth Station technology developed by Thales Alenia Space – NLES-G3.

The NLES transmits the EGNOS message containing all accuracy and integrity corrections to the geostationary satellites for broadcast to users such as aviation operators. Thales Alenia Space NLES-G3 will be integrated with a new geostationary satellite, GEO3, which will enhance the EGNOS system and its end-to-end performance.

Certification and commissioning of this latest version is slated for 2024.

Galileo Milestone

Thales Alenia Space also is the prime contractor for Galileo First Generation’s Ground Mission Segment. Galileo has achieved a milestone with the Galileo constellation approaching final steps before its completion with the GSAT0223 satellite. GSAT0223 will increase the operational constellation to 23 satellites for positioning and 25 for search and rescue.

Thales College to commence classes in September - Restoration NewsMedia - Restoration NewsMedia,"Tue, 07 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vcmVzdG9yYXRpb25uZXdzbWVkaWEuY29tL2FydGljbGVzL3dha2V3ZWVrbHkvdGhhbGVzLWNvbGxlZ2UtdG8tY29tbWVuY2UtY2xhc3Nlcy1pbi1zZXB0ZW1iZXIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"WAKE FOREST — A ribbon-cutting ceremony and open house for Thales College was held June 1.

Founded by Robert Luddy and located on Heritage Trade Drive, the three-year college will start with small numbers. The expected class size for the inaugural semester in September is approximately 15, but the numbers are expected to grow as exponentially as Thales College continues into the future.

Luddy started Thales Academy in 2007 in Apex with 30 students enrolling. Since then, 12 additional campuses have been created, including a pre-K through fifth-grade institution in Wake Forest, located next to the college.

In all, more than 5,800 students are currently enrolled in Thales Academy from pre-K through 12th grade. Additional campuses are located in Richmond, Virg. and Franklin, Tenn., as well as those scheduled to open in Cary and Flowers Plantation, N.C. by August and Greenville, S.C. in 2023.

Luddy, founder of CaptiveAire Systems, also founded Franklin Academy in Wake Forest and St. Thomas More Academy in Raleigh. Thales Academy is named after Greek mathematician, astronomer and pre-Socratic philosopher Thales of Miletus — credited with discovering the seasons.

Luddy said he has focused on making Thales Academy an affordable private institution, and will do the same with Thales College.

“We hope to have students who won’t run into debt, will have experience from internships and apprenticeships, have good academic backgrounds and ready to go into the workplace to make an impact,” Luddy said.

It will take time before enrollment numbers increase, but Luddy said he’s excited about the group coming in and applications are still being accepted for enrollment in September.

“Similar to Thales Academy, we’re looking to build slowly but surely and I believe it’ll be great,” Luddy said.

Keller Moore is one of the members of the inaugural class and said he was attracted to what the college can provide.

“I was looking for a college combining two things that can be difficult to provide — affordability and a depth of learning,” Moore said. “I wanted to find a college that provided a sound learning environment with truth that has stood the test of time, and the curriculum here was incomparable.”

Lucy Fraticelli took dual enrollment classes at Thales last year and said she wanted to continue learning at the college.

“I really enjoy the combination of STEM with the liberal arts,” Fraticelli said. “I feel like people underestimate or mistreat liberal arts, and the affordability here is unmatched. I enjoyed my classes, the professors are great and I didn’t think I would find a better institution.”

Thales College held a dual enrollment program last year for high school juniors and seniors to take courses which will count for college. The courses offered for fall 2022 are Western civilization, writing and rhetoric, calculus and philosophy.

The college will offer three degree options: entrepreneurial business, classic education and leadership, and mechanical engineering. Students will also take core humanities classes, along with liberal arts.

Three faculty mentors will also serve the interests of students: Peter Forrest, dean of humanities; Phillip Johnson, engineering and sciences professor, and Sydney Leonard, humanities instructor, admissions and student life counselor.

Forrest said he believes in the message of Thales College, which is why he came aboard.

“I’m convinced that higher education in the U.S. is deeply dysfunctional,” Forrest said. “It doesn’t deliver a good deal for many students, who end up with a lot of debt and don’t necessarily have the practical skills or direction for a successful career. I believe Mr. Luddy has a better vision with Thales College, and there’s a combination of the practical and philosophical here.”

"Dassault, Thales, and MBDA sued for complicity in war on Yemen - Al Mayadeen English","Sat, 04 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vZW5nbGlzaC5hbG1heWFkZWVuLm5ldC9uZXdzL3BvbGl0aWNzL2Rhc3NhdWx0LXRoYWxlcy1hbmQtbWJkYS1zdWVkLWZvci1jb21wbGljaXR5LWluLXdhci1vbi15ZW1lbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The three companies are being sued for complicity in crimes against Yemeni civilians, considering that they sell weapons to the Saudi-led coalition.

Rafale aircraft (Dassault Aviation)

Three NGOs decided to take legal action in France against the companies of Dassault, Thalès, and MBDA France. The companies are accused of complicity in war crimes due to their arms sales contracts to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which used the weapons against Yemeni civilians in the Saudi-led aggression on Yemen.

A member of the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights (ECCHR), Canel Lavit, who is also one of the civil parties that filed a complaint against the three companies, explained that ""export arms to the coalition (led by Saudi Arabia), knowing that she has been committing war crimes since 2015 in Yemen.” These companies are also accused of complicity in crimes against humanity.

Another group, the Center for Rights and Development “Eye of humanity” declared earlier last month, May, that “the total number of martyrs and wounded during the 2,600 days of coalition aggression against Yemen ( at the time), reached 46,374, including 17,775 martyrs and 28,599 wounded.""

Prior to those statements, the UN had declared Yemen at risk of the largest feminine in modern history with over 25.5 million Yemenis living below the poverty line as a result of a bloody war that has extended for over 7 years.

Dassault had sold UAE 80 Rafale aircraft used in the coalition’s aggression on Yemen and aided in the maintenance of 59 Mirage planes that resulted in the death of several Yemeni civilians. As for MDPA France, they have exported “Storm Shadow” and “Scalp” missiles for coalition forces, whereas Thales is accused of providing the coalition with Damocles and Talios missile guidance systems.

“If we provide arms to an entity suspected of having committed repeated crimes, we facilitate the commission of these crimes,” Ms. Lavit stressed.

Previously, in 2019, Mouwatana, Amnesty International, ECCHR, and two other NGOs filed a complaint with International Criminal Court against 11 European arms companies including Dassault, Thales, and MBDA.

Furthermore, Mouwatana and two other NGOs have been suing RWM Italia, in Italy, under charges of supplying the Saudi-led coalition with the bombs that murdered 6 civilians, 4 of which were children, in an attack in northern Yemen.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.8989712595939636}",neutral,0.8989712595939636,0
"Sherpa A2M: mobile protected indirect firepower from Arquus, NTGS and Thales - EDR Magazine","Mon, 13 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVkcm1hZ2F6aW5lLmV1L3NoZXJwYS1hMm0tbW9iaWxlLXByb3RlY3RlZC1pbmRpcmVjdC1maXJlcG93ZXItZnJvbS1hcnF1dXMtbnRncy1hbmQtdGhhbGVz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Paolo Valpolini

Visiting the Arquus booth at Eurosatory 2022 one brand new product attracts the eye. This is the Mobile Protected Mortar System, based on a Sherpa Scout chassis, also known as A2M for Advanced Mobile Mortar. .

The weapon system mass being well within the vehicle payload limit, this allows the Sherpa to keep all its characteristics in terms of mobility and protection. It maintains the four-door cabin, which level can be adapted to customers’ needs thanks to modular armour packages, residual payload allowing bringing it to the maximum accepted level. The same applies for the mine and IED protection underbelly. The protected bonnet and run-flat inserts ensure good mobility resilience even under attack, the 150 kg bonnet being beneficial to weight distribution.

The vehicle rear flatbed is fitted with the auto-aiming deployable mortar system developed and produced by New Technologies Global Systems (NTGS) of Spain. In travel order the mortar barrel lies horizontally on the vehicle; when deployed, the weapon system is pushed back until the vertical strut that sustains the mortar platform is able to rotate 90° in order to lower the platform on the soil. This means that all recoil forces will be absorbed by the ground, which means that no modification must be carried out on Sherpa suspensions. A motorised arm allows varying the elevation from 45° to 80°, according to the firing data provided by the Fire Control System (FCS). It also allows rotating on the barrel on the x-y plane orienting it in azimuth within a ±60° arc. On the two sides of the vehicle, close to the cabin, we find the ammunition racks, which in the configuration unveiled at can host up to 36 rounds and charges, however EDR On-Line understood that up to 40 rounds could be fitted adopting a slightly different configuration. The two following cabinets host an auxiliary power unit that powers the hydraulic pump that allows the system deployment and redeployment.

While capable to be fitted with various 120 mm and 81 mm barrels, Arquus made the choice of teaming with Thales to provide a high-end solution to its customers, thanks to the superior performances of the 120 mm rifled mortar compared to smoothbore tubes. In service with many nations both in the towed version and in the 2R2M automated mounted mortar system, this barrel now finds a new usage on a lightweight mobile mortar system, the lightest such system fitted with a rifled barrel according to Arquus. The Arquus/NTGS/Thales A2M will be fitted with the Vali-ECSFire Control System specifically designed for indirect fire support systems and already installed on M109 self-propelled howitzers. While some configuration of the NTGS mortar system see the FCS interface installed in the right cabinet, the display allowing the commander to choose the target and initiate the aiming process being on the outside wall, in the Arquus/Thales solution this will be installed in front of the commander’s seat inside the protected cabin. This will obviously be updated with the data relevant to the Thales rifled tube and the ammunition, also provided by Thales. Overall the 120 mm rifled mortar system will not only increase the range compared to smoothbore solutions, but also provide better accuracy and an increased terminal effect.

According to Arquus integrating the NTGS deployable mortar system into the Sherpa Scout was relatively simple, the mortar system being self-sufficient in terms of energy, while the transport configuration allows the centre of gravity to fall within the limits of the vehicle design, hence the mobility remains unaffected. Now qualified at 11,500 kg combat mass, the vehicle payload allows installing a light remotely controlled weapon station (RCWS) on top of the roof, providing a considerable self-protection capability. Not only, should a target be in line of sight, it is possible to exploit the RCWS optronic package to feed its grids into the Vali-ECS and call a fire mission. The fact that the NTGS deployable mortar system is self-sufficient in terms of power generation leaves the power produced by the vehicle 350 A generator for on-board subsystems, such as jammers, etc.

Arquus and Thales have assembled the prototype vehicle, which carried out some mobility and deployment tests in Spain, no firing tests having yet been made. Eurosatory marks the launch event for the system; EDR On-Line understood that Thales would be the prime in bids throughout the world.

Positioning without GPS signal?

Ukraine has shown that relying on GPS might be definitely the wrong choice, Russian jamming disrupting satellite signals. For soldiers who were trained for years in using GPS-based systems it must be quite frustrating to lose this capacity when it is really needed. Calling in fire without knowing your own position as well as that of the target becomes impossible.

To overcome this problem Thales developed a new capability, and added it to the two latest multifunctional thermal imagers, Sophie Ultima and Sophie Optima, which were unveiled respectively at Eurosatory 2018 and in June 2020. Both manportable systems have a weight under 2.5 kg and include a direct view optical channel with a x7 magnification, a day TV channel, a laser rangefinder (LRF) capable to measure up to 25 km distance, a GPS, and a thermal imager for night vision and for decamouflaging targets also at day. The latter is the sensor making the difference between the two systems, the Ultima being fitted with a Medium Wavelength (3-5 µm) cooled IR sensor with a 15 µm pitch allowing tank recognition at 6 km distance, while the Optima has an uncooled microbolometer working in the Long Wave IR band (8-12 µm), allowing tank recognition up to 3 km. While the Ultima is usually a tool for specialists or Special Forces, the Optima is dedicate to platoon leaders.

The production of the Sophie Ultima has recently started, EDR On-Line witnessing the manufacturing of the low rate initial production items on a U-shaped assembly line, during a visit to the Saint-Héand Thales facility, some 70 km west of Lyon, two weeks prior to Eurosatory. As its uncooled sister, the Ultima housing is not anymore made of metal, as previous Sophie, but in a high-tech composite materiel with a very thin metal coating. Moreover it is not anymore made of two shells coupled once the assembly is finished, but of a single body open to the rear in which the various elements are inserted using a COBOT [1]. Following the assembly, test and calibrating is one of the most time-consuming manufacturing phases. According to the production responsible, now that production has started, albeit not yet at full rate, the learning curve is slowly starting to kick in. “We are planning to start delivering the Ultima in late 2022,” Marie-Solange Milleron, Land & Naval Business Segment Director at ThalesOptonics and Missile Electronics said, adding that “the Optima is still in the last development phase, some 5-10 prototypes having been produced, and first deliveries are forecasted in late 2023-early 2024.”

Now customers choosing one of the 4th Generation Sophie have the option to add to those already complete target acquisition systems a new functionality which was unveiled at Eurosatory, the VisioLoc®.

From the name we can deduce what it is all about, vision and localisation. The two latest Sophie iterations can be loaded with a 0.5 meters resolution Geographic Information System covering 200×200 km contained in a Micro-SD card, “but in 5 years time this will increase to 500×500 km. Looking at the map,” Pierre-Yves Guinet, Product Line Manager at Thales Soldier’s Optronics says. The map can be easily seen onto a ruggedised tablet computer, linked to the Sophie either via Wi-Fi or by cable, and it is possible to pick up three notable features on the ground, from bell towers to trees to water tanks, that are in sight; two features would suffice, however the third allows to highlight potential errors and increases accuracy. The operator picks up the first point with his Sophie, laser it to get the distance, and then must correlate it with the map. The field of view used and the distance allow to easily bring the point on the map, which gives the grids of the first point, a virtual circle with its radius equal to the distance measured with the LRF being drawn. The operation is repeated for the two other features, and the interception of the three circles gives the operator’s position. Having the coordinates of the other three points and the distances, it is now just a matter of calculation. Overall, it takes around three minutes to complete the procedure.

EDR On-Line could witness a demonstration of the VisioLoc during the aforementioned visit to Saint-Héand, the Thales Group’s centre of excellence for soldier optronics, which has a workforce of around 350 people and deals not only with defence optronics but is also the home of te famous Angénieux zoom lenses uses by most high-end movie producers. Taking up three features between 1.5 and 3 km distance, one of which a tree that was visible between two other trees so some discrimination in distance was needed to confirm the measure, and verifying the accuracy with that provided by the Sophie GPS with 15 satellites in view, results were pretty similar, the CEP being less than 6 meters with the Sophie mounted on a light tripod.

Once the position of the Sophie is known, it is then possible to get that of a target with utmost accuracy. Introducing a high resolution panoramic digitised image, and knowing the reference points positions, allows obtaining a digitised scenario in which each pixel is de-facto referenced, the angle accuracy being under 1 milliradiant, much less than what can be done with a magnetic north seeker which accuracy is of 1°, equivalent to 17 milliradiants; in the end the CEP of a target would increase from the 6 meters obtained with the VisioLoc to around 100 meters, according to Thales experts. We must however say that non-magnetic north finding systems also exist.

Taking as example a French Army platoon equipped with Scorpion equipment, therefore trained at conducing collaborative combat, not knowing the respective positions would impede the latter. If the platoon commander is equipped with the Sophie Ultima he can definitely get its other vehicles exact positions, allowing the SIC-S to go back to collaborative engagement, at least until these do not start back to move. The same applies to a JTAC who needs to send a nine-liner or to a FOO who needs to send a call-for-fire. Not to forget that most vehicles are fitted with GPS/INS navigation platforms; this allows them to exploit the Inertial Navigation System when the GPS is unavailable, however the INS tends to drift and a position upgrade is needed by time to time; the Sophie Ultima and Optima can definitely be used in this role.

When designing the Sophie Ultima and Optima, Thales considered since inception the growth potential needed for new applications, hence the computing power available on board the two systems is well sufficient to support the VisioLoc, a computing heavy application, some more remaining for further additions. As a term of comparison EDR On-Line was told that the VisioLoc was installed on a previous generation Sophie; the computing time for getting the coordinates took around 24 hours, compared to the 40 seconds when using the Ultima. “Another beneficial aspect is weight reduction in the soldiers’ rucksack, as they will not have to carry the north finding head on which the target acquisition binocular will be mounted, the Ultima and Optima already allowing a considerable saving as they pack four functions into a single instrument, while in the past soldiers had to carry a number of separate items to cover the same capacities,” Pascal Sécretin, Thales Imagers and Sensors product line director and a former HALO/HAHO qualified military paratrooper states.

As seen, the most critical operation is probably the correlation between the feature seen through the Sophie and that on the map. The human machine interface purposely developed by Thales allowed however a trained operator to do it in less than 30 seconds, as seen during the demonstration. Asked about possible solution provided by Artificial Intelligence-based algorithms, Thales experts underlined the difficulty of matching an image taken from a sensor at the same level with that taken from a sensor in the sky, so a top-view. Any AI add-on would need the addition of a neural network element to the system, which must be integrated as close as possible to avoid huge latency times. The Sophie has on its left side a slot where further capabilities can be added, one often mentioned being a Short-Wave IR sensor another being 5G connection. Integrating there the aforementioned neural system might be feasible, however the other element to be considered is power consumption, as such an add-on would be quite power hungry, around 5 W, therefore dramatically decreasing the system autonomy. Will such a capability ever materialise on current hand-held targeting systems remain questionable.

However some more capabilities, that can exploit the computing power availability that still remains on the Sophie Ultima and Optima might well appear in the coming years, as the development roadmap has definitely not yet reached the end.

Forward focused South Australian company Airspeed is preparing to reach new heights - Thales,"Wed, 01 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGFsZXNncm91cC5jb20vZW4vY291bnRyaWVzLWFzaWEvYXVzdHJhbGlhL25ld3MvZm9yd2FyZC1mb2N1c2VkLXNvdXRoLWF1c3RyYWxpYW4tY29tcGFueS1haXJzcGVlZC1wcmVwYXJpbmctcmVhY2gtbmV30gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Steve Barlow, Managing Director of Airspeed

South Australian SME Airspeed is reaching new heights by joining Thales as part of a growing supply chain supporting the development of a new sovereign Defence capability. Airspeed are building on their impressive track record with defence and aerospace projects, as they look to the future with the global technology partner.

Having spent over $657 million on Australian manufacturers and suppliers in 2020, SMEs are a critical part of Thales’ Australian supply chains, with more than 1,500 local businesses making-up 82% of all Thales’s Australian suppliers in 2020.

With the 2020 Defence Strategic Update outlining the challenges in Australia’s strategic environment and their implications, it is evident that Australia needs to prioritise and develop local supply chains and defence capabilities. The acceleration of Guided Weapons activities has echoed this sentiment, enabling Australia to develop and sustain an Australian hypersonic weapons capability.

This acceleration will also see the growth in sovereign industrial capability and local supply chains, and it is estimated that the national enterprise could be worth $40 billion in local production and export capabilities within the next 20 years.

Thales, a leader in the Australian Defence industry, is proud to be contributing to the development and delivery of the High-Speed Weapons capability through the Defence Science Technology Group (DST) Advanced Rocket Motor Technology Demonstrator (ARMTD) Program, and has teamed with local supply chain partners to provide specialist manufacturing and componentry. This program will be a demonstration of an advanced military-relevant rocket motor capable of hypersonic flight, manufactured by Australian industry.

“The decision to partner with a range of local SMEs for the ARMTD program was obvious, given the unique skills and experience each bring,” said Duncan Watt, General Manager of Guided Systems at Thales. “Leveraging Thales’ and DSTG’s expertise and long-standing collaborations with Australian manufacturers and suppliers in areas of enabling High-Speed Weapons research has enabled us to maximise the skills and investment and stay ahead of the curve.”

“Through our use of sovereign capability, we are proud to support a highly capable and resilient industry.”

Airspeed has an impressive track record supporting Defence, previously undertaking a range of projects varying from the manufacture of aircraft equipment pods for Hawk and Super Hornets, as well as special purpose modifications and lightweight replacement structures for the Collins submarine fleet.

Airspeed specialises in the application of composite materials. They design and manufacture high-tech, lightweight composite components which can be used across a number of applications. Combining their engineering design skills with composite manufacturing capabilities, Airspeed produces unique solutions for specialised defence requirements. They are currently engaged in the development of technical applications to support electronic warfare, drones, and rocket motors.

A close-knit team of twelve, Airspeed have a mix of design engineers, technicians and support staff, located in the north Adelaide region.

Airspeed have been acknowledged both technically and commercially on a global scale through the delivery of a variety of composites projects for international companies including the Replenishment At Sea (RAS) stump masts for warships, radomes for high speed drones, emerging Electronic Warfare pod applications and rocket motor casings using filament-wound carbon fibre to reduce structural mass and increase both the amount of propellant or payload that a flight vehicle can launch.

Building on these projects, Steve Barlow, Managing Director of Airspeed acknowledged that Airspeed brings unique capabilities to the ARMTD program.

“Our relationship with Thales has been greatly beneficial. The partnership has provided Airspeed with the necessary background, reputation and commercial ability to prove our sovereign capability. These factors, which were previously inaccessible to Airspeed, will enable us to establish our prominence in the Australian Defence industry.”

Steve anticipates that the partnership with Thales will lead to more opportunities for his company. Utilising the relationship, Airspeed anticipates future growth in capacity and opportunities with the program as a sovereign capability.

“We know we have the ability and want to compete commercially. As the proverb goes, if you want to go quickly, go alone. If you want to go far, go together”, he says.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.999798595905304}",positive,0.999798595905304,1

The C3, housed inside the Lithgow Arms small arms factory, is designed to break down costly barriers to entry for SMEs and industrial partners by providing ready access to Lithgow Arms resources and equipment, engineering skills and expertise. Fostering an interest-based learning model, collaborators within the C3 are able to securely share areas of expertise to advance skills, collaborate on research and design, and seek manufacturing support to accelerate sovereign small arms innovation and design in support of the Australian Defence Force (ADF), commercial, and export markets.

Early adopters of the C3 - Southern Cross Small Arms (SCSA), Hosico, A.W. Bell and Wedgetail Industries, are currently working with the Lithgow Arms team to gain support in areas such as prototyping, test and evaluation, qualification, industrialisation and advanced manufacturing – supporting the advancement of their respective product capabilities to pursue programs in domestic commercial and law enforcement, as well as export.

Current projects underway within the C3 include creating 100% Australian made commercial products for sporting shooters and the farming industry. By leveraging and combining the Australian intellectual property, unique expertise and skills of Lithgow Arms, SCSA, Hosico, A.W. Bell and Wedgetail Industries, the group is able to achieve an increase in Australian industry content to achieve their business objectives. Work is also being done within the C3 with FN Herstal, to explore Australian manufacture and support of FN Herstal weapon’s systems.

The most notable success story of the C3 is the recent collaboration of Thales Australia, Rheinmetall Defence Australia and SME, A.W. Bell, that led to the successful Australian manufacture of key components for Rheinmetall’s Mk30-2 cannon by Lithgow Arms in support of the Australian Defence Force’s Land 400 program. A.W. Bell are now applying their class leading casting expertise, working directly with Rheinmetall, to explore an increase in component manufacture for armoured vehicles in Australia.

Following Thales Australia’s recent $6.5 million investment in the first phase of an industrial plan to transform its Lithgow Arms facility in regional New South Wales, the establishment of the C3 is a critical next step in delivering the Lithgow Arms masterplan. The new development will expand the world-leading precision-manufacturing capability of Lithgow Arms to support new sovereign manufacturing partnerships for strategic ADF programs.

Matt Duquemin, Director Integrated Weapons and Sensors, Thales Australia said, “Opening the C3 inside the Lithgow Arms factory is critical in achieving the vision of the Lithgow Arms masterplan and redevelopment. The future of our business here in Lithgow is not just about building an advanced manufacturing precinct – it’s about growing a sustainable and competitive sovereign industry capability in regional New South Wales to ensure the Australian Defence Force is ready now, future ready.”

Thales Australia’s investment to expand the size and capability of the Lithgow Arms facility, including the recent opening of the C3, is a clear demonstration of the company’s long-term commitment to growing and maintaining an enduring, sustainable and resilient sovereign industrial capability for the Australian Defence Force in regional New South Wales.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.674976646900177}",positive,0.674976646900177,1

This year the company has experienced unprecedented growth, seen the development of a new facility, and is partnering with Australian Defence industry to further develop its advanced manufacturing capability, in order to contribute to Defence’s strategic programs.

Accelerating the development of a sovereign Guided Weapon and Explosive Ordnance (GWEO) Enterprise in Australia is critical to the ADF’s long range strike and deterrent objectives, as per the 2020 Defence Strategic Update.

The Defence Science Technology Group (DST) Advanced Rocket Motor Technology Demonstrator (ARMTD) Program, with phase 1 underway with Thales as the Industry lead, is helping to grow a genuine partnership between the Australian Defence Force and Industry. The program plans to build an Australian industry network to support sovereign advanced rocket motor capability and the growth of Australian industry and local jobs.

Working with Australian SMEs, Thales will deliver the first phase of the transition to industry military-relevant rocket motor systems. This plans to be a demonstration of an advanced military-relevant rocket motor capable of hypersonic flight, manufactured locally.

The catalyst for this program was the push by the Federal Government to invest in local supply chains and create local jobs within the industry.

Thales, a trusted partner of the ADF, has long worked with SMEs to support more than 2,000 jobs within the supply chain. Utilising the local capabilities for the ARMTD program has given Thales the opportunity to make a strong contribution to Australian sovereign capability.

“We are proud to support the expertise and impressive capabilities of the Australian Defence industry. Having partnered with various SMEs for decades, we hope to continue the growth of local manufacturers and suppliers.” Said Duncan Watt, General Manager of Guided Weapon Systems at Thales Australia.

Mincham has been a leader in the development and production of advanced light-weight solutions for the defence, aerospace and high-tech industries. With over 25 years of experience, Mincham has been a core supplier and partner of upgrades and developments of Australian military platforms and systems. At the cutting edge of new technologies, Mincham produces products and services such as autonomous aerial delivery systems, aeromedical, composite radomes and suppressor systems.

With advanced engineering design capabilities, experience with composites, specialised and bespoke machining solutions, and painting and finishing services, Mincham is a competitive end-to-end supplier.

“I come from a structural aerospace background in the Australian Airforce and I really enjoy the challenges of contributing to cutting edge science as well as watching young engineers harness opportunities in this industry,” said Darryl Mincham, Managing Director of Mincham.

With a current team of 25 and a brand-new purpose-built facility, Mincham is expecting to grow 50% within the next six to twelve months due to the opportunities in Defence and Aerospace, including the ARMTD program, which will provide a residual industry capability able to produce intermediate scale rocket motors suitable for high performance Defence missions across all domains. This will ultimately lead to a growth in specialised skills and Australian jobs.

Offering a veteran hiring program which enables ex Defence personnel to re-skill, Mincham has made growing their workforce a priority. There has also been significant investment in developing their Research and Development (R&D) and specialised Defence industry production experience .

This investment has centred around unmanned systems, rocket technologies, aerial delivery systems and high-end specialised technologies. To support this strategy, Mincham has invested millions in expanding their manufacturing and maintenance footprint as well as making an investment in new computer numerical control (CNC) machines and large composite equipment. These large-scale investments and the building of a strong and agile workforce is positioning Mincham to pursue similar programs to the ARMTD in the near future.

“Through this alliance, the Defence minister asked us to condense a 10-year development cycle down to 2 years,” said Darryl.

“Small, agile SMEs in Australia are well placed to respond to this, and we’re excited to be able to contribute to building an advanced manufacturing industry that is supporting Defence here in Australia.”

This day, organized on the Nexter site in Satory, featured a Griffon EPC vehicle equipped with lithium-ion batteries.

The Griffon EPC was also equipped with a screen dedicated to the presentation, which displayed the remaining autonomy of the vehicle in standby with the combustion engine off, or the time remaining before full recharging when the combustion engine is started. This screen has made it possible to highlight the increase by 2 or even 3 times of the standby time allowed by lithium-ion technology compared to current acid/lead technology.

These new batteries will be able in the future to power more electrical equipment while maintaining the current standby time, and recharging twice as fast. The study began in early 2019 with the choice of two standard and mature models on the market: the 6 TE model from SAFT and the BT-0939 model from Brentronics. A theoretical analysis of the lithium-ion technology as well as an extensive test campaign was then carried out by Arquus with the Serma laboratory. This analysis enabled Nexter to identify the risks as well as the means to be implemented for safe integration into the vehicle.

Hutchinson presented its know-how on reducing the risk of lithium-ion battery fires spreading. Nexter then studied with Arquus and Thales an architecture for the Griffon vehicle. A model and a prototype on Griffon were used to test the complete system with the DGA Techniques Terrestres (DGA TT) and GME EBMR teams. The GME EBMR would like to salute the proactive spirit that prevailed during this risk-reduction study, making it possible to consider the use of these technologies on new vehicle fleets.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999922513961792}",neutral,0.9999922513961792,0

Covivio strengthens partnership with Thales in the Vélizy-Meudon business hub - Covivio,"Thu, 09 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jb3ZpdmlvLmV1L2VuL2dyb3VwL2dyb3VwLWNvbW11bmljYXRpb25zL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2Nvdml2aW8tc3RyZW5ndGhlbnMtcGFydG5lcnNoaXAtd2l0aC10aGFsZXMtaW4tdGhlLXZlbGl6eS1tZXVkb24tYnVzaW5lc3MtaHViL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Covivio and Thales, a long-term real estate partnership

The story began in 2003 with Covivio’s acquisition of an 18-hectare plot of land in the Vélizy-Meudon business district, where Thales was historically based.

In line with its strategy of developing scalable turnkey campuses for key accounts on this site, Covivio signed an agreement with Thales in 2012 on the development of an initial 46,750 m2 campus called “Hélios”, which was delivered in 2014.



Surrounded by 10,000 m² of landscaped areas, Hélios offers users over 10,000 m² of service facilities including a 400-seat conference hall, a business centre, a fitness room, a concierge service, various catering areas, a training centre and the “Thales Learning Hub” university. In addition to its comprehensive service offering, Hélios features functional, bright and ergonomic work and relaxation areas with interior design by Saguez & Partners. The “Hélios” campus is currently owned under a joint investment partnership with Crédit Agricole Assurances.



It was built alongside a first historical building of 41,520 m², owned by Covivio and occupied by Thales, and located on the adjacent plot.



Today, the partnership continues with the signing of an agreement on the construction of a new 37,900 m2 building, “Hélios 2” (7 floors + 3 basement levels), which will offer workspaces, communal areas including a restaurant, showrooms and service areas, and datarooms. The building’s tenants will also have access to over 9,000 m² of green spaces.



Eventually, the Thales campus will bring together more than 4,000 employees across the various buildings.



The new 12-year firm off-plan lease agreement signed between Covivio and Thales will come into effect on delivery of the extension, scheduled for the first quarter of 2026.

Meanwhile, the two partners have extended the term of the existing leases: for “Hélios” until 2037 and for the historical building until the end of 2034.



In line with Covivio’s CSR ambitions, this building is intended to be exemplary in environmental terms and aims for the highest levels of certification: HQE Sustainable Building – Excellent, OsmoZ and R2S accreditation.

An agreement that confirms the dynamism of the Vélizy-Meudon business hub

Vélizy-Meudon is the second largest business hub in the Paris region housing nearly 50,000 employees and 1,000 international companies. This new project reinforces the attractiveness of this area, which is an integral part of the Paris-Saclay science and technology cluster, which meets companies’ current demands for diversity, accessibility, performance and services. “Hélios 2” is a further addition to the iconic projects already completed by Covivio on this site: the Dassault Systèmes Campus (98,000 m2), Ducasse Education (5,100 m2) and the Campus Eiffage (33,000 m2 sold at the end of 2021).

It also means the detection capacity of non-cooperative aircrafts, playing a major role in air surveillance.

Since the first delivery in the 70’s, Thales’ portfolio is contributing to air safety with a full range of radars to manage air surveillance and control airport/airbase terminal areas. The range includes primary and secondary radars; the STAR NG (Primary Surveillance Radar for Approach) and the TRAC NG (Primary Surveillance Radar for En-Route) to detect non-cooperative aircrafts, aircrafts without transponders or with faulty transponders, capable of detecting targets of all sizes of aircrafts over an extended operational range coverage (more than 250 NM/460 km) and conducting wind farm mitigation and high clutter suppression to be resistant to harsh environment. And the Secondary Surveillance portfolio with the renowned RSM and latest innovation the RSM NG (for both Approach control and En-Route) to detect and identify cooperative aircrafts from commercial or military aviation.

At the forefront of new technologies, investing in R&D and capitalizing on 50 years of ATC experience, Thales has introduced many leading innovations for airspace safety to accompany evolving customer needs in both civil and military domains, as well as ensuring compliance with the latest safety regulations to provide safe and accurate, Approach and En-Route surveillance.

Upgrades and innovations include a family of radars with higher performances, especially for precision and detection, development of new features such as electronic protection measures, 3D, detection of zero speed aircrafts (such as helicopters), high speed/high maneuverability aircrafts (such as fighters) or merging traditional Mode S with ADS-B detection to enhance sensor performance, including a sustainable solar powered radar station.

“As the Brazilian Air Force incorporates another radar for the defense and control of Brazilian airspace, Thales celebrates the production and installation of its thousandth air traffic surveillance radar, in Forte Príncipe da Beira. This is an acquisition that demonstrates the FAB's concern in controlling the 22 million square kilometers of our airspace as well as defending our borders. This is an extremely important equipment, as it will enable the identification and interception of non-collaborative aircraft”, declares the Director General of DECEA, Air Lieutenant Brigadier João Tadeu Fiorentini.

“The 1000Th Thales air traffic surveillance radar worldwide reference is a demonstration of customers’ confidence and Thales’s track record to detect at all times - ensuring critical air safety and air surveillance - we thank all our clients for their trust. With more than 130 installed air surveillance radars in Brazil, and a 20 year relationship between Omnisys - a Thales company and DECEA we are proud to share the 1000th Air traffic surveillance radar milestone in Brazil. The 1000th milestone is a testimony to Thales Air traffic surveillance radars with a solid reputation for performance and reliability” Lionel de Castellane, Vice President Civil Segment Radars, Thales.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9849121570587158}",neutral,0.9849121570587158,0

Thales, in collaboration with Zelenza, has been selected by Spain’s Ministry of the Interior to provide more than 1,500 manual border control inspection units across all border-crossing points. The company made the announcement during Passenger Terminal Expo 2022 , in Paris, France, where it is displaying the units for the first time.

Those units located at the border officer’s control point will be equipped with Thales EES Border Control Clearance Software and Thales devices such as document readers with embedded document verification, fingerprint scanners and face pods with a facial capture system. Combined, these integrated systems will deliver a fast and secure identity enrolment and clearance process for non-EU citizens at borders.

The contract will be executed over the next eight months, with systems deployed at airports, ports and land crossings throughout Spain. Funded by the EU’s Internal Security Fund, the new system will facilitate the border clearance of travelers while increasing the security at the Schengen borders, following the European Union’s adoption in 2017 of a new directive for the deployment of a biometric Entry-Exit registration system (EES) for member states.

Speaking exclusively to Passenger Terminal Today at Passenger Terminal Expo, Francoise Bergasse, market manager, biometric border and travel solutions, Thales, said, “The regulation stipulates very specific, high quality requirements with regard to face and fingerprint capture, as well as document verification, which are far higher than those governing current passport photos. We have paid particular attention to lighting, while also ensuring that the units are compatible with passengers of all heights, whether short or tall. We also use two high-res cameras to speed the process – it only takes one minute for each passenger to enroll and be fully verified.”

Thales is currently trialling the system at Paris-Orly. Visitors to Passenger Terminal Expo can try it out for themselves on Booth Z1.3000.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999885559082031}",neutral,0.9999885559082031,0

The alliance of French Arquus and Thales with Spanis-based NTGS has developed the new Sherpa A2M (Advanced Mobile Mortar).

The Sherpa A2M is an adequate answer to the tactical challenges met and created by artillery in high-intensity warfare: mobility, protection, close support to the troops on the ground and mobile counter-battery options at the fraction of the price of a Self-Propelled Gun (SPG).

- ADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW -

The alliance allows the application of a truly complete solution delivering a unique indirect fire support solution, suitable for infantry support, collaborative armed forces troops and Special Forces, as well as autonomous artillery units looking for a high level of mobility and protection.

The Sherpa A2M combines the excellent mobility of a Sherpa Light, the proven Deployable Mortar System by NTGS and the 120mm rifled mortar barrel by Thales, into one full fully integrated new solution.

Thanks to Thales’ capability, the vehicle embeds 120 mm rifled ammunition and in the future the mortar laser-guided ammunition. The rifled mortar barrel is three times more precise than smoothbore mortar. ​

Due to this superior efficiency and accuracy, it can achieve similar operational effects with much less shots; around 4 times less rounds are needed than for a smoothbore mortar.

NTGS provides its skills in global systems with the fire control system in the back of the vehicle. This system conveys information about targets and points of interest, which represents a significant strategic advantage. Thanks to their expertise, the A2M Sherpa delivers control across all mission operations and is already combat-proven. The mortar and tube from NTGS and Thales are qualified both by NATO and by different armies.

The Sherpa Light is a multipurpose, 4×4 armored vehicle, designed by Arquus to provide with a wide array of versions and customizations for all needs and missions, built on a single, proven base for increased commonality and ease of maintenance. It is a modern, mature, new-generation vehicle, which is built on many years of industrial experience, operational deployments on the battlefield and maintenance.It is protected against ballistic and mine as well as improvised explosive device threats with a STANAG 4569-certified protection, which ensures a high level of safety for the crew inside the vehicle during operations.

The Sherpa A2M can carry 40 rounds of 120mm mortar ammunition in the rear and possibly additional ammunition in the cabin, depending on user requirements. It has a range up to 8,2 km with standard rifled ammunition and up to 13km with a rocket-assisted projectile, allowing it to enhance the protection of the embarked soldiers by engaging units without being hit (Shoot & Scoot).

Combining the expertise of these three companies’ expertise ensures the highest level of quality for each of the Sherpa A2M’s features: protected tactical mobility, ruggedness, superior firepower and accuracy, as well as easily deployable systems and intuitive fire control.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9998493194580078}",positive,0.9998493194580078,1
Thales solution supports DevSecOps teams with data protection - SecurityBrief New Zealand,"Thu, 16 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vc2VjdXJpdHlicmllZi5jby5uei9zdG9yeS90aGFsZXMtc29sdXRpb24tc3VwcG9ydHMtZGV2c2Vjb3BzLXRlYW1zLXdpdGgtZGF0YS1wcm90ZWN0aW9u0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales has announced the CipherTrust Platform Community Edition, enabling DevSecOps teams to deploy data protection controls into multi-cloud applications in minutes instead of weeks.

The CipherTrust Platform is a broadly deployed encryption and key management solution for data protection applications. IT teams around the world use it to protect sensitive data assets.

The CipherTrust Platform Community Edition is a version of the platform targeted to developers and DevSecOps teams, designed to help them evaluate and integrate the solution into their workflows and build pipelines.

Thales states the latest release reduces the friction required to implement data protection technology and provides an easier path for organisations to scale from development to production.

According to Thales, starting with the CipherTrust Platform Community Edition, developers and DevSecOps teams can implement an enterprise-grade solution that, when ready to scale or go into production, can be upgraded to the CipherTrust Enterprise platform.

The Community Edition includes most of the features of the CipherTrust Enterprise platform and is well suited for small or development-type infrastructures, the company states.

It consists of a free-forever version of CipherTrust Manager and two CipherTrust connectors, CipherTrust Transparent Encryption for Kubernetes and CipherTrust Data Protection Gateway.

Protecting keys and certificates associated with applications and containers allows DevSecOps teams to manage a crucial element of an organisation's security strategy, Thales states.

With the Community Edition, developers can centralise key management and encryption policies across multi-cloud applications. When the solution requires a secure root of trust upgrading to the CipherTrust Enterprise Platform enables access to a FIPS 140-2 Level 3 certified Thales Luna Hardware Security Modules.

With the ever-evolving security threats and compliance regulations, it is a constant chase for organisations to successfully implement and roll out security enhancements at the speed demanded by DevOps, Thales states.

As such, the Community Edition enables DevSecOps teams to rapidly protect data in legacy and cloud-native applications. They can protect sensitive data in RESTful calls and containerised applications in Kubernetes environments without modifying a single line of application source code.

Todd Moore, vice president of encryption products at Thales says, “Organisations are becoming increasingly aware of the need to implement zero trust solutions within their security strategies. Similarly, DevSecOps teams demand that security practices be automated and integrated into each application development cycle stage to mitigate digital transformation risks.

""Thales is now offering a free-forever version of its CipherTrust Data Security Platform to give end users the tools to deploy data protection controls into multi-cloud applications in minutes removing the complexity from implementing data security and accelerating time to compliance.

Jay Lyman, senior research analyst at 451 Research, part of S-P Global Market Intelligence, comments, “Many enterprises are still figuring out how to implement DevSecOps, which represents a departure from traditional thinking whereby security teams own security for the organisation from end to end. Organisations must acknowledge that collaboration among teams not accustomed to working together is critical to successful cross-domain objectives, such as faster releases and greater efficiency.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9511816501617432}",neutral,0.9511816501617432,0

Synthetix explained

Beginning as a stablecoin named Havven in 2018, Synthetix has since evolved into one of the Ethereum ecosystem’s leading derivatives projects.

Specifically, Synthetix is a derivatives liquidity protocol that powers the creation of “synths” — or synthetic assets — that can be traded in a decentralized and permissionless manner.

Synths let traders capitalize on exposure to assets without having to directly own the assets in question. Today, some of Synthetix’s most popular synths are its forex synths, like sUSD and sEUR.

Synthetix is also a DeFi trailblazer renowned for pioneering yield farming in 2019, and for being one of the first major DeFi projects to embrace Optimism, the layer-two (L2) scaling solution in 2021.

To date, the Synthetix community has also fostered multiple additional DeFi protocols, and the Synthetix ecosystem now has a handful of dapps in its orbit.

Using Synthetix 101

A foundational element of Synthetix is SNX staking, which is used for collateralizing the derivatives protocol and for creating deep liquidity for synths.

Per total value locked (TVL), Synthetix is currently the largest protocol on Optimism, and that is in no small part because the project migrated its SNX staking and sUSD minting operations over to Optimism early on in the L2’s lifespan.

Notably, not only do SNX stakers earn inflationary SNX rewards, but they also earn a cut of sUSD fees generated by protocols that work on top of Synthetix, like Kwenta and Lyra.

The basic steps of SNX staking are as follows:

Acquire SNX, which is available directly on Optimism (e.g. via Uniswap), or can be bridged over from Ethereum (e.g. via the Optimism Bridge). Go to staking.synthetix.io/l2 Connect a wallet and connect to the Optimism network Click the sidebar “Staking” button and then the “Mint & Burn” button Click the “Mint Max” button and confirm the transaction in-wallet

Staking rewards are calculated and then published once a week on Wednesdays. Positions just above the protocol’s L2 collateralization ratio (C-Ratio) — 300 % — will earn the most rewards, which can be claimed via staking.synthetix.io/earn/claim. Claimed SNX will be escrowed, i.e. non-transferable, for one year.

Kwenta: The Synthetix DEX

Designed to facilitate zero-slippage synth trading, Kwenta — the primary decentralized exchange (DEX) in the Synthetix ecosystem — is a rebrand of the former official Synthetix Exchange interface.

Interestingly, Kwenta doesn’t rely on an orderbook or liquidity pool model. Instead, the DEX employs a peer-to-contract (P2C) system in which synths are traded against a smart contract informed by Chainlink price feeds. Moreover, Kwenta only allows trading in synths, so other cryptocurrencies cannot be used here.

In September 2021, Synthetix deprecated low-volume synths on Ethereum, like sAAPL and sAMZN, to pave the way for relisting them on the Optimism L2 later.

As of June 2022, Kwenta’s available L2 synths include:

sUSD

sEUR

sETH

sBTC

sLINK

sSOL

sAVAX

sMATIC

sAAVE

sUNI

The basic steps of Kwenta L2 trading are as follows:

Acquire sUSD, or another Synthetix synth sUSD can be obtained via SNX L2 staking or through an L2 DEX (e.g. 1inch) Go to kwenta.io/exchange Connect a wallet and connect to the Optimism network Select a “From” synth, the amount to be traded, and an “Into” synth Click the “Submit Order” button and confirm the transaction in-wallet

Lyra: Options Powered by Synthetix

Lyra is a decentralized options trading protocol powered by a specialized automated market maker (AMM) system.

Notably, Lyra uses Synthetix’s sUSD stablecoin as its exclusive quote asset, so traders pay for opening long positions or closing short positions with sUSD. Lyra also uses Synthetix as a one-stop protocol for getting long and short exposure on its markets’ base assets, i.e. delta hedging.

For a full primer on trading options through Lyra, review A Guide to Options on Lyra, published by Bankless last year.

The basic steps remain the same today and are as follows:

Acquire sUSD (or another synth, e.g. sBTC, if specifically selling call options) Go to app.lyra.finance Connect a wallet and connect to the Optimism network Choose a market (ETH, BTC, LINK, and SOL are currently available) Select an expiry Choose from the “Buy” or “Sell” options Select “Call” or “Put” Choose a strike price Press the “Open Position” button and confirm the transaction in-wallet

Thales: A Binary Options Hub

Thales is a decentralized binary options protocol that a group of Synthetix community members spun out from Synthetix in 2020.

If held until expiry, binary options have only two payoff possibilities: a predetermined amount of profit or nothing at all. Thales relies on Synthetix’s sUSD stablecoin for 1) minting its binary options tokens, and 2) as the platform’s unit of account.

Thales is now entirely independent, but the project is running a three year-long Merkle airdrop system that will see 35% of the THALES token supply distributed to SNX stakers to keep the Thales and Synthetix communities closely aligned.

The main ways to use Thales are as follows:

Aelin: A Decentralized Fundraising Protocol

Last year, Synthetix founder Kain Warwick replied to a Mariano Conti joke tweet with his own joke about a SPAC (special purpose acquisition company), which led to Warwick laying out a SPAC in Ethereum-like terms:

This explainer took on a life of its own. Elements of the Synthetix community used it as inspiration for developing the Aelin protocol, which was launched on Ethereum and Optimism earlier this year.

Aelin allows upstart DeFi protocols to bypass venture capitalists by raising funds and selling tokens directly to communities via special discrete pools.

On the flip side, pool investors get permissionless exposure to early funding rounds for new projects. It’s capital raises, DeFi style.

The main ways to use Aelin are as follows:

Conclusion

Synthetix’s early migration to Optimism paved the way for an ecosystem that’s been coming to life in recent months thanks to Optimism’s fast and cheap transactions.

Per current TVL stats Synthetix, Lyra, Aelin, and Thales are respectively Optimism’s 1st, 6th, 23rd, and 26th largest dapps at the moment. The Synthetix ecosystem is poised to drive considerable activity on Optimism for the foreseeable future, especially if the Synthetix community continues to spin out and support new projects that centrally rely on sUSD or Synthetix’s other synths.

Ground Master 403 (KEVA2010) radar (Picture source: CEMANO-DB)

In a joint media release on 31 May, Thales and PT Len said the new radar system will be installed across the Indonesian archipelago enabling TNI “to detect all types of threats, from jets and missiles to hovering helicopters and UAVs [unmanned aerial vehicles]”. Under the agreement, Thales will focus on building the radars and C2 while PT Len will build the radar stations, provide installation and integration of the systems and manage civil works for the program with support from Thales, the media release said. “Certain components on the radars will be locally manufactured by PT Len, and the project will involve the transfer of radar technology” as well as strengthening of local defense industry capabilities, the release stated.

Ground Master 400 is part of ThalesRaytheonSystems’ (TRS) fully digital 3-D air defense Ground Master radar family using digital beamforming. The GM 400 series is a 3D long-range radar, offering detection from very high to very low altitudes. It tracks a wide range of targets from highly maneuverable low-flying tactical aircraft to unconventional smaller targets such as UAVs, ensuring an excellent wide-area air picture. GM 400 is an AESA radar that can be set up by a four man crew in 30 minutes. The system fits in a 20 foot shipping container and weighs less than ten tons. When deployed on site, the radar can be connected to operate as part of a networked air defense organization and can be controlled from a remote location.

The radar is credited with a range accuracy of 50 meters, an azimuth accuracy of 0.3 degrees and an altitude accuracy of 2,000 ft. at 100 naut.mi. distance. Resolution in range is given as 200 meters and as 3 degrees in azimuth. The radar features electronic stabilization between -6 and +5 degrees. The radars can be operated either from the radar site or from a remote center. They are integrated into the German Air Surveillance network.

The radars are in production at the factory site of Thales in France, in cooperation with Euro-Shelter, GTIE Air & Defence, LATecis - Latécoère group, Schleifring and Sermati. The GM 400 family includes the GM 403 and the GM 406. The GM 406 has a transmitter that is twice as powerful as the GM 403, giving it a 20 percent greater range. The GM 406 is primarily designed to equip fixed sites, with the GM 403 designed to be deployable.

Mounted on a fixed tower, the first of six Ground Master 406 has entered into service. It is installed in Auenhausen (Westphalen), the GM 406 has completed extensive compliance procedures and an operational test campaign. On site validation of the second radar is in progress at the Lauda-Königshofen (Baden-Württemberg) radar site. The third radar was delivered at the site Visselhoevede. Other sets were installed in Brekendorf, Erndtebrück and Freising.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999902248382568}",neutral,0.9999902248382568,0
Rights groups accuse French arms makers of war crimes complicity in Yemen - RFI English,"Thu, 02 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJmaS5mci9lbi9pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLzIwMjIwNjAyLXJpZ2h0cy1ncm91cHMtYWNjdXNlLWZyZW5jaC1hcm1zLW1ha2Vycy1vZi13YXItY3JpbWVzLWNvbXBsaWNpdHktaW4teWVtZW7SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Arms sales

Three NGOs on Thursday filed a lawsuit in a Paris court against French arms producers Dassault Aviation, Thales and MBDA France for alleged war crimes complicity in Yemen. They accuse the companies of having sold weapons to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) that were then used against civilians in Yemen.

Yemeni fighters backed by the Saudi-led coalition during clashes with Houthi rebels on the Kassara front line near Marib, Yemen, on 20 June, 2021.

The complaint, filed by the European Centre for Constitutional and Human Rights (ECCHR), the Mwatana for Human Rights and Sherpa International, comes amid a nationwide truce between a Saudi-led coalition and the Iran-aligned Houthi group that went into effect on 2 April.

Rights groups in France have repeatedly attempted to show that Paris's tacit support for the coalition has prolonged and worsened the conflict, which began in 2015 when the Saudi-led coalition intervened against the Houthis after they ousted the government from Yemen's capital, Sanaa.

By targeting Dassault, Thales and MBDA France, the NGOs hope it will keep the subject in the public domain at a time when the United States and its Western allies are seeking to improve ties with Saudi Arabia.

#BREAKING

Together w/ @MwatanaEn & @Asso_Sherpa + supported by @amnestyfrance, we filed a criminal complaint to hold French arms manufacturers accountable for potentially aiding & abetting alleged war crimes & crimes against humanity in #Yemen

Dassault and MBDA France did not immediately respond to calls or an emailed request for comment. Thales requested questions by email and did not immediately respond.

""The coalition's airstrikes have caused terrible destruction in Yemen. Weapons produced and exported by European countries, and in particular France, have enabled these crimes,"" said Abdulrasheed al-Faqih, executive director of Yemeni organisation Mwatana for Human Rights.

""Seven years into this war, the countless Yemeni victims deserve credible investigations into all perpetrators of crimes, including those potentially complicit,"" he said.

French prosecutors are already studying similar complaints filed against Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and the French customs authority.

The truce has offered a glimmer of hope in a country where the war and ensuing economic collapse have left millions facing starvation, and could also provide Riyadh with an exit from a costly conflict that is a point of tension with Washington.

Thales offers 'free-forever' security solution for DevSecOps teams - Cyber Daily,"Thu, 09 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmN5YmVyZGFpbHkuYXUvc2VjdXJpdHkvNzkxMi10aGFsZXMtbGF1bmNoZXMtZGF0YS1wcm90ZWN0aW9uLXNvbHV0aW9uLWZvci1kZXZzZWNvcHMtdGVhbXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales is aiming to enable DevSecOps teams to deploy data protection controls into multi-cloud applications in minutes instead of weeks with its CipherTrust Platform Community Edition.

CipherTrust Platform Community Edition is a version of Thales' CipherTrust Platform, designed to target developers and DevSecOps teams for evaluation and integration of the solution into their workflows and build pipelines. Thales aims to provide an easier path for organisations to scale from development to production by ""reducing the friction when implement[ing] data protection technology"".

According to Todd Moore, vice president of encryption products at Thales, organisations are becoming increasingly aware of the need to implement zero trust solutions within their security strategies.

""DevSecOps teams demand that security practices be automated and integrated into each application development cycle stage to mitigate digital transformation risks.

============ ============

""Thales is now offering a free-forever version of its CipherTrust Data Security Platform to give end users the tools to deploy data protection controls into multi-cloud applications in minutes – removing the complexity from implementing data security and accelerating time to compliance,"" Moore said.

CipherTrust Platform Community Edition enables developers and DevSecOps teams to implement an enterprise-grade solution that can be easily upgraded to the CipherTrust Enterprise platform, when the time comes to scale, or go into production.

The Community Edition includes most of the features of the CipherTrust Enterprise platform, it is designed to be well suited for small or development-type infrastructures. It consists of a ""free-forever version"" of CipherTrust Manager and two CipherTrust connectors, CipherTrust Transparent Encryption for Kubernetes and CipherTrust Data Protection Gateway.

DevSecOps teams manage a crucial element of an organisation's security strategy via protecting keys and certificates associated with applications and containers.

With the Community Edition, developers can centralise key management and encryption policies across multi-cloud applications. When the solution requires a secure root of trust, upgrading to the CipherTrust Enterprise Platform enables access to a FIPS 140-2 Level 3 certified Thales' Luna Hardware Security Modules.

Ever-evolving security threats and compliance regulations has made it challenging for organisations to successfully implement then roll out security enhancements at the speed demanded by DevOps.

The Community Edition solution is designed to enable DevSecOps teams to protect data rapidly in legacy and cloud-native applications. Sensitive data can be protected in RESTful calls and containerised applications in Kubernetes environments without modifying a single line of application source code.

Organisations must acknowledge that collaboration among teams not accustomed to working together is critical to successful cross-domain objectives, according to Jay Lyman, senior research analyst at 451 Research, part of S&P Global Market Intelligence, who noted that faster releases and greater efficiency are key elements to success.

""Many enterprises are still figuring out how to implement DevSecOps, which represents a departure from traditional thinking whereby security teams own security for the organisation from end to end,"" Lyman said.

Activists from Palestine Action Scotland occupied the roof of Thales UK in Linthouse near the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital on Wednesday.

Factory equipment was destroyed by protesters who targeted the site in the early hours of the morning.

Thales produces military drones, armoured vehicles and missile systems.

Palestine Action Scotland say they targeted the French company, that has eight sites across the UK, in part due to its cooperation with Israeli weapons company Elbit Systems on the Watchkeeper Drone project.

The activist group, that look to end “Scottish complicity in apartheid and military occupation, also say Thales weapons are being used on the populations of Palestine, Iraq and Afghanistan.

A team of six activists from the newly formed group are currently occupying the building, rendering it unusable and factory equipment and facilities inside the factory have been dismantled.

A spokesman for Palestine Action Scotland said: “Thales is one of the world’s largest arms companies – producing armoured vehicles, missile systems and military UAVs (drones) – in particular, the Watchkeeper drone, used for surveillance and combat on captive populations.

“Today’s action has begun the campaign to end Scottish complicity in the apartheid, dispossession and ethnic cleansing enacted on Palestinians by the Israeli occupation.

Palestine Action Scotland

“Thales operates under the same banner as Elbit – Israel’s largest weapons company, with the two cooperating on the Watchkeeper UAV project, which Elbit’s UAV Tactical Systems site in Leicester is directly involved in.

“Elbit’s Hermes 450 drone, which has been used extensively in attacks on Gaza’s captive population, laid the foundations for the Watchkeeper project.

“The Watchkeeper drone has clocked thousands of hours of operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, and has a persistent presence over the skies of Gaza.

“Closer to home, in 2020, Thales were contracted by the Royal Navy to aid in the new ‘Dreadnought’ class nuclear submarine program.

“Furthermore, the UK Border Force began use of the Watchkeeper drone in 2020, monitoring British waters.

“Using the tried and tested tactics in of direct action – disruptions, occupations and blockades – the group hopes to build on the success of parent group Palestine Action, and its ongoing campaign across England and Wales to ‘Shut Elbit Down’.”

Police are in attendance at the protest.

A spokeswoman for the force said: “At around 6.25am on Wednesday, police were called to a report of a demonstration within the grounds of a business premises in Linthouse Road, Govan, Glasgow. Officers remain at the scene.

“Police Scotland is a rights-based organisation that puts our values of integrity, fairness, respect and a commitment to upholding human rights at the heart of everything we do.

Helixview, based on Thales' expertise in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Cybersecurity, is a stationary, compact, and lightweight EDS CB C3-compliant scanner (the next standard applied to the certification for EDS CB) that combines X-ray nanotechnology-based electronic scanning and 3D imaging reconstruction.

Thales is aiming for Helixview certification by the end of 202

With this solution installed at checkpoints, passengers would no longer need to remove items from luggage. The technology is fine-tuned to detect all forms of prohibited items, whether explosives, knives and even weapons that have been dismantled and positioned in separate parts across several bags.

Artificial Intelligence is used to detect and interpret threats, instantly providing the operator with a threat/no threat instruction for the bag.

“I am sure that passengers will appreciate the new smoother and faster security checks using attractively and ergonomically-designed systems. This new technology will bring higher security and comfort with an optimal cost-performance ratio,” said Yannick Assouad, Thales.

Thales is aiming for Helixview certification by the end of 2023.

In less than a month since its inception, PT Len and Thales have marked Defend ID’s first milestone by signing a contract for Thales GM403 radars that will help Indonesia achieve superior situational awareness and modernise its sovereign airspace.

Bobby Rasyidin, president director of PT Len Industri, and Frederique miller, vice president for Sales, Land and Air Systems at Thales, signed the contract at Thales’ headquarters in Paris on 17 May. The contract will span the next few years with Thales building the radars and Command and Control and PT Len constructing the radar stations, providing the installation and integration of the systems and managing civil works for the program, supported by Thales. Certain components on the radars will be locally manufactured by PT Len, and the project will involve the transfer of radar technology and building of local indigenous capabilities, enabling Indonesia to further strengthen its local defence industry.

The GM403 is currently in service with 17 nations worldwide and is a proven and reliable radar that provides superior situational awareness that help armed forces enhance airspace sovereignty amidst constantly evolving threats. Featuring full digital stack beam technology, the GM403 can detect and track threats such as low-flying UAVs while simultaneously detecting higher-altitude targets from stealth aircraft to fighter bombers at distances of over 500 kilometres. The digital architecture of the GM403 ensures that the radars remain resilient to new threats, cyber-attacks and electronic warfare tactics. When fully implemented into service, Thales radars will increase protection over the Indonesian airspace.

“Our working relationship with Thales which dates back several decades gives us the confidence that Thales is the right partner to help us drive Defend ID forward. This new radar contract is a further testament to our strong partnership and aligned vision to build expertise locally. Through this project, PT Len will be building the next generation of defence engineers in Indonesia,” said Rasyidin.

“Through this contract, Thales is delighted to help Indonesia safeguard and enhance the sovereignty of its airspace with one of the world’s most advanced air surveillance radars, capable of detecting new threats in a rapidly changing airspace. Our commitment to Indonesia goes beyond just providing equipment. With this contract and the strategic partnership agreement signed last month, we are excited to deepen our strategic partnership with PT Len to define a roadmap for Indonesia’s defence modernisation, including the development of a national Command & Control (C2) centre and to build local radar MRO activities,” said Miller.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999845027923584}",positive,0.9999845027923584,1

On June 14th, 2022, Arquus, Thales and NTGS have officially presented the new Sherpa A2M (Advanced Mobile Mortar), during a ceremony organized on Arquus’ booth at Eurosatory 2022

The alliance of Arquus, NTGS and Thales allows the application of a truly complete solution delivering a unique indirect fire support solution, suitable for infantry support, collaborative armed forces troops and Special Forces, as well as autonomous artillery units looking for a high level of mobility and protection.

The Sherpa A2M combines the excellent mobility of a Sherpa Light, the proven Deployable Mortar System by NTGS and the 120mm rifled mortar barrel by Thales, into one full fully integrated new solution.

Thanks to Thales capability, the vehicle embeds 120 mm rifled ammunition and in the future the mortar laser guided ammunition. The rifled mortar barrel is three times more precise than smoothbore mortar. Due to this superior efficiency and accuracy, it can achieve similar operational effects with much less shots; around 4 times less rounds needed than for a smoothbore mortar.

NTGS provides its skills in global systems with the fire control system in the back of the vehicle. This system conveys information about targets and points of interest, which represents a significant strategic advantage. Thanks to their expertise, the A2M Sherpa delivers control across all mission operations and is already combat proven. The mortar and tube from NTGS and Thales are qualified both by NATO and by different armies.

The Sherpa Light is a multipurpose, 4×4 armored vehicle, designed by Arquus to provide with a wide array of versions and customizations for all needs and missions, built on a single, proven base for increased commonality and ease of maintenance. It is a modern, mature, new-generation vehicle, which is built on many years of industrial experience, operational deployments on the battlefield and maintenance. It is protected against ballistic and mine as well as improvised explosive device threats with a STANAG 4569-certified protection, which ensures a high level of safety for the crew inside the vehicle during operations.

The Sherpa A2M can carry 40 rounds of 120mm mortar ammunition in the rear and possibly additional ammunition in the cabin, depending on user requirements. It has a range up to 8,2 km with standard rifled ammunition and up to 13km with a rocket assisted projectile, allowing it to enhance the protection of the embarked soldiers by engaging units without being hit (Shoot & Scoot).

Combining the expertise of these three companies’ expertise ensures the highest level of quality for each of the Sherpa A2M’s features: protected tactical mobility, ruggedness, superior firepower and accuracy, as well as easy deployable systems and intuitive fire control.

At Eurosatory 2022, the Sherpa A2M is presented with a Hornet Lite RCWS fitted with a 7.62mm MG for the vehicle’s self-protection. The Sherpa A2M can be seen on the Arquus booth, Hall 5A F281.

The six-month programme brings together a number of local associations and offers scholarships to selected female students to help them enter and remain in the labour market, either as employees or entrepreneurs.

DAKAR, Senegal, 21 June 2022 -/African Media Agency(AMA)/-

A partnership encouraging young women to pursue digital careers

The French development agency (Agence Française de Développement, AFD) estimates that 60% of Africans are now under 24 and 35% of the world’s young people will be in Africa by 2035. According to the International Monetary Fund, nearly 20 million jobs will need to be created each year in Africa to accommodate these new workers, instead of the 10 million currently being created each year.

Studies show that in Senegal, young women are the most affected by a lack of access to employment. A recent study by the International Labour Organization showed that internet access and training in information and communication technology (ICT) allow local women to start businesses, sell their products, find better-paying jobs and access education, health and financial services.

In response to the pressing issue of job creation, the Thales Solidarity charitable fund and Polaris Asso, in partnership with the Embassy of France in Senegal and UN Women, are teaming up to launch a new programme to help young Senegalese women pursue digital careers.

The six-month programme combines the expertise of various associations to give scholarship recipients the best possible chances of entering and remaining in the labour market, either as employees or entrepreneurs, and to develop their skills as local leaders. In addition to the main programme sponsors mentioned above, other organisations including OpenClassrooms, Talent2Africa and the Senegal Youth Consortium (Consortium Jeunesse Sénégal, CJS) are also participating in the initiative.

Ousseynou Gueye, Executive Director of Polaris Asso, says the initiative is a major innovation for French-speaking Africa. “This programme is designed to train young Senegalese women in digital technology and encourage the new talents Africa needs for its development: women with the key skills for the 21st century who are engaged citizens dedicated to addressing social issues. Through this programme, we are giving them the tools they need to play an active role in the digital transition the country’s economy needs to achieve sustainable growth.”

Contributing to the digital transformation of local businesses

[bsa_pro_ad_space id=1]

During their training, scholarship recipients will learn about the importance of digital citizenship and volunteer to lead digital education workshops for local middle and high school students. They will also contribute to the development of the local economy through tutoring projects and hands-on internships where they can apply the skills they learn in their training and acquire professional experience in women-led SMEs.

“Thales has made a clear social commitment to promoting the inclusion of women. We are therefore very honoured to participate in this professional integration project through the Thales Solidarity charitable fund. We would like to support these young women by giving them skills and teaching them to become digital citizens so they can make a difference in Senegal and beyond. This initiative reflects the Thales purpose of building a future we can all trust.”

Roselyne Cartheron, Director, Thales West and Central Africa

Launch of the first group of scholarship recipients in celebration of International Women’s Day

After selecting the first 50 scholarship recipients for the pilot phase of the programme in January 2022, a kick-off ceremony was held on 28 March 2022 at the Résidence de France in Dakar.

At the event, alongside H.E. Philippe Lalliot, French Ambassador to Senegal, Professor Ismaïla Madior Fall, State Minister to the President of the Republic of Senegal, expressed the Government of Senegal’s appreciation for this programme, which will contribute to addressing the critical problem of unemployment in the country.

The event, which took place under the French Presidency of the Council of the European Union, was attended by several diplomatic delegations present in Senegal as well as Thales employees, represented by Roselyne Cartheron (Director, Thales West and Central Africa) and Yan Levy (Director, Strategy and Business Development, Africa).

Jeff Connolly joins Thales Australia as CEO - @AuManufacturing,"Wed, 15 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1bWFudWZhY3R1cmluZy5jb20uYXUvamVmZi1jb25ub2xseS1qb2lucy10aGFsZXMtYXVzdHJhbGlhLWFzLWNlb9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Peter Roberts

French defence group Thales has appointed leading Australian manufacturing figure Jeff Connolly as Australia and New Zealand CEO.

The well known head of Siemens in Australia joins following the decision by CEO Chris Jenkins to retire after 14 years in the role.

Connolly will take up the role in September with Jenkins continuing as a non-executive director of the defence company after a period of leave.

Australian-born Connolly has held senior executive roles throughout Australia, Europe and Asia, including 30 years with technology and engineering company Siemens AG, where he has been executive chairman and CEO of Siemens Australia and New Zealand for the past 10 years.

Connolly has had a leading role in Australia promoting industry 4.0 initiatives, and was instrumental in Siemens supporting university research and teaching work through the provisions of Siemens technology assets.

He chaired the Prime Minister’s Industry 4.0 Taskforce and the federal government’s Research Commercialisation Taskforce, and in 2019 was made an adjunct professor of Swinburne University recognising ‘significant contributions to Industry 4.0 in Australia’.

At the time Swinburne’s Deputy Vice-Chancellor (R&D) Professor Aleksandar Subic said: “No other individual has contributed so much to Australia’s journey through the fourth industrial revolution.

“He is an advocate and thought leader, and as a company, Siemens has invested an incredible amount of time, resources and effort to bring this capability to life across Australia.”

Connolly’s arrival comes at a critical time for Thales, which is investing heavily in revitalising its widespread Australian product development and manufacturing capabilities.

In January Thales began construction on the first phase of its plan to create an advanced manufacturing 4.0 and integration hub at the historic Lithgow Arms factory in regional NSW. This followed a $12 million investment in infrastructure and advanced manufacturing capabilities at its’ Lithgow and Mulwala facilities,

Most recently Thales established a Small Arms Collaboration and Cooperation Centre (C3) at its Lithgow Arms plant, and entered into a teaming agreement with Ocius Technology to develop and deploy an Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV)

Thales ANZ chair Belinda Hutchinson said the company was delighted to welcome a highly regarded senior business leader of Mr Connolly’s calibre to Thales.

Hutchinson said: “As an experienced, passionate and committed supporter of Australian research, innovation and modern manufacturing, Jeff has the strategic and operational capability to deliver for our customers and support our employees and other stakeholders.”

Connolly himself said he was excited by the opportunity to lead one of Australia’s most innovative and trusted companies.

In his 17 years with Thales Jenkins, an engineer, has focused on technology and engineering as drivers of the company’s Australian business.

He joined Thales from GEC Marconi, and was instrumental in Thales successful involvement in the Collins class submarine build.

Over the past 15 years Thales has exported more than $500 million of Australian developed and manufactured product.

That lack of integration could even have led to the door problems riders experienced after the train system launched, one witness suggested on Monday at the commission investigating breakdowns on Ottawa's LRT.

Alstom manufactured the trains for Ottawa's LRT, while Thales Canada Inc. provided the computerized signalling system that controls braking and propulsion, doors, sensors along the tracks and more.

It was up to Rideau Transit Group's construction arm, OLRT Constructors, to do the critical job of merging the two companies' systems. The Confederation Line was the first time that a Thales communications-based train control system was being integrated with a low-floor light rail vehicle, commission lawyers pointed out.

At the public hearings into the breakdowns on Ottawa's light rail system, however, Thales project manager Michael Burns testified that he tried to draw the train builder's attention early on to how his company and Alstom were having to sort out issues in silos rather than collaboratively.

""They had challenges in fulfilling that role,"" he said of OLRT Constructors.

Poor pre-launch 'health check'

The commission investigating Ottawa's light rail system heard a similar conclusion last Friday from Rupert Holloway, a SNC-Lavalin vice-president and civil engineer who took on oversight of building the train system at OLRT Constructors from May 2018 to May 2019.

He testified that Ottawa's train system involves thousands of complicated digital devices, and integrating the Confederation Line's systems was ""crucial.""

Holloway gave the example of how several systems would need to work together if there were a fire on a train in the tunnel. The train's computers would need to detect the fire and tell the control room at Belfast Road, fresh air would need to flow to riders as they evacuated, and elevators would need to turn off to prevent other riders from descending to the tunnel.

In hindsight, Holloway said RTG's construction arm spent a lot of time focusing on building the tunnel — ""a world-class piece of civil engineering"" — but lost focus when it came to ""the integration challenge.""

""We certainly failed in regards of tackling that challenge as effectively as we could have done,"" Holloway told the commission.

A witness from the company that provided the train control systems for Ottawa's LRT testified on June 20, 2022 that doors didn't behave as expected after the system launched because the train's manufacturer had changed a command. (Andrew Lee/CBC)

Ottawa's LRT even received a bad grade six months before the original date in 2018 when the system was to be handed over to the City of Ottawa.

OLRT Constructors had hired consultant SEMP Ltd. to do a ""health check"" on whether Ottawa's system was on track to be up-and-running and safe.

""The level of system engineering on the project to date is considered to be substantially below the minimum acceptable level for a project of this size and complexity,"" the consultant summarized in November 2017.

""This was a real catalytic moment for us,"" Holloway said. OLRT Constructors then spent more than $20 million to fly in experts from the United Kingdom to help fix the gaps, he said.

Passenger caught in door

Burns described a couple of instances in which Alstom had made changes to the way the trains would behave, unbeknownst to Thales.

During pre-launch testing, he said Thales discovered Alstom had changed software so that a train would stop if the emergency brake was applied too many times, for safety reasons. Meanwhile, Thales had its own test for the emergency brakes.

Then, after residents began riding the train in 2019, Burns said there was an instance when a woman was caught when a train door closed prematurely.

Burns explained Thales would have expected the door to re-open if something blocked it from closing. After investigating, it found Alstom had assigned a different command to that signal.

Thales then had to modify the software to prevent that door issue.

Missed Tuesday's hearing? Watch it here:

The inquiry also heard that Thales has still not completed its work on the first stage of the Confederation Line. Under the contract, Thales was supposed to install its control system at the the maintenance and storage facility on Belfast Road, but hasn't finished.

Burns said the non-automated system in the rail yard slows down the launch of LRT system in the mornings.

The issue of integrating various systems is expected to be discussed further Tuesday morning, when Alstom's Lowell Goudge is scheduled to testify. Goudge oversaw the train system integration and was the safety certifier for Alstom.

In the afternoon, the commission will hear from Jacques Bergeron, who was responsible for integrating the Thales and Alstom systems from 2014 to 2018.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.8771504163742065}",negative,0.8771504163742065,-1

And when inspecting the vehicle, one hero Ukrainian MP found it was kitted out with equipment made by French firm Thales.

There has been an arms embargo for European firms supplying Russia with equipment since the annexation of Crimea in 2014.

But reports say €346 million worth of military gear was sold to Russia by continental manufactures after that.

It is not known when the equipment was sold to the Russians.

Alex Goncharenko, who discovered the kit, told The Sun: “The French people who are opening their doors to Ukrainian refugees should be aware they are fleeing a war aided by their country’s own firms.”

A Thales spokesperson said: “Thales has always strictly complied with French and international regulations, which is why - since the European embargo measures taken in 2014 – we have not signed any contracts with Russia in the defence sector.

“Messages have been recently published on social networks showing our optronic equipment on board Russian military platforms.

""We share the emotion generated by these images, but it is important to remember that this equipment was delivered within the framework of contracts signed before the embargo decreed in 2014.""","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.99977046251297}",neutral,0.99977046251297,0

Airservices has named Thales as its primary systems integrator for the Integrated Drone Surveillance System (IDSS) trial, integrating an array of sensors and C2 systems to identify potential drone threats.

Under the program, it is expected that Thales will deliver a “system of systems” that integrates an array of sensors and command and control capabilities, enabling the classification and identification of drone of threats around the Kingsford Smith Airport.

The system will generate a 3D holographic radar which has been utilised by airports in the United Kingdom, Asia and the Pacific to detect all sizes of drones with trials expected to commence this year.

== ==

It is expected that the system will also be able to locate the drone’s pilot.

Airservices Australia is a federally owned organisation that manages 11 per cent of the world’s airspace.

“Airservices, in partnership with Australian government agencies, implemented drone detection capabilities at major airports across Australia several years ago,” Peter Curran, Airservices Australia chief customer experience and strategy officer, said.

“As uncrewed aircraft technologies continue to evolve and increase in use, we are investing in solutions that keep pace with latest developments.

“Our partnership with Thales allows us to trial next-generation drone detection capabilities to enhance the safe operation of crewed and uncrewed flights operating together in Australian airspace.”

According to Christophe Salomon, executive vice president land and air systems at Thales, the trial represents years of cutting-edge drone research and development by the company.

“We are looking forward to starting trials in partnership with Airservices Australia, to enhance their detection capabilities of drones,” Salomon said.

“This partnership strengthens our collaboration of more than 30 years and represents a key building block for our strategy.

“Over the years, Thales has developed a strong expertise and experience to master the entire drone ecosystem to offer cutting-edge solutions,” he added.

“Indeed, we have demonstrated our ability to be a strong player in the field of airport air surveillance and anti-drone systems, through various worldwide references to date and our 3D holographic radar system solution is becoming a ‘game changer’ in protecting aircraft from rogue drones whilst maintaining airport operations.”

ETCS is an in-cab signalling technology that is set to transform the railway network by removing trackside signalling. In doing so, it will improve performance, reduce delays, enhance safety and reduce costs. As fitted to the Class 43s the ETCS complies with the latest UNISIG baseline (B3R2),

The Class 43 power cars fitted with the ETCS are owned by Porterbrook, which is the lead ROSCO for the Class 43s under the National Joint ROSCO Programme. They form part of Network Rail's New Measurement Train, which carries out essential infrastructure monitoring work across the whole network. Fitment of ETCS is a priority to enable continued data recording on the East Coast and in other areas as the technology is rolled out.

In 2018, Porterbrook awarded a contract to Thales to carry out the First in Class (FiC) design and fitment project. The project is the first time that Thales has fitted the ETCS On-Board System in the UK. Over the last two weeks, Level 2 Testing was carried out at Network Rail's Melton Rail Innovation & Development Centre (RIDC). That testing was successful, and preparation is now underway for the units to undergo full testing and reach Approval to Place Into Service by the end of the year.

Ben Ackroyd, Chief Operating Officer at Porterbrook, said:

“Successful testing of Thales ETCS equipment is a major milestone, and we are delighted that the New Measurement Train will continue to operate on the East Coast once conventional signals are removed as we move to ETCS Level 2. This project is a key part of the rollout of the Digital Railway and my thanks goes to everyone who has played their part in getting us to this important stage.”

Mark Newill, Head of On-board Portfolio at Thales, said:

“This milestone proves Thales's capability to modify existing cabs with the new digital in-cab system so they can be ETCS-compatible. The multiple stakeholders involved worked collaboratively to get us to the point where we can trial the system on an operational track.”","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9956938028335571}",positive,0.9956938028335571,1
