A few days before the start of DSEI 2017 Thales and the UK celebrated a landmark date; the centenary of the entry into service of the company’s first Royal Navy periscope. Since that date, Thales has achieved the remarkable feat of being the Royal Navy's sole supplier of periscopes and optronic masts.

It is testament to our people and our innovation that we have sustained this partnership for an entire century, but how did it all start? With WW1 well under way, the Navy needed an accurate rangefinding capability in their submarine periscopes, mainly due to the limitations of torpedo technology and the increasing need to operate covertly. Glasgow based Barr & Stroud Ltd, now part of the modern Thales family of businesses, was the UK’s leading rangefinder supplier and in December 1915 was approached by Cdr S.S Hall of the RN to look at the feasibility of designing and building a periscope with this rangefinding facility.

Incredibly, the first mock-up periscope was designed and built by July 1916 resulting in a contract to supply six FY1 rangefinding periscopes – the first of which was delivered in less than 12 months in August 1917. The rest, as they say, is indeed history.

100 years: the significant dates and advances

1919 – 1939: the first true binocular periscope; the CK1, which made observation for extended periods much easier. On the export front, Thales’s customer list expanded to include a range of countries including France, Poland, Spain and the USA.

WWII: During Operation Source in September 1943, a small group of X-Craft midget submarines, each fitted with a single Thales CL8 periscope, attacked the 52,000 ton German battleship Tripitz in Kåfjord in northern Norway. The mission resulted in the Victoria Cross being awarded to the commanding officers who subsequently visited Glasgow to thank the workforce for their efforts.

1950s-60s: As the world moved into the Cold War era, the CK24 Search and CH74 Attack Periscopes, optimised for surveillance and intelligence gathering roles, were fitted to the Royal Navy’s diesel electric Oberon Class Submarines periscopes.

Late 1960s - early 1980s: The world’s first thermal imaging periscope (CH82) and the world’s first laser rangefinder periscope (CH80). The change to an electronic system set the standard for the future and provided the basis for subsequent leading edge sensor upgrades.

Mid to late 1980s: The CK35 and CH85 periscopes introduced remote control of key functions. Imagery from thermal imaging and TV sensors could now be controlled and displayed on screens in the control room and made available to the entire command team, not just the commander. Remote control technology had finally reached a level of maturity to enable the next generation of above water sensor systems – the optronic mast.

1998: Thales’s first CM10 optronic mast was sea-trialled on HMS Trenchant and brought about a significant change in the Royal Navy’s above water visual system capabilities. Today, each Astute Class submarine has two Thales CM10 optronic masts, each fitted with a fully integrated ESM/EW sensor package and with TV, thermal imaging or images being remotely controlled and displayed on consoles within the control room.

A centenary celebration

On August 31, the celebration of the 100th anniversary of Thales’s first supply of periscopes to the Royal Navy, took place at the Group’s facility in Glasgow, in the presence of Harriett Baldwin, Defence Procurement Minister.



""This anniversary marks a proud record of Scottish engineering contributing directly to UK defence and national security by providing the eyes and ears for our nuclear deterrent and attack submarines,” declared the minister. ""Generations of highly skilled engineers across Scotland have applied battle-winning technologies to meet the needs of their UK armed forces, as well as exporting their innovations to dozens of navies around the world.""

Thales UK Chief Executive, Victor Chavez, noted the remarkable technological advances over the years whilst also looking forward into the next century. “Our latest full remote control, non-hull penetrating optronics systems give naval architects more design flexibility by not restricting them to co-locating the fin and the control room via a 50ft long periscope. These options, combined with the digital inboard control and display system, provide commanders with a leap forward in submarine capability.""

Thales bets on China's appetite for simulators - Vertical Magazine,"Wed, 27 Sep 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvdGhhbGVzLWJldHMtY2hpbmFzLWFwcGV0aXRlLXNpbXVsYXRvcnMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Haite Group, a Chinese company specializing in aviation services, recently inaugurated a flight training center in Tianjin featuring a Thales Reality H EC135 full flight helicopter simulator. Thales sees the delivery as the first in a long series to come.

The center will be instrumental in meeting the increasing demand for helicopter pilot training in China, Thales said. In that instance, the Paris-based company’s role is only that of a supplier. But it has had a long relationship with Haite Group, Benoit Plantier, Thales vice president, training and simulation activities, said.

The simulator Haite Group has received sports Thales’ Hexaline electric motion system, for lower maintenance cost.

The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) certified it as a Level D simulator. “The CAAC’s requirements are similar to those of the European Aviation Safety Agency, but this was their first EC135 simulator so they want to understand in depth, they ask for more explanation and documents,” Plantier said.

Thales expects Haite Group will order more simulators, and said they would support H135 fleet growth in the country.

Meanwhile, Airbus Helicopters is building its first final assembly line in China, and it will produce H135 light twins. The EC135 is the predecessor of the H135 so, for Haite Group, buying an H135 simulator was the next logical step.

China was the manufacturer’s first single market in 2016. The country is estimated to need thousands of civil helicopters over the next 20 years for applications such as emergency medical services, for which the EC135 and the H135 are well suited. Airbus Helicopters is claiming a 40 percent market share in China’s civil helicopter market, with 260 rotorcraft. The long-discussed deregulation of the lower airspace, needed for the helicopter industry to thrive, is beginning in earnest, according to Plantier."
Thales Introduces the F90MBR Modular Assault Rifle - Defense Update,"Mon, 11 Sep 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiL2h0dHBzOi8vZGVmZW5zZS11cGRhdGUuY29tLzIwMTcwOTExX2Y5MG1ici5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales is launching the F90MBR – a new assault rifle at DSEI 2017. The weapon represents a new generation of the F90 currently in service with the Australian Defence Force. The Modular Bullpup Rifle is NATO interoperable and is suited to support the modern integrated solider systems. At a total weight of 3.25 kg it is one of the lightest weapons of its class. NATO compatibility is supported by the tri-rail system and magazine compatibility, that ensures interoperability with existing NATO weapons and ammunition. It is fitted with ambidextrous controls to enable fast reaction times and rapid target engagement.

As a modular weapon system, it is able to be packaged with multiple barrels, and compatible optics, accessories, and ancillaries with Grab Case, allowing an operator to quickly transition between different tactical employments of the weapon system. Designed for use by amphibious forces, soldiers can swim with the weapon, and fire immediately after emerging from the water. Both the F90 and F90MBR enable the soldier to reach up to 600m accurately.

availability in multiple barrel lengths, fully-ambidextrous forward bolt and magazine release controls, and a ‘drop free’ magazine release function to facilitate even faster magazine changes, regardless of the hand-dominance of the firer. The F90MBR safely accommodates off-handed shooting techniques through the use of a case deflector and can be easily modified by the operator without tools to a dedicated left or right handed ejecting weapon."
Researchers unveil the world's first artificial nano-neuron with voice recognition capabilities - Thales,"Tue, 19 Sep 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi93b3JsZHdpZGUvZ3JvdXAvcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZS9yZXNlYXJjaGVycy11bnZlaWwtd29ybGRzLWZpcnN0LWFydGlmaWNpYWwtbmFuby1uZXVyb24tdm9pY2XSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Researchers from the Joint Physics Unit CNRS/Thales, the Nanosciences and Nanotechnologies Centre (CNRS/Université Paris Sud), in collaboration with American and Japanese researchers, have developed the world’s first artificial nano-neuron with the ability to recognise numbers spoken by different individuals. Just like the recent development of electronic synapses described in a Nature article, this electronic nano-neuron is a breakthrough in artificial intelligence and its potential applications.

© ©L. Thion Ecliptique The latest artificial intelligence algorithms are able to recognise visual and vocal cues with high levels of performance. But running these programs on conventional computers uses 10,000 times more energy than the human brain. To reduce electricity consumption, a new type of computer is needed. It is inspired by the human brain and comprises vast numbers of miniaturised neurons and synapses. Until now, however, it had not been possible to produce a stable enough artificial nano-neuron which would process the information reliably.



Today, for the first time, researchers have developed a nano-neuron with the ability to recognise numbers spoken by different individuals with 99.6% accuracy. This breakthrough relied on the use of an exceptionally stable magnetic oscillator. Each gyration of this nano-compass generates an electrical output, which effectively imitates the electrical impulses produced by biological neurons. In the next few years, these magnetic nano-neurons could be interconnected via artificial synapses, such as those recently developed, for real-time big data analytics and classification.



The project is a collaborative initiative between fundamental research laboratories and applied research partners. The long-term goal is to produce extremely energy-efficient miniaturised chips with the intelligence needed to learn from and adapt to the constantly ever-changing and ambiguous situations of the real world. These electronic chips will have many practical applications, such as providing smart guidance to robots or autonomous vehicles, helping doctors in their diagnosis’ and improving medical prostheses. This project included researchers from the Joint Physics Unit CNRS/Thales, the AIST, the CNS-NIST, and the Nanosciences and Nanotechnologies Centre (CNRS/Université Paris-Sud).

The State of Qatar signed a new €5bn deal with the Republic of Italy to purchase seven Italian naval vessels for the Qatari Emiri Naval Forces (QENF).

The deal was announced at a joint news conference in Doha, which was attended by Qatari Minister of Foreign Affairs Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani and Italian Foreign Minister Angelino Alfano.

Al Thani said: “We have strong political and economic relations with Italy, and important cooperation in defence and security fields, along with the continued political consultation between the two countries.”

The British Royal Navy's future flagship Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carrier, HMS Queen Elizabeth, arrived at its homeport of Portsmouth harbour for the first time.

The 65,000t vessel is berthed at the Princess Royal Jetty at Her Majesty’s Naval Base (HMNB) Portsmouth, which will serve as the homeport for both of the Royal Navy’s aircraft carriers.

Princess Royal Jetty was refurbished and strengthened to support the two new carriers as part of a £100m infrastructure upgrade programme, which was carried out ahead of the first vessel's arrival.

The 280m-long HMS Queen Elizabeth underwent sea trials prior to its arrival in Portsmouth, after setting sail from Scotland's Rosyth dockyard in June.

Germany and Norway officially entered a long-term naval defence material cooperation on submarines and missiles.

The Norwegian Government previously confirmed its intention to enter a strategic partnership with Germany for the common purchase and lifetime management of new submarines in February.

The bilateral cooperation was formalised through the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) between the two nations.

Rostec subsidiary Russian Helicopters is set to begin the serial delivery of upgraded multi-role Ka-27M helicopters for the Russian Naval Aviation.

The first aircraft scheduled for delivery has successfully completed a series of factory tests and assessments.

The modernised helicopters feature a new tactical command system that includes the latest acoustic and magnetometric systems, a radio reconnaissance device, an information computation solution and an active phased-array airborne radar station.

The Indian Navy commissioned its second landing craft utility (LCU) Mk-IV-class ship known as IN LCU L52 at Port Blair in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.

The LCU MK-IV amphibious ships are primarily used for transporting and deploying main battle tanks, armoured vehicles, troops and equipment from the vessel to the shore.

The vessels are set to be based in the Andaman and Nicobar Command and used for multi-role activities such as beaching operations, search and rescue, disaster relief operations, supply and replenishment, and evacuation from far-away islands.

The Government of Australia granted first pass approval for the service life extension of the Royal Australian Navy's (RAN) Huon-class minehunter coastal vessels.

Navy Capability head rear admiral Jonathan Mead said that the project will ensure that the RAN is capable of providing an effective maritime mine countermeasure capability by 2030.

Mead said: “Minehunters play a vital role in protecting Australia’s ships, harbours and infrastructure from the threat of sea mines.""

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) tested a prototype of a low-cost elevated sensor mast on-board the US Navy's commissioned Cyclone-class patrol coastal ship USS Zephyr for the first time.

The three-day trial period saw the crew of the 174ft-long naval vessel evaluate the prototype of DARPA’s Towed Airborne Lift of Naval Systems (TALONS) near Naval Station Mayport, Florida.

TALONS exhibited safe and routine operation from USS Zephyr’s deck under different sea states and wind conditions during the trials, without adversely affecting the vessel’s operational capability.

The Egyptian Navy officially received the second of four Howaldtswerke-Deutche Werft (HDW) 209/1400mod-class submarines from Germany.

ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems (TKMS) launched the new vessel at its shipyard in Kiel, Germany.

The Type 209/1400 submarine features a length of 60m-73m and has the capability to sail for 11,000nm at a speed of 21k.

It will also be able to launch missiles and torpedoes for the Egyptian Navy."

Metal 3D printing will lead to a reduction in the development and manufacturing times for parts with high added value made from complex metal alloys in all mechanical domains, in particular the aerospace and space domains.

The industrial Competence Centre at the heart of the Thales group's ""Industry 4.0"" development generates employment.

Thales is continuing with its commitments as part of its cooperation with Morocco.

This industrial Competence Centre forms part of the Industrial Acceleration Plan 2014 to 2020, supported by the Kingdom of Morocco, which supports the development of an innovative ecosystem involving Thales and its local suppliers, including the creation of a high-tech industrial competence centre.

""With an existing aerospace ecosystem of subcontractors, Morocco has everything needed to become Thales' global centre of expertise in 3D printing. The use of a secure digital platform provides the industrial Competence Centre with the latest innovations in terms of connected industry and smart plants, and will improve the competitiveness of the solutions offered to our customers"" Pierre Prigent, Thales Country Director in Morocco.

Spread across an area of 1000 m², in the Midparc zone in Casablanca, this industrial Competence Centre will eventually employ around twenty engineers and technicians. It is currently equipped with two so-called selective laser melting technology machines. This technique, which involves fusing metal alloy powders using a high-intensity laser, is used to manufacture metal parts of unrivalled complexity, which cannot be manufactured using current technologies. It is freed from the high-reliability constraints of traditional manufacturing, while reducing the number of parts used and making them lighter. The initial qse series will be produced using aluminium and titanium, widely used in the aerospace sector. In the medium-term, Thales is planning to acquire 10 machines.

The ""Industry 4.0"" type procedure undertaken accelerates the efficiency of the production tool, allowing improved production, at a lower cost and in a more environmentally friendly manner. It offers a new way of handling production through smart systems used to collect, store, manage and analyse thousands of items of information from their sensors. This Competence Centre, which specialises in 3D printing, is fully in line with the digital transformation of Thales and will provide a genuine global centre of expertise, from which Morocco will be the first to benefit.



“Thales is bringing state-of-the-art technology and a high added value profession to Morocco: it is a genuine source of pride for us to deliver this leap forward to the country’s industrial sector. This new project is proof that the Moroccan is achieving a diametric shift in its industrial sector, which is driving the creation of highly specialized jobs in the country.”

One hundred years of unbroken supply to any customer is an incredible achievement. In this era of intense competition, it is all the more impressive when the record is also one as a sole supplier.



The 25th of August 1917 was the day on which Thales officially delivered its first submarine periscope to the Royal Navy. Prior to that, in December 1915, Commander S.S Hall of the Royal Navy had approached Glasgow based Barr & Stroud Ltd, now part of the modern-day Thales UK, to investigate the feasibility of integrating an optical rangefinder into a periscope. As the UK’s leading supplier of military rangefinders, the Company rose to the challenge and within 7 months had built a fully-functioning mock-up. That led to their first contract for a quantity of 6 FY1 periscopes being placed on 15th September 1916. According to company records, one of those first periscopes was shipped via Liverpool to the US Navy in New York in May 1918.

The very first periscope, FY1 Serial Number 1, was fitted to HM Submarine M3 which was then based at Rosyth Royal Dockyard. One hundred years later, Thales still has a strong presence in Rosyth through its involvement as a leading partner in the QEC Aircraft Carrier programme for the Royal Navy.

In the years between WW1 and WW2, Thales significantly expanded its global customer base to include countries such as Denmark, Greece, Latvia, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Yugoslavia. The Baltic Fleet of the then USSR also became a customer of Thales although the political scene has changed somewhat since those days in the 1930’s.



La Marine Nationale (Forces Sous-Marine) in France was supplied with over 80 periscopes during the 1920’s/1930’s. These were built under licence in France and initiated a relationship which continued through WW2 with the supply of periscopes for the Free French Government. Even back in those days, international industrial collaboration was clearly a strong point for Thales.



Post WW2 and with the advent of the Cold War, submarine operations highlighted the need for periscopes optimised for surveillance and intelligence gathering although the opto-mechanical technology used in the periscopes really didn’t differ much from those used in the preceding 50 years. Innovations introduced in periscopes such as those of the Oberon Class submarines of the Royal Navy, Brazil, Chile and Canada included basic night vision and Electronic Warfare sensors.

With the advent of the electronic age, during the late 1970’s Thales introduced Thermal Imaging sensors and Laser Rangefinders to Royal Navy periscopes in 1978 and 1979 respectively. The use of electronics in periscope design architecture facilitated a transition to limited remote control, followed by full remote control systems such as those used on the Royal Australian Navy Collins Class in the 1990’s. This meant that Thales had successfully achieved a steady progression to the fundamental building blocks required for the next generation of visual sensor systems – Optronic Masts.

Today’s Astute Class submarines of the RN use twin CM10 Optronic Masts from Thales, providing the “eyes” of the platform and as such our relationship as the Trusted Partner to the Royal Navy.

Much has changed since those distant days of 1917 in terms of technology but, for Thales, innovation is in our DNA. Work is already well under way to deliver the next generation of visual system, the Low Profile Variant (LPV) Optronics Mast which holds the prospect of leading the way for Thales’ second century in the Periscope and Optronic Mast business."

Welcome onboard a brand-new experience, an immersive journey on the Stairway to Space, step after step.



A gigantic observatory in the middle of the desert

Your trip starts, quite naturally, down on Earth… well, not really down, since you’ll be at an altitude of 5,000 meters (that’s over 16,000 feet, for our American friends) in the Atacama Desert in Chile. Up on the Chajnantor plateau is the largest radiotelescope ever built: ALMA (Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array). Consisting of 66 giant dish antennas, this titanic observatory was built by an international team from Europe, the United States and Japan – with Thales Alenia Space chosen to build the 25 European dish antennas. ALMA was designed to meet a wide range of exciting objectives: to observe the so-called “cold” universe and molecular gases, to provide scientists and astronomers with images of stars and planets being formed, to detect nascent galaxies as they could have existed some ten billion years ago, and much more.

Anytime, anywhere connectivity

10,700 meters (over 35,000 ft). You’re a passenger on a commercial jetliner, and you can phone, check your emails, watch a film, use online services and much more. Today’s users are always looking for greater connectivity and mobility, with anytime, anywhere access to richer content. The best solution to address this market trend is undoubtedly Satcom, or satellite communications systems. For instance, international operator SES chose Thales Alenia Space in 2016 to make the very-high-throughout communications satellite, SES-17, with a special focus on providing connectivity for both airplanes and their passengers.

Is it a bird? A plane? A drone? No, it’s StratobusTM!

We’ve moved up to an altitude of 20,000 meters, or 20 kilometers (12-1/2 miles), well above air traffic and the jet stream. In a few years it will be StratobusTM an airship halfway between a drone and a satellite, which will be flying in the stratosphere. Stratobus is an excellent fit with satellite systems and, unlike these systems, does not require a launch vehicle. It will provide a perfect solution for both homeland and defense applications, for example by providing permanent surveillance of a given regional coverage zone.

“Eye in the Sky”

700 kilometers: That’s where most Earth Observation satellites are to be found, in an orbit where they gather intelligence, monitor our environment, help map the planet, manage crises, etc. Spaceborne systems give their users, especially governments, access to a wide range of surveillance applications, to guarantee security and independence. More and more countries today have shown an interest in acquiring independent space systems capable of providing them with key intelligence pictures. Thales Alenia Space offers a complete range of observation components (optical and radar sensors, user ground segment) to meet market expectations in this area.

Connecting people

780 kilometers: The Iridium® NEXT constellation should be fully operational at this orbit in 2018. Built by Thales Alenia Space for Iridium, this second-generation constellation will count 66 operational satellites in orbit, nine in-orbit spares, and six more spares on the ground. Iridium® NEXT is one of the most complex and ambitious space programs ever developed. It is designed to connect thousands of users around the world, using an ingenious “mesh” arrangement that interconnects dozens of telecom satellites flying around our planet.

Reduce the digital divide

Let’s take a big jump now, all the way to 36,000 kilometers (about 22,300 miles), where geostationary communications satellites hang out. Even in 2017, the digital divide is still a major program for society. More than 4 billion people on Earth are still not connected to the Internet, or have a poor connection. In the 42 countries that have the lowest connection rate (totaling 2.5 billion people), it’s still very hard to connect to the Internet via conventional terrestrial systems. Very High Throughput Satellites (VHTS) a sector where Thales Alenia Space is an uncontested key player, provides a very attractive alternative to reduce this digital divide. The major advantage of a satellite-based solution is of course its ability to provide internet coverage over a given area, independently of the ground infrastructure, and at comparable connection costs.

Herschel: tribute to a groundbreaking space telescope - Thales,"Fri, 22 Sep 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi93b3JsZHdpZGUvc3BhY2UvbmV3cy9oZXJzY2hlbC10cmlidXRlLWdyb3VuZGJyZWFraW5nLXNwYWNlLXRlbGVzY29wZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Every week there seems to be a new hero in space. Last Friday, a week ago to the day, the entire world was celebrating the end of the Cassini mission to Saturn and its moons. The spacecraft, as planned, disintegrated on September 15, 2017 as it plunged into the Saturnian atmosphere, recording and transmitting images right up to its last cosmic breath. This week, the European Space Agency is celebrating the Herschel space observatory, which collected a rich trove of data concerning the formation of stars and galaxies. Herschel helped scientists uncover some of the best kept secrets in our Universe, and made them very happy indeed!





“A Sky Full of Stars”

The space observatory Herschel was orbited on May 14, 2009 by Arianespace, along with its co-passenger Planck. These two high-tech jewels are still considered some of the most complex scientific satellites ever built in Europe. Herschel-Planck was a space exploration program conducted by Thales Alenia Space as prime contractor on behalf of ESA. The Herschel mission came to an end on April 29, 2013 after four years of loyal service in orbit – 10% over its initial life expectancy.

Dedicated to the exploration of the “cold universe”, Herschel was fitted with a telescope that featured a primary mirror 3.5 meters in diameter – twice the surface area of the mirror used on the Hubble Space Telescope. Herschel was the first spaceborne observatory to cover the spectrum between 55 and 672 µm (far infrared and submillimetric radiation), capable of detecting radiating objects at temperatures between 5 and 50 K (-268/-223°C). Placed in orbit around the Lagrange Point L2, at 1.5 million kilometers from the Earth, it was also the first telescope to detect emissions from cosmic dust, allowing it to observe fossil radiation (light) from some of the oldest phenomena in the Universe. Along with Planck, this observatory revolutionized modern astronomy, and gave scientists a better understanding of the distant Universe, as well as our own Solar System.

The Cassini-Huygens spacecraft was launched in October 1997, primarily to study Saturn, its famous rings and its moons. To get there, it got four gravitational “slingshot” assists, passing by Venus twice, then Earth in 1999 and Jupiter at the end of 2000. On June 30, 2004, the spacecraft finally arrived at Saturn.

The international Cassini–Huygens mission, undoubtedly one of the most complex in the history of interplanetary exploration, was also one of the most successful, sending back data and spectacular images to Earth thanks to its main antenna designed and built by Thales Alenia Space. The piggyback Huygens probe would later separate from the Cassini orbiter land on the surface of Titan, Saturn’s largest moon.

Thales Alenia Space provided the Ku-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR), High Gain Antenna and radio frequency subsystem for Cassini. These instruments helped explore Titan’s great hydrocarbon seas, revealed oceans of liquid water beneath the icy surfaces of Titan and another of Saturn’s moons, Enceladus, and probed the atmospheres and ionospheres of Titan and Saturn, just to name a few of their tasks.

After nearly 13 years in orbit around Saturn, Cassini is about to write its final chapter. The spacecraft is performing a series of daring dives between the planet and its rings, culminating on September 15th in a dramatic final plunge into Saturn's atmosphere. It will record and transmit data right up to the time it disintegrates.



When Europe landed on Titan!



Thales Alenia Space was prime contractor for the Huygens space probe on behalf of ESA. Leading a consortium of 40 companies and laboratories, Thales Alenia Space was the first company in Europe to take up the challenge of building a space probe designed to face extreme conditions. One of the requirements on Cassi-Huygens exploration mission was to survive a seven-year journey of more than 3 billion kilometers through the Solar System, subject to temperatures down to minus 200 degrees Celsius.

Regarding Cassini spacecraft, built by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Thales Alenia Space was responsible for the design, manufacture and testing of the High Gain Antenna that handles all communications with Earth. Measuring four meters in diameter, the antenna features a light, strong and ultra-stable carbon fiber reflector and structure, allowing it to stand up to the extreme conditions encountered throughout the mission.

The High Gain Antenna can withstand temperatures up to 400°C, allowing it to be used as a shield to protect the spacecraft from the 180°C heat during the flyby with Venus, the closest point to the Sun. Since reaching Saturn, it has been working at a temperature of -200°C. Its outstanding performance over the 20 years since spacecraft launch reflects Thales Alenia Space’s excellence in the design, manufacture, assembly and testing of large antennas for deep space applications.

Thales Alenia Space also made the multimode radar used to characterize many of Titan's features. Developed in collaboration with NASA, this technology was first used on the way to Saturn, to study Jupiter’s magnetosphere – a considerable scientific achievement. The synthetic aperture radar (SAR) was especially useful because it can see through Titan's dense atmosphere, where optical sensors are useless.

Whether exploring Venus or Mars, Saturn or Titan, asteroids or comets, Thales Alenia Space has always been a pivotal partner in Europe's fantastic missions to the Solar System.

Key Points

Two new facilities in the UK dedicated to the test and training of autonomous systems

The two facilities will bring an investment of £7m (€8m) and sustain 60 jobs in the local regions, 500 skilled jobs throughout the UK.

Both facilities are key to Thales’s vision of autonomous system capabilities

Following Thales’s successful trials during the Royal Navy’s Unmanned Warrior exercise in 2016, Thales is now investing in two trials and training centres based in West Wales and in South-West England to test and develop autonomous systems for both military and civil activities.

Thales will invest £7 million (€8 million) across the two regions, and sustain around 60 jobs in the local areas. There are currently 500 jobs both in Thales and our supply chain supporting current and future autonomous and unmanned systems technologies.

The new £1 million facility in Turnchapel Wharf, Plymouth will be Thales’s maritime autonomy trials and training centre. The five year commitment by Thales secures 20 jobs and the aspiration to continue to grow our footprint. This waterfront facility will provide access to trials areas for development of cutting edge maritime autonomous systems and position Thales at the centre of future maritime autonomy capability. The facility will act as the key maritime integration, test and evaluation centre for the combined United Kingdom and French Maritime Mine Counter Measures (MMCM) Programme.





Investing in these facilities enables the safe test, evaluation and training of autonomous platforms, innovative research and development, as well as the regulations for military and civil applications. These facilities will be central to the growth of Thales’s future autonomous capability.

Victor Chavez, CEO of Thales in the UK



Central to the growth of Thales’s future, Thales has also signed a five year agreement with West Wales Airport (WWA) which will continue to deliver the Watchkeeper programme to the British Army and to expand the innovative test, development and training of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS).

Thales has committed £6 million to the West Wales facility over the next two years, securing 40 jobs both locally and across the UK. Over the past ten years, £10 million has already been invested into the airport and local economy while Thales and the Ministry of Defence have tested and developed Europe’s largest UAS programme, Watchkeeper.

The commitment to these facilities builds on Thales’s leadership in autonomous systems and strengthens the position of UK industry in this emerging market.



Whether in the air or the sea, the UK is leading the way when it comes to autonomous systems. Thales’ announcement today is yet another example of that, and another way in which this innovation is supporting jobs right across the country.

This marked the first step towards one of the world’s most advanced Earth observation systems, completed in 2010 and totaling four satellites.

In its first decade of service, COSMO-SkyMed has captured over one million radar scenes worldwide, by monitoring for example UNESCO World Heritage Sites and generating data that is vital to understanding the underlying phenomena that affect our planet. The three earthquakes that rattled central Italy in October 2016 and Hurricane Harvey are just the most recent examples of natural disasters monitored by the constellation to determine the extent of damage.

The powerful radars on the Sentinel-1 and COSMO-SkyMed satellites, both built by Thales Alenia Space as prime contractor, deliver essential information about what’s happening to our planet. They both use synthetic aperture radars (SAR) that can “see” through clouds day or night and in any weather, and can measure ground movements to within a centimeter. This is especially important for monitoring remote regions such as the poles.

Thales has today welcomed Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon to its Belfast site where he visited the state-of-the-art high precision engineering facilities that are supporting both the UK Armed Forces and the latest developments in the UK Space industry.

With a 60 year heritage in world class engineering, the Belfast facility is the leading high technology company in Northern Ireland, employing more than 500 people in the defence and space sectors.

The site specialises in the design manufacture and integration of lightweight, mobile defence solutions, including the protection of high value assets. The utilisation of these systems to secure the 2012 Olympic Games demonstrates the criticality of this capability to the UK.



Thales is a trusted partner for UK armed forces and its manufacturing and investment roots in Northern Ireland can be traced back to the iconic Short Brothers in the 1930’s.In recent years, Belfast has also become an increasingly important part of the Thales export strategy, winning over £400m orders in the last three years.

During his visit, Sir Michael took the opportunity to meet young employees from Thales UK’s thriving apprentice and graduate programme, which currently numbers more than 400 people.



The Defence Secretary was also given an update on the Belfast space electric propulsion facility which was first opened by UK astronaut Major Tim Peake. The facility will be the Thales global centre of excellence for electric propulsion systems for satellites and is gearing up for full production in 2018.



This cutting edge technology allows the satellite to carry larger payloads for longer periods, driving down the cost of operating the platform in space and requiring one fifth of the propellant to deliver the same mission compared to chemical-based engines.



The decision to open the centre in Belfast was made after an evaluation of potential sites across Europe. A combination of the heritage of precision engineering for the defence sector and support from Invest Northern Ireland, created the perfect business environment and made Belfast an obvious choice.



Victor Chavez, Thales UK’s CEO, said: “With 60 years of heritage, Thales is proud of Belfast’s world leading skills and our recent investment to create a global centre of excellence for space propulsion demonstrates our long term commitment to the Northern Ireland economy. The rapid growth in exports over the past few years demonstrates both the quality of our technologies and our global competitiveness.”"

Defeating the IED - Asian Military Review,"Fri, 15 Sep 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFzaWFubWlsaXRhcnlyZXZpZXcuY29tLzIwMTcvMDkvZGVmZWF0aW5nLXRoZS1pZWQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Defeating Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) with active countermeasures involves two distinct approaches: attacking the Radio Frequency (RF) detonation signals and mitigating the explosion with an energetic response. Both are very demanding technologies.

Disrupting the RF detonation signal without harming friendly and neutral communications presents a challenge as does the energetic response which requires extremely rapid and precise kinetic effects. According to Thales, which offers a portfolio of Counter-IED (CIED) technology for convoy projection and dismounted use, lessons learned from recent deployments, such as the US-led operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, stress the need for equipment that can be upgraded easily to keep pace with continuously-evolving threats, that preserve friendly communications and that are smaller, lighter and more energy efficient than legacy systems to enable integration into all types of vehicles.

Many of the latest RF jammers now combine active and reactive modes to improve both power efficiency and operational security. As Elbit explains, active systems spread RF jamming energy across their coverage frequency band without regard to threat activity, making them less effective on any individual frequency and increasing the electro-magnetic signature that might enable hostile forces to detect them more easily. Purely reactive jammers, in contrast, only jam when they have detected a signal that they recognise as a threat, which requires an up-to-date threat database and very rapid reactions. The risk is that they may not react to a signal they do not recognise as a threat. Therefore, a carefully selected and configurable combination of active and reactive operation is increasingly seen as the way to go.

Eclipse

Under the auspices of the French Direction Générale de l’Armement (General Armament Directorate) defence procurement and technology agency’s BARAGE C-IED programme, Thales’ new Eclipse jammer has successfully completed qualification testing, the company announced on 16 May. This qualification clears the way for entry into service with the French Armed Forces, with deliveries commencing and concluding this year. Thales says that the Eclipse is a compact device designed to be integrated with light armoured vehicles of all kinds. Designed to improve protection against Remote-Controlled (RC) IEDs, the Eclipse covers a wide range of frequencies used by potential RF detonator threats without interfering with friendly radio communications, specifically operating between 20 megahertz (MHz) and 2.5 gigahertz (GHz) as standard, with an optional extension up to six gigahertz. Thales specialists told AMR that Eclipse is the smallest smart, vehicle-mounted solution available offering full band coverage and high power while preserving the vehicle’s radio communications. With four independent channels it produces 50 Watts of jamming power per channel and makes use of active, reactive and hybrid countermeasures techniques, says the company, needing just two antennae where comparable systems might use four, with this reduced number of antennae easing integration onto a wide range of vehicles. “The hardware and software architecture of Eclipse is scalable and modular allowing easy upgrade with new inhibition capabilities or technology insertion,” the company told AMR. “The Personal Computer-based mission preparation unit is simple to use in order to allow it to be easily configured for its mission.”

The Eclipse uses Software Defined Radio (SDR) technology and with a modular open architecture, this enables it to accept new jamming waveforms to extend its functionality and to provide protection from new threats as they emerge. An embedded integrity check function gives operators information on the system’s health and operational readiness. Thales points out that Eclipse jammers are currently in service with the armed forces of several other undisclosed nations, including NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organisation) members and other allies, and are set to equip a number of vehicle types to be used by the French Army including the force’s forthcoming Renault/Nexter/Thales Griffon and Jaguar armoured vehicles expected to enter service towards the end of this decade.

Eclipse’s handheld and wearable counterpart is the Storm-H which can generate more than one watt of jamming power and can operate for more than four hours continuously on a single battery charge. The Storm-H system provides wide continuous coverage of the Very High Frequency (30 to 300MHz) band, and the upper and lower GSM (Global System for Mobile) communications bands. GSM frequency bands, mandated by the International Telecommunications Union, the United Nations organisation which supervises the radio spectrum, typically cover an Ultra High Frequency range of 300MHz to three gigahertz. Civilian cellphones use GSM bands, and such devices have been used as RF detonators for IEDs. The frequency coverage provided by the Storm-H also includes those used by Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications (DECT) systems, in laymen’s terms, civilian cordless telephones, wi-fi networks typically using frequencies of 2.4GHz to five gigahertz, and the Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM) bands. ISM bands are used for non-telecommunications applications such as medical diathermy machines. The wideband Storm-H covers the 20MHz to 470MHz band; meanwhile the Storm-H (2G/DECT) inhibits second generation mobile and cordless phones being used as RF detonators, while Storm 3G covers third generation mobile phones. There is no specific mention made by Thales of the capacity to jam fourth-generation Long Term Evolution (LTE) cellphone standards, but these are not technologically distinct from 3G as they use the same GSM frequency spread; they just defined improvements to its data rates. In terms of frequency bands, the Storm-H version covers short-range, low-power RF devices operating in 200-470MHz, the Storm-H 2G/DETC covering DETC and second-generation cellphones with the Storm-3G covering third-generation cellphones. All Storm-H family members can be handheld or worn. The company added that it sees “counter RCIED electronic protection vehicle-mounted solutions evolving to cope with a wider range of threats such as direct fire weapons or mini-UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles through the integration of new technologies for) gunshot detection, spectrum sensing or direct energy weapons, to ultimately become a land platform self-protection suite with enhanced electronic protection and attack.”

Airbus MRJ

With its ‘smart’ Multi-Role Jammer (MRJ), Airbus is developing a system that can take on the RCIED threat in addition to more general tactical communications jamming roles and even counter-UAV missions, potentially replacing several separate pieces of equipment. Revealed one year ago, the system is under contract with an unnamed customer and is being integrated to this end in its VPJ-R6 vehicle protection jammer variant, in a package compact enough for installation on a civilian four-wheel drive. In this form, the MRJ was at Technology Readiness Level (TRL) Eight in late 2015 according to Airbus specialists who responded to the author’s questions. TRL levels are used by the United States Department of Defence to measure technological maturity. TRL-8 means that the system’s development is complete and it has been qualified. Large-scale shelter-based and compact airborne variants are also in the pipeline. At heart, the MRJ is an SDR. This means the system is able to grow in capability as new jamming waveforms are developed as software applications. For example, the ability for MRJs to communicate between themselves to coordinate their responses to threats is already in preparation, Airbus specialists told AMR, with the next step being communication between the jammers and other sophisticated SDRs. This may enable the jammers to communicate between themselves and with SDRs to show threat information on a vehicle battle management system. According to sources at Airbus, this capability is likely to be available in perhaps three to five years. “However, the dynamics of threat and countermeasure are particularly speedy in this area, so armed forces and industry need to be particularly agile,” the sources said.

The MRJ is considered a smart reactive jammer, with reaction times to threat signals of significantly less than a millisecond and the ability to focus its jamming energy on the specific threat frequency rather than spreading it over a broader frequency range. A key enabler here is its spectrum sensing, where the equipment can listen for threats and also for friendly users of the spectrum, which puts it on the road that leads towards the artificially intelligent realm of cognitive radio. “A full-blown cognitive jammer would be able to autonomously adapt to any threat environment,” the company told AMR. A cognitive jammer would apply artificial intelligence techniques to detect, analyse and counter in real time threats that it had not encountered before. “Such a system is currently under development as an extension to our multirole jammers.” Asked when a truly cognitive system might be ready, a company said that it envisages such a capability in five to eight years.

Protecting Comms

Preventing jammers from interfering with friendly radio communications is an important task. At one end of the scale, simple fixed-frequency filters applied to broadband jammers leave a selected narrow frequency range unjammed. “The problem with those is that they are very bulky and they also only work on a fixed frequency band,” said Chris Reith, managing director of the Harris facility in Basingstoke, England in a recent interview. “So you are limiting your radio’s capabilities by only operating on a very narrow band. Also it opens the communications up to certain techniques that could be used to jam it, intercept it or geolocate it (as the radio’s frequency-hopping capabilities by nature cannot continue).” Harris has developed an alternative approach embodied in its Integrated Protection and Transmission System (IPROTXS) which, said Mr. Reith, allows the operator to use all the ECCM (Electronic Counter-Counter Measures) capabilities inherent in their radio while still using their jammer. The IPROTXS approach “works between the radio and the jammer to allow communications to go out in very small bits and pieces that are undetectable and do not impact the jammer.”

With an IPROTXS module connected to the jammer and a smaller IPROTXS Lite module connected to each radio comprising the friendly radio network, the system enables the jammer and the radios to talk to each other to negotiate slots in which the radios can operate freely through the jamming. Dismounted soldiers, for example, would have IPROTXS Lite module, which are about the size of a cigarette packet, connected to their radios. A vehicle IPROTXS installation is about the same size as the vehicle’s radio and would typically fit above it in the radio rack. With four different settings it allows the operator to run multiple radios including VHF, UHF and both civilian and military TETRA (Terrestrial Trunked Radio) communications. “You can set (IPROTXS) up to run across all four of those setting, so you would switch between them and allow your radios to operate in those environments (where jamming is being performed).” The jamming systems IRPOTXS would work with include Exelis’ own EGON active/reactive CIED jammer that draws on the firm’s proven MMBJ-2.1 CIED system. It is unknown if this latter system is in service.

Planned arbitration

L-3 TRL Technology’s director of business development and strategy Mark Minall argues that it is not always possible to provide direct links between jammers and radios. He told the author that operators need to understand the frequencies they need to communicate on and those used by adversaries that are targets for electronic attack or defensive jamming for force protection. This requires pre-planned communications arbitration. “When you look at your battle plan for communications … ECM (Electronic Counter Measures) and electronic warfare … have to be a consideration right at the beginning of the communications planning,” he said. “If you don’t get that right you are in trouble.”

The company’s family of Broadshield jammers can take on both CIED and electronic attack role, the latter being directed against tactical radios, and are designed with communications arbitration in mind. They are also designed to pack in more capability while minimising their size, weight and power consumption in both vehicle-mounted and man-pack variants. The Broadshield Modular Countermeasures Suite (MCS) man-pack, for example, can operate in either active or reactive modes in both low band (20-520 MHz) and high band (420MHz to six gigahertz) ranges and can be quickly reprogrammed in the field to optimise its jamming capability, target frequencies and operating parameters, says the company.

The Broadshield Lightweight Countermeasures Suite (LCS) provides a subset of the Broadshield MCS capabilities over the same frequency ranges in the form of a more compact active jammer weighing less than two kilograms (4.4 pounds), excluding battery and antennae. For vehicles that need a lot of RF jamming power but with limited space, the company offers the Broadshield High-power Compact System (HCS), another active/reactive jammer that can be configured into a stack of up to three interoperable units, according to the company, each providing 50 Watts of reactive or active jamming and an additional ten watts of active capability. Each module can be re-roled for dismounted use, adding flexibility to the overall solution. All the Broadshield family use common laptop-based programming. “(The company) has recognised that its force protection expertise and its electronic attack expertise hitherto have been on separate Broadshield ranges,” said Mark Minall: “We have now brought both of those together into one platform with a firmware change.”

Israeli Options

Looking towards Israel, Elbit is well known for its Electronic Jammers Against Bombs (EJAB) family, which is available in vehicle-mounted, portable and man-pack forms. Elbit launched the new Miniature Reactive Jammer (MRJ) family in 2013 and this June announced its intention to highlight the man-pack variant at the Eurosatory Exhibition in Paris the same month. This active/reactive system has been developed for the kinds of missions usually given to special forces or other types of penetration forces, says the company, and features a set frequency range that covers low-band, cellular and high-band threats and enables multiple jammers to operate simultaneously without mutual interference. In service with Israeli forces, the MRJ man-pack will operate for 3.5 hours on a single battery charge, the company states.

Recognising that so single sensor or countermeasure can defeat all types of IED and mine threat, IAI Elta offers the ELI-3375 Counter-IED and Counter Mine Suite (CIMS), whose mission management system integrates multiple sensors grouped into above-surface and below-ground subsystems to detect surface and underground IEDs. The Above-surface Detection System (ADS) includes the Surface IED Detection Radar (SIDER), the GigaPix Optical Detection System (GPODS) and the infrared IED investigator with overlapping coverage to detect threats in front or to the sides of the vehicle. Underground threats are addressed by the Mine and IED Detection System (MIDS), which combines a metal detector and a Ground Penetrating Radar. The company shows the ADS mounted on the roof of a four-wheel drive vehicle, with the MIDS carried low to the ground on a frame in front of it, although the company emphasises that it can also be deployed on unmanned ground vehicles. The CIMS is being marketed to the Indian armed forces and is to be evaluated by the US Army, the service’s Contracting Command announced on 13 April.

Once detected, IEDs can be neutralised remotely with weapons such as Rafael’s Thor, which adds a two kilowatt laser to a Mini-Samson Remote Control Weapon System (RCWS) already armed with a heavy machine gun. Using optics to acquire or re-acquire the suspected IED, the laser can then burn off camouflage material to confirm operator’s suspicions and then destroy the explosive charge through deflagration (rapid, non-explosive burning) or low-order detonation. Alternatively, Thor can also neutralise the device by cutting the command wire or detonating cord. Needing no downtime for cooling or recharging, the water-cooled laser can be fired continuously, says the company. The gun can also be used as a disruptor as well as to defend the vehicle carrying the Thor.

Together, using smart and, in the future cognitive, jammers and kinetic sensor-controlled weapons to neutralise IEDs, such capabilities promise to provide greater survivability for vehicles than ever before. IED attack is unlikely to disappear from the battlefield, but protective technologies are here to stay.

Big Surveillance for Small Platforms - Asian Military Review,"Mon, 11 Sep 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFzaWFubWlsaXRhcnlyZXZpZXcuY29tLzIwMTcvMDkvYmlnLXN1cnZlaWxsYW5jZS1mb3Itc21hbGwtcGxhdGZvcm1zL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The high performance found in naval surveillance radars equipping large surface combatant is migrating to smaller surface vessels of corvette and Offshore Patrol Vessel (OPV) size, bringing ever-increasing levels of capability.

The Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN) will outfit its forthcoming ‘Independence’ class Littoral Mission Vessels (LMVs) with Kelvin Hughes’ SharpEye navigation radar, as announced by the firm in early August. The RSN is acquiring a total of eight ‘Independence’ class corvettes which are replacing its erstwhile ‘Fearless’ class ships. Each ‘Independence’ class ship—the eponymous vessel was commissioned this May—will be outfitted with Kelvin Hughes’ X-band (8.5-10.68 Gigahertz/GHz) version of its SharpEye naval radar. The selection of this radar is not surprising: Surface combatants of corvette size and below, namely warships displacing under 3000 tonnes, including Offshore Patrol Vessels (OPVs), both in the Asia-Pacific and beyond, are receiving progressively more capable naval surveillance radars.

What are the reasons for this trend? Navies around the world are increasingly being called upon to ensure the safety and security of their littorals. The Asia-Pacific has a notable example in this vis-à-vis the People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) so-called Nine Dash Line which denotes the country’s maritime and territorial claims in the South China Sea. The subject of intense controversy in the Asia-Pacific region, the Nine Dash Line arguably overlaps into several Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) which are prescribed by the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea and allow a state to exploit the waters up to 200 nautical miles/nm (107.9 kilometres/km) from its coastline. The EEZs of several nations, including the Philippines and parts of Malaysia, are covered by the PRC’s Nine Dash Line. Therefore, the littorals of such nations can become contested, as recent events in the South China Sea have illustrated. In one incident in May 2015, Chinese vessels and Vietnam People’s Navy (VPN) ships clashed in the South China Sea following the positioning of the PRC’s Haiyang Shiyou 981 oil platform in the vicinity of the Paracel Islands, an archipelago in the South China Sea, controlled by the PRC but claimed by Taiwan and Vietnam. On this occasion, the clashes between the VPN and the PRC ships accompanying the oil rig were confined to ramming and the use of high-pressure water hoses against each ship, but such incidents do little to cool tempers in this increasingly volatile stretch of water.

Getting Smaller

The lesson of the May 2015 confrontation is the importance of maritime situational awareness for the vessels which routinely patrol such contested waters. Advances in the miniaturisation of electronics, principally following Moore’s Law which states that the number of transistors that can outfit an individual ship doubles every two years, have enabled the size of electronic circuits to progressively reduce. The consequence of this for radar design is that circuitry reduces in size, which enables comparatively more functionality in radars designed for small vessels than might have been possible a decade ago. For naval vessels, this increase in functionality provides OPVs and corvettes with good resolution regarding the surface and air targets they are able to detect and track. Previous to the introduction of naval surveillance radar such as Cassidian/Airbus’ TRS-3D in the 1990s, powerful naval surveillance radars capable of providing a detailed air and maritime picture tended to be the preserve of large combatants such as the US Navy’s ‘Arleigh Burke’ class destroyers and ‘Ticonderoga’ class cruisers. These ships had the required space to accommodate the large antennae and electronics cabinets that radars such as Lockheed Martin’s AN/SPY-1B/D S-band (2.3-2.5/2.7-3.7GHz) product, which weighs 83 tonnes when including its antennae and electronics, require. Smaller OPV/Corvette sized combatants may not be able to perform complex missions such as ballistic missile defence or fleet air defence with their radars despite their sophistication. This is because they may be unable to safely accommodate large antennae without endangering seakeeping, and to generate the required electrical power levels. For example, the AN/SPY-1B/D typically generates a peak power of four to six megawatts, due to power plant limitations (broadly speaking, the more radio frequency energy a radar transmits, the greater its detection range), nevertheless they can provide a detailed view of the air and maritime situation in the ship’s locale.

Requirements

Radars optimised for comparatively small naval combatants have several requirements such as a significant elevation coverage of up to 90 degrees from the antenna, Airbus told AMR via a written statement. This ensures that as much of the sky as possible can be watched by the radar. The need to detect very small objects that may have a Radar Cross Section of under 0.1 square metres (one square foot) is also an imperative while, at the same time, being able to discern such targets against ‘clutter’—the ‘noise’ which can be detected by a radar, such as wave crests into which smaller targets such as jet skis or a submarine periscope can hide—plus the need to detect and track small and fast targets such as surface-skimming anti-ship missiles, Airbus’ statement continued.

For small combatants, all of these capabilities must be housed on a radar small enough to outfit the vessel. Spike Hughes, sales and marketing manager at Kelvin Hughes, notes the importance of low RCS target detection: “Small target detection in radar terms means low RCS targets such as RHIBs (Rigid Hull Inflatable Boats), wooden boats and jet skis fall into this category, which may be fast moving or very slow moving.” Mr. Hughes also states that versatility in terms of roles is important: “A naval surveillance radar has to provide a number of roles now, firstly navigation, then safety at sea, i.e. collision avoidance, and a surveillance role to provide security through detection of asymmetric threats which may pose a threat to the ship or be operating illegally.” Such asymmetric threats can encompass everything, from water-borne insurgents to narcotics traffickers using small boats to transport their products.

Alongside Singapore, the SharpEye radar has been procured by the Tentera Laut DiRaja Malaysia (TLDM/Royal Malaysian Navy) for its Second Generation Patrol Vessels (also known as the Littoral Combat Ship) of which the navy is expected to acquire six, with deliveries of the ships concluding in 2020. The SharpEye radars, two of which (one X-band and one S-band) will equip each vessel, will be joined by a single Thales Smart-S Mk.2 S-band naval surveillance radar which has a detection range of 130 nautical miles/nm (150 kilometres/km) and the ability to track 500 air and surface targets. Augmenting Thales’ radar product family for small combatants is its NS-100. This radar uses an Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) antenna (see below), which has the asset of reducing the amount of space that such a radar absorbs on a warship. According to a statement supplied to AMR by Thales, “(The) NS-100 is a radar with limited required footprint. This results in fast and simple on-board installation, also on ships with limited available space.” This S-band radar, which has a range of 107.9nm (200 km) provides 70 degrees of elevation coverage. The radar also comes equipped with Automatic Identification System (AIS) and Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) interrogators. AIS is mandated by the International Maritime Organisation’s International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea which requires all vessels displacing in excess of 300 tonnes to carry a Very High Frequency (30 to 300 Megahertz) transponder which transmits details of their identity, position, course and speed. ADS-B, meanwhile, forms one part of the US Next Generation Air Transportation System air traffic management infrastructure which has developed surveillance technology that is being increasingly adopted around the world to provide civilian aircraft identification using satellite navigation, with the radar able to detect the Ultra High Frequency (300MHz to three gigahertz) transmissions made by an aircraft’s ADS-B transponder.

Beyond Thales and Kelvin Hughes, the provision of naval surveillance radar to comparatively small surface combatants is the preserve of several companies such as Denmark’s Terma which has outfitted vessels such as the Royal Navy’s ‘River’ class OPVs with its SCANTER-4103 X-band (8.5-10.68GHz) product. The firm was selected by the United Kingdom Ministry of Defence to this end in December 2014, and deliveries of the radar to equip the vessels, four of which have been commissioned, a fifth is under construction, and two have been ordered with radar deliveries commencing this year. Providing target detection to a range of 90nm (167km), the SCANTER-4103 provides detection and tracking of up to 500 surface and 100 air targets simultaneously. In terms of customers in the Asia-Pacific, the SCANTER-4103 equips the Tentara Nasional Indonesia-Angkatan Laut (Indonesian Navy) ‘Fatahillah’ class corvette, and a single ‘Darussalam’ class corvette of the Tentera Laut Diraja Brunei (Royal Brunei Navy).

US Markets

European manufacturers are also enjoying success in new markets, notably the United States, which had always been hard for non-US companies to penetrate. Airbus’ TRS-3D radar has been selected for the United States Navy’s ‘Freedom’ class Littoral Combat Ships. With a surveillance range of up to 97nm (150km), this C-band (5.25-5.925GHz) radar is available in two variants with 16 (TRS-3D/16) and 32 (TRS-3D/32) radiating elements mounted on the radar’s antenna. Alongside the TRS-3D, known in US Navy service as the AN/APS-75, some of the vessels in the ‘Freedom’ class, notably the latter vessels from the ninth example (USS Indianapolis, plus four additional vessels on order), will receive the improved Airbus TRS-4D radar which, like the TRS-3D family, is a C-band radar. Principle differences between the TRS-3D and TRS-4D include the longer detection range of the latter, which extends to 135nm (250km) and its ability to detect and track around 1000 air and surface targets.

An Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar outfits the TRS-4D, which encloses a multitude of Transmit/Receive (T/R) modules on the antenna. Each T/R module effectively acts as its own miniature radar generating, transmitting and processing its own RF pulse. AESA technology allows the radar to be rapidly switched between tasks such as air and ground surveillance, which enables so-called ‘graceful degradation’ (the failure of one T/R module will not render the radar unserviceable). The flexibility inherent in the AESA design enables the TRS-4D to be used for tasks such as fire control for the vessel’s armament, and for helicopter navigation. The TRS-4D is available with both a rotating antenna which equips the ‘Freedom’ class ships, and a flat panel design which outfits the ‘Baden-Württemberg’ class frigates for the Deutsche Marine(German Navy), two of which have been launched from a total class size of four vessels. Airbus told the author in 2015 that there are currently no US Navy plans to retrofit the TRS-4D onto the first eight ships of the ‘Freedom’ class which received the TRS-3D.

The US Navy LCS family includes the ‘Independence’ class design alongside the ‘Freedom’ class. Like its sibling, it is outfitted with a naval surveillance radar of European origin, in this instance Saab’s Sea Giraffe AMB C-band naval surveillance radar. Capable of providing 97nm (180km) of surveillance range, the radar can track up to 200 air, and 400 surface targets. Known in the US by its AN/SPS-77 nomenclature, ten of the radars have been delivered to Austral, the ‘Independence’ class’ shipbuilder. Additional deliveries of three radars are expected to follow for the same number of additional ships which have been ordered by the US Navy as of April 2015. Also optimised for relatively small sized vessels is Saab’s Sea Giraffe-1X radar. Launched in May 2014, this radar has a range of 54nm (100km) and can monitor up to 100 air and 200 surface targets. The Sea Giraffe-1X is thought to be awaiting customers.

Like its TRS-4D counterpart, Israel Aerospace Industries’ ELTA Systems division has employed AESA architecture for its MF-STAR (Multi-Function Surveillance Track and Guidance Radar) comprising two family members, the S-band EL/M-2248 with a published range of 135nm (250km), and the EL/M-2258 ALPHA (Advanced Lightweight Phased Array) which has a range of 65nm (120.3km) and uses a phased array design as opposed to AESA architecture. In the latter, the radar’s RF energy is generated as one source, as opposed to by each T/R module as with an AESA, and is then fed into individual emitters mounted on the antenna. This enables the RF transmissions which fan out from the individual emitters to be ‘steered’ using a process of constructive interference. This process is akin to that by which two magnets of the same polarity repel each other; in that RF transmissions can be fed into the individual elements mounted on the antenna at different phases of oscillation which is sufficient to force the movement of the RF transmissions in particular directions. Phased array radars have advantages as when the antenna stops rotating, the RF transmissions can still be steered to allow the radar to widen its field of view rather than only looking directly in front of the antenna’s field-of-view. Moreover, as these radars do not require a large number of T/R modules, they can be comparatively less expensive than AESA radars to procure. That said, they can only transmit on a single frequency at any one time, unlike the T/R modules on an AESA radar which can transmit on different frequencies) which can render phased array radars more susceptible to jamming.

The EL/M-2258 equips the Israeli Navy’s eight ‘Sa’ar 4.5’ class missile boats. Although the EL/M-2148 is typically designed for vessels which displace in excess of 2000 tonnes, Gil Roth, IAI ELTA’s director of naval systems, says that the radar is scalable and can outfit ships displacing between 1600 and 2000 tonnes. This can be achieved using a smaller antenna or a flat panel design in which several panels can be combined together to provide 360 degrees surveillance. Mr. Roth adds that while the radar’s detection range may reduce with a smaller sized antenna, its processing power remains unchanged.

Finally, the IAI stable also includes the EL/M-2222S Nav-Guard radar launched in 2014. Employing four AESA antennae, the radar has a four nautical mile (seven kilometres) range and is primarily designed to provide short-range defence for a warship and can be teamed self defence systems such as Rheinmetall’s MASS (Multi-Ammunition Soft-Kill System) which deploys chaff, flares and ultraviolet countermeasures against radar and infrared guided anti-ship missiles.

Sophistication

The technology for naval surveillance radars is in a condition of continual evolution. Mr. Hughes says that a major challenge for current radar designers is the ability to detect and track Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). While naval surveillance radars are traditionally optimised for detecting conventional aircraft such as helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft, UAVs present their own challenges. Such aircraft can be small, may be constructed from radar-absorbent materials such as carbon fibre or plastic, and thus be comparatively harder to detect yet, at the same time, they are proliferating. Ensuring that naval surveillance radars will be able to remain abreast of emerging threats such as these in the future will be helped in no small part by the software-defined nature of their architecture. Instead of requiring the hardware of a radar to be changed to detect emerging threats, altering the algorithms that are used to process the radar’s reflected transmissions will be sufficient. As the Thales statement notes, changing the software of a radar, alongside the use of modular components for hardware, allow physical elements of the radar to be changed using a ‘building block’ approach. This should make radars easier and less expensive for users to modify as and when new threats become apparent.

Thales aims new rifle at NATO forces - CONTACT magazine,"Tue, 12 Sep 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbnRhY3RhaXJsYW5kYW5kc2VhLmNvbS8yMDE3LzA5LzEyL3RoYWxlcy1haW1zLW5ldy1yaWZsZS1hdC1uYXRvL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales Australia is introducing another new rifle – the F90MBR (modular bullpup rifle) – at a major Defence exhibition in London this week.

F90 is Thales’ export name for the EF88 (Enhanced F88) currently rolling out with the Australian Defence Force and the F90MBR is squarely aimed at NATO sales.



See Australia’s new EF88 in action (above) or read what soldiers really think about it here.

Thales says the F90MBR is one of the lightest assault rifles on the market at just 3.25kg, and is fitted with ambidextrous controls to enable fast reaction times and rapid target engagement.

Features include availability in multiple barrel lengths, fully-ambidextrous forward bolt and magazine release controls, and a ‘drop free’ magazine release function to facilitate even faster magazine changes, regardless of the hand-dominance of the firer.

F90MBR safely accommodates off-handed shooting techniques through the use of a case deflector, and can be easily modified by the operator without tools to a dedicated left- or right-handed ejecting weapon.

The weapon’s open architecture incorporates a NATO tri-rail system and magazine compatibility to ensure interoperability with existing NATO weapons.

It is able to be packaged with multiple barrels, and compatible optics, accessories and ancillaries with Grab Case, allowing an operator to quickly transition between different tactical employments of the weapon system.

‘Over-the-beach’ capability means it is well suited for use by amphibious forces. Soldiers can swim with the weapon, and fire immediately after emerging from the water.

CEO Thales Australia Chris Jenkins said the F90MBR was the result of the company’s ambition to support soldiers on operations.

“We’ve made long-term investment in an advanced weapons manufacturing capability in Australia, and this is reinforced by over 100 years of weapons engineering and leading design expertise at our facility in Lithgow,” he said.

“The F90MBR is a weapon ideally suited to the modern integrated solider – light, compact and adaptable, its compatibility with existing NATO weapons and ammunition offers a cost-effective upgrade with a substantial degree of future-proofing.

“The new generation weapon is evolved from a reliable, battle-proven platform in the F90 Assault Rifle, unsurpassed for its high levels of accuracy and reliability.

“Both the F90 and F90MBR enable the soldier to reach up to 600m accurately and with ease.

“Proven world-class reliability ensures a war fighter can have absolute confidence in his weapon in the most demanding environmental conditions, whether that be the sands of the desert, the humidity of the jungle or in extreme cold.”

QinetiQ's AS3 COMINT system ready to fly on Watchkeeper - UK Defence Journal,"Tue, 12 Sep 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vdWtkZWZlbmNlam91cm5hbC5vcmcudWsvcWluZXRpcXMtYXMzLWNvbWludC1zeXN0ZW0tcmVhZHktZmx5LXdhdGNoa2VlcGVyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"QinetiQ’s AS3 communications intelligence (COMINT) system is ready to fly as a payload on Thales’s Watchkeeper unmanned aerial vehicle.

Part of QinetiQ’s ASX family, AS3 is designed specifically for UAVs and small manned platforms. It enables the operator to detect signals from military communications devices and then locate, identify and listen to the individuals using them.

Fitted to Watchkeeper, AS3 is designed to increase the UAV’s sensor footprint and enable it to work with ground-based systems, such as QinetiQ’s MEWS, to locate military communications with greater precision. The company say it allows the platform to undertake communications intelligence missions that would normally be carried out by larger more strategic platforms, such as multi-engine business jets.

AS3’s integration into Watchkeeper is the culmination of a jointly funded collaborative project between Thales and QinetiQ, with its roots in a contract with Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl). The achievement follows a rigorous programme of engineering and safety case activity, which saw QinetiQ design, test and manufacture a bespoke chassis to hold the AS3 payload in place.

Ian Fuller, Campaign Lead for Airborne Surveillance in QinetiQ said:

“We are proud to be working with Thales to increase Watchkeeper’s potency as a world-leading intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition, and reconnaissance (ISTAR) solution.

Having combined our technologies and expertise to enhance the platform, we look forward to demonstrating the new capability in its first flight trials. By ensuring vital intelligence can be gathered, analysed and distributed securely, we deliver proven advantage to customers.”

Mark Stead, Director for Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance at Thales in the UK, said:

“We are very pleased to be working with QinetiQ to demonstrate the flexibility and modularity of the Thales Watchkeeper Unmanned Aircraft System.

Achieving such interoperability and positive results is a testament to the joint collaboration and respective expertise. We look forward to flight trials of the joint capability in the near future to demonstrate this additional utility it brings to unmanned intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition, and reconnaissance (ISTAR).”

The AS3 payload will appear on the QinetiQ stand, S2-550, at Defence and Security Equipment International (DSEI), from 12 to 15 September 2017. At the Thales stand, S6-110, the software will be displayed on the Watchkeeper console."
Improved F90 Modular Bullpup Rifle Officially Launched by Thales - - The Firearm Blog,"Thu, 14 Sep 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZpcmVhcm1ibG9nLmNvbS9ibG9nLzIwMTcvMDkvMTQvaW1wcm92ZWQtZjkwLW1vZHVsYXItYnVsbHB1cC1yaWZsZS1vZmZpY2lhbGx5LWxhdW5jaGVkLXRoYWxlcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales Australia has launched the newest update to its F90 bullpup assault rifle, at DSEI 2017. The weapon, which is the pre-production version of the prototype F90 Export shown off at IDEX 2017, sports a host of improved features versus both the legacy AUG and the F90. Thales released a press release describing the rifle, just prior to DSEI.

There have been some changes to the rifle since we saw the prototype that at IDEX. Perhaps most prominently, gone are the bolted-together receiver halves, replaced by the more traditional seamless vibration welding shared with the rest of the AUG family. A longer barrel, new flash hider with thread protector (presumably removable for mounting a suppressor) complete the visible changes from the IDEX prototypes. Thales advertises the F90MBR as a lightweight, modular weapon, featuring multiple barrel lengths, 3.25 kg (7.17 lb) weight, and “over the beach” capability. Interestingly, the company’s brochure on the weapon emphasizes a 600 meter effective range, as well. For left-handed shooters, the F90MBR includes an enlarged shell deflector to allow shooting from the left shoulder, even if the right-hand kit is installed (a left hand ejection kit is available for the rifle).

Eric Graves of Soldier Systems Daily reports Thales representatives assured him that the F90MBR’s feed ramps featured fully compatibility with the US Army’s new M855A1 round, which sports a hardened steel tip that can prematurely wear out some receiver designs. The F90MBR features a full steel trunnion/feed ramp design, so this does not surprise me."
