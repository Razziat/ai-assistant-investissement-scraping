French MoD challenge: Thales Performs a Successful Sovereign AI Hack and Presents Enhanced Security Solutions ... - Yahoo Finance,"Thu, 23 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9mcmVuY2gtbW9kLWNoYWxsZW5nZS10aGFsZXMtcGVyZm9ybXMtMTYwMDAwMTI3Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Friendly Hackers team from Thales, a world leader in data protection and cybersecurity, won the CAID 1 challenge organised by the French Ministry of Defence during the fifth edition of European Cyber Week in France, from November 21 to November 23 2023.

The challenge, first of its kind to be organised by the French Ministry of Defence, was designed to evaluate the extent to which teams of hackers could exploit certain intrinsic vulnerabilities of AI models.

Thales's work on AI security and trust is aligned with the requirements of both the defence community and civilian organisations such as critical infrastructure providers, which all face the same challenges of protecting their training datasets and intellectual property and guaranteeing that AI-generated results can be trusted for critical decision-making.

MEUDON, France, November 23, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The French Ministry of Defence's AI security challenge

This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20231123072562/en/

@Thales

Participants in the CAID challenge had to perform two tasks:

1. In a given set of images, determine which images were used to train the AI algorithm and which were used for the test.

An AI-based image recognition application learns from large numbers of training images. By studying the inner workings of the AI model, Thales' Friendly Hackers team successfully determined which images had been used to create the application, gaining valuable information about the training methods used and the quality of the model.

2. Find all the sensitive images of aircrafts used by a sovereign AI algorithm that had been protected using ""unlearning"" techniques.

An ""unlearning"" technique consists in deleting the data used to train a model, such as images, in order to preserve their confidentiality. This technique can be used, for example, to protect the sovereignty of an algorithm in the event of its export, theft or loss. Take the example of a drone equipped with AI: it must be able to recognize any enemy aircraft as a potential threat; on the other hand, the model of the aircraft from its own army would have to be learned to be identified as friendly, and then would have to be erased by a technique known as unlearning. In this way, even if the drone were to be stolen or lost, the sensitive aircraft data contained in the AI model could not be extracted for malicious purposes. However, the Friendly Hackers team from Thales managed to re-identify the data that was supposed to have been erased from the model, thereby overriding the unlearning process. Exercises like this help to assess the vulnerability of training data and trained models, which are valuable tools and can deliver outstanding performance but also represent new attack vectors for the armed forces. An attack on training data or trained models could have catastrophic consequences in a military context, where this type of information could give an adversary the upper hand. Risks include model theft, theft of the data used to recognise military hardware or other features in a theatre of operations, and injection of malware and backdoors to impair the operation of the system using the AI. While AI in general, and generative AI in particular, offers significant operational benefits and provides military personnel with intensively trained decision support tools to reduce their cognitive burden, the national defence community needs to address new threats to this technology as a matter of priority.

The Thales BattleBox approach to tackle AI vulnerabilities

The protection of training data and trained models is critical in the defence sector. AI cybersecurity is becoming more and more crucial, and needs to be autonomous to thwart the many new opportunities that the world of AI is opening up to malicious actors. Responding to the risks and threats involved in the use of artificial intelligence, Thales has developed a set of countermeasures called the BattleBox to provide enhanced protection against potential breaches.

BattleBox Training provides protection from training-data poisoning, preventing hackers from introducing a backdoor. BattleBox IP digitally watermarks the AI model to guarantee authenticity and reliability. BattleBox Evade aims to protect models from prompt injection attacks, which can manipulate prompts to bypass the safety measures of chatbots using Large Language Models (LLMs), and to counter adversarial attacks on images, such as adding a patch to deceive the detection process in a classification model. BattleBox Privacy provides a framework for training machine learning algorithms, using advanced cryptography and secure secret-sharing protocols to guarantee high levels of confidentiality.

To prevent AI hacking in the case of CAID challenge tasks, countermeasures such as encryption of the AI model could be one of the solutions to be implemented.

""AI provides considerable operational benefits, but it requires high levels of security and cybersecurity protection to prevent data breaches and misuse. Thales implements a large range of AI-based solutions for all types of civil and military use cases. They are explainable, embeddable and integrated with robust critical systems, they are also designed to be sovereign, frugal and reliable thanks to the advanced methods and tools used for qualification and validation. Thales has the dual AI and line-of-business expertise needed to incorporate these solutions into its systems and significantly improve their operational capabilities,"" said David Sadek, Thales VP Research, Technology & Innovation in charge of Artificial Intelligence.

Thales and AI

Over the last four years, Thales has developed the technical capabilities needed to test the security of AI algorithms and neural network architectures, detect vulnerabilities and propose effective countermeasures. Thales's Friendly Hackers team based at the ThereSIS laboratory at Palaiseau was one of about a dozen teams taking part in the AI challenge, and achieved first place on both tasks.

The Thales ITSEF (Information Technology Security Evaluation Facility) is accredited by the French National Cybersecurity Agency (ANSSI) to conduct pre-certification security evaluations. During European Cyber Week, the ITSEF team also presented the first project of its kind in the world aimed at compromising the decisions of an embedded AI by exploiting the electromagnetic radiation of its processor.

Thales's cybersecurity consulting and audit teams make these tools and methodologies available to customers wishing to develop their own AI models or establish a framework for the use and training of commercial models.

As the Group's defence and security businesses address critical requirements, often with safety-of-life implications, Thales has developed an ethical and scientific framework for the development of trusted AI based on the four strategic pillars of validity, security, explainability and responsibility. Thales solutions combine the know-how of over 300 senior AI experts and more than 4,500 cybersecurity specialists with the operational expertise of the Group's aerospace, land defence, naval defence, space and other defence and security businesses.

Thales to Supply Five Ground Radars to Danish Air Force - The Defense Post,"Fri, 03 Nov 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRlZmVuc2Vwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzExLzAzL2Rlbm1hcmstZml2ZS1ncm91bmQtcmFkYXJzLXRoYWxlcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales to Supply Five Ground Radars to Danish Air Force

Thales has signed a contract to deliver land-based military radars for the Danish Air Force.

The agreement covers the supply of five Ground Master 200 Multi-Mission Compact (GM200 MM/C) radar platforms developed by Thales Netherlands.

These systems were ordered to support the air force’s defense and surveillance missions, retaining the service’s airborne operability, situational awareness, weapon tracking, and fire support capabilities.

The contract follows an announcement by Denmark last April seeking to enhance tactical sensor assets in the North Atlantic by integrating advanced technologies in the Faroe Islands.

Security over the region will also cover the airspace of neighboring countries, including Norway, Iceland, and the UK.

Thales’ GM200 MM/C Radar

Part of Thales’s Ground Master 200 family of radars, the GM200 MM/C is specialized for modern warfare missions.

The radar offers an improved timeline for users to gather as much data as possible from incoming adversaries through an advanced four-dimensional active electronically scanned array that can simultaneously detect entities at all positions without moving its components.

By employing the GM200 MM/C, operators can obtain automated classification and pathway tracking over aircraft, helicopters, multiple aerial drones, and projectile weapons.

“I am very happy that we are now acquiring new, mobile radars for airspace surveillance,” Danish Defence Acquisition and Logistics Chief Lt. Gen. Kim Jesper Jørgensen stated.

“This is an advanced capability that the Armed Forces badly need, not least in light of the current serious political security situation.”

Common Radar Configurations

Netherlands defense procurement agency COMMIT Commander Vice Admr. Jan Willem Hartman explained how the new radars can impact cooperation between the Danish and Dutch militaries.

“The acquisition of the GM200 MM/C is an example of how allies can help each other in strengthening their defence forces by interoperable materiel,” Hart said.

“In addition, it is an advantage that both Denmark and the Netherlands have identical configurations of the GM200 MM/C, which enables cooperation for identical future updates and support.”"
Galileo Second Generation satellite aces first hardware tests - European Space Agency,"Thu, 16 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzYS5pbnQvQXBwbGljYXRpb25zL1NhdGVsbGl0ZV9uYXZpZ2F0aW9uL0dhbGlsZW8vR2FsaWxlb19TZWNvbmRfR2VuZXJhdGlvbl9zYXRlbGxpdGVfYWNlc19maXJzdF9oYXJkd2FyZV90ZXN0c9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Applications Galileo Second Generation satellite aces first hardware tests 16/11/2023 5935 views 78 likes

The new Galileo satellite model from Thales Alenia Space underwent mechanical and signal performance testing this summer at ESA’s ESTEC Test Centre. Structural models resisted launch-like noise and vibrations while an electrical model proved its ability to send Galileo signals - a major milestone in the development of Galileo’s Second Generation.

G2 satellite model arrives at ESTEC Europe’s Galileo is the world’s most precise satellite navigation system, providing metre-level accuracy to more than four billion users worldwide. It currently comprises 28 satellites in orbit and 10 more are due to be launched, after which a new generation of satellites, the Galileo Second Generation or G2, will revolutionise the fleet with enhanced capabilities. “G2 satellites will be much larger than those of the First Generation, use electric propulsion, host a more powerful navigation antenna, carry more and even better atomic clocks on board and have fully digital payloads,” explains ESA's Galileo Second Generation Project Manager Miguel Manteiga Bautista. “The modular architecture will offer a high degree of flexibility to accommodate more equipment and inter-satellite links will be enabled,” he adds. ESA, as Galileo’s design authority and system development prime and on behalf of the European Commission, awarded in 2021 the first satellite-building contracts to Thales Alenia Space (IT) and Airbus Defence and Space (DE) to create two independent families of six satellites each. Galileo Second Generation has now reached a significant milestone. Between July and September, two structural models of the Thales Alenia Space satellite and an electrical model of its navigation payload underwent mechanical and signal performance assessment at ESA’s ESTEC Test Centre in Noordwijk, the Netherlands. “The models successfully passed the stringent mechanical, acoustic and radiofrequency tests required by the Galileo Programme,” confirmed Tiziano Sassorossi, Director of G2SB1 Project at Thales Alenia Space Domain Observation and Navigation Programs Italy.

Dual launch structure approved Dual launch configuration A structural model is a mechanical representative of a satellite that has dummy masses instead of equipment, tank, propellant and appendages. Thales Alenia Space sent two structural models from Turin, Italy, to ESTEC, where they were exposed to the harsh environmental conditions present during a rocket launch. First, the enormous sound horns at ESA’s Large European Acoustic Facility (LEAF) blasted the models with noise equivalent to multiple jet aircraft lifting off simultaneously. Then, they had to withstand earthquake-like vibrations at the Hydraulic Multi-axis Shaker (Hydra). Finally, they endured a mechanical shock alike to what a satellite experiences during its separation from a rocket. “The satellites will be launched in pairs, one on top of each other and connected to the launcher until separation, so we had to test them in this configuration. Each satellite is over 2000 kg and when stacked, they reach a towering height of seven meters. Seeing the models undergo testing in this configuration was both impressive and nerve-wracking, and we are thrilled that this new design concept for Galileo has received mechanical qualification” said Alberto Bramante, ESA’s Head of Management Office for Thales Alenia Space G2 Satellite.

Antenna under scrutiny Team in the Hertz chamber The G2 satellites will carry an innovative navigation payload that is fully digital and reconfigurable in orbit to actively respond to evolving user needs. An electrical model of the Thales Alenia Space payload, an aluminium box with flight-like equipment and antenna, was tested to assess its signal performance. At ESTEC’s Hertz facility, an anechoic chamber isolated from the outside world with radio- and sound-absorbing internal walls, the model radiated transmission in different modes and demonstrated compatibility with Galileo First Generation signals.

Full steam ahead for G2 The Galileo Second Generation is in full development phase after the main procurement batch was completed this summer. The European industry is now building the satellites and ultra-precise atomic clocks, and developing the system testbeds, ground mission and ground control segments. In parallel to Thales Alenia Space, Airbus Defence and Space is developing the other half of the constellation, which will be tested for mechanical and signal performance at the company’s facilities in Germany.

Vibration test After all testing on the models is complete and the final design details confirmed, the first flight models of both families will be assembled and integrated before undergoing functional and environmental verification, including for some satellites a radiated test campaign in the new test chamber for space antennas being built at ESTEC, Hertz 2.0. This new generation of satellites will start joining the existing constellation in the upcoming years. ""G2 is designed to stay in orbit for at least 15 years. We are working hard to make sure the new satellites enable our high-performing navigation system Galileo to go forward into the future with novel capabilities and additional robustness,"" declares ESA’s Head of Galileo Space Segment Management Office, Andrea Cotellessa. ESA's Director of Navigation Javier Benedicto confirms: “This first milestone is a powerful testament to the capabilities and unwavering dedication of the European industry and reaffirms ESA’s commitment to redefine the boundaries of satellite navigation. I cannot wait to see the many parts come together to bring to life an even better performing Galileo system, so this EU programme can continue serving European and world citizens.”

About Galileo Galileo is currently the world’s most precise satellite navigation system, serving close to four billion users around the globe since entering Open Service in 2017. All smartphones sold in the European Single Market are now guaranteed Galileo-enabled. In addition, Galileo is making a difference across the fields of rail, maritime, agriculture, financial timing services and rescue operations. Galileo is a flagship programme of the European Union, managed and funded by the European Commission. Since its inception, ESA leads the design, development and qualification of the space and ground systems, as well as procuring launches. The EU Agency for the Space Programme (EUSPA) acts as the service provider of Galileo, overseeing the market and application needs and closing the loop with users.

to AI systems Share this article



LinkedIn

At the 30th edition of the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security, which took place in Copenhagen from 27-30 November 2023 and included a daylong workshop on artificial intelligence and security (AISec), Thales made a world-premiere presentation of a technique for carrying out a physical attack on an AI system.

Companies and organisations are now well aware of the risk of software attacks on their AI models, but less information is available ​ about potential attacks on AI hardware.

With the increasing use of AI in defence systems (drones, vehicles, fighter aircraft, etc.), the security of these highly critical assets needs to be taken into account from the earliest design stage in order to protect the intellectual property they contain and safeguard national security interests.



Side-channel attack on an embedded AI system by Thales ©Thales

In an AI system, software is embedded in physical hardware components. Physical attacks known as side-channel attacks attempt to gain access to sensitive information by observing indirect signals generated by physical components of the system. Thales's demonstration of a side-channel attack during the AISec workshop was intended to raise awareness of this new type of threat among members of the scientific and technical community and encourage them to take this potential vulnerability into account when developing their systems.

The heat, power consumption or electromagnetic radiation generated by a system can be a valuable source of information for hackers. They can use this information to exploit the physical characteristics of a system's electronic components, understand how the embedded software functions, access its sensitive data and compromise the confidentiality of the parameters influencing the decisions made by the AI.

Joan Mazenc, Director of the Thales ITSEF1, said: ""The risk of side-channel attacks on AI systems has not been fully addressed, and specific developments are needed to guarantee their reliability and resilience and to protect the intellectual property they contain. By presenting this new threat to the international scientific and technical community at the AISec conference, Thales seeks to alert industry to this emerging risk and the advanced solutions and techniques required to build a trusted AI system.""

The attack presented at the AISec conference was conducted in two steps:

​ ​ 1 . Attack by observation, in which the physical behaviour of the system was analysed during operation to reveal the secret parameters used by the targeted AI for classifying images.

Conventional laboratory techniques can measure the electromagnetic radiation generated by a system's electronic components. By reproducing this process thousands of times in a variety of conditions, an attack AI can be trained to recognise the observed radiation patterns and thereby identify the secret parameters of the target AI with no prior knowledge of the system being observed.

​ ​ 2 . Active attack, in which the parameters influencing the target AI's decisions were exploited in order to deceive the model by creating adversarial examples.

This attack used scripts capable of exploiting the secret parameters revealed in the first step in order to create an image that would be incorrectly classified by the AI.

In addition, a hacker with physical access to the target system could achieve the same objective by physically disturbing the component while the AI is running. Creating a quick disturbance in the electronic component's power supply or exposing a circuit to a strong electromagnetic pulse could alter the AI's decisions, causing it to misclassify images. This type of ""fault injection"" attack also needs to be taken into consideration by embedded system designers in order to build a trusted AI.

Thales and AI

To counter these threats, Thales runs security evaluations at its ITSEF laboratory, which is accredited by the French National Cybersecurity Agency ANSSI, and draws on the Group's extensive expertise to propose customised solutions to mitigate any vulnerabilities that are detected.

As the Group's defence and security businesses address critical requirements, often with safety-of-life implications, Thales has developed an ethical and scientific framework for the development of trusted AI based on the four strategic pillars of validity, security, explainability and responsibility. Thales solutions combine the know-how of over 300 senior AI experts and more than 4,500 cybersecurity specialists with the operational expertise of the Group's aerospace, land defence, naval defence, space and other defence and security businesses.

Do you want to know more about 5G technology? Then you're in the right place.

On this Q&A page, you'll discover key facts about 5G: What is 5G? and what is 5G+?

How fast is 5G?

What is the difference between 4G and 5G?

What are the 5G use cases?

When is 5G coming, and where is it available?

What does it mean for consumers and operators?

What's the relation between 5G and satellites?

Will 5G technology be secure? Let's see how 5G technology is changing the world.

What is 5G?

5G technology is a breakthrough.

The next generation of telecom networks (fifth generation or 5G) started hitting the market at the end of 2018 and will continue to expand worldwide.

Beyond speed improvement, the technology is expected to unleash a massive 5G IoT (Internet of Things) ecosystem where networks can serve communication needs for billions of connected devices, with the right trade-offs between speed, latency, and cost.

This makes sense if you think about what 5G has to offer.

5G technology is driven by 8 specification requirements:

Up to 10Gbps data rate - > 10 to 100x speed improvement over 4G and 4.5G networks

1-millisecond latency

1000x bandwidth per unit area

Up to 100x number of connected devices per unit area (compared with 4G LTE)

99.999% availability

100% coverage

90% reduction in network energy usage

Up to 10-year battery life for low-power IoT device

How fast is 5G?

5G speed tops out at 10 gigabits per second (Gbps).

5G is 10 to x100 faster than what you can get with 4G.



What makes 5G faster? Good question!

According to communication principles, the shorter the frequency, the larger the bandwidth.

Using shorter frequencies (millimeter waves between 30GHz and 300GHz) for 5G networks is why 5G can be faster. This high-band 5G spectrum provides the expected boost in speed and capacity, low latency, and quality.

5G download speed may differ widely by area. However,may differ widely by area. According to the February 2020 issue of Fortune Magazine, average 5G speed measures done in Q3/Q4 2019 range from: 220 megabits per second (Mbps) in Las Vegas,

350 in New York,

380 in Los Angeles,

450 in Dallas,

to 550 Chicago,

and over 950 in Minneapolis and Providence, approximately. That's 10 to 50 times more than 4G LTE 5G speed can vary widely based on your proximity to a 5G tower and the surrounding environment. Close to a 5G tower with a clear line of sight, you could experience speeds surpassing 1000 Mbps—nearly tenfold the rates of 4G. However, these speeds can diminish as the distance from the tower increases or if obstacles interfere with the signal. Here are some other examples of download and upload speeds you can expect with 5G. Some download and upload 5G speed tests in Australia, America, and China In conclusion, 5G speeds are not uniform; they can significantly fluctuate based on factors such as distance from the cell tower, environmental obstacles, and network traffic. But here is the part where you understand the benefits of 5G go beyond speed. What is 5G low latency? 5G technology offers an extremely low latency rate, the delay between the sending and receiving information. From 200 milliseconds for 4G, we go down to 1 millisecond(1 ms) with 5G.

Just think about it.



A millisecond is 1/1000 of a second.

The average reaction time for humans to a visual stimulus is 250 ms or 1/4 of a second. People are capped at around 190-200 ms with proper training. Imagine now that your car could react 250 times faster than you. Imagine it could also respond to hundreds of incoming information and communicate its reactions to other vehicles and road signals within milliseconds. At 60 mph (100km/h), the reaction distance is about 33 yards (30 meters) before you pull on the brakes. With a 1ms reaction time, the car would only have rolled more than one inch (less than 3 centimeters).

Use cases associated with low latency are: V2X (Vehicle-to-Everything) communication: V2V: (Vehicle-to-Vehicle), V2I (Vehicle-to-Infrastructure), autonomous, connected cars

Immersive Virtual Reality Gaming (5G will bring VR to the masses.)

Remote surgical operations (aka telesurgery)

Simultaneous translating. In other words, 5G and IoT create the perfect match. So, let's see what makes 5G so different from 4G. 5G vs 4G - What is the difference? The 5th generation of wireless networks addresses the evolution beyond mobile internet to massive IoT (Internet of Things) from 2019/2020. Compared with today's 4G and 4.5G (aka LTE advanced, LTE-A, LTE+, or 4G+), the main evolution is that, beyond data speed improvements, new IoT and critical communication use cases will require a new level of improved performance. For example, low latency provides real-time interactivity for services using the cloud, which is key to the success of self-driving cars.

provides real-time interactivity for services using the cloud, which is key to the success of self-driving cars. 5G vs 4G also means at least x100 devices connected. 5G must support 1 million devices for 0.386 square miles or 1 km 2 .

for 0.386 square miles or 1 km . Also, low power consumption is what will allow connected objects to operate for months or years without the need for human assistance. Unlike current IoT services that make performance trade-offs to get the best from current wireless technologies (3G, 4G, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, etc.), 5G networks will be designed to bring the level of performance needed for massive IoT. It will enable a perceived entirely ubiquitous connected world. In short, that's what makes it transformational. 5G and the previous mobile generations at a glance In the last four decades, mobile phones, more than any other technology, have quietly changed our lives forever.

( for Long Term Evolution), starting in 2009, doubled data speeds. While LTE boasts extensive network coverage, 5G is still in the initial phases of being rolled out. 5G networks (2019) expand broadband wireless services beyond mobile internet to IoT and critical communications segments Virtual networks (5G slicing) tailored to each use case. 5G will support all communication needs from low-power Local Area Networks (LAN) – like home networks, such as Wide Area Networks (WAN), with the proper latency/speed settings. This need is addressed today by aggregating various communication networks (Wi-Fi, Z-Wave, LoRa, 3G, 4G, etc.) And 5G is more innovative. 5G is designed to allow simple virtual network configurations to align network costs with application needs better. This new approach will allow 5G Mobile Network operators to catch a larger IoT market by delivering cost-effective solutions for low-band, low-power applications. Some recent illustrations: Hewlett-Packard builds a private network for the 2023 Ryder Cup (September 2023).

NTT and Las Vegas launch the largest private 5G network in the US (September 2022)

Porsche and Vodafone build a hybrid private network (December 2022) What is 5G+? 5G+ is a step up from standard 5G, designed to boost network speed, capacity, and coverage by as much as 50%. Imagine at busy events, like concerts or games, 5G+ cuts through digital crowd jams, letting you download an HD movie in a minute. While standard 5G utilizes low-band spectrum to extend coverage and enhance reliability, it delivers speeds only marginally faster than 4G LTE. On the other hand, 5G plus leverages millimeter wave technology to achieve breakneck speeds, though with a shorter range. What are the real 5G use cases? Each new generation wireless network came with a new set of new usages. The next 5G will make no exception and focus on IoT and critical communications applications. In terms of the schedule, we can mention the following use cases over time: Fixed wireless access (from 2018-2019 onwards)

Enhanced mobile broadband with 4G fallback (from 2019-2020-2021)

Massive M2M / IoT (from 2021-2022)

Ultra low-latency IoT critical communications (from 2024-2025) Some critical applications, like self-driving cars, require very aggressive latency (fast response time), while they do not require quick data rates. Conversely, enterprise cloud-based services with massive data analysis will require speed improvements more than latency improvements. When is 5G coming? 5G availability and speed in 2023 5G rollout: Where do we stand? Over four years since its launch, 5G technology has significantly matured, achieving broader and faster coverage. As of June 2023, 5G has reached 1.1 billion subscriptions globally, with an addition of 125 million in the first quarter alone. About 240 service providers have established 5G networks, and 35 have launched 5G Standalone (SA) networks. As of early 2023, users have over 700 5G smartphone models to choose from. GSMA Intelligence predicts rapid 5G expansion, with connections set to reach 2 billion by 2025, outpacing 3G and 4G rollouts. By 2028, 5G is expected to encompass 4.6 billion subscriptions, overtaking half of all mobile subscriptions. 5G availability Regarding availability, South Korea and Puerto Rico are leading, with nearly half of their 5G users spending most of their time connected to 5G, according to OPENSIGNAL benchmarks of June 2023. The US follows closely with a 31.1% availability rate. However, availability varies in Europe, with Finland and Bulgaria at the top (24.2% - 24.7%) but significant markets like the UK lagging behind (10.1%). Singapore and Taiwan are at 30% in Asia, with Malaysia at 20.5%. 5G speed in 2023 Speed-wise, 5G is transforming digital experiences with average download speeds many times faster than 4G, with India (19.2x), Malaysia (14.4x), and Brazil (13.5x) witnessing the most significant jumps. Regarding absolute speeds, South Korea leads at 432.5Mbps, with seven markets exceeding 300Mbps. For gaming and video streaming, 5G provides an enhanced experience, with improvements of up to 37.6% in video and 31.3% in gaming experiences across various markets. When did 5G come out in the US? North America 5G was available in some locations in 2019. It took off in most areas in 2020. More precisely, ATT announced nationwide coverage in the US in the first half of 2020. Verizon 5G was the first carrier to roll out 5G. 5G is being set up much quicker than 4G ever was. The first 5G network covered the whole country twice as fast as 4G. Also, the top three phone service providers got their 5G networks up and running nationwide 1.5 times quicker than they did with 4G. Currently, 5G networks in the US reach over 325 million people, making America's 5G the most widespread worldwide. According to Ookla, the US leads globally, with more than half of 5G-ready phones using a 5G network most of the time. That's almost 20% more than South Korea and nearly twice as much as China, where only about 27.3% have 5G availability. 5G in Germany, France and the UK Deutsche Telekom started 5G in Berlin, Darmstadt, Munich, Bonn, and Cologne in Sept 2019. In December 2021, major cities (53% of the territory) were covered by 5G services. In August 2023, Telefonica Germany reached 90% of 5G coverage. The company is targeting nationwide coverage for 2025. 5G networks covered 89% of Germany's territory as of July 2023. Telcos in France announced 5G offers by 2020 for real availability in 2021. By 2030, France should be covered by 5G. In the UK, many cities have seen 5G in 2019 and more in 2020. EE, Vodafone, and O2 have been actively deploying 5G since mid-2019. The UK was quick to start using 5G in 2019, but now it's not keeping up. Why? According to the Financial Times of 2 August 2023, phone companies haven't been spending enough. Ofcom says that while 82% of homes and workplaces in the UK can get 5G from at least one company, only 22% have it from all the phone services. 5G in India India Telcos started their 5G rollouts in October 2022. The number of users now exceeds 100 million, according to the main operators, Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio, driving the push. It's one-sixth of the 600 million phone users.

According to the GSMA, median 5G download speeds are 25 faster than 4G in the country. 5G and China China Unicom has set up 5G in a few locations in 2019. China Mobile said it had deployed over 560,000 5G base stations as of November 2021.

In August 2023, China Broadnet announced it had reached nationwide 5G coverage.

In June 2023, China Mobile said the country will achieve a 90% penetration rate in 2023. The company will have 2 million 5G base stations by the end of this year. China Mobile's 5G end-users exceeded 480 million in June. Find more resources: 5G availability worldwide as of September 2023, or check the interactive weekly updated Ookla 5G map. Over four years since its launch, 5G technology has significantly matured, achieving broader and faster coverage. This brings us to our next point. How fast will 5G take-up be? The projected adoption rate for 5G differs drastically from all previous generation networks (3G, 4G).

While previous technology was driven by mobile internet usage and the availability of ""killer apps,"" 5G is expected to be mainly driven by new IoT usages, such as connected and self-driving cars.

Ericsson reports that as of early 2023, there are now 1.1 billion 5G subscribers worldwide, with an increase of 125 million in the first quarter alone. About 240 service providers have rolled out 5G networks, and approximately 35 have introduced or set up 5G Standalone (SA) networks. By the end of 2028, the number of 5G users is projected to hit 4.6 billion, representing more than half of all mobile users globally. Ericsson announced 4.6 billion 5G subscribers at the end of 2028. By 2030, 6G will probably start commercial rollouts."

"Spy'Ranger contact drones, an unrivalled operational experience - Thales","Wed, 15 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi93b3JsZHdpZGUtZGVmZW5jZS91bm1hbm5lZC1hZXJpYWwtdmVoaWNsZXMtc3lzdGVtcy9tYWdhemluZS9zcHlyYW5nZXItY29udGFjdC1kcm9uZXMtdW5yaXZhbGxlZNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Spy’Ranger contact drones, an unrivalled operational experience Share this article



LinkedIn

Drones are not a recent technology. French armies have used them for some sixty years in various theaters of operation. In current conflicts, whether in Nagorno-Karabakh, Ukraine or Mali during the French operation Barkhane, drones, and in particular contact drones, have demonstrated their decisive character.

What are contact UAVs ?

Used ""as close as possible"" to the enemy by operators in the various armed forces (Air, Land or Sea), contact drones cover micro UAVs, mini UAVs and small UAVs capable of operating within a few kilometers to over 100 kilometers and weighing between 500 grams and 150 kilos. In the wide criteria of drone warfare requirements, Thales is positioned in contact drones

Contact UAVs are decisive in protecting forces engaged in contact, who need to be illuminated, informed and supported. Large tactical drones cannot provide the agility that combatants need on the front line to act without delay in rapidly changing combat scenarios. The versality, ubiquity and agility of contact drones provide a decisive advantage. But for smaller drones to deliver their full potential, they must be integrated with other means of air/land combat. At Thales we have the ability to develop new systems with collective intelligence. Leveraging in our experience in drones, UAS management systems, surveillance, and aerial operations but also air defence, we are shaping solutions to really integrate contact drones in the “Air-Land Combat bubble” providing forces with the operational capabilities needed for today or tomorrow’s conflicts.

Contact drones are decisive equipment for OODA loop acceleration

Spy'Ranger contact UAV systems, developed by Thales, offer a concentration of the most innovative technologies available on the market.

Spy'Ranger UAVs are used for multi-domain intelligence, reconnaissance, surveillance and protection missions. They are used by the armed forces and security forces of several countries, including the French Army (SMDR programme).

Interoperable with intelligence and artillery systems, Spy'Ranger drones have become the eyes and ears of armed forces in the collaborative combat of the future. They enable forces to accelerate the OODA (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) decision loop, i.e. to detect the adversary, anticipate his actions and act before he does.

Spy’Ranger UAV systems are ready for high-intensity combat

High-intensity warfare is characterized by unprecedented violence, significantly increasing the stress levels of combatants and reducing their cognitive abilities. Our systems offer AI-based 'hyper-assistants' to enable combatants to understand the situation faster than the enemy.

Jamming of communications and GNSS signals is systematically used. That’s why the systems we offer are equipped with the latest innovations in communications, navigation and positioning to be able to survive in the most contested environments.

Operational superiority in high-intensity combat is the result of a combination of manoeuvres involving dismounted and embarked units supported by contact UAVs and associated loitering munitions (LMs) engaged individually or in packs.

Spy’Ranger UAVs have an unrivalled operational experience

The Spy'Ranger fixed wing contact drones have proved their worth in combat. As part of the French SMDR (Systèmes de Mini-Drones de Reconnaissance) programme, the Spy'Ranger 330s have carried out numerous missions alongside French forces since the end of 2020, contributing to the success of military operations and protecting soldiers during the French Barkhane operation in Mali.

With more than 2,000 flights and over 2,000 flying hours in overseas operations, the SMDR has accumulated unrivalled experience. After a period of learning and adaptation, the French army has gradually increased the SMDR's objectives, dedicating it to missions involving observation of enemy movements, surveillance of empty zones and routes, detection of enemy fire and Improvised explosive devices (IED), protection of convoys and disembarked combatants, day/night intelligence, BDA (Battle Damage Assessment) and the provision of coordinates for friendly fire guidance.

Fixed wing and hybrid VTOL/fixed wing contact drones

Thales offers conventional & regular forces a comprehensive family of front-line fixed wing UAS (Spy’Ranger 330 and 550) and hybrid VTOL/fixed wing UAS (Spy’Ranger X40 and X100).

The Spy'Ranger X40 and Spy'Ranger X100 benefit directly from developments in the Spy'Ranger 330 and Spy'Ranger 550 UAV systems : robust, lightweight composite and carbon structure, high-definition multi-sensor optronic payloads (EO, IR, laser), high-performance batteries, on-board AI, AI-based edge computing, hyper-assistance, vision-based navigation, secure high-speed data links, ground station and control/command HMI, connectivity and interoperability with intelligence and artillery systems, reduced logistics footprint,…

The Spy'Ranger X40 and Spy'Ranger X100 are multi-mission, multi-payload UAV systems. They combine image-based intelligence (IMINT) with electromagnetic intelligence (SIGINT). They can fulfil several objectives in a single mission and combine the effects of their payloads for greater effectiveness.*

The Spy'Ranger X40 is a lightweight tactical drone system. Fitted with electric motors for landing, take-off and cruise flight, it has a range of more than 2 hours and a radius of action of more than 40 km, for a very small logistical footprint.

It is natively equipped with 2 payloads: an IMINT payload (Image Intelligence) with a Spy'Ball Mk3 gyrostabilised ball incorporating 1 HD EO (Electro-Optical) sensor (day channel), 1 HD IR (Infra-Red) sensor (night channel), 1 laser pointer and 1 laser telemeter, as well as a SIGINT payload (Signal Intelligence) with an IMSI catcher system for detecting, identifying and locating mobile phones.

The Spy'Ranger X40 is ready to carry out its ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance,Reconnaissance) missions in a high-intensity conflict where many of the threats are electromagnetic. It is equipped with vision-based navigation and GNSS anti-jamming technologies. Its uTMA V2 data link, developed by Thales, integrates a specific and sovereign waveform, anti-jamming and encrypted, with frequency hopping, enabling it to resist enemy jammers.

Complying with STANAG 4609 (digital motion imagery) and 4545 (NSIF format), the Spy'Ranger X40 is interoperable with all artillery, intelligence and C4I systems meeting these standards. The Spy'Ranger X40 can also be certified to STANAG 4703 (Light Unmanned Aircraft Systems Airworthiness).

It is designed and produced in France and does not include any equipment subject to war material control regulations.

The Spy'Ranger X100 is a light MAME (Medium Altitude-Medium Endurance) tactical UAV system. Equipped with electric motors for take-off and landing, and a gasoline engine for cruising flight, it has a range of over 10 hours and a range of over 100 km, with a total payload of 17 kg.

The Spy'Ranger X100 is natively equipped with a high-performance IMINT (Image Intelligence) payload with a Spy'Ball Mk4 gyrostabilised ball incorporating 1 HD EO (Electro-Optical) sensor and an optical/digital zoom, 1 very long-range IR (Infra-Red) sensor with a continuous optical/digital zoom, 1 laser pointer, 1 laser telemeter and eventually 1 laser designator.

It will eventually be able to drop two Thales loitering munitions

It has a cargo bay at the centre of gravity of the air vehicle, enabling it to carry several types of payload: ROEM sensors (LTE, WiFi, U/VHF), jammers, a radar, a SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar), a LIDAR, a sonar, a NRBC (Nuclear, Radiological, Bacteriological, Chemical) detector, emergency equipment, weapons (bombs, MTO) and two TOUTATIS remotely operated munitions.

The Spy'Ranger X100 can carry out its ISTAR (Intelligence, Surveillance, Target acquisition & Reconnaissance) missions behind enemy lines in a high-intensity conflict environment, thanks to its vision-based navigation technology and GNSS anti-jamming system. Equipped with the secure, encrypted uTMA V2 data link, its frequency hopping waveform is specific and sovereign, and resists the most powerful jamming.

Like the Spy'Ranger X40, the Spy'Ranger X100 complies with STANAG 4609 (digital motion imagery) and STANAG 4545 (NSIF format) and is interoperable with all artillery, intelligence and C4I systems meeting these standards. The Spy'Ranger X100 can also be certified to STANAG 4703 (Light Unmanned Aircraft Systems Airworthiness).

Designed and produced in France, the Spy'Ranger X100 does not include any equipment subject to war material control regulations.

SWISSto12, a provider of additively manufactured antenna and radio frequency (RF) system products based in Renens, Switzerland, reports it is developing Active Electronically Steerable Antennas (AESAs) for airborne, land, and maritime platforms, in collaboration with Thales, France.

An Active Electronically Steerable Antenna is an array of antenna elements that can electronically steer towards any point in various directions, without physically moving the antenna. AESAs can produce beams that are scanned at large elevation angles. This feature allows for the creation of flat arrays that can be easily incorporated into ships, land vehicles, or aircraft.

SWISSto12’s AESAs will utilise additively manufactured miniature horn antennas as an alternative to traditional patch antennas. These AM antenna apertures offer higher efficiency and superior overall performance, including gain, axial ratio and bandwidth over scan volume, compared to patch antennas. These characteristics are crucial for preserving wide-angle scanning capabilities in AESAs.

SWISSto12’s additively manufactured antennas are mounted on planar beamformers supplied by Thales. These beamformers are reported to use the latest Beamforming Integrated Circuits (BFICs) and innovative patented interconnection solutions.

Under the collaboration, Thales will leverage its legacy in designing complex layouts of microwave amplification functions, dedicated to spatial combination using the most advanced ultra-fine pitch packaging solutions available in the market.

The new AESA product will leverage improvements in Size, Weight and Power consumption (SWaP) starting with Ka band satellite communications and future combined operation across Ku and Ka bands combined in one antenna.

Emile de Rijk, CEO of SWISSto12 stated, “We are delighted to announce this new AESA product at SWISSto12, and the associated collaboration with Thales. This new class of AESAs uses our unique 3D printed antenna technology and will offer a breakthrough for users of on-the-move satellite communications across airborne, naval and land platforms.”

Charles-Antoine Goffin, Vice President, Microwave & Imaging Sub-Systems, Thales shared, “Thanks to this collaboration with SWISSto12, Thales is able to expand its RF power amplification and beamforming product portfolio. The result of this collaborative effort will be a new solution for Satcom on-the-move applications, where Thales will bring its skills on Design for Manufacturing and Design to Cost applied to electronic assemblies for competitive serial production planned in its premises. These compact AESAs will give the opportunity to SWISSto12 and Thales to serve various markets starting with commercial airborne connectivity and government satellite communications.”

In January 2023, SWISSto12 and Thales entered a contract to develop solid-state power amplifiers (SSPAs) for Space applications, specifically for SWISSto12’s HummingSat missions.

Matthew Hunt

by Matthew Hunt, Head of Sales (Land Communications), Thales UK

Ask anyone for the first words that spring to mind at the mention of “cyberspace” and they will likely say some variety of: computers, networks, information and data. Whole virtual worlds, accessible in an instant.

Ask someone thirty, forty, fifty years ago and the likelihood is the general population will have never heard of the term – yet, “cyberspace” actually first appeared on the page in William Gibson’s 1984 novel Neuromancer – and it did so in terms as nebulous as they are hard to grasp:

“A consensual hallucination experienced daily by billions of legitimate operators, in every nation…A graphic representation of data abstracted from the banks of every computer in the human system. Unthinkable complexity. Lines of light ranged in the nonspace of the mind, clusters and constellations of data. Like city lights, receding.”

Gibson couldn’t have known what the world would look like in 2023. He couldn’t have known that his term would become the definition for something so embedded in our everyday lives. With everything – and everyone – now more connected than ever, technological advancement in communications technology has seated his intangible definition in terms we can make better sense of. It’s why, forty years on, the UK MOD’s definition of cyberspace seems much more familiar:

“An operating environment consisting of the interdependent network of digital technology infrastructures (including platforms, the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, as well as embedded processors and controllers), and the data therein spanning the physical, virtual and cognitive domains.” (Cyber Primer, 2nd Edition)

The pervasiveness of cyberspace – so ingrained in our devices, our relationships, our day-to-day – has implications for the modern military environment. In the Future Character of Conflict, the Development, Concepts and Doctrine Centre (DCDC) described the 2014 joint battlespace as “congested, clustered, contested, connected and constrained”. Nearly ten years on and those 5Cs are more relevant – and challenging – than ever. The frontline is now increasingly digital.

The evolving threat: IEDs to CEMA

From smartphones and Personal Role Radios, through to drones and the controllers with which to operate them, today’s dismounted soldiers and operational units are trialling and deploying more integrated technologies than ever before. However, smartphone messages can be intercepted. Radio signals get detected and tracked. Controllers can be hacked. More connected soldier systems present greater “attack surface” opportunities to expose vulnerabilities and exploit the data therein, with Cyber and Electro Magnetic Activities (CEMA) increasingly supplementing improvised threats to become a mainstay of the modern battlespace.

CEMA is intentional in its objectives, targeted in its approach, and is as dangerous for individual soldiers as it is to whole countries. Attacks are often aimed at a nation’s operational technology and critical infrastructure, with commonplace, ubiquitous connected technologies, such as CCTV systems and Wi-Fi routers, often being targeted.

CEMA has three pillars:

Effect: What can I do to impact the enemy? Protect: What can I do to stop the enemy affecting me? Understand: How can I find out what the enemy is intending to do?

The three pillars coalesce to form one overarching objective: operational advantage. CEMA is all about gaining a competitive edge. It’s about disrupting OODA loops so the adversary has to play on your terms. Maybe that’s by making an enemy behave in a way they don’t want to through jamming their network. Or it might be a case of making them believe that your ten radio signatures are actually 100 soldiers defending an outpost – forcing them by deception to where you want them to be. It can be argued as to whether deception is CEMA or good old-fashioned electronic warfare (EW), but it doesn’t really matter, as the boundaries blur and overlap with today’s equipment being capable of delivering more than one effect. At its core, CEMA is about exerting power and influence over someone else via electronic means to come out on top.

CEMA is a testament to how technology has given us the means to relentlessly chase this competitive edge. Where once we used our eyes to survey from a ship, we saw further by climbing up a mast. Then we got a telescope. Then we got radar. In every case, we are trying to stay ahead of our adversaries. What we are trying to do has not changed. Technology has given us the ability to see further and therefore given us the tactical advantage needed.

From technological frontiers to the digital frontline

CEMA is complex and multi-faceted by its very nature. Soldiers must protect themselves and their unit, which depends on the interoperable, interchangeable and harmonised set-up of every system involved to increase mission survivability and streamline operations. They must harden equipment against offensive CEMA from an enemy, and they must do all this while responding with CEMA effects of their own. CEMA is not the preserve of large systems operated at brigade level, but it is also accessible and effective in the hands of the soldier.

How might this be put into practice: an assault team can use on-the-soldier equipment such as Thales’ Storm 2 in a CEMA attack to disrupt Wi-Fi-connected security cameras, rendering them ‘blind’. This would be an electronic attack with a cyber-effect on real-world equipment. Now imagine that same equipment used by a four-man observation post to frequency scan and identify the presence of electronic signatures in a nearby wood. By integrating other technologies, they will be able to understand not only the frequency on which someone is transmitting, but also its power and the specific radio signature. This means they will be able to make better-educated inferences around who precisely is in that wood – conventional forces, reserves, special forces as well as which nationality – and decide on the best next steps. CEMA and EW are, however, two sided. While the observation post may have decided not to hang around once the electronic signatures of 4,000 adversaries have been identified, can they be sure their adversary isn’t using electronic deception to make a small handful of soldiers look like a brigade?

Conducting CEMA effectively – whether to Protect, Effect or Understand – relies upon soldiers having access to the latest, most reliable and most relevant technologies. But a lack of software-defined hardware means capabilities can’t be continuously adapted and updated to meet the pace of the evolving threat while maintaining their own security protection measures. And a lack of interoperability spells bad news for soldiers who need their kit to work as one.

If a soldier can’t use their CEMA systems and radios at the same time, then their situational awareness plummets. If their CEMA systems can’t protect them from things going bang without stopping the exchange of data with the rest of the team, then orders and situational awareness could get lost. And if the squad’s electromagnetic signals can’t coincide amidst a congested spectrum – especially while trying to fend off jamming and interception by an enemy – then the entire operation becomes compromised and the tactical advantage is handed over.

A call to arms for industry, a competitive edge for soldiers

Traditional methods won’t cut it if we are to drive the necessary digital transformation that will allow for more integrated, unified and relevant technologies on the battlefield. This is why the Army Warfighting Experiment (AWE), conducted yearly, is so valuable in exploring new ways to develop, deliver and deploy new and advanced capabilities. It’s up to industry to explore an answer; to define the problem and design a solution that will give soldiers an enduring advantage on the battlefield.

This year, Thales will be demonstrating a suite of offensive and defensive CEMA products that deliver tactical and strategic advantage to those on the frontline. Visit the team at AWE on 30 November to find out more, or get in touch with me on LinkedIn if you would like to find out more about our CEMA solutions.

"Vodafone, Eseye, G+D, Thales rank a 'champs' for IoT and eSIM services - RCR Wireless News","Tue, 14 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJjcndpcmVsZXNzLmNvbS8yMDIzMTExNC9pbnRlcm5ldC1vZi10aGluZ3MtNC92b2RhZm9uZS1lc2V5ZS1nZC10aGFsZXMtcmFuay1hLWNoYW1wcy1mb3ItaW90LWFuZC1lc2ltLXNlcnZpY2Vz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Market research firm Kaleido Intelligence has reviewed a bunch of cellular IoT providers for the supply of connectivity management platforms (CMP), eSIM connectivity, and eSIM subscription management – and ranked Vodafone, Eseye, G+D, and Thales as the best in the business. Vodafone was rated ‘champion’ for CMP; Eseye was rated the same for eSIM connectivity; G+D and Thales shared the title for ‘champion’ eSIM management provider.

The firm said it studied the cellular IoT connectivity market for four months, running various primary and secondary research (demos, questionnaires, interviews, briefings) to rank 39 companies in total. It said it categorised vendors based on their product excellence, market positioning, problem-solving, innovation prowess, plus their “ability to align with current market needs and future demands”.

In total, it handed out ‘champion’ scores (12+ out of 15) to 12 vendors, with Vodafone, Eseye, G+D, and Thales ranked highest of them. It listed them all: Airlinq, Cisco, MAVOCO, Soracom, and Telefonica Tech for their CMP offerings; Pod Group (part of G+D) and Tata Communications for eSIM connectivity; and IDEMIA for eSIM subscription management. A further 22 vendors were recognised as ‘high-flyers’ (10-12/15).

Steffen Sorrell, chief of research at Kaleido, said: “Connectivity is the bedrock of IoT but it remains fragmented with a series of roadblocks in place that often lead to project failure. Leaders in the market are lowering those roadblocks, be it through their underlying infrastructure and software, connectivity agreements or seamless management across different realms of connectivity enablement.”

Erik Brenneis, chief executive for IoT of Vodafone Business, said: “As more customers adopt and rely on IoT, platform performance and capability become paramount. I am delighted Kaleido has recognised our connectivity management platform GDSP, as the number one ‘champion’ in its eSIM and CMP assessment. By developing and owning our platform we can respond rapidly to changing… demands to ensure that customers are always at the forefront of IoT.”

Nick Earle, chief executive at Eseye, said: “For the third straight year, we’ve been recognised as a ‘champion’, and this year as the number one firm, confirming our position as the market leader in eSIM connectivity solutions. Our advanced multi-IMSI and eUICC capabilities, multi-award-winning IoT connectivity management platform, and AnyNet Federation set us apart from the other 25 vendors, allowing us to deliver… [and] deploy IoT at scale.”

Thales press release

Following the signing of the contract between OCCAR and Naviris (a Fincantieri and Naval Group joint venture) for the Mid-Life Upgrade of the four Horizon-class units in service with the Italian and French navies, a sub-contract was signed in August 2023 between SIGEN (a consortium between Elettronica and Thales) and Naviris for the modernization of the Electronic Warfare (EW) system.

This contract represents a continuation of what has already been successfully initiated in the Horizon and FREMM programs and consolidates the collaborative relationship between the two companies for the supply of cutting-edge EW systems capable of successfully confronting current and future operational needs, with very balanced contributions from both companies.

In detail, the EW system integrates into the new Naval Units the excellence developed by both companies in their respective national naval programs. The full digital Radar Electronic Support Measures (RESM) component developed and qualified for the FDI (Frégate de Défense et d’Intervention) program for the French Navy will be integrated with ELT Group’s Radar Electronic Counter Measures component developed and qualified for the PPA (Patrol Multipurpose Offshore Units) for the Italian Navy. The Communication Electronic Support Measures and Electronic Warfare Management Unit subsystems, on the other hand, will be national variants, provided by each company for its own Navy.

Domitilla Benigni, CEO and COO of Elettronica said:

“The contract for the EWS Mid-Life Upgrading (MLU) of the Horizon Units has a twofold and significant value for our company: on the one hand, we consolidate our presence of excellence in EW on board naval units for the Italian and French Navies and, at the same time, we consolidate the long and fruitful collaboration with Thales. Both aspects consolidate ELT Group’s convinced contribution toward European Defence.”

The sensor suite, featuring Bluewatcher sonar, NS50 radar and the TSA 3522 IFF system, provides active and passive surveillance capabilities to ensure optimal effectiveness in safeguarding French waters and supporting naval missions.

These systems will replace the outgoing Estienne d’Orves class and OPV54-class patrol boats. The offshore patrol vessels, set to enter service in 2024, will operate primarily in French metropolitan waters, covering depths ranging from the continental shelf to the continental slope and rise.

Their long-endurance design makes them ideal for escort roles, especially ahead of nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs), providing intelligence, deterrence and scouting capabilities.

According to GlobalData’s The Global Naval Vessels and Surface Combatants Market 2023–2033 report, the procurement of light combat vessels including offshore patrol vessels, fast attack craft, fast patrol vessels and mine countermeasure vessels that are equipped with advanced weapons and communication systems is expected to increase globally.

Philippe Duhamel, executive vice-president of defence mission systems at Thales, emphasised the importance of this contract. “This new contract with the French defence procurement agency will enable the French Navy to support the missions of France’s Strategic Oceanic Force, monitor the country’s maritime approaches and contribute to state action at sea.”

The Bluewatcher sonar, known for its high underwater detection performance, is particularly suitable for vessels operating in shallow waters due to its low-draught design. The NS50 radar, as the first compact 4D multi-mission AESA radar for low/medium-tonnage vessels, provides air and surface surveillance capabilities and performs fire control functions for naval guns and missiles.

Complementing these technologies, the TSA 3522 IFF interrogator is Mode 5 certified, offering a cryptographic solution for identifying objects detected by the radar and ensuring France’s maritime security through naval capabilities.

Thales reported its order intake and sales for the period ending 30 September 2023, stating that the defence and security segment showed a robust growth outlook."

In July 2016, Thales and Electronica entered into a collaborative agreement which aims to focus on industrial and commercial operations in the electronic warfare (EW) domain in France and Italy, according to GlobalData’s “The Global Electronic Warfare Market 2020-2030” report.

The heart of this advancement lies in integrating components developed in national naval programmes. The radar electronic support measures (RESM) component, born out of the Frégate de Défense et d’Intervention (FDI) programme for the French Navy, will merge with the radar electronic countermeasures component developed for the Patrol Multipurpose Offshore Units (PPA) for the Italian Navy.

The communication electronic support measures and electronic warfare management unit subsystems will also feature national variants tailored for each navy.

Domitilla Benigni, CEO and COO of Elettronica emphasised the dual significance of the contract, stating, “The Horizon Units’ Electronic Warfare System Mid-Life Upgrade solidifies our excellence in naval EW for both the Italian and French Navies. Furthermore, it strengthens our longstanding collaboration with Thales, reinforcing ELT Group’s dedicated contribution to European Defense.”

Philippe Duhamel, executive vice-president of defence mission systems, Thales, expressed pride in the partnership, stating, “We are very proud to reinforce our collaboration and partnership with ELT Group by providing our unique Electronic Warfare system for the Italian and French Navies. This considers the new and modern stakes and threats of the electromagnetic spectrum, ensuring heightened defence capabilities in an evolving landscape.”"

The deal will see Emirates equip its Boeing 777X aircraft (deliveries start in 2025) with Thales’ AVANT Up IFE systems. In 2022 Emirates also selected AVANT Up for its new A350 fleet.

The AVANT Up system features Optiq QLED smart displays, the 4K HDR monitors having capability to show more than a billion colours. The growing demand for in-seat power will be met by the Pulse power management function, which includes high-speed USB-A and USB-C charging ports at each seat.

Passengers will be able to enjoy content on Emirates’ ‘ice’ system, including the usual TV shows and movies, live TV, and new options for streamed events and DVR.

Customers can also pair their Bluetooth device (such as a smartphone or tablet) to view their own content on the seatback, while also charging the device. They can also seamlessly sync their personal devices with the IFE screen to provide a multi-screen experience.

Emirates has also chosen several AVANT Up digital services, including personalisation features with curated recommendations. The system will also feature user interfaces that enable visually impaired passengers to have an immersive experience."

“We are excited to bring this state-of-the-art autopilot to market in partnership with Thales,” said StandardAero Military, Helicopter, and Energy Sector president Marc Drobny. “The features offered by StableLight will be a major game changer for pilots and operators alike—it provides unparalleled performance, taking the already capable AS350 and H125 aircraft to the next level.”

Offering stability augmentation, attitude retention, and auto trim, StableLight’s feature set includes stabilized climb flight attitude recovery, auto hover, go-around mode, and a terrain awareness and warning system (TAWS) with auto-pull up functions. According to Thales, the system has been tested by “pilots representing numerous operators and industry experts” over the last year. Thales noted that it has also applied for EASA and Transport Canada validations of the StableLight STC.

Base price for the StableLight kit, which weighs in at 40 pounds fully installed, is $150,000. StandardAero estimates that installation time will average 2 to 3 weeks. The launch customer for StableLight is Illinois-based MacNeil Aviation LLC."

Thales demonstrates the excellence of its naval solutions during NATO exercises - EDR Magazine,"Thu, 09 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVkcm1hZ2F6aW5lLmV1L3RoYWxlcy1kZW1vbnN0cmF0ZXMtdGhlLWV4Y2VsbGVuY2Utb2YtaXRzLW5hdmFsLXNvbHV0aW9ucy1kdXJpbmctbmF0by1leGVyY2lzZXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"9 November 2023 – During the REPMUS and Dynamic Messenger exercises, Thales demonstrated the excellence of its naval solutions, enabling forces to obtain a complete vision of the mission and improve interoperability in the conduct of operations to control the seabed. Thales’ innovative and collaborative electronic warfare technologies experimentations, including an interoperable mine warfare mission management system, improve situational awareness beyond the ship’s sensor horizon.

A mission management solution promoting interoperability between NATO networks, capable of easily integrating third-party systems, for the protection of the seabed

The aim of these two exercises, which took place in Portugal was to demonstrate new operational concepts and test new technologies in order to develop more flexible maritime UxV systems that are interoperable with conventional systems.

On this occasion, Thales demonstrated new mine detection capabilities, particularly in the strategic and complex area of the coastal waters. The open architecture of Thales’ mine action mission management system, M-Cube, enables the rapid and flexible integration of third-party sensors. For example, the CAMCOPTER® S-100 UAV incorporating the Austrian company RIEGL’s VQ-840-G LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) system was able to carry out a complete airborne mine countermeasures operation with 100% mine detection success and 0% false alarms, thereby achieving the best results recorded during the exercises.

These innovations in mission management enabled the forces to obtain a complete view of the tactical situation in order to achieve their operational objectives. This is the first time that the advantages of the distributed architecture of the new generation M-Cube system have been demonstrated in a NATO naval exercise combining traditional platforms and UAVs. In addition, the M-Cube system, with its open architecture, shows that it is compatible with NATO major communication networks and able to manage missions at an operational group command level.

In addition, Thales, through its MiMap solution, contributed to the protection of critical submarine infrastructures by identifying a cut in a submarine cable during the Dynamic Messenger exercise. MiMap is a mission analysis tool that enables operators to analyse sonar data in real time or recorded during a mission. It provides an efficient way to study the seabed, classify and locate contacts and detect changes from the last known status of an area, presenting speed, area coverage and false alarm rate unrivalled to date

“The MiMap and M-Cube solutions have made the BBPDs (Base Bomb Disposal Diving Vessels), which date back to the mid-80s, even more efficient and effective in their use of 21st century drones. MiMap is a powerful tool for processing sonar data, and was particularly appreciated by my teams responsible for operating mine warfare sonars. ​ My crew were also very pleased with the ease of installation and integration of the MiMap and M-Cube systems.” Lieutenant-Commander Claude-Louis, commander of the GPD Méditerranée and the BBPD Pluton.

Multi-static electronic warfare for improved situational awareness

Electronic Warfare (EW) enables signals in the electromagnetic spectrum to be detected, interpreted, controlled or disrupted. Today, Radar Electronic Support Measures (R-ESM) are required to simultaneously receive and identify multiple complex radars. During these exercises, Thales deployed collaborative electronic warfare resources based on UAV micro-ESM solutions in partnership with a SME (ESROE), and our multi-purpose digital radar electronic support measurement system (R-ESM) on board a frigate. In this way, the Group has demonstrated in real conditions how sensors’ collaboration in multi-domain will enable to refine situation awareness.

Thales Senior Executives Join London's Quantum Technology Event to Shape the Future of UK's Quantum Sector - The Quantum Insider,"Mon, 13 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3RoZXF1YW50dW1pbnNpZGVyLmNvbS8yMDIzLzExLzEzL3RoYWxlcy1zZW5pb3ItZXhlY3V0aXZlcy1qb2luLWxvbmRvbnMtcXVhbnR1bS10ZWNobm9sb2d5LWV2ZW50LXRvLXNoYXBlLXRoZS1mdXR1cmUtb2YtdWtzLXF1YW50dW0tc2VjdG9yL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales Group, a global leader in technology innovation, is channelling significant resources into the realm of quantum technologies, recognizing their transformative potential across various sectors. As part of this strategic focus, the company is leveraging quantum advancements to revolutionize fields such as cybersecurity, aerospace, transportation, and defense, aiming to bring about groundbreaking changes in both societal and industrial landscapes.

At the UK National Quantum Technologies Showcase held earlier this month, Thales’ top executives, Dr. Bernhard Quendt, Group Chief Technical Officer, and Dr. Paul Gosling, UK Chief Technical Officer, joined a gathering of industry leaders, academics, government figures, and investors. This event was a pivotal platform for examining the rapid progression of quantum technology and its commercial applications in the UK, a prominent hub for quantum innovation in Europe.

The showcase, orchestrated by Innovate UK and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), in partnership with the UK National Quantum Technologies Programme, served as a fertile ground for discussions on the latest quantum breakthroughs. These discussions spanned a diverse range of fields, including automotive, healthcare, infrastructure, communications, cyber, and defense, highlighting the versatile impact of quantum technologies.

Here is what Thales executives had to say:

Dr Gosling:

“The first generation of quantum technology gave us the transistor, microchip, laser and MRI scanner to name but a few. These all had a remarkable, but largely unanticipated impact on society.

We are now on the verge of the next generation of quantum technology that can deliver unprecedented computing power and sensors with a far greater sensitivity than ever before. Many of these next generation quantum devices have already been demonstrated in the laboratory.

The challenge in the next few years is to accelerate the ability to incorporate these new quantum devices into systems, work out how to exploit them and in the case of quantum computing, protect our data against computers that will be able to crack existing encryption in matters of minutes instead of years.

Importantly, the technology needs to move from the lab to production so we need to develop the local manufacturing base which will allow ready access to the best devices on the market.

As with the first generation of quantum technologies, the impact on society will likely be significant and we probably can’t fully appreciate at this point the extent to which it will impact the lives of future generations.

It is for this reason that countries like the UK and companies such as Thales see investment in and mastery of quantum as a key strategic topic.”

Dr Quendt:

“Thales is delighted to participate to this key quantum event in the UK. We are the only European player present and leading in the three areas of quantum: sensors, communications and algorithms.

This is made possible thanks to the significant skills of the employees, their passion for quantum, a considerable amount of patents and increasing investment of the Group in quantum technologies.”

Thales’ active participation and investment in quantum technologies underscore the company’s commitment to being at the forefront of emerging tech trends. By deeply engaging in these critical discussions, Thales aims to not only contribute to but also shape the direction of quantum technology development, ensuring its effective integration into future solutions that will redefine our society and industries."
UK to Procure Dutch Counter-Battery Radar for British Army - The Defense Post,"Mon, 13 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRlZmVuc2Vwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzExLzEzL3VrLWNvdW50ZXItYmF0dGVyeS1yYWRhci_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The UK will procure a new weapon-locating radar for the British Army.

The Thales Nederland Ground Master 200 (GM200) multimission radar will be procured as part of project Serpens.

It supports various missions, including simultaneous weapon location and counter-battery activities, air surveillance, and air defense, according to Thales.

Its compact design provides high mobility, short deployment time, and ease of transportation.

“The procurement with the Netherlands will be undertaken under a new memorandum of understanding and will build on the GM200 sensor as part of a multinational NATO community,” the UK Ministry of Defence stated in a notice.

Project Serpens

The 400-million-pound ($490 million) Serpens project seeks to deliver a suite of radar and sensor systems, integrating multiple current and future systems and sensors.

It includes deep find and close find radar systems and an integrated suite of acoustic and electro-optic passive sensors.

An interoperable and integrated digitized command and control system will also be acquired for the sensors, replacing the legacy standalone systems.

Upgrading Legacy Systems

Serpens was launched in 2018 as London acknowledged the need to upgrade its aging weapon locating systems: the mobile artillery monitoring battlefield asset, the hostile artillery locating system, and the AN/TPQ-49 lightweight counter-mortar radar.

The systems are reportedly about 15 years old and are due to retire by 2026.

The new systems are expected to detect, recognize, identify, and locate incoming threats — such as rockets, artillery, and mortars — from a much greater range than the existing systems.

Initial operating capability is expected by 2029, and full operating capability three years later.

The British Army’s 1 Artillery Brigade and 1st Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Brigade will field the new capability."

Thales will be involved in the integration of this equipment.

These solutions will enable offshore patrol vessels to carry out their operational missions by providing active and passive surveillance against underwater threats, aerial surface surveillance, fire control and identification.

This contract with the French Defence Procurement Agency (DGA) meets the requirements of the new Military Planning Law (LPM) for the period 2024-2030. Three new offshore patrol vessels may be added to the fleet after 2030.

Thales will supply the French Navy with a sensor suite comprising Bluewatcher sonar, NS50 radar and an IFF identification system for its new offshore patrol vessels. The first vessel will enter service in 2024.

The French Navy’s new offshore patrol vessels will replace the Estienne d’Orves class of type A69 Avisos and OPV54-class patrol boats. They will operate in French metropolitan waters, primarily across the continental shelf (i.e. to depths of 200 m) and continental slope and rise (to depths of 1,000 m). Designed for long endurance, the new multi-role OPVs will perform escort roles for front-line warships. In particular, they will be dispatched ahead of nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) as they leave port to provide intelligence and deterrence and act as scout vessels. They could also be deployed to control maritime areas above and below the surface and defend territories at sea, as well as taking part in missions to evacuate nationals.

These highly innovative and capable Thales systems have already been proven at sea and will enable the new OPVs to accomplish their missions with optimum effectiveness.

The Bluewatcher sonar is a proven system offering high underwater detection performance. With its low-draught design, it is particularly suitable for small vessels operating in shallow waters. The NS50 is the first compact 4D multi-mission AESA (Active Electronically Scanned Array) radar for low/medium-tonnage vessels. It provides air and surface surveillance capabilities as well as performing fire control functions for naval guns and missiles. The NS50 provides the highly precise data needed for rapid target acquisition, engagement of short-range fire-and-forget surface-to-air missiles, and fire control functions for engagement of surface threats by naval guns.

Complementing the NS50 radar, Thales’s advanced TSA 3522 IFF (Identification Friend or Foe) interrogator is Mode 5 certified by the US Department of Defense (DoD) AIMS Program Office for deployment on allied operations with NATO forces. This high-reliability system provides a complete cryptographic solution that identifies objects detected by the radar in complete security, and also identifies civil aircraft.

“This new contract with the French defence procurement agency will enable the French Navy to support the missions of France’s Strategic Oceanic Force (FOST), monitor the country’s maritime approaches and contribute to state action at sea. Thales is mobilising all of its resources and expertise to provide France with a suite of advanced sensors based on the very best technologies.” Philippe Duhamel, Executive Vice President, Defence Mission Systems, Thales.

English view video China's Plan to Land Astronauts on the Moon

NASA’s Gemini and Apollo missions, and the Cold War space race in general, understandably expanded the horizons of science fiction writers, who began to portray futures in which the Moon wasn’t just a celestial body to visit but a place to inhabit. This vision, as vividly portrayed in various TV shows and movies, showcased lunar bases as standard fixtures of the future. The classic 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey serves as a prime example, depicting the Moon as the site of an advanced research facility, illustrating a future where high-tech living extends beyond Earth. Likewise, the 1975 British series, Space: 1999, depicted a fully operational Moon base—Moonbase Alpha—as a hub of scientific advancement and space exploration.

Yet, as we find ourselves in the year 2023, this vision remains unfulfilled (a scenario that would have seemed unimaginable in the early 1970s). Despite many technological advancements and renewed interest in lunar exploration, particularly with NASA’s Artemis program, humanity has yet to establish a permanent base on the Moon. This is now set to change, as a project to build the first permanent lunar outpost is finally taking shape.

On November 23, Thales Alenia Space announced a contract with ASI to develop the Multi-Purpose Habitat (MPH)—a crucial component of NASA’s Artemis program that aims to establish a sustainable long-term human presence on the Moon. This project could conceivably result in the first permanent Moon base. No costs or timelines for deployment were provided, but the module likely won’t appear on the lunar surface before the 2030s.

“MPH will mark a historic milestone as the first Italian habitation module to operate on the lunar surface,” Franco Fenoglio, head of human planetary exploration and robotics programs at Thales Alenia Space, said in a statement. “This is a matter of great pride for our company, which has the unique technical and organizational skills to overcome challenges of this kind.”

The collaboration between NASA and ASI on this endeavor dates back to 2020 with a joint statement of intent in support of the Artemis program. This early agreement focused on developing crew habitation capabilities and related technologies for short-term lunar stays. In June 2022, ASI signed an agreement with NASA to conduct a preliminary design of the module. The project met a key milestone in October, successfully passing NASA’s Element Initiation Review. This progress prompted ASI to assign Thales Alenia Space the responsibility of further developing this humble lunar base.

Thales Alenia Space released an image of the MPH, revealing a cylindrical design, telescopic legs, and solar arrays. Although details are sparse, and assuming the artistic rendering is accurate, the pressurized module looks to be no longer than roughly 33 feet (10 meters) in length. It’ll be cozy for the Artemis astronauts, no doubt. From this base, astronauts will embark on missions to conduct experimental science in the lunar environment, deploy and test new technologies, and investigate potential exploration risks. Excitingly, it could lay the groundwork for NASA’s proposed lunar base camp, which calls for foundation surface habitats capable of housing as many as four astronauts at a time.

The next significant step for the project is the Mission Concept Review, scheduled for the first quarter of 2024. This review is essential for progressing to the subsequent phases and developing the critical technologies needed for long lunar stays. These technologies include advanced life-support systems and solutions to mitigate the pervasive lunar dust and the extreme temperatures experienced near the lunar south pole. Thales Alenia Space’s responsibility extends to forming an industrial consortium to move the project into its implementation phase. Interestingly, Thales Alenia Space is also working to develop three pressurized modules meant for Lunar Gateway, a planned space station that will orbit the Moon—another sci-fi-like project that’s long overdue.

Ifeoma Noelin Okolie

Thales in the UK are proud to announce that Ifeoma Noelin Okolie, Product Safety Manager and EDI Network Development Lead, was selected as one of the 51 black women in the UK and Ireland making an impact in the tech industry and her story has been featured in The Voices in the Shadow Volume 3 book.

This achievement is not only a testament to her brilliant work in the STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) industry, but also highlights the importance of representation and visible role models in STEM. In celebration of this milestone, Thales in the UK has sponsored the book launch and has acquired over 1000 copies of The Voices in the Shadow Volume 3 book, which will be shared across schools as part of our commitment to encourage and support the next generation of STEM talent.

You Cannot Be What You Can't See

Representation plays a pivotal role in shaping our aspirations and achievements. For far too long, the lack of diverse role models has hindered the progress of underrepresented groups in STEM. It’s reported that Black, Asian, and Minority Ethnic backgrounds, only account for 8% of the STEM workforce. The Voices in the Shadow book aims to give black girls and women the empowerment they need to feel that there is a place for them to flourish professionally.

Ifeoma Noelin Okolie said, “Historic stereotypes and unconscious gender-career biases limit the progression in the STEM industry. It is everyone’s responsibility to debunk these so that we can build the pipeline of STEM talent that will ultimately place STEM businesses and the UK at the forefront of innovation and technological leadership.

By sharing my story, I hope to encourage young black girls and women to pursue the career they want. I recognise the path to success can be challenging, but with hard work and perseverance, I believe anyone can excel”.

Take Action for an Inclusive and Innovative Future

We all have a role to play in creating a more inclusive and innovative future and at Thales in the UK we are committed to fostering a culture that promotes equity, diversity and inclusion.

We recognise we still have work to do, but we are taking steps in the right direction to have a workforce that is truly representative of our communities – from publishing our first Ethnicity Pay Gap in 2023, to sponsoring employees through the Solaris Executive Leadership Development Academy programme.

It’s also important to have greater representation from our leaders in the business and recently our Chief Executive and Chairman (CEO) Alex Cresswell, shared his commitment and sponsorship of both the Business in the Community Race at Work Charter, and our Thales REACH (Race, Ethnicity and Cultural Heritage) network - a network that aims to foster ally-ship with our senior management team and our business to achieve representation across all functions.

Looking forward to the future of STEM

By having voices like Ify’s amplified through The Voices in the Shadow book, it will hopefully inspire all young girls and women, especially those from black and minority ethnic backgrounds, to pursue their dreams in the STEM industry.

Thales and the University of Bordeaux conceptualized the “AutonomouS SYstem for Decoying using Uav Swarms” (ASSYDUS) project under the aegis of the Defense Innovation Agency.

It hypothesizes a swarm of small aerial drones whose collective radar cross section (RCS) resembles a fighter jet.

AutonomouS SYstem for Decoying Project

“The originality of the principle adopted is to position the drones of a swarm autonomously in order to obtain an RCS, measured by the radar of the ground-to-air system, which is equivalent to that of a combat aircraft, and to set up drones (a swarm) management so as to lure the radar which would measure the target’s Doppler,” the project description reads.

The swarm’s autonomous capability is crucial in implementing the deception and thus requires drones that could autonomously position themselves in such a way that increases their RCS.

“The autonomy of the swarm will be crucial in applications containing numerous cooperating drones or drones supervised by an operator whose concentration is already required on other activities (an airplane pilot for example),” the Defense Innovation Agency said.

The project has been validated following flight tests of several multi-rotor autonomous drones and confirmation of the results in real-time, according to the agency."
Northrop exit from UK satellite bid recasts big-ticket Skynet 6 race - Defense News,"Wed, 29 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS9nbG9iYWwvZXVyb3BlLzIwMjMvMTEvMjkvbm9ydGhyb3AtZXhpdC1mcm9tLXVrLXNhdGVsbGl0ZS1iaWQtcmVjYXN0cy1iaWctdGlja2V0LXNreW5ldC02LXJhY2Uv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LONDON — Defense contractors have been given until March next year to submit bids to provide the U.K. military with a new generation of wideband communication satellites as part of the Ministry of Defence’s Skynet 6 program.

Procurement officials for Skynet 6 released an invitation earlier this month to Airbus Defence and Space, Lockheed Martin and Thales Alenia Space with instructions to respond no later than March 2024, said an industry executive who asked not to be named while discussing internal discussions with the government.

The three companies were announced by the MoD as being shortlisted earlier this year after responding to a pre-qualification questionnaire for that segment of the program, known as Skynet Enduring Capability Wideband Satellite System.

The British are in the midst of a competition to build a network of geostationary-orbit, narrow- and wideband communication satellites to replace existing Skynet 5 capabilities, built and operated by Airbus, as part of a wider £6 billion ($7.6 billion) program.

RELATED

Submission of the bids for the wideband requirement will trigger a period of negotiations, followed by the MoD launching a second phase of the competition starting December 2024. A winner is expected to be announced the following year.

The government’s new solicitation came just days before a separate competition to build narrowband satellites for Skynet 6 was thrown into disarray when the Financial Times reported that Northrop Grumman was pulling out of the contest, seemingly leaving Thales Alenia Space as the only bidder left in the race.

The withdrawal has raised concerns here over whether the competition should be reset or proceed on a sole-source basis with the Franco-Italian bidder.

Thales Alenia Space declined to comment for this article.

For the moment, defense officials said the narrowband procurement is going ahead. But, according to the industry insider, they were furious about Northrop’s withdrawal announcement, which came as a surprise.

Northrop Grumman told the FT that it had withdrawn from the narrowband competition “after thoroughly reviewing” the government’s invitation to negotiate.

The U.S. space giant was to be the prime bidder in a partnership with Airbus Defence and Space. In return Airbus is taking the lead for the transatlantic bid for the wideband business, with Northrop Grumman as its junior partner.

Northrop Grumman declined to comment on the reasons for its withdrawal. Airbus said it wouldn’t comment on the commercial decisions of other companies.

Airbus and Northrop Grumman announced Oct. 23 that they had signed a memorandum of understanding to pursue the wideband satellite requirement in what the companies termed a “strategic partnership.”

That element of the Skynet tie-up between the two space companies continues.

Airbus is already building a satellite, known as Skynet 6A, to fill a capability gap ahead of the new generation of spacecraft becoming available in 2028.

Skynet 6A is scheduled to launch in 2025.

Dr Bernhard Quendt

Senior experts from Thales have attended an important event in London this month that has mapped out and demonstrated the future and direction of the UK quantum technology sector.

Innovation at the Forefront

Dr Bernhard Quendt (Group Chief Technical Officer) & Dr Paul Gosling (UK Chief Technical Officer) joined delegates from industry, academics, government representatives and investors at the UK National Quantum Technologies Showcase.

Strategic Investment in Quantum Technologies

Thales is investing heavily in the development of quantum technologies as one of the Group’s key core future technologies for its markets and solutions.

Breakthrough Discussions

The showcase was an opportunity to explore the expanding landscape of quantum technology commercialisation and industrial advancement in the UK, where approximately half of all quantum businesses in Europe are based.

Subjects for discussion included the major quantum breakthroughs happening across automotive, healthcare, infrastructure, communications, cyber and defence.

Dr Paul Gosling

The event was run by Innovate UK, the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), in collaboration with the UK National Quantum Technologies Programme.

Quantum Innovation: Transforming Tomorrow

Dr Gosling said: “The first generation of quantum technology gave us the transistor, microchip, laser and MRI scanner to name but a few. These all had a remarkable, but largely unanticipated impact on society.

“We are now on the verge of the next generation of quantum technology that can deliver unprecedented computing power and sensors with a far greater sensitivity than ever before. Many of these next generation quantum devices have already been demonstrated in the laboratory.

“The challenge in the next few years is to accelerate the ability to incorporate these new quantum devices into systems, work out how to exploit them and in the case of quantum computing, protect our data against computers that will be able to crack existing encryption in matters of minutes instead of years.

“Importantly, the technology needs to move from the lab to production so we need to develop the local manufacturing base which will allow ready access to the best devices on the market.

“As with the first generation of quantum technologies, the impact on society will likely be significant and we probably can’t fully appreciate at this point the extent to which it will impact the lives of future generations.

“It is for this reason that countries like the UK and companies such as Thales see investment in and mastery of quantum as a key strategic topic.”

Quantum Mastery: A Strategic Imperative

Dr Quendt added: “Thales is delighted to participate to this key quantum event in the UK. We are the only European player present and leading in the three areas of quantum: sensors, communications and algorithms.

“This is made possible thanks to the significant skills of the employees, their passion for quantum, a considerable amount of patents and increasing investment of the Group in quantum technologies.”"
France and Italy team up to build Moon habitat - New Atlas,"Wed, 29 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3YXRsYXMuY29tL3NwYWNlL2ZyYW5jZS1pdGFseS1sdW5hci1oYWJpdGF0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"France and Italy are teaming up to build a habitat for future moon bases with Franco-Italian technology company Thales Alenia Space and the Italian Space Agency (ASI) signing a contract to develop the Multi-Purpose Habitat (MPH) for NASA's Artemis project.

A lot of recent effort has been expended in aerospace circles to develop the means to return astronauts to the Moon and set up a permanent human presence there as part of NASA's Artemis project. However, once the space travelers leave their lander, they are going to need somewhere to hang their space helmets and put their feet up.

Thales Alenia Space has already been working on orbital habitats like ESA's ESPRIT and I-HAB, and Northrop Grumman's HALO, which are intended to support NASA's Lunar Gateway space station designed to support lunar and deep-space crewed missions, so they seem like a logical choice for ASI when it decided to get into building an Italian lunar habitat module.

The MPH is pretty much just a concept at the moment, though the design passed NASA's Element Initiation Review in mid-October and is scheduled to complete a Mission Concept Review (MCR) early next year. Meanwhile, the company has to coordinate with various companies to set up the complex infrastructure and supply chains that will be needed to create the actual habitat.

The concept released looks very simple – essentially, a metal cylinder sitting on articulated legs with solar panels, a communications dish, and a jaunty little ASI flag. However, this has to be more than a shiny glamping cabin with an airlock.

When operational, the MPH will have to be able to protect its inhabitants from intense, relentless cosmic radiation as well as the extreme temperatures on the lunar surface, which range from 250 °F (120 °C) during the day to -208 °F (-130° C) at night or even in the shadows. It will also have to have a life support system that can provide air, water, and stable, livable temperatures for beyond the few days the old Apollo Lunar Module of the Space Race days was capable of.

In addition to this, it will need to be connected to a power supply that can sustain the habitat through the lunar night, not be vulnerable to the clinging and destructive lunar dust, and be compatible with other hardware needed to complete the base.

Decor has not been discussed yet, though given the size of MPH, it will probably be something cozy.

""MPH will mark a historic milestone as the first Italian habitation module to operate on the lunar surface. This is a matter of great pride for our company, which has the unique technical and organizational skills to overcome challenges of this kind,"" said Franco Fenoglio, Head of human planetary exploration and robotics programs at Thales Alenia Space.

"Who's Who: Bernard Roux, CEO of Thales in Saudi Arabia and Central Asia - Arab News","Sat, 25 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFyYWJuZXdzLmNvbS9ub2RlLzI0MTUxMzYvc2F1ZGktYXJhYmlh0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Saudi novelist Sultan Ayaz’s ‘Crossing Thoughts’ to be adapted into manga

RIYADH: A fantasy novel by a Saudi author has been chosen for adaption into a manga, Japan’s famous style of graphic novel.

Sultan Ayaz finished writing the story of “Crossing Thoughts” in 2014, and says the adaptation deal with Manga Arabia is the result of a decade-long dream.

Manga are comics or graphic novels originating from Japan, conforming to a style developed in the late 19th century, though the form has antecedents in earlier Japanese art.

Ayaz’s novel, written in English, tells the story of humans defending their lands against the oppression of demons. It is about the eternal conflict between humans and demons, and a man who stands in between.

In the book, humans fight off demons by using elemental magic and swordplay.

The narrative begins with Drake, a little boy, who, along with his family, lives in tranquility in a tiny town. But the town is destroyed by a demonic attack, which Drake miraculously survives.

Three characters emerge — Aria, Ray and Amber — and study the nature of elements at the Grand College of Elements in the Kingdom of Iora. They learn how to use the elements as weapons against their demonic foes.

“Crossing Thoughts” is full of drama, action and a hint of terror.

Ayaz told Arab News: “I was always into writing in English since high school, and I was influenced by video games and anime, which strongly developed my imagination. Along with daydreaming and creating scenarios in my head, I always wanted to have my own story. So, I started to write short stories from time to time to fulfill this desire.”

The Saudi author said he was “ecstatic” to sign a deal with Manga Arabia and adapt his novel.

“‘Crossing Thoughts’ is the result of hard work and sincere dedication, and I am very proud of it. Since I finished writing the novel back in 2014, I always wanted to have it adapted into a manga or an anime, because I believe it is suitable for such adaptation,” he said.

“When I signed the contract with Manga Arabia, I felt overwhelming happiness, because, for 10 years, this is exactly what I was aiming for. I am very proud of this achievement and honored to be chosen among other talented Saudi authors to be part of this project.”

In 2020, Ayaz became one of the first Saudi novelists to have a fiction work published internationally when a British publishing house, Olympia Publishers, acquired the rights to publish “Crossing Thoughts.” The book was first released locally in 2017 and sold in Virgin Megastores.

“During this journey, I faced many obstacles and hardships that almost forced me to drop my novel and just focus on balancing my life. My father passed away. I had to drop college for a couple of years, and worked in several minimum wage jobs just to contribute to covering the living expenses of my family. But, eventually, I was inspired by my mother’s strength and decided to push myself to the limits and overcome all that, and I succeeded,” Ayaz said.

The writer used two monthly salaries just to cover the printing and publishing expenses of his work.

And though he faced some criticism because the novel was authored in English, “Crossing Thoughts” sold well in Saudi Arabia, attracting the attention of Olympia Publishers.

“I am rather pleased with ‘Crossing Thoughts.’ It is the first English-language fantasy book by a Saudi author to be published, and it helped me overcome my anxiety of failing by landing me live TV appearances and magazine features. It is the sole outcome of real commitment and persistent work,” Ayaz said.

His advice for young writers is to never aim for fame, set your goals straight and persuade audiences with continuous effort. Always remember that “the journey’s experience is priceless,” he said.

Last month, Manga Arabia chose five Saudi authors to have their novels turned into comic stories.

“Drawing Nothingness” by Ashraf Al-Faqih was already featured in the Manga Arabia Youth magazine.

“The Voyagers” by Kendah Jambi, Ayaz’s “Crossing Thoughts,” “The Awsaj” by Al-Jawhara Al-Rimal and Ghada Al-Marzouqi’s “I Live My Memories Upside Down” will also be published in Manga Arabia magazine’s print and digital editions.

The project is part of joint efforts between the Saudi Literature, Publishing and Translation Commission and Manga Arabia to support businesses in the publishing sector.

Europe is Working on a Multi-Purpose Habitat for the Moon - Universe Today,"Thu, 30 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVuaXZlcnNldG9kYXkuY29tLzE2NDU4NC9ldXJvcGUtaXMtd29ya2luZy1vbi1hLW11bHRpLXB1cnBvc2UtaGFiaXRhdC1mb3ItdGhlLW1vb24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"With NASA gearing up to send humans back to the Moon in the next few years with the Artemis missions with the goal of establishing a permanent outpost at the lunar south pole, nations are making efforts to contribute to Artemis and a permanent presence on our nearest celestial neighbor. Recently, the Italian Space Agency, formally known as Agenzia Spaziale Italiana (ASI), has taken steps to establish the first permanent outpost on the lunar surface, known simply as the Multi-Purpose Habitat (MPH). This endeavor was officially kicked by the ASI signing a contract with the French-based aerospace company, Thales Alenia Space, who specializes in space-based systems, including ground segments and satellites used for both Earth observation and space exploration.

“MPH will mark a historic milestone as the first Italian habitation module to operate on the lunar surface. This is a matter of great pride for our company, which has the unique technical and organizational skills to overcome challenges of this kind ” Franco Fenoglio, who is the Manager of Human & Robotic Planetary Exploration Program at Thales Alenia Space, said in an official statement. Thales also announced the partnership on its X account, formerly known as Twitter.

Lunar Multi-Purpose Habitat activities are officially underway.@Thales_Alenia_S signed a contract with @ASI_spazio to initiate activities on a lunar habitation module.

Despite MPH being only a concept right now, the partnership between ASI and Thales Alenia Space comes after MPH’s design passed NASA’s Element Initiation Review just last month and with a Mission Concept Review (MCR) slated to be conducted sometime in the first quarter of 2024. The goal of MPH will be its compatibility with Artemis architecture for future lunar crewed missions.

The image provided by Thales Alenia Space of its MPH shows a very simple design comprised of a single cylinder complete with solar panels and a communications dish. However, this module will be required to protect astronauts from the harsh lunar environment, including intense cosmic radiation and the lunar surface’s extreme temperature fluxes, as temperatures at the lunar equator can reach 121 degrees Celsius (250 degrees Fahrenheit) during the day and -133 degrees Celsius (-208 degrees Fahrenheit).

However, temperatures are especially important at the lunar south pole, which is the target landing site for the Artemis missions, as parts of these regions experience either constant sunlight or constant darkness. For example, data from NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter has indicated that temperatures in the darkest craters at the poles are lower than -246 degrees Celsius (-410 degrees Fahrenheit). Therefore, MPH’s design and construction will have to account for these much lower temperatures, as well.

Founded in 2007, Thales Alenia Space has a long and rich history of space-based activities, as it is the second largest industrial participant in the International Space Station (ISS), with Boeing being the largest. This participation includes building several pressurized ISS modules such as Harmony, Tranquility, Columbus Laboratory Module, Leonardo, and the Cupola, the last of which is comprised of the large windows where the astronauts conduct Earth observations.

This most recent development for the MPH continues a long-standing partnership between ASI and NASA, as ASI has sent a total of seven astronauts to space starting with STS-46 in 1992 and most recently with SpaceX Crew-4 in 2022. Additionally, Italy became an official participant in the Artemis Accords, which they signed in 2020.

How will MPH contribute to the Artemis missions in the coming years and decades? Only time will tell, and this is why we science!

As always, keep doing science & keep looking up!"

The Three Next-Generation Marketing Skills You Need - INSEAD Knowledge,"Tue, 21 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8va25vd2xlZGdlLmluc2VhZC5lZHUvbWFya2V0aW5nL3RocmVlLW5leHQtZ2VuZXJhdGlvbi1tYXJrZXRpbmctc2tpbGxzLXlvdS1uZWVk0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The marketing landscape is undergoing a remarkable transformation, driven by the rapid expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT). In 2019, the estimated number of IoT-connected devices stood at 8.6 billion, but by 2030, this figure is projected to soar to 29.4 billion. This exponential growth is blurring the boundaries between products, services, data and software, heralding a significant shift in how marketing is perceived and executed.

On September 21st, INSEAD’s Marketing and Sales Excellence Initiative (MSEI) hosted a members-only event in Fontainebleau, France, titled “Next-Generation Marketing Skills”. Speakers at this seminar delved into two pivotal inquiries: What are the competencies required for next-generation marketing? And how can Marketing & Sales professionals best collaborate with Human Resources and Learning & Development teams so their firms acquire, grow, and retain the essential talent and skills?

What’s happening in the marketing landscape?

The burgeoning array of IoT devices offers both blessings and curses for marketers. On the bright side, it presents a golden opportunity to enhance value propositions and build trust with customers. However, the complexity of managing and leveraging this ecosystem will inevitably pose challenges, making it somewhat of a curse. Moreover, as customers become increasingly aware of the growing number of sensors in everyday devices, their expectations of value from marketers are set to reach new heights.

Internally, the pressure on marketing teams will also mount. As investments in IoT marketing strategies increase, business leaders, including CEOs, will demand a clear demonstration of the return on investment (ROI). The famous line, “Show me the money,” will echo through boardrooms, underscoring the need for marketers to prove the value of their initiatives.

At the same time, putting technology to work for customer value creation will be essential. Participants and speakers reminded us that technology is an enabler of value creation, not a goal in its own right. The graveyard of failed traditional products and services serves as a stark reminder: Marketers will have to tread carefully to avoid populating a new cemetery of failed digital offerings.

Another noteworthy marketing trend is the rise of Customer Success Management (CSM). In 2021, around 130,000 LinkedIn users identified themselves as CS Managers. Just a year later, that number surged to nearly 200,000. This shift is a response to the increasing prevalence of subscription-based recurring revenue services, such as Software as a Service (SaaS) products, among many others.

To sum up, the marketing horizon is rapidly evolving, presenting new opportunities and challenges. To seize the opportunities on the horizon, companies require exceptional talent. Yet, there is a persistent shortage of such experts. The situation is exacerbated by the fact that digital natives are inclined to work for organisations that already have a firm grasp on digital marketing strategies. So, what are the “killer” marketing skills that firms need to develop or acquire?

Skill #1: Digitisation as the gateway to AI

Thomas Ritter, Professor of Market Strategy at the Copenhagen Business School, outlined the first critical skill: digitisation. In the era of IoT, firms must attract and retain individuals capable of tackling three dimensions:

1. Data: While companies are often awash with data, they need individuals who can explore methods and tools to identify valuable data that can lead to deep insights for decision-making.

2. Analytics: It's not just about obtaining data; it's about its astute analysis. Often, there's a disconnect between those gathering data and those responsible for analysing it. Bridging this gap is essential for success.

3. Permission: This is typically the domain of lawyers. Understanding the importance of permission, especially in the context of data privacy and security, is crucial. Disasters like the Cambridge Analytica scandal have proven the importance of obtaining permission. Complicating matters, permission pertains not only to legal contracts but also to societal norms and ethical considerations. This is why some firms may also wish to involve sociologists.

Firms aiming to implement AI-driven marketing in the IoT landscape will need individuals who excel in each of these digitisation areas.

Skill #2: Proactive contingency planning

Professor Ritter pointed out that in an era marked by uncertainty, where adversity, catastrophes and surprises can disrupt the market, organisational preparedness is key. Firms must be ready to navigate through disasters that could hinder their operations.

It is equally important that marketing professionals contribute to their company's crisis preparedness. Their ability to devise and execute strategies to ensure business continuity in challenging times is invaluable. From a practical perspective, this means developing contingency plans for the most likely but also the worst-case scenarios that could happen. Consequently, marketing plans become much more real.

Skill #3: Real-time communication

Successful marketers must be adept at identifying dilemmas and supporting decision-making processes. And once decisions are made, they must communicate them effectively to stakeholders. For instance, situations like Russia's seizing Russian subsidiaries of foreign firms, as experienced by Danone and Carlsberg, require decisive action and clear communication.

What is hot now may soon be replaced

Two MSEI member companies shared their experiences in developing their marketing team. Attendees first heard from Thales, a global leader in aerospace and space, cybersecurity, defence, digital identity, security and transportation. More insights followed from representatives from Schneider Electric, a global leader in digital automation and energy management.

Guest speakers from Thales emphasised the growing importance of strategic leadership skills, particularly in the context of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) issues. These issues are increasingly on the minds of Thales' customers, they said. As such, marketers must stay informed and engaged with ESG-relevant concerns.

Furthermore, one of the most significant challenges in the dynamic marketing landscape is the rapid obsolescence of skills. Thales estimates that 50 percent of the skills currently in demand will become obsolete by 2030. Marketers must thus prioritise continuous learning while never losing sight of foundational marketing principles. Thales's successful approach involves nurturing a blend of generalists and experts, and recognising the value of both types of talent.

Thales' onboarding of 12,000 new staff in 2023 has created a pressing demand for knowledge transfer and upskilling. Investing in ongoing education and professional development to keep pace with the rapidly evolving marketing landscape is a must.

As the “R&D of Sales”, Marketing at Thales is becoming an increasingly boundary-spanning function across business lines and units. Building and managing marketing content for online selling and improving sales skills – particularly on social media – have become paramount for generating leads and enhancing customer relationships. Thales shared valuable lessons learned from integrating front- and back-end marketing and sales platforms. Allowing new initiatives to gain traction “under the radar” and giving “a baby tiger” time to grow resonated well with participants’ questions on how to drive marketing change.

Killer competencies

Similar concerns were addressed by Schneider Electric’s presentation. As digitisation, electrification, and sustainability fuel its global growth, Schneider Electric is rapidly transforming its marketing function and building next-generation marketing ‘killer competencies’. Our guest speakers tackled a vast array of ‘hot’ topics, including brand transformation. They also discussed ways to seamlessly integrate the marketing and sales functions as a ‘Spectrum of One’ that leverages digital technologies to effectively and efficiently engage with all customers, large and small.

As Schneider Electric substantially grows its industrial software, service and recurring revenue businesses, the company secured new data-driven skills and introduced new agile methods as well as marketing activities and processes, to help with various business areas, from offer development to pricing.

In all, the blend of academic insights, best-practice sharing, and break-out discussions provided a rich 360-degree view of why today’s fast-changing marketing landscape calls for the development of new marketing resources and skills and how to acquire them. Companies that put the three identified skills on their radar screen will have a better chance to succeed in tomorrow’s fast-changing markets.

Galileo Second Generation satellite aces first hardware tests - Tech Xplore,"Fri, 17 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vdGVjaHhwbG9yZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIzLTExLWdhbGlsZW8tZ2VuZXJhdGlvbi1zYXRlbGxpdGUtYWNlcy1oYXJkd2FyZS5odG1s0gFSaHR0cHM6Ly90ZWNoeHBsb3JlLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjMtMTEtZ2FsaWxlby1nZW5lcmF0aW9uLXNhdGVsbGl0ZS1hY2VzLWhhcmR3YXJlLmFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:

Galileo Second Generation satellites will be launched in pairs, interconnected and connected to the launcher until separation. Each satellite weighs more than 2,000 kg and when stacked they reach a towering height of seven meters. Credit: ESA-SJM Photography

The new Galileo satellite model from Thales Alenia Space underwent mechanical and signal performance testing this summer at ESA's ESTEC Test Center. Structural models resisted launch-like noise and vibrations while an electrical model proved its ability to send Galileo signals—a major milestone in the development of Galileo's Second Generation.

Europe's Galileo is the world's most precise satellite navigation system, providing meter-level accuracy to more than 4 billion users worldwide. It currently comprises 28 satellites in orbit and 10 more are due to be launched, after which a new generation of satellites, the Galileo Second Generation or G2, will revolutionize the fleet with enhanced capabilities.

""G2 satellites will be much larger than those of the First Generation, use electric propulsion, host a more powerful navigation antenna, carry more and even better atomic clocks on board and have fully digital payloads,"" explains ESA's Galileo Second Generation Project Manager Miguel Manteiga Bautista. ""The modular architecture will offer a high degree of flexibility to accommodate more equipment and inter-satellite links will be enabled,"" he adds.

ESA, as Galileo's design authority and system development prime and on behalf of the European Commission, awarded in 2021 the first satellite-building contracts to Thales Alenia Space (IT) and Airbus Defense and Space (DE) to create two independent families of six satellites each.

Galileo Second Generation has now reached a significant milestone. Between July and September, two structural models of the Thales Alenia Space satellite and an electrical model of its navigation payload underwent mechanical and signal performance assessment at ESA's ESTEC Test Center in Noordwijk, the Netherlands. ""The models successfully passed the stringent mechanical, acoustic and radiofrequency tests required by the Galileo Program,"" confirmed Tiziano Sassorossi, Director of G2SB1 Project at Thales Alenia Space Domain Observation and Navigation Programs Italy.

Dual launch structure approved

A structural model is a mechanical representative of a satellite that has dummy masses instead of equipment, tank, propellant and appendages. Thales Alenia Space sent two structural models from Turin, Italy, to ESTEC, where they were exposed to the harsh environmental conditions present during a rocket launch.

First, the enormous sound horns at ESA's Large European Acoustic Facility (LEAF) blasted the models with noise equivalent to multiple jet aircraft lifting off simultaneously. Then, they had to withstand earthquake-like vibrations at the Hydraulic Multi-axis Shaker (Hydra). Finally, they endured a mechanical shock alike to what a satellite experiences during its separation from a rocket.

""The satellites will be launched in pairs, one on top of each other and connected to the launcher until separation, so we had to test them in this configuration. Each satellite weighs more than 2,000 kg and when stacked, they reach a towering height of seven meters. Seeing the models undergo testing in this configuration was both impressive and nerve-wracking, and we are thrilled that this new design concept for Galileo has received mechanical qualification"" said Alberto Bramante, ESA's Head of Management Office for Thales Alenia Space G2 Satellite.

Antenna under scrutiny

The G2 satellites will carry an innovative navigation payload that is fully digital and reconfigurable in orbit to actively respond to evolving user needs. An electrical model of the Thales Alenia Space payload, an aluminum box with flight-like equipment and antenna, was tested to assess its signal performance.

At ESTEC's Hertz facility, an anechoic chamber isolated from the outside world with radio- and sound-absorbing internal walls, the model radiated transmission in different modes and demonstrated compatibility with Galileo First Generation signals.

Full steam ahead for G2

The Galileo Second Generation is in full development phase after the main procurement batch was completed this summer. The European industry is now building the satellites and ultra-precise atomic clocks, and developing the system testbeds, ground mission and ground control segments.

In parallel to Thales Alenia Space, Airbus Defense and Space is developing the other half of the constellation, which will be tested for mechanical and signal performance at the company's facilities in Germany.

After all testing on the models is complete and the final design details confirmed, the first flight models of both families will be assembled and integrated before undergoing functional and environmental verification, including for some satellites a radiated test campaign in the new test chamber for space antennas being built at ESTEC, Hertz 2.0.

This new generation of satellites will start joining the existing constellation in the upcoming years. ""G2 is designed to stay in orbit for at least 15 years. We are working hard to make sure the new satellites enable our high-performing navigation system Galileo to go forward into the future with novel capabilities and additional robustness,"" declares ESA's Head of Galileo Space Segment Management Office, Andrea Cotellessa.

ESA's Director of Navigation Javier Benedicto confirms, ""This first milestone is a powerful testament to the capabilities and unwavering dedication of the European industry and reaffirms ESA's commitment to redefine the boundaries of satellite navigation. I cannot wait to see the many parts come together to bring to life an even better performing Galileo system, so this EU program can continue serving European and world citizens."""

Moon Digs

The Italian Space Agency (ASI) has teamed up with French space startup Thales Alenia Space to come up with a multi-purpose habitat that could serve as the first-ever permanent human outpost on the surface of the Moon.

It's especially relevant these days considering that America's NASA is planning to get boots on the ground as soon as late 2025 as part of its Artemis program, with the construction of a permanent habitat following sometime in the 2030s — that is, if everything goes according to plan.

And while we've seen plenty of early mockups and renders, we may finally be honing in on some actual designs of what such a future fixture on the Moon could look like.

Last week, Thales Alenia Space announced it had signed a contract with the ASI to build the ""first permanent outpost on the Moon"" — and the news has us giddy with excitement.

Thales Alenia Space has its work cut out for it. Not only does a habitat on the lunar surface need to provide astronauts with a pressurized environment and life support, but it also has to protect them from harmful radiation and possible micrometeorite showers.

The company has remained surprisingly vague about its final design, but judging by the render, it'll be cylindrical in shape and be powered by substantial solar panels. Articulated legs will keep the circular habitat from rolling over.

But will it ever actually be built, nevermind inhabited on our natural satellite? So far the company has passed NASA's Element Initiation Review, which confirms that the proposed habitat passes the space agency's needs. In 2020, the ASI signed a ""joint statement of intention"" in NASA's Artemis Program, signaling a ""mutual desire to further develop cooperative lunar exploration activities, with a specific focus on returning humans to the surface of the Moon.""

However, before the multi-purpose habitat officially becomes part of the Artemis program, it'll still need to complete NASA's Mission Concept Review early next year, a ""key milestone to move the project forward to the next phases of critical technology design and development of the module,"" according to the announcement.

Is this what the future of prolonged stays on the surface of the Moon will look like? We can't wait to find out.

Yannick Assouad PhD, Executive Vice President, Avionics at Thales

In certain parts of the world drones are already being used to transport cargo and it does not require much imagination to believe that in the not too distant future flying taxis could well become a realistic option. From there, perhaps one day some of us, our children or grand children, may even have an eVTOL in the driveway.

At the recent APG World Connect airline conference in Monaco, France the subject of electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, UAM and air traffic management (ATM) was discussed.

During the very interesting session, Yannick Assouad PhD, Executive Vice President, Avionics at Thales, said that for the sector to achieve the goal of 1.5 Euros per kilometre per passenger, eVTOLs will have to be pilotless and that air traffic control (ATC) will have to be completely automated and voiceless.

To learn more about the role Thales is playing in the development of UAM and to discuss the topic in more detail, Steven Howard of Travel News Asia sat down with Yannick Assouad to ask those questions and more.

In this interview, filmed on 2 November 2023, Steven asks why APG World Connect is so important to Thales and how it differs from other events in the industry.

Yannick shares her thoughts on how UAM is going to develop, what two types of UAM will exist, how ATC needs to change, what role AI will play, which regions of the world will be at the forefront of UAM development, how airports may need to adapt, how systems will be developed, what challenges are in the way of UAM, and what timeframe we are looking at. All that and much, much more in the video and podcast below.

European stocks struggled somewhat this week with more companies missing earnings estimates and warning about lower full-year profits.

The CAC 40 index saw a fall of 0.51% this week, clocking in at €7,045.44 on Friday morning. The Stoxx 600 did slightly better, with a mostly flat performance over the week, trading at €443.79 on Friday morning.

The FTSE 100 index fell by 8.75% this week, trading at £7.363.92 on Friday afternoon.

Investors were also concerned about more hawkish comments from US Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, indicating that rate cuts may not be on the agenda yet.

CAC 40 top weekly gainers

Schneider Electric saw a rise of 6.07% this week, following the company announcing its medium term targets and an expansion of its partnership with Compass Datacenters. The partnership will now see a new influx of $3 billion (€2.8 billion), said Schneider Electric at its Capital Markets Day meeting.

Electrical systems company Thales inched up 2.44%, on the back of increased confidence in its naval technology, as showcased to NATO in Portugal recently. The company has also announced that it will invest €100 million in its Space Smart factory, based in Rome. This will be done through the joint venture between Leonardo and Thales, called Thales Alenia Space.

Safran shares climbed up 2.29%, following an increase in Q3 2023 revenues, propped up by CFM spare part sales. It also recently launched a joint venture with India’s Hindustan Aeronautics for helicopter engines. The new venture will be known as Safhal Helicopter Engines.

L’Oreal rose 2.27% as the company’s investments in green sciences make progress, along with increased confidence in Chinese consumer demand rebounding.

Pharmaceutical giant Sanofi shares advanced 1.52% as the company ventured further into artificial-intelligence led drug discovery. However, the company is also facing increased investigations and probes for potential market manipulations.

CAC 40 top weekly losers

Payment services company Worldline showed a weekly decline of 7.19%, following an outlook cut recently. However, earlier this month, shares had plunged as much as 55%, as consumer sentiment dropped drastically, following a downbeat sales forecast.

Luxembourg-based steel company ArcelorMittal slid 5.88% this week after a mining accident in Kazakhstan shook investors, prompting the company to hand over their operations in the country to the government. ArcelorMittal is also currently in a legal battle with Liberty Steel, regarding unpaid debt totalling €140 million.

Rolling stock manufacturer Alstom shares fell 4.93%, following increased warnings about cash flows recently, as well as uncertainties regarding its Derby train factory.

Pernod Ricard dropped 4.79%, as the company reported weaker-than-expected sales for its FY2024 first quarter. The French liqueur company is also exploring divestment options for some of its wine business. It could also be caught up in the weak sentiment generally affecting the luxury goods sector at the moment, especially with Richemont missing earnings estimates recently.

Automobile manufacturer Stellantis inched down 4.70%, amid a slew of North American strikes, as well as flailing Chinese demand.

The US 10-year Treasury yields dropped 0.45% this week, with the US dollar also showing a decline of -0.32%."

The agreement was signed during the show today and will leverage the expertise of both companies to deliver world-class services for airport security and safety systems as well as maintenance services across the Middle East and Africa region.

Speaking at the show, Yannick Assouad, executive VP Thales Avionics, said the agreement with Sanad will enable the two companies to explore how to ensure more seamless operations in terms of passenger flow, as well as safer operations on the apron and runway.

Building on the foundation of a memorandum of understanding signed by the two companies in 2022, the latest agreement will see Thales lead on designing and building systems to enhance airport safety and security systems as well as the passenger experience, by deploying solutions such as its “Fly to Gate” end-to-end airport self-service experience for passengers. Meanwhile, Sanad will spearhead critical tasks such as maintenance, installation and rigorous testing.

With airports in the Middle East projected to invest more than US$150 billion in capacity expansion over the next 20 years, Thales is poised for further expansion in the region. “We have a strong presence in the UAE where we have our maintenance centre as well as in Saudi Arabia and Doha, but we are working across the region,” noted Assouad."

The premises were also drenched with red paint using repurposed fire extinguishers, symbolising the bloodshed of the Palestinian people.

Palestine Action acted on the day of the international call to action under the ‘Shut It Down for Palestine‘ banner. As ever, these activists have put their liberty on the line, using direct action to respond to Palestinian pleas for the world to stop supplying arms to, and to reject complicity with, Israel’s apartheid regime.

The action comes at a time of increasing mobilisation globally against the companies facilitating Israel’s murderous ethnic cleansing. Over 10,500 Palestinians have thus far been killed by the occupation, a genocide made possible because of the deadly supply chain which aids and abets the murderers serving in Israel’s military; specifically, Thales partners with Israel’s largest weapons company, Elbit Systems, under their joint venture ‘UAV Tactical Systems’ (or U-TacS).

Blockade Thales offices, London 09/11/23

U-TacS operates from their factory in Leicester, a site which has been targeted by direct action for over two years and which has been hit multiple times by Palestine Action since Israel’s latest genocidal onslaught commenced. This site exports equipment for military drones in considerable volumes to Israel. With Israel not being a purchaser of U-TacS’ Watchkeeper drones, these exports will undoubtedly consist of parts for Israel’s Hermes drone fleet, which was “battle-tested” on the captive population of Gaza, upon which the Watchkeeper is closely based.

The Hermes drones are used extensively in Israeli bombardments of Gaza, for either guiding bombs or for delivering munitions themselves. They are the ‘backbone’ of the Israeli Air Force’s aerial operations. The death toll attributable to these drones will be incalculable, and even when they are not being used for aerial strikes, Palestinians in Gaza have long described the constant, horrifying presence and surveillance of the Hermes. Separately to the deplorable U-TacS venture, Thales UK has also supplied arms independently to Israel of the ML5 license category reserved for sights, targeting and firing systems."

The visitors heard that the launch is on schedule for the winter of 2024-2025.

The satellite uses Thales Alenia’s flight-proven Spacebus 4000 system, and will replace Koreasat 6 currently in orbit. The contract with Thales Alenia was signed in September 2022 and is with Korean satellite service operator KT Sat, a subsidiary of KT Corp, and covered the build of Koreasat-6A to provide, broadcasting and fixed communications services.

Koreasat 6A will replace the current Koreasat 6 satellite and will deliver both fixed satellite service (FSS) and broadcasting satellite service (BSS) to South Korea. It will be positioned in geostationary orbit at 116° East.

Koreasat 6A is being fitted with six BSS transponders and 20 FSS transponders to cover all of South Korea. Slated for delivery in the fourth quarter of 2024, Koreasat 6A will weigh about 3.5 metric tons at launch and offers a design life of 15 years.

Koreasat 6A will also carry a satellite-based augmentation system (SBAS) payload to improve the continuity and availability of the Korea Augmentation Satellite System (KASS). KASS is similar to the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS). It improves the positioning and navigation performance provided by global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) for a number of different sectors, especially aviation. It has been developed to meet international standards by International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), improving the accuracy and reliability of global positioning system (GPS) signals and better ensure flight safety and efficiency, while also reducing the environmental impact of air travel.

The satellite will be launched by SpaceX."

NASA has drawn up plans to set up a permanent base on the Moon and is roping in France’s Thales Alenia Space and the Italian Space Agency (ASI) to help them build it. This will be a key element in NASA’s Artemis mission.

The dream of establishing a permanent lunar base has been a recurring theme in science fiction, notably portrayed in iconic films like “2001: A Space Odyssey” and TV series like “Space: 1999.”

On November 23, Thales Alenia Space announced a contract with ASI to develop the Multi-Purpose Habitat (MPH), a crucial component of NASA’s Artemis program aimed at establishing a sustainable long-term human presence on the Moon. While specific costs and deployment timelines were not provided, the module is not expected to reach the lunar surface before the 2030s.

The MPH project marks a historic milestone as the first Italian habitation module designed to operate on the lunar surface. Franco Fenoglio, head of human planetary exploration and robotics programs at Thales Alenia Space, expressed pride in the company’s technical and organizational capabilities to overcome the challenges posed by such an endeavour.

The collaboration between NASA and ASI on this project began in 2020 with a joint statement of intent supporting the Artemis program. The initial agreement focused on developing crew habitation capabilities and related technologies for short-term lunar stays.

In June 2022, ASI signed an agreement with NASA to conduct a preliminary design of the module. The project achieved a significant milestone in October by passing NASA’s Element Initiation Review, leading ASI to assign Thales Alenia Space the responsibility of further developing the lunar base.

The MPH, as depicted in an image released by Thales Alenia Space, features a cylindrical design with telescopic legs and solar arrays. While details are limited, the pressurized module appears to be approximately 33 feet (10 meters) in length.

This lunar base will serve as a starting point for Artemis astronauts, enabling missions to conduct experimental science in the lunar environment, deploy and test new technologies, and investigate potential exploration risks. Additionally, it could lay the groundwork for NASA’s proposed lunar base camp, accommodating up to four astronauts at a time.

The next significant step for the project is the Mission Concept Review scheduled for the first quarter of 2024. This review is crucial for advancing to subsequent phases, focusing on developing critical technologies for extended lunar stays.

Thales Alenia Space’s responsibilities include forming an industrial consortium to move the project into its implementation phase. Notably, the company is also working on developing three pressurized modules for the Lunar Gateway, a planned space station orbiting the Moon.

Their technical and organizational capabilities have been instrumental in overcoming the challenges associated with this project.

As of now, the multi-purpose habitat remains a mere concept. However, the design was granted approval by NASA‘s Element Initiation Review in mid-October and is expected to undergo a Mission Concept Review (MCR) early next year. Before the actual habitat can be created, the company needs to work with various firms to establish the intricate infrastructure and supply chains that are required to create the actual habitat.

The concept that has been revealed in renders appears to be quite simple – a metallic cylinder perched on articulated legs with solar panels, a communications dish, and an ASI flag. Nonetheless, the MPH must be more than a luxurious camping cabin that comes equipped with an airlock. When the MPH is operational, it will protect its inhabitants from intense cosmic radiation and extreme temperatures on the lunar surface. Additionally, the MPH will have a life support system that can provide air, water, and stable, livable temperatures for beyond a few days. Not much about the project has been revealed yet.

The project’s next crucial challenge will be to complete the Mission Concept Review (MCR), expected in the first quarter of 2024. The review will move the project forward to the next phases of critical technology design and development of the module.

In this initial phase, Thales Alenia Space will be tasked with coordinating an industrial consortium of large, small, and medium-sized companies from the national supply chain to advance the program to its implementation phase. Through module design activities and future collaboration on Italian technological and production capabilities within the Italian ecosystem, the primary objective remains to deliver a secure, comfortable, and multifunctional habitation module for astronauts, able to interface with other systems and components in the Artemis architecture.

“MPH will mark a historic milestone as the first Italian habitation module to operate on the lunar surface. This is a matter of great pride for our company, which has the unique technical and organizational skills to overcome challenges of this kind,” commented Franco Fenoglio, Head of human planetary exploration and robotics programs at Thales Alenia Space."

Expert Q&A: Decarbonising data centres - The Engineer,"Fri, 10 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWVuZ2luZWVyLmNvLnVrL2NvbnRlbnQvaW4tZGVwdGgvZXhwZXJ0LXFhLWRlY2FyYm9uaXNpbmctZGF0YS1jZW50cmVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Experts from Thales Alenia Space and Deep Green offer their take on some of the technologies that could help ensure our insatiable demand for data is compatible with the push for net zero

Today, data centres are thought to account for around two per cent of global electricity usage, which is more than the total of the UK electricity market. And without a fundamental technological shift, the growing demand for the services they provide is expected to push this figure closer to 15 per cent, making them one of our planet’s biggest consumers of electricity.

In response, innovators and engineers are exploring a range of options that could improve the efficiency of these engines of the digital age – including the prospect of locating them within environments and applications that can reduce the cost of cooling; making practical use of the waste heat generated; and even tapping into new sources of energy.

We spoke to two organisations at the forefront of thinking in this area: Thales Alenia Space, which is exploring the feasibility of using space-based data centres to tap into extraterrestrial solar energy, and clean energy startup Deep Green, which is commercialising technology that enables sites such as swimming pools to provide free cooling in return for free waste heat.

Yves Durand, Director Technology at Thales Alenia Space and expert of the ASCEND feasibility study

Mark Bjonsgaard, CEO - Deep Green

Why is it important to explore the development of more energy efficient data centres?

YD: The number of data centres is growing extremely rapidly, following the rate of our data usage (+30% every year). There is no pause in sight, with new data processing intensive usages such as new AI applications, new digital usages, working methods, etc. The problem is the massive energy consumption associated with data servers: experts project that the energy needed for data centres could even reach 20% of our global energy resources before 2050.

Strict digital sobriety measures are difficult to envision today, considering the need for digital, the billions of objects and vehicles soon to be connected through more performant communications, as 5G or 6G. The data centre industry is making great efforts to reduce its energy consumption, but the only available leverage today is the reduction of the energy spent in cooling (such as immersion in oceans, implementation in northern countries, drawing of cold underground water) and a race for more efficient electronics technology.

As we need to rapidly get rid of fossil fuels to reach carbon neutrality, the pressure on renewable energy production will become very high. If data centres could make use of a completely different energy source, such as extraterrestrial solar energy, it would relieve the effort to provide on ground the renewable energy for essential human needs such as transport, heating, agriculture, manufacturing, etc.

MB: The data centre industry already uses one to three per cent of the UK’s electricity supply and it’s generally assumed that we will need 10 times the amount of data centres in the next 10 years. The sector is just never going to be able to get its hands on around 20% of the country’s electricity supply so there’s an economic argument. Then there’s the sustainability argument, which is that it’s nuts in a climate emergency that we’ve got an industry that takes three per cent of the world’s electricity supply and literally uses billions of gallons of water to inject it into the atmosphere in the form of waste heat.

Mark Bjornsgaard, CEO of Deep Green, at Exmouth Leisure Centre - Deep Green

What’s more, data centres are not going to be able to cope with type of compute that’s coming. As AI takes over [the GPUs used in them] will get really hot and conventional data centres won’t really be able to cope with them because they’ll take so much power and they create so much heat.

The data centre industry is going to be like the fossil fuel industry in the next 10 to 20 years if it doesn’t do something about this.

Outline the solutions you are exploring or developing to address this issue?

YD: The goal of the ASCEND study is to determine whether placing future data centre capacity in orbit, using solar energy outside the earth’s atmosphere, will substantially lower the carbon footprint of digitalization. If the answer is yes, space data centres could become an active contributor to the EC Green Deal objective of carbon neutrality by 2050, which would justify the investment required to develop and install such a large space infrastructure system.

Data centres are an ideal candidate for orbital location because only data is transferred, be it through fiber optics cables on ground, or through optical feeder links in space. The ASCEND study already showed that datacentre stations could be located in orbits permanently illuminated by the sun, minimizing the need for on-board batteries, and compatible with current access delay requirements.

The Thales Alenia ASCEND study is exploring whether orbital, solar-powered data centres could help reduce the carbon footprint of digitalisation - Thales Alenia Space

There is today no major technology obstacle to building large infrastructures in space that could house the equipment needed for data centres. The “old” space station ISS is an example of such a large space infrastructure, and the technologies have greatly evolved recently in on-orbit services. The foreseen infrastructure would be unmanned, which would also make it more accessible in terms of cost. It will require in-orbit assembly, inspection, maintenance and repair, which is now possible given the recent advances in robotics and AI based anomaly detection.

A major challenge will be the availability of a heavy, reusable and ‘green’ launcher. The numerous launches would have a carbon and environmental impact, which needs to be quantified, and compared with the carbon emissions associated with the equivalent ground data centres infrastructure. This is a major part of the ASCEND study.

MB: We extract heat from our on-site edge data centres to provide hot water for swimming pools, blocks of flats and a range of other industries. We supply and fit Deep Green digital boilers for free and pay for the energy they use. In return we ask for space for containers and sufficient grid and internet connection.

The business is really predicated on two new types of cooling technologies that are coming in: The direct chip, which is kind of like the heat sinks that you see on gaming computers where they’re cooled by liquid, and immersion - where you literally dump the whole computer in an inert oil, the oil gets hot, a convection current starts and then you flow that around a closed loop into a heat exchanger.

It’s really simple. It’s computers in massage oil, basically. We’ve framed it as “we’re giving away free heat, aren’t we magnanimous” but actually - of course - we’re being provided with free cooling. It’s genuine symbiosis.

What’s the current status of your work in this area?

YD: The study is funded by the European Commission. It started in January 2023 and is currently at midterm, with a final review foreseen in April 2024. The System Requirement Review and Baseline Architecture kick off gave the basis for detailed analysis to be performed during the following months, and to assess the feasibility of such project and the associated requested new development or technology gap to be crossed.

There is today no major technology obstacle to building large infrastructures in space that could house the equipment needed for data centres

The ASCEND study involves 11 partners from different domains and with complementary expertise. The consortium brings together major players in the fields of environment analysis (Carbone 4, Vito), data centres architecture, hardware and software (Orange, CloudFerro, HPE), space systems development (Thales Alenia Space, Airbus, DLR), and access to space (ArianeGroup).

MB: At Exmouth Swimming pool [where Deep Green data servers are being used to heat the water] we’re currently doing about 20 to 30% of the load of the pool and by Christmas we’ll be saving them about £22,000 and doing about 60% of the load of the pool. As well as that we’re involved in the Barking Riverside district heating project, where heat from a data centre will be used to prime the largest water source heat pump in Europe. That’s going to be one of our first of many, district heating sites.

30% of all industrial applications can house a data furnace. We estimate there’s a £3.4 trillion retrofit opportunity across Europe [in applications including district heating systems, swimming pools, distilleries, laundries, bakeries, and food production]. We’ve already had something like 5000 sites come in and make contact with us since March.

What are the longer-term ambitions for your work in this area?

MB: We see ourselves as the next version of AWS (Amazon Web Servives). If we were sitting here 30 years ago designing what the data centre industry would be we would say, well, we’ll just break it all up and put it where the heat’s needed and we wouldn’t even debate it.

When you think that anywhere that needs hot water could house a little bit of a data centre you start to realise that actually you can start to change the whole structure of society by giving away free energy. It gets quite existential and a bit exciting.

The data centre industry is going to be like the fossil fuel industry in the next 10 to 20 years if it doesn’t do something about this.

It’s not just going to be us doing it like this. In the same way as Tesla opened up their IP and said “everyone use it” because they genuinely just wanted to get everyone else making electric cars, we’re in that phase where it’s like really the more the merrier.

14 to 15 per cent of the UK’s energy mix is heating homes and offices and so when you do the math, actually what happens is that you see in the next 20 years we’ll just distribute data centres around our towns and cities and then we’ll heat all our homes for free. That’s the upside of this. The story actually ends happily ever after.

Given our exponentially growing demand for data will it ever be possible to reduce the sector’s energy demands whilst delivering improved performance?

YD: Current data centres consume energy during their overall operational life, and the tendency is toward the increase of such consumption, with more and more power demanding applications, made possible by improved performance. Moore’s law seems to have reached some limit, and further increase of performance will require even more power consumption.

Yves Durand - Director of Technology at Thales Alenia Space ASCEND feasibility study lead - Thales Alenia Space

Data centre consumption can be reduced either through digital sobriety, new very low power processing technology, or the removal of some data centres capacity from the power grid.

The ASCEND project is assessing this last option.

MB: No, but that’s brilliant news because the more compute we need, the more free heat we can generate for society. The whole data centre industry can just explode into the gap which is home and industrial heating, and it can be there as a brilliant welcomed partner. The net effect of this is actually we think our local towns and cities will be regenerated with this idea of free heat.

The Romans, they had their baths, and even if you were pretty much the poorest person in Rome you could still go to the bath. That sort of psychology of us aggregating around free or very cheap heat will, we think, actually reinvigorate our societies."

In a statement Palestine Action said: “On the day of the international call to action under the 'Shut It Down for Palestine' banner, Palestine Action have this morning acted on that call.

“As ever, these activists have put their liberty on the line, using direct action to respond to Palestinian pleas for the world to stop supplying arms to, and to reject complicity with, Israel's apartheid regime. The action comes at a time of increasing mobilisation globally against the companies facilitating Israel's murderous ethnic cleansing.

“Over 10,500 Palestinians have thus far been killed by the occupation, a genocide made possible because of the deadly supply chain which aids and abets the murderers serving in Israel's military.""

Palestine Action has accused the UK branch of Thales of supplying weapons to Israel.

""Thales partners with Israel's largest weapons company, Elbit Systems, under their joint venture 'UAV Tactical Systems' (U-TacS),"" the group said.

“U-TacS operates from their factory in Leicester, a site which has been targeted by direct action for over two years. This site is used for the export of equipment for military drones in huge volumes to Israel.”

Israel has asserted its right to defend itself - a right supported by the UK government - and has carried out an extensive attack in Gaza, aiming to end the threat to its people from Hamas. The terrorist attacks on Israel on October 7 left more than 1,400 dead and Hamas is holding hundreds of hostages.

The Hamas authorities in Gaza say more than 10,000 people have been killed in the Israeli attacks.

The Met Police said two people were arrested on suspicion of criminal damage.

In a statement the Met said: “This morning we responded to a report of criminal damage to a building in Thomas More Square, Wapping. The building is coated in red paint.

“When officers arrived two people were laying on the ground outside the building and had attached themselves together with padlocks.”"

The company, which was losing over £3million a year, said it had been unable to overcome the business’s problems in a highly competitive market.

Employees spoke to the County Gazette about the pending closure and the effect the announcement had had on them.

One man, who did not wish to be named, said one number of staff walked out when they were told the news.

“We received e-mails at 11.10am saying there would be a company briefing at 11.30pm,"" he said.

“There were no managers there when we walked in, which set the alarm bells ringing.

""When they came into the room you could see by their faces that they weren’t happy.

""They genuinely thought it might work, so it has hit them hard as well.

“Then a number of staff walked out when they told us what was happening and asked if anyone had any questions.”

The employee described the decision as devastating and said the closure would have a profound effect on everyone involved.

A second Thales worker, who also wished to remain anonymous, said: “There was never a chance we could turn bad debt around in two months.

“At the moment we have more questions than answers and we’re getting no feedback.

“The first people could go in 90 days, but we don’t know who’s at risk of going first.

“I think it’s a hopeless cause because it’s the second time they’ve done this and it was just a technicality that saved us in February.”

Despite the pending closure the employee said staff were still working overtime to keep up with the volume of work.

Thales said in a statement that it had been a sad day for the workforce and the community of Taunton, and the decision had not been easy.

The company then started a 90-day consultation process with the trade union and vowed to provide as much support as possible to help people find alternative jobs in the area."
