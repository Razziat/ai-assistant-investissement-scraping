Thales Alenia Space expands exploration with larger 3D printed parts - 3D Printing Industry,"Thu, 18 May 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vM2RwcmludGluZ2luZHVzdHJ5LmNvbS9uZXdzL3RoYWxlcy1hbGVuaWEtc3BhY2UtZXhwYW5kcy1leHBsb3JhdGlvbi1sYXJnZXItM2QtcHJpbnRlZC1wYXJ0cy0xMTM1NzQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Franco-Italian aerospace company Thales Alenia Space aims to expand its 3D printed space exploration.

The company has recently supported the launches of the Telkom 3S, SGDC and KOREASAT-7 satellites with metal 3D printed parts, and will now scale up production for larger structures.

The number of metal 3D printed parts launched into space by the Franco-Italian company now totals 79 – 47 of which are different designs. Additionally, Thames Alenia Space has sent hundreds of 3D printed polymer tube supports thus far.

Earlier in 2017, Thales Alenia Space worked on the Iridium NEXT satellites which signified the first flight application of 3D printed thermoplastic through its propulsion system tube supports.

Largest 3D printed space parts

Thames Alenia Space’s use of 3D printing began two years ago with the launch of its first 3D printed aluminium antenna support. At the time, the aluminium antenna brackets were the largest 3D printed parts to be launched in space. Since then, all of Thames Alenia Space’s telecommunication satellites have incorporated additive manufactured antenna supports.

Thames Alenia Space uses laser beam melting machines to produce the metal parts and previously made use of a Concept Laser Xline 1000R machine to create initial antenna brackets.

This year, Thames Alenia Space will look to expand the use of 3D printing to again create larger parts. The company explains it is currently working on dual antenna supports for a new telecom satellite which will launch in the near future. These dual antenna supports will be large in size at 480 x 378 x 364 mm (18.9 in x 14.9 in x 14.3 in).

Part consolidation and widespread use

Satellite launches are increasing the incorporation of 3D printing for weight reductions and enhanced design freedom. Satellite brackets in particular have shown significant application for 3D printing with other programs such as Canada Makes working on a 3D printed bracket to launch later in 2017.

Additive manufacturing also enables parts to be produced with increased functionality, as Florence Montredon additive manufacturing technology development manager at Thames Alenia Space explains. Montredon states the company’s “development efforts are now focusing on integrating several functions in a single part, such as mechanical, thermal and radio-frequency functions.”

Reducing the number of parts is another key benefit of the technology as it reduces assembly time and simplifies the design process. Californian rocket manufacturers, Aerojet Rocketdyne has successfully reduced parts in its Bantam rocket engine from 100 to just 3 additive manufactured parts.

Thales Alenia Space launches multiple 3D-printed parts for space apps - Optics.org,"Thu, 18 May 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiH2h0dHBzOi8vb3B0aWNzLm9yZy9uZXdzLzgvNS8zNi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Applications

Thales Alenia Space launches multiple 3D-printed parts for space apps

18 May 2017

Most commonly used technique is laser beam melting on bed of metal powders including aluminum and titanium.

With the recent launches of the Telkom 3S, SGDC and KOREASAT-7 satellites (see below), plus satellites in the Iridium Next constellation, Thales Alenia Space (TAS) has now sent into orbit at least 79 metal parts made by additive manufacturing (3D printing) and 350 polymer tube supports so created for chemical propulsion systems.

The work started two years ago, in April 2015, with the first 3D-printed aluminum antenna support, sent into orbit on the TurkmenAlem MonacoSat satellite. Since then, all of the company’s telecommunications satellites employ lightweight 3D-printed antenna supports and reflector fittings.

In mid-January 2017, with the successful launch of the first Iridium NEXT satellites, TAS also launched into orbit satellites with propulsion system tube supports, the first flight application of thermoplastic additive manufacturing.

TAS says its next step will be the manufacture of larger parts using this process, such as dual antenna supports for a new telecom satellite, ""to be launched shortly"".

These parts measure 480 x 378 x 364 mm, which the company says represents ""a real challenge from the manufacturing standpoint"".

“Our development efforts are now focusing on integrating several functions in a single part, such as mechanical, thermal and radio-frequency functions,” said Florence Montredon, Additive Manufacturing Technology Development manager at TAS. “The challenge lies as much in the design process as in the production technique.”

Space benefits

TAS believes that additive manufacturing provides real benefits for spaceborne products. For example, it allows the design and manufacture of single-piece structures, as opposed to a conventional manufacturing approach, which entails the assembly of several different parts to form a structure.

The consequecne is a significant reduction in weight, along with cost savings. The tube support illustrates the technique's ability to replace several parts with a single-piece structure, thanks to additive manufacturing, while also introducing new functions.

Additive manufacturing also means greater design freedom and the absence of tooling, which makes it ideal for producing complex parts – with curves, holes or cavities – that are typically produced in small runs or on a one-off basis.

KOREASAT-7 telecommunications satellite.

Out of the total of 79 parts produced by AM so far, 47 have different designs and are used on the satellites, where they carry out 13 different functions. TAS adds that some of these parts are design variants for a given function. The tube supports are made of a polymer and are all identical, with 35 used on each of the ten satellites launched to date.

TAS generally focuses on metallic materials for this process, including aluminum and titanium. The most commonly used technique is laser beam melting (LBM), with a bed of metallic powder. One or several lasers progressively melt the powder, layer by layer, in a controlled atmosphere.

This technology demands a high level of expertise to control the various design restrictions and the “printing” machine’s complex settings. Producing a part may take several hours or even days of continuous printing.

About SGDC and KOREASAT-7

SGDC is a dual (civil-military) satellite for the customer Visiona, a joint venture of aircraft manufacturer Embraer and Brazil’s telecommunications operator, Telebras. It will provide sovereign and safe means for the strategic communications of the government and the defense and reduce the digital divide in Brazil by giving internet access to the whole country.

This program reflects the close collaboration between Thales Alenia Space and Brazil, which includes the training of 30 Brazilian engineers in space industry techniques as well as the integration aboard the satellite of a structure panel made by the Brazilian company CENIC.

KOREASAT-7 was launched for the South Korean telecom/media service provider KT Sat. The satellite will provide Internet access, multimedia, broadcasting and fixed communications services for South Korea, Philippines, Indonesia and India. The KOREASAT-5A satellite is now being integrated by Thales Alenia Space and will later join KTSAT’s fleet.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.5835608243942261}",positive,0.5835608243942261,1

In the Needle Doctor room on a Clearaudio Innovation turntable you’ll see the much talked about $750 Hana SL cartridge that includes a Shibata stylus, playing through a Musical Surroundings Super Nova 3 battery powered phono stage ($5000).

On the lower level, in the Kyomi Audio room featuring Vivid Audio Giya G1 Series II loudspeakers ($68,00/pr) see the least expensive TechDas turntable, the Air Force 3, costing around $29,750. The turntable includes an air bearing platter, vacuum hold-down and an outboard motor. Mounted on the ‘table are the Graham Elite ($12,000) and new Graham Phantom 3.0 tone arms. Electronics are by Jadis (JA200 MKII monoblocks ($33,900/pr, JP200MC tube preamplifier with MC phono stage $32,900) .

In veteran retailer Galen Carol’s room we saw the Basis Signature turntable and the SA-9 Super Arm, the final arm design from the late A.J. Conti.

In another room we saw and heard the new $2,200 (with arm) VPI Scout Prime fitted with Ortofon 2M Black cartridge in a system with Rogue Audio electronics and a pair of new Revel speaker system. In the background, the new Intervention Records reissue of The Flying Burrito’s Gilded Palace of the Sun.

The Swiss Thales TTT compact ‘table ($14,500) and Simplicity tangential tracking pivoted arm ($9200) fitted with an Ikeda KAI ($8500) cartridge was producing sweet sound through the Ypsilon VPS-100 tube-based phono preamp ($26,000) and MC 26L step-up transformer ($6200) feeding a Ypsilon Phaeton Integrated amplifier ($25,000), driving a pair of Wilson-Benesch Discovery II speakers ($28,000/pr). The speaker features an unusual “let it all hang out” configuration that mounts the woofer from the bottom of the baffle, with the basket and magnet exposed and seemingly in need of an athletic supporter—ok maybe that’s just me. The “spare tire” on the floor is a W-B subwoofer.

The Kronos Pro turntable with its unique counter-rotational platters (circa $35,000, add $8500 for the Black Beauty arm) was in the David Michael Audio room along with Nagra electronics and “classic” Graham Audio speakers including the ones shown, which were the BBC LS 5/9 stand-mount monitors.

The big news in the Technics room was the final pricing of the SL-1200GR introduced at CES 2017. Technics was hoping to bring it in “under $2000” and they’ve managed to do it for $1699.

The beautiful recently introduced $34,000 Bergmann Galder turntable (a tired Angie mistakenly identifies it as the “Magne”) features an air bearing platter with vacuum hold down and an air bearing tangential tracking arm. Angie says base is “stainless steel” but she means aluminum. The cartridge is a $6000 Phasemation PP-2000. The rest of the system features the Sutherland Audio Phono Block four chassis phono preamplifier ($10,000). Amplification was via the AvantGarde XA integrated amp that outputs 1 watt Class A and 150 watts of Class A/B power. The speakers are the powered woofer, DSP controlled Avantegarde Acoustics Zero TA covered in our CES 2017 show report.

The project is being implemented for the first time in the Central Asian region and will meet all state requirements.

“The station is constantly on duty, operating day and night. It showed itself as really good equipment, overlapping almost half of the central region,” said military expert and air defence forces senior engineer Tair Rakhimzhanov.

The first radar station prototype, produced in Kazakhstan in 2014 and tested for three years, has been guarding the capital for the same amount of time. The Ministry of Defence has plans that domestic radar stations will be able to place the entire country under their protection in the near future. The second station will be delivered to Karaganda this year.

In total, the plant will produce four radars per year. New stations will be installed in West Kazakhstan to protect the Caspian region and Almaty. The stations, with a maximum range reaching 500 kilometres, have a market price of approximately $22 million.

Kazakhstan is one of nine countries which received the French technology for radar station production. The Ground Master 400 is used in Germany, Canada and Finland. Recently, the North Atlantic Alliance received 10 French stations.

The Officials at the Kazakh Ministry of Defence see great potential in the systems to not only to cover the nation’s requirements, but also for export.

“A good understanding of this system and improving it is the way to enter the world market. The creation of other locators with medium, short range for border guards will give us prospects in the future,” said Granit-Thales Electronics deputy general director Marat Amanzholov.

Ground Master 400 uses digital beam-forming technology. Thales, its developer, combines the expertise of 64,000 employees and operations in 56 countries, which has made the company a key player in guarding vital infrastructure and protecting the national security interests of dozens of countries.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999735355377197}",neutral,0.9999735355377197,0

The new-generation Griffon 6×6 multi-role armoured vehicles (VBMR) are being acquired by the French Defense Procurement Agency (DGA) to replace the ageing fleet of Véhicule de l’Avant Blindé (VAB) 4×4 armoured personnel carriers, which have been operational with the French Army since 1976.

The vehicle is developed by a consortium of French companies, comprising Nexter Systems, Renault Trucks Defense, and Thales. It can be configured for various roles such as troop transport, command post, artillery observation vehicle, recovery, refuelling, and medical evacuation.

The armoured carrier variant is intended for transportation of infantrymen, mounted troops, weapon systems and cargo to the battlefield under high protection.

Orders and deliveries of the VBMR

Renault Trucks Defense and Nexter Systems signed a pact to perform a detailed VBMR design following a proposal request in November 2011.

The French DGA unveiled its plan to acquire a total of 1,722 Griffon multi-role vehicles under its Scorpion programme in November 2014. A contractual agreement for the manufacture of the VBMR vehicles was signed in December 2014.

A Griffon VBMR prototype was introduced during Eurosatory 2016 international defence and security industry trade show in Paris, France, in June 2016.

The consortium secured an order from the DGA for the production 319 Griffon 6×6 tactical vehicles in April 2017. The first units are expected to be delivered in 2018.

Griffon VBMR design and features

Based on a 6×6 all-terrain truck chassis, the Griffon VBMR features modular architecture with a maximum gross vehicle weight of 24t. It is manned by a crew of two and can accommodate up to eight personnel.

The layout of the armoured vehicle is conventional with engine compartment located in the front section, crew cabin in the middle and troop compartment at the rear.

The protected crew cabin is fitted with a bullet-resistant windscreen and two side doors featuring bulletproof windows. The troop compartment has two small bulletproof viewing windows on either side. A large rear door provides entry and exit for troops from the rear.

Two firing ports are provided on rooftop hatches of the troop compartment for use by the infantry.

The vehicle is equipped with a protective overpressure system to maintain constant overpressure, and an air-conditioning unit to create a comfortable working environment.

“The vehicle is developed by a consortium of French companies, comprising Nexter Systems, Renault Trucks Defense, and Thales.”

The Griffon tactical vehicle is transportable by air, land and sea modes.

Armament and protection of Griffon VBMR

The French Army’s new multi-role armoured vehicle is equipped with a remote-controlled weapon station armed with a single 12.7mm or 7.62mm MAG 58 heavy machine gun or 40mm automatic grenade launcher.

Optional armament of the vehicle includes FELIN soldier system, 81mm mortar, and MMP medium-range missile.

Designed in accordance with high levels of NATO STANAG standard, the Griffon VBMR offers improved protection over VAB. It can withstand small arms fire, shell splinters, improvised explosive device (IED) and mine blasts.

The on-board chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) defence suite protects the vehicle’s occupants from CBRN threats.

The crew survivability is further improved by a set of eight smoke grenade launchers fitted to the weapon station.

Observation and countermeasures

The remote weapon station has a day-and-night sighting system, which provides vehicle commander and gunners with increased field of view for detection, recognition and identification of targets.

The remote weapon station is coupled with METRAVIB’s SLATE acoustic sniper localisation system.

The Griffon VOA artillery observation vehicle variant incorporates Safran’s Paseo new-generation electro-optical system.

Consisting of an inertial navigator and high-resolution sensors, the optronic system also provides surveillance, artillery observation, fire control and geolocation information.

Navigation and communications

Safran Electronics & Defense’s Epsilon 10 terrestrial navigator is fitted to provide accurate position, autonomous engagement and navigation capabilities to the Griffon multi-role armoured vehicle.

The VOA version comes with a navigation system based on hemispherical resonating gyro (HRG) technology.

The French Army’s Scorpion Combat Information System (SICS) is installed to allow troops to share information in the battlefield. The vehicle is also equipped with Thales CONTACT (Digital Tactical Communications and Theater) radio system, which enables automated information sharing and flat networking.

Countermeasures of the vehicle include barrage jammer, infrared jammer, fire detection system, laser detector, and missile detection system.

Engine and performance of Griffon VBMR

IMDEX Asia is an international maritime defence show taking place in Asia Pacific, which comprises an exhibition, strategic conferences and warship displays. It has gained recognition as a global platform to address the issues within the naval and maritime security industry, showcasing the latest naval technologies and connecting key players from navies, government and industry.

During the opening by the Defense Minister of Singapore, Mr Ng Eng Hen, it was announced that the Singapore Navy will acquire two more Type 218SG diesel-electric submarines in addition to the two that have already been ordered, thus making it four in total.

At IMDEX Asia 2017, Thales showcased its state-of-the-art innovations in its Autonomous Underwater and Surface System (AUSS) for the first time in Asia-Pacific, and the SEA FIRE radar.

This unmanned maritime system concept (AUSS) is quite different from anything that has ever existed before. The platform was developed by Thales with 19 SMEs and combines a whole host of technological breakthroughs. The autonomous vehicle can operate in complete discretion under the water as well as on the surface. The system actively-avoids obstacles and performs safely and reliably even in shallow waters around port facilities. It is designed for civil as well for military missions, including surveillance, intelligence gathering, counter- terrorism, mine countermeasures, anti-submarine warfare (ASW), monitoring of offshore oil and gas facilities and shipwreck search and recovery. After a series of tests, potential customers showed a great deal of interest in the new hybrid drone concept when it was unveiled at Euronaval 2016.

The next generation of the Thales SEA FIRE is an all-digital radar with four flat-panel arrays, that meets the requirements of a broad range of missions, from ship self-defence to extended air defence. SEA FIRE is designed to perform in the complex conditions of the littoral or in heavily jammed environments to counter conventional, asymmetric or emerging air and surface threats. The French Defence Ministry announced on 21 April a contract with DCNS for the development and construction of five intermediate-size frigates (FTIs) intended for the French Navy, for delivery in 2023 with entry into active service in 2025. DCNS are proposing a French version of its new BELH@RRA frigate intended for the international market, equipped with the new SEA FIRE radar.

MBDA showcased at IMDEX 2017 the Sea Viper Weapon System, which had received a £175 million contract from the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) for further in-Service Support to the Sea Viper weapon System, securing a key capability of the Type 45 fleet in April 2017.

This contract will cover in Period 1, the continuing in-service support to the Sea Viper system, including the Aster missile that protects the Royal Navy’s Type 45 destroyers, for the next five years. The unified support environment (USE) provides in-service support to UK MoD Weapon Systems and Missiles in a portfolio environment. The USE approach is designed to reduce support workload and administrative costs and has already been successfully applied to several other MBDA programmes, including ASRAAM, Brimstone and Storm Shadow.

In January 2005 DCNS opened an office in Singapore and DCNS Far East signed a contract in January 2016 with the Singaporean Navy for the supply of spare part kits for the major maintenance of the six Formidable-class frigates, today considered as the most advanced close cooperation with local shipyard Singapore Technology Marine : while the first frigate was built in DCNS shipyard in Lorient (France), the other five were built in Singapore, through a full transfer of technology.. It has improved its service offering with the installation of a floating security barrier in Singapore’s naval base in 2012. The purpose of this barrier is to ensure the safety of military vessels against a possible attack by sea. Since then, the subsidiary has been in charge of the maintenance and operations of this barrier.

DCNS have been developed since, by the deployment of new activities to serve the civilian customers and in particular the underwater inspection by remotely operated vessels (ROV). These submarine robots allow underwater inspections of structures in diversified fields such as oil and gas, port infrastructures, ships, etc. Since 2013, DCNS Far East has already carried out some thirty submarine inspection projects in Singapore but also more widely in Asia.

The Series 30 SOM Search Optronic Mast dedicated to conventional or nuclear submarines was present in the SAFRAN booth at IMDEX Asia 2017. It is the most modern stealthy and complete search optronic mast system. Modular and highly reliable, the non-hull penetrating mast can simultaneously accommodate up to four advanced optronic channels and a full range of the electromagnetic antenna. In addition to its advanced anti-surface search capabilities, it can function in automatic aerial alarm mode, make use of a laser, receive telecommunications and use an ESM electronic warfare sensor.

SAFRAN also showed the new Series 30 AOM (based on Series 30 SOM), which is a very discreet non-penetrating attack optronic mast. Perfectly suited to all types of submarines it can simultaneously combine up to four optronic sensors and an ESM/GPS antenna. The Series 30 AOM features very low signature thanks to its extremely small volume above the water and its fully digital technology allows a high level of optronic performance.

SAFRAN also presented EUROFLIR 410SP which incorporated up to 7 high-performance sensors, a latest-generation thermal imager, HDTV colour zoom camera, multi-channel spotter with colour HD TV sensor and low-light level TV or short-range infrared range (SWIR) sensor, laser rangefinder, laser pointer and laser illuminator as an option.

Under the French pavilion lead it by the GICAN, an important number of PME was present like DCI, LACROIX and others. In the booth of CNIM at IMDEX Asia, 2017 could be seen on a TV screen a movie showcasing the company’s L-CAT Ship to Shore landing craft, a combat proven vessel, in service in the French Navy since 2011 and the Egyptian Navy since 2016. It expands the strategic capabilities of major amphibious units and increases the tactical options of expeditionary forces in all their missions. Embarked on an LSD ship it can carry up to 80 tonnes, that is either a tank or any armoured vehicles or soldiers with their equipment. Its speed loaded is 18 knots and 30 knots when empty.

The L-CAT Shore to Shore is a key enabler of force projection on a regional scale and is suitable for a stand-alone long-range amphibious, disaster relief and maritime security operation. It is a small vessel, protected by its own embedded weapon system. It may be interesting for countries that have Islands to defend such as Japan, Philippines, Vietnam and Australia. It can carry up to 100 tonnes, 60 soldiers with their equipment for 24 hours, one tank, or four armoured vehicles like the VBCI or any amphibious vehicle, anti-submarine warfare or disaster relief and logistics equipment. Its loaded speed is 15 Knots and empty 22 knots.

Bertin, a subsidiary of CNIM, showcased on its side the FusionSight, a lightweight Night and Day vision enhancer combining two viewing modes, based on low light colour and thermal cameras. These can be used separately or in smart fusion. Especially developed to meet the Infantry chiefs and special forces requirements, this reliable hand device is efficient on the field during operations helping to spot hidden and camouflaged enemies.

At IMDEX Asia 2017 Ixblue showcased its autonomous navigation capabilities including the M7 as its most popular system. The Marins series allows stealthy autonomous navigation for submarines, providing accurate heading roll, pitch, speed and position. These products can also meet a naval surface vessel navigation requirement when operating under challenged global navigation satellite system (GNSS) conditions.

ST Engineering highlighted three unmanned products at IMDEX Asia 2017, the Mercury AUV, Venus family of USVs and a conceptual long-endurance SV. This latter new system is called the long Endurance Unmanned Surface vessel (LEUSV). It is a 45m-long craft equipped with advanced autonomy technologies. Boasting an intelligent power management system to give a 28-day endurance, it also employs computational fluid dynamic techniques for greater speed, higher manoeuvrability and better seakeeping.

In conjunction with the DSO National Laboratories, ST engineering has also just completed R&D on its Mercury autonomous underwater (AUV). The info-communications systems have been revealed. Weighing less than 1 tonne, to enable lifting by a ship’s crane, this system is able to swim 300m underwater at 6kt and can perform mine countermeasures missions without endangering personnel. It can be also be configured for harbour security, search and salvage, environmental monitoring and scientific research. The Mercury consists of a nose cone module with collision avoidance sensor, payload section for Thales SAMDS high-frequency synthetic aperture sonar, the mission module for communication and navigation), and the battery and propulsion units.

BrahMos display in IMDEX Asia 2017 a supersonic cruise missile with a fine combination of speed precision and power, has three times more velocity, 2.5 to 3 times more flight Range 3 to 4 times more seeker range and nine times more kinetic energy than any existing subsonic cruise missiles. The multi-platform, multi-target cruise missile, carrying a conventional warhead weighing 200 to 300 kg, is capable of flying up to 290 km at a top speed of 2.8 Mach.

BrahMos showcasing also the naval version. These anti-ship variants of BrahMos have already been successfully developed and deployed by Indian Navy. Several south-East-Asian and Latin American countries want to BrahMos or have at least expressed interest in it, particularly for the naval and coastal defence versions.

Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) promoted at IMDEX 2017 its new HF over-the-horizon (OTH) radar, the ELM-2270 that provides a constant coastal OTH situational awareness picture of ranges of up to 270km., which provides the necessary coverage to monitor the boundaries of a country’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ). The system transmits a wide-angle beam, covering 120° in azimuth, while the receiving section comprises one or more arrays of vertical antennas that provide instant coverage of the entire sector. The ELM-2270 provides detection of 1,500-ton ships within 370km, and low-flying aircraft within 130km. The radar has advanced noise cancellation, which includes ionosphere clutter, man-made and communication noise.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.7491769790649414}",neutral,0.7491769790649414,0
Addressing Mental Health in the Workplace - Thales,"Thu, 11 May 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi91bml0ZWQta2luZ2RvbS9uZXdzL2FkZHJlc3NpbmctbWVudGFsLWhlYWx0aC13b3JrcGxhY2XSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Addressing Mental Health in the Workplace Mental Health Share this article



LinkedIn

Work-related stress, depression or anxiety is defined, according to the Health and Safety Executive , as a harmful reaction people have to undue pressures and demands placed on them at work. The Labour Force Survey estimates to every 100,000 workers in Great Britain, 1,510 are affected in this way. Recognising poor mental health in the workplace is far too prevalent, Thales in the UK has several measures in place to ensure this statistic isn’t echoed among its own people.

One such measure is the Mental Health First Aid programme. Those who partake and successfully complete the course, ‘Mental Health First Aiders’, are trained to spot the early warning signs of common mental health conditions, provide immediate support and signpost appropriate longer term help for the individual affected. A successful Mental Health First Aid pilot scheme was organised at the beginning of 2017 and plans to roll this out across other UK Thales sites are now in motion. The Mental Health First Aiders within the company will be able to promote appropriate processes in all areas of the business where they see issues.

Further to this, digital ‘Tool Kits’ will be soon be made available to people managers, which will be centred on how people managers themselves can support health – both physical and mental – in the workplace. The Tool Kits will cover what support is available within Thales and how it can be accessed, making it easier for managers to ensure their teams have the correct assistance in place for any health issues that may be affecting them.

These new initiatives come on top of the support already available for anybody experiencing mental health issues at Thales. This includes the Employee Assistance Programme available for Thales people and their families, giving them access to support through counselling, and a stress risk assessment process enabling Human Resources to work with managers who may be concerned about somebody. The intention is to be able to sit down and have a conversation with the person under assessment about the stresses they are dealing with and what can be done to help or support them.

Having a large demographic of ex-forces personnel and reservists, Thales in the UK recently sponsored the Military Minds Symposium, for the third year running. Each year the Symposium is an opportunity for organisations to understand the benefits of working with individuals with a military background and, conversely, to understand what they can do to assist those individuals who may be going through mental health issues brought on by experiences from their time in service.

To affirm its commitment to ending mental health stigma, Thales in the UK has recently signed the Time to Change pledge. Samantha Madeiros, HR Advisory Manager, says, “I am really pleased that we are signing the Time to Change pledge as it demonstrates Thales UK’s commitment to changing how we think and treat mental health in the workplace. The wording of our pledge will be: ‘The wellbeing of our employees is fundamental to our success as a business. Signing the Time to Change pledge is one way in which we can demonstrate our commitment to promoting a culture of openness, in which support is offered and diversity is celebrated.’”

Thales in the UK’s Chief Executive Victor Chavez, who signed the pledge personally, adds, “Being able to engage with people to talk about problems is really key, and we don’t we have space for people who take a hard line management perspective on this.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998237490653992}",neutral,0.9998237490653992,0
