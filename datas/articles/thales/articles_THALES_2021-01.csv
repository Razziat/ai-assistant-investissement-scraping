Cannes, January 11th, 2020 – After leading over the last five years several R&D activities for the Strategic Research Cluster (SRC) on Space Robotics Technologies set up by the European Union within Horizon 2020, Thales Alenia Space, Joint Venture between Thales (67 %) and Leonardo (33 %) and its Partners have been awarded by the European Commission a preparation project (phase A/B1) for in-orbit demonstration dedicated to In-Orbit Servicing space vehicles. An in-orbit demonstration is expected by 2026.

This new project, called EROSS+, for European Robotic Orbital Support Services, will be led under Thales Alenia Space’s responsibility. The consortium includes: Thales Alenia Space in France that will supervise the Overall System, contributing to the Guidance, Navigation and Control functions for this new type of mission, while Thales Alenia Space in Italy will handle the Mission design, the German Aerospace Center (DLR) the Robotics aspects, GMV (Spain) the Robotics Autonomy Systems, PIAP Space (Poland) Gripping Mechanisms and SINTEF (Norway) the Software Architecture. Similar to the first two phases of the SRC, the PERASPERA consortium of Space Agencies in Europe (Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Poland, United Kingdom and the European Space Agency) will be contributing to the technical review of the EROSS+ project, in support to the European Commission services.

This phase is the third and last one of the SRC in the frame of H2020 projects, building on the two previous ones that have allowed to increase the Technology Readiness Level of several key building blocks. The first phase involved six projects related to the development of technologies dedicated to robotics and in-orbit operations. Thales Alenia Space was leading I3DS (Integrated 3D sensors), a sensor suite for robotic missions. The second step, currently in its final phase, was to integrate the previously developed building blocks into more specific applications, through three projects oriented towards modular and reconfigurable spacecraft (MOSAR), in-orbit assembly (PULSAR) and on-orbit servicing (EROSS), the last being led by Thales Alenia Space as well. Those projects are now resulting to ground demonstrators, a first step to demonstrate the feasibility of the targeted applications especially EROSS which will validate all the technologies needed for On-Orbit Servicing.

The third phase of the SRC is now to prepare the in-orbit demonstration of such new types of missions (up to preliminary design). EROSS+ obviously follows up on the EROSS activity and aims to develop a European solution for On-Orbit Servicing. These space vehicles will be able to carry out a wide range of operations in orbit, including controlled re-entry of space debris, robotic manipulation, the extension of a satellite's operational life, in-orbit re-fuelling, inspection, and many more. The project will start in February and will last 24 months. The goal consists in designing a demonstrator while progressing in parallel on the maturity of the key building blocks.

The demonstration mission concept includes the complete orbital rendezvous phase of a Servicer satellite with a collaborative Client satellite prepared for On-Orbit Servicing that shall be followed by the capture and then servicing operations. The whole idea is to validate the capability of carrying out on-orbit operations of this type for future missions.

On-Orbit servicing space vehicles represent a real paradigm shift in space: upcoming systems will no longer be “abandoned to their fate” once in orbit, but can evolve over their lifetime. Thales Alenia Space is one of the leading pioneers in the trend towards On-Orbit Servicing, which signals the advent of a new approach to space access. When humanity considers the possibility of building lunar bases sometime in the future, On-Orbit Servicing technologies will underpin the solutions developed to transport and assemble the constituent elements.

This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 101004346.

"Airbus, Thales win second-generation Galileo satellite contracts - SpaceNews","Thu, 21 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9haXJidXMtdGhhbGVzLXdpbi1zZWNvbmQtZ2VuZXJhdGlvbi1nYWxpbGVvLXNhdGVsbGl0ZS1jb250cmFjdHMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"WASHINGTON — The European Commission announced Jan. 20 it will award contracts to Airbus Defence and Space and Thales Alenia Space to build an initial set of next-generation Galileo navigation satellites, shutting out incumbent manufacturer OHB.

Airbus and Thales will each build six of the second-generation Galileo satellites under contracts that will be formally signed at the end of January. The combined value of the contracts is 1.47 billion euros ($1.78 billion), but the Commission did not disclose the value of each company’s contracts.

The 12 satellites will be the start of the second generation of the Galileo system that will feature improved accuracy and resilience. The first satellites will be ready for launch in 2024.

Galileo is one of the cornerstones of the European Union’s space activities and, combined with the Copernicus program of Earth observation satellites, account for nearly all the EU’s space budget. However, EU officials said both programs need to improve to keep pace with changing demands and growing capabilities outside Europe.

“Galileo and Copernicus must evolve. Otherwise, they will fast become obsolete,” warned Thierry Breton, commissioner for the internal market at the European Commission, in a speech Jan. 12 at the 13th European Space Conference. New technologies that will be incorporated into the next generation of Galileo satellites, he said, include digitally reconfigurable antennas, intersatellite links, more advanced atomic clocks and all-electric propulsion.

“The second generation of Galileo will have significantly improved service capabilities, notably in the field of secure navigation and resilience against emerging threats,” Breton said. At a press briefing later in the conference he declined to go into more details about the program, citing the pending contract award.

The contracts with Airbus and Thales shut out OHB Group, the prime contractor for the current generation of Galileo satellites. The European Commission said in its announcement that the European Space Agency, which partners with the EU on Galileo, performed a two-month technical and financial evaluation and recommended the awards to Airbus and Thales.

The statement noted there were three bidders, but did not disclose the third bidder. However, in a Jan. 20 announcement, OHB acknowledged that it had submitted a proposal and had been informed by ESA that it was not successful. That decision, it added, did not affect its ongoing contract to provide 34 Galileo satellites, 22 of which have already been delivered with the remaining 12 in various stages of production.

OHB partnered with Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd. (SSTL) for the current Galileo satellite contract, with SSTL providing the navigation payload. Such a partnership would not have been possible for the next-generation Galileo satellites since the United Kingdom, where SSTL is based, has left the EU and can no longer participate in the Galileo program.

At a Jan. 14 press briefing, Paul Verhoef, director of navigation at ESA, said SSTL delivered the final navigation payloads for the current generation of Galileo satellites in November. “It is, of course, unfortunate that the UK is now excluded from the navigation programs of the EU,” he said.

“We don’t expect to see UK participation on those programs,” he added, other that possibly components not available elsewhere. “This is what it is. This is the political reality of the day.”"
Thales UK secures Indian partner for selling its Starstreak air-defense missile - Defense News,"Thu, 14 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZWZlbnNlbmV3cy5jb20vZ2xvYmFsL2V1cm9wZS8yMDIxLzAxLzE0L3RoYWxlcy11ay1zZWN1cmVzLWluZGlhbi1wYXJ0bmVyLWZvci1zZWxsaW5nLWl0cy1zdGFyc3RyZWFrLWFpci1kZWZlbnNlLW1pc3NpbGUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LONDON – The Northern Ireland arm of Thales UK has struck a partnering arrangement with Bharat Dynamics Ltd (BDL) as part of its effort to secure a deal with the Indian military to purchase the British-developed Starstreak man-portable, air-defense system.

In a statement the two companies said the tie-up will see BDL become a “part of the Starstreak global supply chain, providing the opportunity for export of Indian-manufactured components to existing and future Starstreak air defense customers, including the UK armed forces.”

The agreement also provides the opportunity for BDL to “offer a ‘Make in India’ solution to the Indian government, with a capability that will match the immediate air defence needs of the Indian Army and Air force, and with 60 percent of the system manufactured in India,” said the two companies.

The tie-up is the culmination of a four-year effort by Thales and BDL to explore a possible technology-transfer deal following the signing of a memorandum of understanding in 2017.

The items in line for building by the Indian state-owned BDL include electronic and mechanical components with sub-system and system assembly, Thales UK officials told Defense News.

The industry teaming agreement was signed in a virtual ceremony in Britain and India on Jan. 13 with British defense procurement minister Jeremy Quin and the Indian Army’s director general of air defense in attendance.

“Today’s signing marks the start of the next-generation of missile systems for the Indian Army and reinforces our commitment to work with international partners,” Quin said.

The partnership follows the two governments’ recent signing of a defense-technology and industrial-cooperation memorandum of understanding.

To date Starstreak has not participated in any Indian competition for a man-portable, air-defense weapon.

The high-velocity, Mach 3-plus weapon, which can be man-portable or platform-mounted, has been in service with the British Army since 1997 and has been exported to several nations, including Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia.

The weapon is unique in that it employs three laser guided darts as its warhead.

"Thales, G+D Continue to Lead Global eSIM Management Landscape - Counterpoint - Counterpoint Research","Thu, 14 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvdW50ZXJwb2ludHJlc2VhcmNoLmNvbS9pbnNpZ2h0cy90aGFsZXMtZ2QtY29udGludWUtbGVhZC1nbG9iYWwtZXNpbS1tYW5hZ2VtZW50LWxhbmRzY2FwZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"While Truphone, IDEMIA, Workz, Valid and Eastcompeace have emerged as specialists, players such as Oasis, Kigen and Ericsson are in position to challenge the status quo in the future

Seoul, Hong Kong, New Delhi, Beijing, London, Buenos Aires, San Diego

January 14, 2021

More than one billion eSIM (eUICC- and iUICC-based) capable devices have been shipped cumulatively so far, according to the latest research from Counterpoint’s ETO (Emerging Technology Opportunities) Service. The uptake of eSIMs is poised to further grow across a gamut of connected devices over the next decade, led by the flexibility, cost efficiency, security and other myriad benefits offered by the technology. To better understand the positioning, platform capabilities and competence of various players managing these hundreds of millions of active eSIM devices, Counterpoint has analyzed and evaluated key eSIM management players. These players at core offer eSIM management platform to service providers from data preparation, entitlements, connectivity management and value-added services to drive newer business models in a scalable manner.

Highlighting the research findings, Senior Analyst Karan Dasaor observed, “eSIM management capabilities, especially Remote Service Provisioning (RSP), are critical to securely managing cellular subscription profile lifecycle remotely. RSP on M2M devices employs a server-driven push model operating without any human intervention, whereas the consumer solution follows a client-driven pull model, controlled by the end-user. Owing to these differences in the architecture of RSP on M2M and consumer devices, different elements are required for effective provisioning. M2M services require Subscription Manager Data Preparation (SM-DP) and Subscription Manager Secure Routing (SM-SR) while consumer services require Subscription Manager Data Preparation for Consumer (SM-DP+) and Subscription Manager Discovery Server (SM-DS). These subscription management service provider, data center operation and management capabilities are accredited by GSMA and are important criteria to fulfil security and interoperability standards.”

Thales and G+D are the top providers of end-to-end feature-rich eSIM management platform, followed by specialists such as Truphone, IDEMIA, Workz and VALID. The CORE (COmpetitive Ranking and Evaluation) framework ranks different players in terms of completeness and capabilities of the platform providers’ offering, level of GSMA compliance, the number of eSIM RSP management platform deployments, diversity of end-customers, partnerships, and other parameters.

Exhibit 1: eSIM Management CORE Scorecard for Integrated Players

Source: eSIM CORE Scorecard & Analysis, Dec 2020

Commenting on the eSIM management competition, Research Vice President Neil Shah highlighted, “Both Thales and G+D are eSIM Management leaders not only in terms of overall completeness of offerings but also all-round capabilities, partnerships and customers. Both the players have aced the GSMA-approved platform offerings though Thales surpasses G+D with growing number of partnerships, deployments and live eSIMs managed. Truphone and IDEMIA follow the two leaders but with a relatively broader platform play. Truphone is ahead of IDEMIA in terms of completeness with end-to-end offerings and has been seeing sizable traction in the fast-growing Entitlement segment, where most of the other leading players are still going with a partner route. IDEMIA ranks slightly behind Truphone in completeness but is ahead and one of the top three leaders with more than 110 subscription management wins globally.”

Shah added, “Oasis, Kigen and Ericsson are the dark horses with their recent entry into the eSIM Management race with GSMA accreditation for their platform offerings, key partnerships and for the likes of Kigen and Ericsson, a broad set of customers to cross-sell the eSIM solution. Handful of operators have built and managed an in-house eSIM Management platform. The top three Indian operators, Jio, Vodafone–Idea and Airtel, as well as STC and Telenor from the list are activating and managing eSIM devices on their networks using their own platforms set up with the help of partners such as HPE and Nokia.”

While the aforementioned eSIM Management players lead in terms of completeness and GSMA accredited eSIM Management platforms, there are multiple players offering proprietary subscription management solutions integrated with connectivity offerings in an MVNO/E or marketplace setup.

Dasaor further added, “Players such as RedteaMobile, Cubic Telecom, Telna, Airalo and Gotell, and newer players such as SIMLocal which initially started as eSIM MVNO/E, are growing to target the long-tail of MNOs and other MVNOs with targeted solutions to accelerate eSIM adoption. RedteaMobile leads this segment managing hundreds of millions of soft-eSIM devices and riding on its partnership with Deutsche Telekom to power the nuSIM solution. These players are pivoting to a Connectivity-as-a-Service model for both the eSIM users and the MNOs.”

The navies of Belgium and the Netherlands rely on Thales, Naval Group and KERSHIP shipyard to equip the 12 next generation Mine Counter Measures Vessels with NS50 radars for Air & Surface Surveillance with Fire Control capabilities.

Thales press release

The NS50 provides for the first time a complete and superior level of self-protection capability against air and surface threats for this category of high value MCM vessels. A strategic choice for small to medium vessels, the NS50 offers dual functions between air and surface surveillance and fire control.

The nature of threats faced by Navies has never been more varied nor more challenging, ranging from next generation anti-ship missiles, robotic warfare and swarm attacks, to electronic warfare (jamming) as well as, overall, having to operate in a simultaneously conventional, asymmetric and hybrid threat environment. Time and quality of information are critical when facing this new array of unpredictable simultaneous threats. The NS50 provides maximum time on target for forces to evaluate the threat and take countermeasures while, at the same time, understanding what is around them to safeguard the ship and to protect their own allied forces.

Thales NS50 4D AESA radar scale-model showcased at LIMA 2019

The NS50 is the world’s most compact, affordable 4D multi-function naval radar in the market. It offers superior air and surface detection, tracking and classification performances providing highly accurate 4D target information required for rapid acquisition by short-range “fire and forget” Surface-to-Air-Missile Systems as well as fire control of ship-borne artillery against surface targets. It can defend against Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), low slow flying object, surface targets and in combination with small to medium caliber gun system.

A fully software-defined sensor, the NS50 features a modular and scalable hardware architecture, making it equally suitable for combat boats, Offshore Patrol Vessels, MCMVs, auxiliaries and various other platforms. No other radar in this class up offers the NS50’s flexibility and range of features, which are similar to those that do equip larger sized ships. Its full digital design implies that upgrades are possible at any moment and at any place and that, software modifications are simple for integrating new features. The NS50 meets today’s cybersecurity requirements.

The NS50 is part of the NS family of radars already operational within the Royal Netherlands Navy, providing enhanced situational awareness and contributing to regional stability in various parts of the world."

H3 Dynamics’ DBX autonomous drone charging box was tested in an urban environment with a drone electronically registered and identified using Thales’ Remote Identification tracker, according to a news release. The UAS was monitored in real time via the Thales UAS Airspace Management solution to enable beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) operations.

This development is expected to accelerate the adoption of IoT technology to manage Singapore’s complex urban airspace. The solution can help UAS operators and others precisely monitor unmanned traffic in dense urban areas, securely and in real time.

Singapore start-up H3 Dynamics has been working with government and corporate clients on the end-to-end digitization of various maintenance and monitoring processes. One of the first use cases involves imaging high-rise building facades using HD and thermal camera drones.

Anticipating scalability challenges, H3 Dynamics developed autonomous charging shelter systems and drone data hubs, with some already installed in Singapore and other locations for initial testing. This end-to-end solution seamlessly links with the unmanned traffic monitoring technology from Thales.

The Thales Remote Identification tracker weighs less than 70 grams and features Network remote ID function through LTE and Direct Remote ID function through Wi-Fi/Bluetooth. It allows authorities to register, identify, monitor and track drones in real time. It is the visible asset of a complete IoT ecosystem featuring cloud-based web server access and a mobile application so operators also can track their own fleet of UAS in real time. All communications are end-to-end cyber-secured.

The demonstration showcased real life and stress test flight scenarios, including geofencing and mission deviations.

“For the first time in the world and in a live test conducted in Singapore, Thales and H3 Dynamics integrated autonomous drone docking stations with real-time drone tracking, and a world-class unmanned air traffic control system capable of being deployed today,” H3 Dynamics Founder and CEO Taras Wankewycz said, according to the release. “The broad coverage of Thales digital aviation capabilities, tied to our remote mission control and aerial data acquisition systems, places the combined system at the edge of drone technology and demonstrates the true potential of safe BVLOS operations.“"

The agreement was signed between the companies in the presence of UK and Indian government representatives in a virtual ceremony on January 13, 2021.

Through the agreement, BDL will become a part of the STARStreak global supply chain, providing the opportunity for export of Indian manufactured components to existing and future STARStreak customers, including the UK Armed Forces.

More importantly, the agreement will also provide the opportunity for BDL to offer a ‘Make in India’ STARStreak solution to the Indian government, with a capability that will match the immediate air defense needs of the Indian Army and Air force, and with 60% of the system manufactured in India.

“Today’s signing is a significant milestone for all parties concerned and I look forward to Thales and BDL developing a close working relationship. This is good news for our business in Belfast in Northern Ireland, for the strong supply chain of UK SMEs with whom we work and for our teams in India,” Alex Cresswell, CEO of Thales in the UK said.

“The partnership between Thales and BDL in this project with transfer of technology for STARStreak will create a new business opportunity for BDL and its supply chain partners in India,” Commodore Siddharth Mishra (Retd), chairman and managing director of BDL, added.

The STARStreak missile system is in service in the British Army and has been exported to Malaysia, South Africa, Thailand and Indonesia. STARStreak is unique due to its three laser-guided darts, which cannot be jammed by any known countermeasure, according to Thales.

The missile itself is the fastest of its kind in the world, achieving a Mach 3 velocity shortly after launch. It is designed to provide close air defense against conventional air threats such as fixed-wing fighters and late unmasking targets, such as attack helicopters."

Why was it so important to maintain the Global Supplier conference, even as a virtual event?

Roque Carmona: Many of our suppliers have suffered the economic consequences of the global pandemic. It was important that we reaffirm the partnership relationship that we have with them. We have done everything possible to support them and keep their business going. For their part, our suppliers have demonstrated their responsiveness, inventiveness and commitment to continue supplying the Group, and thus contribute to its resilience. They are, and will be tomorrow, stakeholders in the transformation of the Group. It is therefore essential that we discuss the challenges facing Thales with them so that they can help us meet them. Our performances can only be as good as our suppliers' one!

Amongst these challenges, which is the one that you feel is the most important?

RC: Without a doubt, competitiveness. Let me remind you about the importance of our purchasing activities: nearly 7 billion euros this year, of which more than 2 are spent with 3,000 small and medium-sized enterprises, around 14,000 suppliers. If we are demanding with our suppliers, not only in economic terms - meeting deadlines, reducing defects, etc. - but also in terms of integrity, we also expect a lot from their expertise and creativity. They should be encouraged to ""challenge"" the specifications of our products - anything that will make us more competitive is a good thing! To establish and maintain this win-win partnership, our relations must be fluid, transparent and, above all, based on sharing the same values.

What lessons can we learn from the global health crisis?

RC: The pandemic reminds us that we must always be prepared for the unexpected. Despite the abrupt halt to the global economy, our supply chain has held up well overall, thanks to the partnership we have with our suppliers and the radical transformation of the Purchasing function over recent years. In certain activities, defence for example, the constraints imposed on transport have shown us that even in our “virtual” world, distance still matters - it is impossible to deliver a radar via the internet! This raises the question of sovereignty in matters of critical systems. This crisis should help us prepare for the future by accelerating the transformation of Thales and its suppliers.

Thales Alenia Space: at the heart of lunar industrial challenges - Thales,"Thu, 07 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi93b3JsZHdpZGUvc3BhY2UvbmV3cy90aGFsZXMtYWxlbmlhLXNwYWNlLWhlYXJ0LWx1bmFyLWluZHVzdHJpYWwtY2hhbGxlbmdlc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"We are kicking off the New Year with hope for the future. Today, Thales Alenia Space signed a contract with the European Space Agency to develop ESPRIT (European System Providing Refueling, Infrastructure and Telecommunications) for the upcoming lunar space station, Gateway. The contract is worth 296,5 million euros. Thales Alenia Space in France will be prime contractor on ESPRIT, working with Thales Alenia Space in Italy and in the United Kingdom to form a strong international core team, with key contributions from teams in Belgium and Spain.

ESPRIT comprises two main elements: HLCS (Halo Lunar Communication System), which ensures communications between Gateway and the Moon; and ERM (ESPRIT Refueling Module), which will provide Gateway with xenon and chemical propellants. In addition to extending Gateway’s service life, ERM will pave the way for a reusable lunar lander and deep space transport (to Mars). ERM features a pressurized tunnel with large windows offering a 360° view. Delivery is planned for 2026, with launch the following year.

But ESPRIT isn’t Thales Alenia Space’s only contribution to lunar exploration. Here’s a quick look at some of the other breathtaking projects now underway.

A Lunar Space Station

The Lunar Gateway is one of the pillars of NASA’s Artemis program, supporting a sustainable presence on the Moon and exploration beyond. It’s an international project, led by the two main contributors NASA (United States) and ESA (Europe). Weighing about 40 metric tons, the Gateway will be automatically assembled and placed in a highly elliptical orbit around the Moon. It mainly comprises habitation modules for the crew, power and propulsion systems, logistics modules, communications systems, a robotic arm and docking ports. It is not intended for permanent occupancy, but will be able to host 4-person crews for periods of one to three months.

Thales Alenia space is leading the development of I-HAB (International - Habitat), a pressurized habitable module that will provide crew living quarters, plus docking points for vehicles in transit. Drawing on Thales Alenia Space’s longstanding expertise in the development of pressurized modules for the ISS, along with new technologies and processes, I-HAB will mark the transition from the ISS to a new generation of space infrastructures for deep space exploration. It will meet evolving requirements for lighter structures and advanced micrometeorite protection systems, evolved docking systems and hatches, enhanced functional and avionics architectures, more efficient thermal control systems with deployable radiators and innovative air conditioning systems. For the first time, I-HAB will undergo long exposure to the deep space environment, allowing us to test potential solutions for protection against cosmic radiation.

Since I-HAB will be unmanned most of the time, it will also require dedicated solutions for robotic operations. In relation to the ISS, designers will call on virtual reality techniques to come up with more comfortable accommodations, using modular and reconfigurable solutions to optimize crew comfort and space. The European Space Agency (ESA) is responsible for this module, with contributions from other space agencies: Japan (JAXA) for environmental and life support subsystem, coolant pump motors and rechargeable batteries, NASA for core software and crew items, Canada (CSA) for robotic components. The integration of I-HAB relies on Thales Alenia Space’s vast experience, including Nodes 2 and 3 for the International Space Station. I-HAB is scheduled for launch in 2026.

Sustaining life in space

Thales Alenia Space recently signed a contract with Northrop Grumman to develop the pressurized module for HALO (Habitation and Logistics Outpost), one of the first two main Gateway elements, to be launched in 2023.

© ESA

HALO, a crucial contribution from NASA, will be launched along with the Power and Propulsion Element (PPE). Its primary purpose is to provide living space for astronauts and prepare for their trip to the lunar surface. It will also offer command, control and data handling capabilities, energy storage and power distribution, thermal control, communications and tracking capabilities. It will have three docking ports for visiting vehicles and future modules, as well as space for science and stowage. With NASA’s Orion spacecraft docked, it will be able to sustain up to four astronauts for up to 30 days as they explore the lunar surface.

Thales Alenia Space is in charge of designing and building the HALO primary structure (pressurized module), the module and vestibule pressure control, part of the micrometeorite protection system and the interface with NASA docking systems. The HALO design is derived from Northrop Grumman’s Cygnus spacecraft, a program that includes Thales Alenia Space as a longstanding partner.

HALO will be 3 meters in diameter, like the Cygnus Pressurized Cargo Module, but will be stretched by a meter to provide habitable volume for visiting crews, bringing the total length to about 7 meters.

Artemis, the key to a sustained human Lunar presence

The Gateway is a critical component of the agency’s sustainable lunar operations. NASA will integrate the first two components on Earth, launching the Power and Propulsion Element (PPE) and the Habitation and Logistics Outpost (HALO) together in 2023, followed by a commercial supply launch.

© ESA

In 2024, Orion will deliver its crew to lunar orbit. The commercially developed lander that will take the crew to the lunar surface will be capable of docking directly to Orion for crew transfer on early Artemis missions, but NASA is maintaining flexibility for optional docking to Gateway. On later Artemis missions, crews will arrive at Gateway on Orion, then conduct research and take trips down to the surface.

Orion, designed to take humans further than they've ever gone before

Orion is the new NASA spacecraft, designed to send astronauts further into space than ever before and consider that when they return to Earth, the astronauts will enter our atmosphere at speeds over 32,000 km/h but the capsule will ensure a safe – but bumpy! – landing.

Thales Alenia Space is working with ESA, alongside Airbus Defense and Space, to develop critical service module systems for all the flight model, including structure and micrometeorite protection, thermal control and consumable storage and distribution.

Thales Alenia Space recently delivered the third European Service Module structure, the one that will bring the first woman and the next man to the Moon in 2024.

Jumping down to the Moon

The Human Landing System (HLS) is a key to NASA’s Artemis program. This man-rated vehicle will enable astronauts to reach the lunar surface, live and operate on the ground for up to a week and then fly back to the lunar station.

A Dynetics-led international consortium is one of the teams chosen by NASA to design the Human Landing System, with Thales Alenia Space in charge of designing the main volume of the crew module, including the primary structure, hatch & Extra Vehicular Activities (EVA) door, windows and thermal and micrometeorite protection. The design of the pressurized cabin structure will progress at a much faster rate than the other components of the system, since it’s a key to the lander’s development.

The aim is to conduct the HLS Critical Design Review (CDR) by early 2021, following which NASA will select the best technical solution and authorize production of the first two flight models for the 2024 and 2026 missions.

Studies for a sustained human presence on the Moon

Along with current projects Thales Alenia Space has also been chosen to design advanced solutions for a sustained human presence on the Moon.

© Thales Alenia Space

One of these visionary studies is EL3, or the European Large Logistic Lander (EL3). A free-standing part of international lunar exploration activities, it’s a versatile system designed to support a variety of missions. It is aimed to provide cargo and logistics services for NASA-led lunar missions via Artemis and support a European mission to study the Lunar South Pole with a robotic laboratory derived from the designed sample fetch rover.

Searching for water… and talking to Earth

To answer the critical question if whether there is water on the Moon, we have a Viper up our sleeve!

VIPER (Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover) is NASA’s latest lunar vehicle. It will explore the Moon’s South Pole to search for water ice and other potential resources using its three instruments and a 1-meter drill. The data collected by the rover will show where the Moon’s water ice is most likely to be found and easiest to access. The first water maps of the Moon will mark a critical step forward in NASA’s Artemis program. Furthermore, by identifying the lunar resources needed to produce oxygen and propellants, it would support future space exploration missions. The launch is planned for late 2023, and the mission will last about 100 days.

© NASA

Thales Alenia Space is providing the X-band transceiver and X-band diplexer to ensure communications between the VIPER and Earth.

Thales Alenia Space, as part of the Space Alliance is partnering with Telespazio in studying for the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency the future of Moon’s Communication and Navigation systems, while working with CommStar Space Communications to design the next-generation hybrid Earth/Moon data relay satellite by 2023.

Towards a new Moon ecosystem

Humanity’s journey into space continues with these new landmark programs, Space is still the ultimate human frontier, but even the most ambitious and visionary projects are ultimately designed to offer a better and more sustainable life on Earth… and beyond!

Co-operation between the UK and India continues to develop at pace with much closer ties within our defence equipment programmes and systems.

“Today’s signing marks the start of the next-generation of missile systems for the Indian Army and reinforces our commitment to work with international partners.”

Through the agreement, BDL will become a part of the STARStreak global supply chain, providing the opportunity for export of Indian manufactured components to existing and future STARStreak Air Defence customers, including the UK Armed Forces.

BDL was established in Hyderabad in 1970 as a manufacturing base for guided missiles and allied defence equipment. In 2017, Thales and BDL had signed a Memorandum of Understanding to assess the opportunity for the transfer of technology for STARStreak. The signing of this teaming agreement confirms a positive outcome from that exploration process.

Today’s agreement will also provide the opportunity for BDL to offer a ‘Make in India’ STARStreak solution to the Indian Government, with a capability that will match the immediate air defence needs of the Indian Army and Air force, and with 60% of the system manufactured in India.

It also represents an opportunity for further UK and Indian Industrial co-operation and will cement the ambition for closer collaboration and co-development between our two nations, supporting the ambitions of our governments’ recently signed Defence Technology and Industrial Capability Cooperation MoU.

Alex Cresswell, CEO of Thales in the UK said: “Today’s signing is a significant milestone for all parties concerned and I look forward to Thales and BDL developing a close working relationship. This is good news for our business in Belfast in Northern Ireland, for the strong supply chain of UK SMEs with whom we work and for our teams in India. The UK and India have a strong tradition of industrial partnership in defence, innovation and sharing technology and we are thankful to both the Governments for their strong support to this excellent initiative.”

Commodore Siddharth Mishra (Retd), Chairman and Managing Director, Bharat Dynamics Limited, in his address stated that “partnership between Thales and BDL in this project with Transfer of Technology for STARStreak will create a new business opportunity for BDL and its Supply Chain Partners in India. BDL will be able to enhance its footprints in the export market in addition to domestic market with this new business opportunity. The Government of India’s ‘Make in India’ programme, the ‘ease of doing business’ and recent ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ initiatives have created a congenial ecosystem for the foreign OEMs to tie up with Indian Industries like BDL to establish the production facility in India,” he added.

The STARStreak missile system is in service in the British Army and has been procured by defence forces worldwide. The fastest missile in its category, STARStreak is unique due to its three laser-guided darts, which cannot be jammed by any known countermeasure. It has the capability to defeat any air target – even armoured helicopters – as the last line of defence.

Thales Alenia Space was pleased to welcome to its Cannes plant today Franck Riester, French Minister for Foreign Trade and Economic Attractiveness as well as David Lisnard, Mayor of Cannes.

Cannes is also corporate headquarters for Thales Alenia Space. A center of excellence for the French and European space industry, this plant has built up its skills and expertise over the last 50 years, most notably in Earth observation, telecommunications, space exploration, scientific missions and orbital infrastructures. The delegation visiting today was fascinated by the plant’s 15,000 square meters of clean rooms, making it the largest facility in Europe dedicated to satellite assembly, integration and testing (AIT). Also housed at this site is a center dedicated to the production of very-high-resolution optical instruments, the European benchmark in this demanding field.

The visitors could see several satellites undergoing integration, including SES-17, mainly intended to provide connectivity services to airline passengers, and the geostationary communications satellites EUTESAT-10B and EUTELSAT KONNECT VHTS. The latter aims to bring high-speed internet to isolated areas in Europe, delivering performance on a par with fiber-optic networks. It will play a major role in bridging the digital divide and providing online connectivity to everybody in France (where more than 800,000 households will gain access to high-speed internet) and in Europe.

Cannes has also integrated a number of Earth observation satellites, designed to monitor our environment, as well as all very-high-resolution instruments for French defense and security spacecraft, from Helios and CSO to Pleiades. Thales Alenia Space is a pivotal partner in the European Commission’s vast Copernicus observation program.

In 2020, it was chosen for five of the six new Copernicus Expansion missions: as prime contractor on three of the missions, CHIME, CIMR and ROSE L, and supplier of the instruments for the CO2M and CRISTAL satellites. The delegation got a close-up look at the Sentinel-3C and -3D satellites, in the process of integration. Like the -3A and -3B satellites, launched in 2016 and 2018, respectively, these new models have a two-pronged mission, monitoring both oceans and land masses.

Cannes is also recognized worldwide for building all European geostationary weather satellites as prime contractor, on behalf of the European Space Agency (ESA) and the European Meteorological Satellite organization (Eumetsat). Today’s visitors got a privileged glimpse of a Meteosat Third Generation (MTG) satellite, which will shortly be delivering the data needed for even more accurate weather forecasting.

The highlight of the day was undoubtedly a look at the upcoming second ExoMars mission. Four of the major elements on this spacecraft were delivered to Cannes at the end of the year, from Thales Alenia Space’s plant in Turin, Italy. It’s not every day that you’re lucky enough to see these high-tech spacecraft components (transfer module, descent module, landing platform and rover), which will lift off in 2022, destination Mars. Following a long and perilous journey spanning some 500 million kilometers, the landing platform will descend to Mars and release the rover, whose task is to discover possible traces of past life, by drilling up to two meters into the Martian soil.

The samples taken will be analyzed immediately in the rover’s own mini-lab, and results will be transmitted to ESA via the Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO), which was integrated at Cannes.

The ministerial delegation was delighted with its visit, and congratulated all those involved for the many successes chalked up by the European space industry in 2020.

Thales researchers are playing a central role in the quantum revolution and are now developing the next generation of quantum solutions that will shape the world of tomorrow: quantum sensors, quantum communications and post-quantum cryptography. Using cold atom technology, flawed diamonds and superconducting devices, the Group’s teams are combining their efforts to harness unexploited properties of matter and unleash a whole host of new opportunities. As a major player in the Saclay ecosystem and Europe’s leading industrial research laboratory in the field of physics, Thales is continuing to team with academia, industry and the start-up community to accelerate the development of sovereign quantum technologies

Accelerating the development of these technologies thanks to the France’s quantum plan

Thales welcomes the ambitious quantum plan launched by the French government, which will speed the development of the promising, sovereign technologies of quantum sensors, quantum communications and post-quantum cryptography.

The Group continues to invest 1 billion euros annually in self-funded R&D, pushing back the limits of the possible and helping to sustain the excellence of French and European research to serve Thales customers.

Quantum sensors: augmenting and expanding human senses to better understand our environment

Smart homes, self-driving cars, automated trains, air traffic control, Industry 4.0, new energy sources, connected medical devices and services, latest-generation defence and security systems… None of this would be possible without the countless types of sensors that exist in the world today.

Sensors come in all shapes and sizes. From the simplest meat thermometer in the kitchen to the most sophisticated radars used in air traffic surveillance, sensors play a crucial role in improving human understanding of the world we live in.

In an environment that is more and more connected and digital, quantum sensors augment and expand human senses to create new knowledge. Research is underway at Thales laboratoriesinto several types of sensors:

Superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) are being extensively studied today with a view to developing miniature quantum antennas to detect communication signals over a very large portion of the radiofrequency spectrum and offer a competitive advantage, particularly at low frequencies. These superconducting devices could have applications in a wide range of areas, including brain imaging and particle detection.

Continuous, wideband based on rare earth ions offer a way to relieve network congestion and optimise frequency utilisation — frequencies being a scarce resource — and could also have applications in military intelligence. Thales is also exploring the use of cold atom technology in future quantum inertial navigation systems for aircraft. At present, an aircraft taking off from Paris equipped with only a conventional inertial navigation system can land in New York with a precision of within a few kilometres. With future quantum sensors, aircraft will be able to navigate and land with a precision of within one metre.

Quantum sensors have a promising future in a broad range of sectors. New, ultra-sensitive, miniaturised magnetometers will revolutionise medicine, with numerous applications ranging from new-generation miniaturised MRI systems to diagnosis of brain tumours or changes in cognitive functions.

The key role of quantum communications: making communications completely trustworthy and managing future networks of quantum objects

In a digital economy where communications play a vital role, and with the relentless increase in data rates in fixed and mobile communication systems, quantum technologies will make it possible to secure communications with inviolable cryptographic keys based on the quantum properties of light. The principle of quantum communications has been established for some time in point-to-point networks, but the quantum Internet of the future will need to apply these concepts to large-scale networks. Thales is pioneering the design of these future network architectures, both for ground-based network elements and for the space-based components needed to share cryptographic keys over long distances. Thales is part of EuroQCI, a large-scale European project working to deploy a quantum secured network of this type to establish an ultra-secure Europe-wide network for sharing sensitive data.

Beyond quantum secured communications, quantum data such as qbits, the basic units of quantum information, could be shared across a quantum information network. This type of network could interconnect systems such as quantum sensors and quantum computers, leveraging quantum physics to build integrated systems delivering order-of-magnitude improvements in performance. Although it will be some time before these systems are available, the basic building blocks of quantum information networks, such as quantum memories, entanglement sources and protocols, are already being designed.

Post-quantum cryptography: acting today to protect our systems from the quantum computers of tomorrow

Communications security is a strategic necessity for governments, businesses and private citizens. Today, communications security mainly uses RSA crypto-systems, which rely on the difficult mathematical problem of breaking down a number into its prime factors. The algorithm for future quantum computers that could break RSA encryption, undermining the rationale behind existing cryptographic techniques, is already known. Thales is building on its experience in information systems security to develop alternative encryption methods using other mathematical problems to withstand quantum computers. These methods, combined with the use of quantum keys, will provide deeper, more persistent and more unconditional protection for our data assets.

LinkedIn

Cannes, January 7th, 2021 – Thales Alenia Space, a joint venture between Thales (67 %) and Leonardo (33 %), has signed a contract with ESA worth € 2,8 Million for the study, design, manufacture and test of the ATHENA Mirror Assembly Module Demonstrator.

ATHENA (Advanced Telescope for High ENergy Astrophysics) is the 2nd ‘Large’ mission in the ESA Science Cosmic Vision programme, focusing on the Hot and Energetic processes in the Universe by mapping hot gas structures and determining their physical properties as well as searching for supermassive black holes. The purpose of this mission is to try to understand how does ordinary matter assemble into the large-scale structures we see today and how do black holes grow and shape the Universe.

To address the first question, it will be necessary to map hot gas structures in the Universe – specifically the gas in clusters and groups of galaxies, and the intergalactic medium – determine their physical properties and track their evolution through cosmic time. To answer the second question, supermassive black holes (SMBH) must be revealed, even in obscured environments, out into the early Universe, and both the inflows and outflows of matter and energy as the black holes grow must be understood.

Planned to be launched in 2031, Athena will probe 10 to 100 times deeper into the cosmos than previous X-ray missions, to observe the very hottest, high-energy celestial objects. To achieve this challenge, the mission requires entirely new X-ray optics technology.

In this frame, the ATHENA Mirror will be the largest X-ray optics ever built: the achievement of the very demanding scientific goals requires in fact quite a large effective area in the bandwidth range. Therefore the telescope optics must be able to collect and focus the X-rays through a wide circular structure of about 2.5 m diameter. The Mirror Structure will bear about 600 accurately co-aligned Mirror Modules based on the innovative Silicon Pore Optics technology. It must be stiff and extremely stable to meet the scientific optical performances. The Mirror Assembly Module is then pointed to the two different instruments by means of a complex and very accurate steering system.

Thales Alenia Space is the prime contractor of the activity that will focus in the next 20 months on the design, development and testing of a full scale Mirror Assembly Module demonstrator and will allow the verification of critical functions prior to mission adoption.

The activity is in particular aimed at:

demonstrating the capability of manufacturing and integrating a full sized Mirror Assembly compatible with all the functional and interface requirements of the ATHENA mission

performing environmental tests to verify the compatibility of the ATHENA Mirror Assembly with the applicable mechanical and thermal loads by means of dedicated testing campaign, including the alignment verification of the Mirror Modules

A dedicated activity is then foreseen to integrate specific thermal control system and perform a representative test campaign.

The overall results will demonstrate the readiness of the relevant technology and process that will be made available for the implementation in the ATHENA spacecraft - planned to start in 2022. This is thus one of the most enabling technologies to make the ATHENA mission possible.

The specialist’s corner

The satellite will consist of a single large-aperture grazing-incidence X-ray telescope, utilizing a novel technology (High-performance Silicone pore optics) developed in Europe, with 12m focal length and 5 arcsec Half Energy Width (HEW) on-axis angular resolution. The focal plane contains two instruments. One is the Wide Field Imager (WFI) providing sensitive wide field imaging and spectroscopy and high count-rate capability. The other one is the X-ray Integral Field Unit (X-IFU) delivering spatially resolved high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy over a limited field of view.

BNP Paribas to begin issuing biometric payment cards to all customers within 6 months - Biometric Update,"Mon, 04 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpb21ldHJpY3VwZGF0ZS5jb20vMjAyMTAxL2JucC1wYXJpYmFzLXRvLWJlZ2luLWlzc3VpbmctYmlvbWV0cmljLXBheW1lbnQtY2FyZHMtdG8tYWxsLWN1c3RvbWVycy13aXRoaW4tNi1tb250aHPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Biometric payment cards companies are starting out 2021 with a bang, as the first general roll-out of cards with integrated fingerprint sensors by a big bank has been announced, a major payment network certification has been announced, and a volume order placed. Thales, Idex Biometrics and Fingerprint Cards are involved directly in the announcements, but the long-awaited commercialization of the consumer biometric device could lift many players.

First biometric bank card general roll-out planned

The first major bank to announce intentions to distribute biometric bank cards to all its customers is BNP Paribas, with the French issuer declaring its plan to begin a general roll-out in the first half of 2021, MoneyVox reports.

BNP Paribas launched a commercial trial of 15,000 payment cards with fingerprint biometric authentication based on Thales and Fingerprint Cards technology instead of PIN entry for purchase authorization in the fall of 2020.

The bank’s transformation, marketing and digital director Céline Ansquer said its carriers are in favor of the move. Its customers will receive a metal case for fingerprint biometric enrollment from home with the new cards, though their price is yet to be announced.

MoneyVox notes that other banks could quickly follow BNP Paribas lead into generalized commercial biometric payment card issuance.

BNP Paribas is the eighth-largest bank in the world by total assets, and counts more than 30 million customers in its three domestic markets.

Second Idex biometric card certified for China UnionPay

Idex Biometrics and its partner GoldPac have been certified for China UnionPay’s dual interface biometric payment card standard, according to a company announcement.

The testing was carried out by the Bank Card Testing Center (BCTC), and is required to obtain a Letter of Approval (LOA) from China UnionPay.

Goldpac already has certifications for China UnionPay. Visa, Mastercard, American Express JCB and Diners, and the new certification is the second for a biometric payment card with Idex’ fingerprint sensors and biometric solutions, according to the announcement. A card made by Feitian with Idex biometrics technology was granted an LOA from China UnionPay in May.

“This certification is another significant milestone for IDEX as our sensor, algorithm and software are now certified for biometric payment cards by an additional Tier One fintech products and services provider and is now available on multiple global payment schemes,” states Vince Graziani, CEO at IDEX. “IDEX is the only fingerprint company to have achieved this honor. The certifications continue the transition from the pilot phase, to commercialization and broad market adoption of biometric payment cards.”

“We are pleased that we have been able to complete certification with our partner IDEX, so that immediate mass deployment and customer engagement are ready to carry forward,” says Goldpac CEO Hou Ping.

Contactless payments have gained traction during the COVID-19 pandemic, most notably in America, as Graziani told Biometric Update in a November interview.

Major payment cards manufacturer orders 100K units from Fingerprint Cards

Fingerprint Cards has received a volume order of 100,000 units of its T-Shape biometric sensor modules from what it describes as a global top three card manufacturer.

FPC says all commercial launches of biometric payment cards so far include its fingerprint recognition technology, and the latest order indicates the acceleration of their roll-out.

“Fingerprint sensors for biometric payment cards represent a very large potential market for biometrics, and this order demonstrates the strength of Fingerprints’ solution and our leading position within this growing market. Together with our partners, we are enabling banks to remove the payment cap and bring consumers the trust and experience needed for contactless payments”, says Michel Roig, SVP Business Line Payments & Access at Fingerprint Cards.

The company received an order for 100,000 T-Shape modules in 2019 for logical access control, and the T-Shape module passed BCTC testing for biometric payment cards in November.

Saab to supply mine neutraliser for Anglo-French MMCM programme - Naval Technology,"Fri, 08 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdmFsLXRlY2hub2xvZ3kuY29tL25ld3Mvc2FhYi10by1zdXBwbHktbWluZS1uZXV0cmFsaXNlci1mb3ItYW5nbG8tZnJlbmNoLW1tY20tcHJvZ3JhbW1lL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"MuMNS. Image: Saab.

Thales has awarded Saab a SEK300m (£26.8m) contract to supply its Multi-Shot Mine Neutralisation System (MuMNS) to the UK-French Maritime Mine Countermeasure (MMCM) programme.

Deliveries of the mine-neutralising system will begin in 2022, with the order booked in Q4 of 2020.

Under the programme, the MuMNS system will be operated from an uncrewed surface vessel (USV) and will ultimately be in service with the UK Royal Navy and French Marine Nationale.

The MMCM is a ‘system of systems’ including uncrewed surface vessels (USVs), uncrewed underwater vessels (UUVs), sensors, command and control systems, and mine neutralisation systems.

Saab’s business area Dynamics head Görgen Johansson said: “We are proud to announce our first customers of the MuMNS. It’s a great success to deliver capabilities that enable these navies to perform safer and more efficient Mine Countermeasures operations, since the operator can neutralise multiple sea mines from a safe distance.”

The MuMNS can neutralise three mines without the need to resurface and is billed as being affecting against a range of sea mines and improvised explosive devices (IEDs).

The mine neutraliser has an operational depth of 300m and weighs 415kg.

MuMNS comprises a remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV), up to three mine neutralisation charges, a surface unit, Launch and Recovery System (LARS), tethered winch and control position.

Last November the UK and France invested £184m in the MMCM programme. The autonomous minehunting system being developed through the programme could eventually replace the UK’s in-service Hunt and Sandown class minehunting ships.

The investment also funded Thales’ and L3 Harris’s work into the development of autonomous systems able to detect and neutralise sea mines.

The November contract covers the production of three sets of autonomous vessels, towed sonar and the MuMNS. The first of the three sets will be delivered in 2022 and will then undergo operational evaluations before transitioning into active service."

The European System Providing Refuelling, Infrastructure and Telecommunications (Esprit) will consist of two separate units. The communications system will be used by astronauts to provide data, voice and video links to and from the lunar surface. It will be mounted on the Nasa Habitation and Logistics Outpost (Halo) module, which is scheduled for launch in 2024.

Esprit’s separate refuelling unit will provide the Gateway with xenon and chemical propellants that will allow the space station to maintain its orbit around the moon. It will also be used to refuel lunar landers, and potentially other spacecraft that wish to use the Gateway as an “interplanetary petrol station”. In addition, the module will boast a series of observation ports, allowing 360-degree views of the moon and spacecraft as they approach and dock.

The contract to build Esprit was signed between Esa and Thales Alenia Space on 7 January. Worth €296.5m (£265m), the work will be split between Thales sites in France, Italy and the UK. Meanwhile, Nasa plans to test-fire its Space Launch System moon rocket next week."

Interview: Thales UK CEO Alex Cresswell - The Engineer,"Thu, 07 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWVuZ2luZWVyLmNvLnVrL2NvbnRlbnQvaW50ZXJ2aWV3cy9pbnRlcnZpZXctdGhhbGVzLXVrLWNlby1hbGV4LWNyZXNzd2VsbC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales UK CEO and Chairman Alex Cresswell believes that current and future challenges will provide opportunities for engineers that are too good to miss. Jason Ford reports.

Thales’ presence in the UK can be traced to Glasgow in the late 1880s when an engineer and a physicist responded to a tender from industry after the poor performance of artillery rangefinders during the Boer War.

The tender asked for improved equipment that could be operated by soldiers of ‘average intelligence’ and the two academics – who went onto form Barr & Stroud – cemented a relationship with the UK’s armed forces that continues to this day. Barr & Stroud’s range-finding technology was deployed on the Royal Navy’s first submarine and Thales has since gone on to provide periscopes, then optronic masts, to every single submarine in the Royal Navy.

Thales UK CEO Alex Cresswell joined Thomson CDF (latterly Thales) in 1992

“There are three original periscopes from that period left,” said Alex Cresswell, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of Thales UK. “One is in the Thales foyer at Glasgow, the other is in the Maritime Museum and the third is at St Andrew’s Golf Club where you can look through it and view the first hole!”

Cresswell’s appointment in the UK follows several years as Executive Vice-President, Thales Land and Air Systems in France, and he is keen for engineering careers to be as appealing in Britain as they are across the English Channel.

“Having spent 10 years in France and seen at first-hand how they view and respect engineers in society, I think it’s critical we focus on our future,” he said. “We cannot keep losing the ‘best of the best’ engineers to careers in banking. Engineering and scientific careers also have to be appealing to everyone, regardless of ‘class’ or background.

“Without a doubt we in Thales want talented, commercially astute and innovative engineers. We would like to see greater diversity, but this starts much earlier in the educational system. I think STEM ambassadors have a massive role to play. You can only be inspired by what you see at an early age - and I speak from experience.”

Indeed, Cresswell’s journey to becoming an aeronautical engineer began with a childhood fascination for aeromodelling (a hobby funded by a paper round) and a visit with his grandmother to the National Air & Space Museum in Washington, which he says, ‘remains one of my favourite places in the world.’

Cresswell’s obvious enthusiasm is buoyed by the belief that science and technology provide considerable societal benefits and that the impact of Covid-19, whilst severe for many, is likely to present similarly advantageous challenges and benefits as we emerge from the pandemic

That said, Thales has not escaped disruption to production chains and projects and has had to introduce a Global Crisis Adaptation Plan to strengthen its resilience. The company’s civil aeronautics business – which generated sales of approximately €2.15bn in 2019 - recorded a 45 per cent sales slump in third quarter of 2020.

“After the 2008 crash, it took five years for the [civil aerospace] industry to recover and we could be looking at something similar,” Cresswell said. “And I think we’re going to see a much-changed rationale to travel with a higher emphasis on green issues and the environment.

“At one end of the spectrum, it could be airlines retiring the big aircraft...and at the other it will be the greater use of AI and technology to improve the green footprint of the industry,” he continued. “By combining AI with our expertise in trajectory prediction algorithms for flight management systems, it is possible to predict air traffic with a degree of reliability, and thus anticipate the decisions that will need to be made; improving factors such as cutting down on aircraft circling waiting to land, burning fuel, aircraft waiting on taxiways.”

The old model of graduate and PhD recruitment is being supplemented these days by really talented young people joining at a younger age and going on to get a degree through an apprenticeship route

According to Cresswell, the challenges and opportunities of a technology-led bounce back from Covid will very likely involve autonomy, AI, IoT connectivity, cyber security and big data.

He notes that the importance of data and algorithms to extract important information from vast quantities of data will grow, but a strong case will remain in the autonomous realm for keeping a human in certain decision-making loops. Furthermore, algorithms are inextricably linked to autonomy and trust in autonomy will be critical as new platforms and use cases emerge.

“The potential civil and military use of autonomy is massive and it’s not just an engineering challenge,” he said. “In the air, it is going to be overcoming the challenge of operating in the uncontrolled airspace – the 1,000ft ‘in line of sight’ area below.

The orgnisation is also involved in the Artemis NASA space program. Image: Thales

“At Turnchapel, Plymouth we’ve invested in a centre to develop these maritime autonomous technologies. The most advanced is mine countermeasures (MMCM). Effectively, it’s taking the sailor out of the dull, dirty and dangerous and its proving highly effective.”

Early into the Covid-19 pandemic Thales and partners mobilised in civilian airspace to bring beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) capabilities to drones delivering PPE and medical equipment from the Scottish mainland to a remote hospital on the Island of Mull. (The Engineer, April 2020).

“I think it demonstrated the positive role that unmanned technology can play in our society and hopefully represents a landmark step to accelerate its adoption,” Cresswell said.

A piloted aircraft with the potential to operate with a degree of autonomy is scheduled to enter service in the mid-2030s. The Tempest Future Combat Air System includes Thales as a team member and the platform’s proposed capabilities will make today’s military jets seem antiquated in comparison.

“We will explore how we will play a leading role in designing and securing the digital operating environment,” Cresswell said. “It’s not just a platform, it’s the ability to share and assimilate massive amounts of data in a trusted command structure and secure direct effects as a consequence.”

Thales is a key member of the Tempest future combat air system consortium. Image: BAE Systems

Getting Tempest airborne, keeping MMCMs afloat, and accommodating a greater number of unmanned and autonomous drones will require a fresh pipeline of talent and Cresswell concedes that companies will have to look beyond the conventional tertiary route. “The old model of graduate and PhD recruitment is being supplemented these days by really talented young people joining at a younger age and going on to get a degree through an apprenticeship route,” he said. “We have an excellent partnership with Manchester Met University for a degree apprenticeship that provides students with a solid academic foundation in Computer Science/Software Engineering, along with real life project and workplace skills.”

Cresswell joined Thomson CSF (latterly Thales) in 1992 with the intention of leaving after three years. He remained due to the ‘huge variety of meaningful projects’ he was responsible for and is confident that the sheer pace and scale of change will help inspire the next generation of engineering talent. “We’re the eyes and ears of the UK Dreadnought Class nuclear submarines… we’re going to play a key role in the building of the habitat and refuelling modules for the Gateway space station as part of the Artemis mission to land on the Moon….we’re going to Mars as part of the Exomars mission in 2022 where our sensors will play a central role in the mission to find signs of life. “Just as I did, engineers will want to come and work on these sorts of challenges. It’s a perennial, personal thing: to contribute and make a difference.”"
Cameroon moves to tackle hurdles impeding biometric IDs' smooth issuance - Biometric Update,"Thu, 14 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpb21ldHJpY3VwZGF0ZS5jb20vMjAyMTAxL2NhbWVyb29uLW1vdmVzLXRvLXRhY2tsZS1odXJkbGVzLWltcGVkaW5nLWJpb21ldHJpYy1pZHMtc21vb3RoLWlzc3VhbmNl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Cameroon’s general delegation for national security, the body charged with overseeing the issuance of biometrics-backed digital national identity cards for citizens as well as passports, has announced a number of measures intended to tackle the lingering problems plaguing the delivery process of the important documents.

Cameroon introduced biometric IDs in 2016 after penning a deal with Thales but citizens have since continued to express concerns about hiccups which, they say, are hampering the process of procuring the document.

While many have been crying foul over delays in obtaining the digital IDs, other applicants say the documents they apply for are never issued to them at all. It is the same problem with passports, as many Cameroonians confess they do not only spend huge sums of money to secure the document, but have to sometimes wait for months before their biometrics-enabled passports are ready.

Complaints relating to the procurement of these ID documents have been a bone of contention between the police service and citizens. The problem recently prompted an online protest — especially on Twitter with the hashtag #JeVeuxMaCNI (loosely translated in English as ‘I want my ID card’) — which saw hundreds of Cameroonians join in to call on authorities to take adequate measures aimed at fixing the problem.

On the heels of all of these calls and the online protest, Cameroon’s police boss, on January 8, issued a statement via his secretary general, explaining some of the reasons for the delays in the delivery of the biometric ID documents, and unveiled the new approach the police intend to adopt to handle the problem.

Soon 15k IDs to be produced daily

Reading the police boss’ statement at a press conference in Yaounde, the secretary general, Dominique Baya, said one of the moves is to increase the daily production capacity of the IDs from the current 10,000 per day to 15,000.

This, he however said, will begin shortly, when a major secondary production center for the documents will be opened in the northern city of Garoua to serve the country’s northern administrative regions. Cameroon’s three northern regions are highly populated.

The increase in daily production capacity, the official said, is also seen as one of the ways of making up for the limited number of ID document production centers in the country of 26 million people. There are currently just 280 centers nationwide, including 50 mobile units which serve mostly the urban population.

“Despite the slowdown in production of these IDs which is linked to technical difficulties, procedures and the delivery of production equipment, I want to assure that the process of producing the documents is still very active. There’s therefore no need for the blame game or political manipulation intended to whip up unpatriotic sentiments among Cameroonians…,” Baya said at the Yaounde presser in what looked like a parry of blame away from the police.

New deal for biometric passports production

Regarding passports, the police official noted that President Biya authorized the signing of a new deal recently concluded with Augentic in September.

Recall that the general delegation for national security had engaged Augentic for the production of biometric express passports for Cameroonians beginning in March this year.

Mr. Baya explained that the plan by the country is to henceforth have biometric passports produced within 48 hours.

The problem not just with the police

While promising to make sure that the IDs and passports are produced without major delays henceforth, the police official said citizens are also to blame for the delays because some of them present documents with conflicting information in the case of second-time applicants.

On this issue, the secretary general stated that the police was taking the necessary steps to ensure that the IDs are issued only to persons who present the correct information at identification centers.

He said apart from that problem, nearly 250,000 ID cards are lying fallow at various identification posts nationwide with their applicants nowhere to collect them. He used the opportunity to call on all those who have applied for the cards to stop at the identification centers where they did so, and look out for them.

The Cameroon digital ID card is an electronic and biometric identity document produced in credit card format and is capable of fighting fraud given that it is embedded with both visible and invisible security features, according to Thales. The card also has a high definition laser-engraved portrait of the holder built in it.

This post was updated at 12:24pm Eastern on January 18, 2021 to correct that Augentic is the new contractor for the project, not the contractor which has been replaced.

Thales to deliver Collins sonar upgrades - Australian Defence Magazine,"Tue, 05 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1c3RyYWxpYW5kZWZlbmNlLmNvbS5hdS9kZWZlbmNlL3NlYS90aGFsZXMtdG8tZGVsaXZlci1jb2xsaW5zLXNvbmFyLXVwZ3JhZGVz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Collins Class submarines will increase their operational effectiveness in hazardous, shallow waters through the delivery of sovereign Mine and Obstacle Avoidance Sonar (MOAS) and High Frequency Intercept Array (HFIA) systems.

In an announcement made in late December, Thales Australia and the Commonwealth of Australia (CoA) said they have signed a $23.7M contract to deliver these next generation systems.

The Heron MOAS is an Australian designed and developed system and the result of more than 20 years of investment in Australia by Thales, the RAN and Defence Science and Technology to develop sonar systems tailored to Navy’s unique operating requirements.

Mine and obstacle avoidance capability is critical to sustain naval operations due to the rapidly evolving threat of mines, as well as other navigational hazards in the shallow, poorly charted waters that are prevalent throughout Australia's maritime region.

The Herron system provides enhanced detection, coupled with a low false alarm rate, against dangers ranging from small mine-like objects to reefs, shoals, and hazardous objects like displaced shipping containers.

The High Frequency Intercept Array (HFIA) will enhance the submarine’s ability to detect high frequency emissions like sonars, and emerging undersea threats.

“These advanced systems are designed, developed, integrated and sustained in Australia. Enhancing our world leading sovereign industrial capability in sonar systems,"" Thales Australia CEO Chris Jenkins said. “Together, these contracts will support approximately 30 jobs at our Rydalmere site in western Sydney and additional jobs with our supply chain partners."""

As a result of the teaming agreement, BDL has become a part of the STARStreak's global supply chain. In addition to this, BDL also gets the opportunity to export the air defence system to existing and future customers which include the UK's Armed Forces.

The agreement also allows BDL to offer the air defence system to the Indian Armed Forces with a minimum of 60 per cent indigenous content along with domestic designing and development. This would qualify it under the Make in India programme.

Sharing details of the development, BDL's chairman and managing director Commodore Siddharth Mishra (Retd) said, ""The partnership between Thales and BDL with Transfer of Technology for STARStreak, will create a new business opportunity for BDL and its supply chain partners in India. BDL will be able to enhance its footprint in the export and domestic markets with this new business opportunity."""
"No way out for Thales in arms deal case, court rules – The Mail & Guardian - Mail and Guardian","Fri, 22 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vbWcuY28uemEvcG9saXRpY3MvMjAyMS0wMS0yMi1uby13YXktb3V0LWZvci10aGFsZXMtaW4tYXJtcy1kZWFsLWNhc2UtY291cnQtcnVsZXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Advocate Barry Roux, for Thales, had contended that the prosecution had failed to give a summary of available and admissible evidence when formulating charges of racketeering, corruption and money-laundering, and instead ""simply alleged"" that such existed.

The state’s endlessly delayed arms deal case against Jacob Zuma was strengthened on Friday when the high court in Pietermaritzburg threw out an application by Thales South Africa (TSA) to have charges linking it to alleged corrupt payments to the former president set aside.



The court, in a 34-page ruling, dismissed the local subsidiary of the French arms maker’s application with costs, rejecting an argument that the decision to prosecute it along with Zuma did not rest on evidence submitted to successive heads of the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA).

Advocate Barry Roux, for Thales, had contended that the prosecution had failed to give a summary of available and admissible evidence when formulating charges of racketeering, corruption and money-laundering, and instead “simply alleged” that such existed.

Therefore, he said, legality principles were violated because there was nothing to support a reasonable belief implicating Thales in racketeering, leaving the national director of public prosecutions (NDPP) to decide on the mere “say-so” of the prosecutor.

Roux also argued that nowhere in the thousands of pages in documents supporting the state’s case was there evidence to show that his client was aware of hundreds of indirect payments to Zuma, some allegedly required to pay for work at his Nkandla home.

He further submitted that because there were no facts to show that the money flow on which the case rested was the proceeds of crime, there was no viable charge of money-laundering.

But Judge Alsa Bezuidenhout dismissed this argument as well, ruling that the crime of money laundering was so much broader than a mere requirement that the money was “hot” or “dirty”. This judgment states that Thales will remain accused number two when the case proceeds later this year, a decision welcomed by the NPA in a brief statement that concluded: “We look forward to the criminal hearing.”

Zuma faces 16 charges of fraud, corruption, racketeering and money-laundering stemming from the 1999 Strategic Arms Procurement Programme to overhaul post-apartheid South Africa’s military hardware.

The racketeering charge relates to an alleged agreement for Thales to funnel half a million rand a year to Zuma — a retainer meant to buy the company political influence and protect its dealings from close scrutiny.

As part of the German Frigate Consortium, Thales had won a contract to provide combat equipment for the navy’s corvettes as part of the arms deal.

In on the deal as empowerment partners were Zuma’s financial adviser Schabir Shaik and his company Ngobi Holdings, from which 783 payments flowed to Zuma. In the main the money came from Thales.

Shaik remains crucial to the case in that he served, until September 1999, as a director of Thales and that this arguably imputes knowledge to the company of the nature of payments to Zuma.

Bezuidenhout concluded: “It is clear in my view that sufficient information was placed before the NDPPs on which they could rationally conclude that there was reasonable and probable cause to believe that TSA had directly or indirectly or with common purpose participated in the enterprise run by Mr Shaik, through a pattern of racketeering activity compromising the planned, ongoing, continuous or repeated participation or involvement in at least two Schedule 1 offences.”

The payments came to just more than R4-million, a sum that now seems like small change compared with the billions state entities bled in state capture deals inked while Zuma was president.

The arms deal charges have haunted Zuma since 2005 when Shaik was found guilty of soliciting a bribe on his behalf and sentenced to 15 years in prison.

Zuma was due to go on trial in 2006, with the NPA having added Thales to the indictment. Zuma lost a bid to set the charges aside on appeal but they were controversially withdrawn in 2009, paving the way for him to be elected president, and only reinstated in 2018, mere months after his forced resignation.

The interim saw the Democratic Alliance’s ultimately successful legal battle for the release of the so-called spy tapes on which then-NDPP Mokotedi Mpshe had based his decision to bin the charges on the basis of political interference by the former president Thabo Mbeki administration in the timing of Zuma’s initial indictment.

But last year the case was again delayed pending the ruling on Thales’s application for dismissal. The high court application was the company’s third bid to have the charges scrapped, with direct presentations to the NPA and an approach to the Constitutional Court having failed.

The corruption case against Zuma was postponed last year until February 23 to allow pre-trial matters to be resolved."
Stockport engineers from Thales Cheadle behind world-first autonomous mine-hunter - Marketing Stockport news feed,"Thu, 21 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vbWFya2V0aW5nc3RvY2twb3J0LmNvLnVrL25ld3Mvc3RvY2twb3J0LWVuZ2luZWVycy1mcm9tLXRoYWxlcy1jaGVhZGxlLWJlaGluZC13b3JsZC1maXJzdC1hdXRvbm9tb3VzLW1pbmUtaHVudGVyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Engineers from Thales, both in Cheadle and nationwide, have worked alongside the Royal Navy and French military to develop the world’s first autonomous mine-hunter technologies.

Following successful trials detecting over 140 mines across miles of open sea and in harsh weather conditions, bringing this hi-tech capability to the Royal Navy will create 215 jobs at the firm and in its UK supply chain, including 30 at Thales’ Cheadle site.

Staff from Thales UK’s Cheadle site have been instrumental in developing the new technology: software architecture and development to implement this world class and cutting edge autonomy for a surface vessel was carried out by engineers in the Stockport team.

The project has also allowed Thales UK to recruit a number of apprentices in Stockport who have been able to have involvement in this work. It is hoped that having worked a multi-national environment on this world-first defence programme, those apprentices will go on to be the next generation of world class professional software engineers.

One of these apprentices on secondment at one of the firm’s sister sites in France to continue development of the technology and for their own professional development.

The firm has now secured a £184 million contract for the Maritime Mine Counter Measure (MMCM) programme, a collaboration between the French and British defence departments, to combat sea mines worldwide. In Autumn 2020, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said:

This £184 million contract offers a huge leap forward for the Royal Navy’s autonomous capabilities in the detection and defeat of sea mines. As the Armed Forces puts modernisation at the heart of its future strategy, these systems will protect vital shipping lanes, commercial traffic and our brave personnel from these deadly devices.”

The Royal Navy has been a world leader in mine countermeasures since beginning the removal of ordnance left over from World War Two. . In recent times, the UK has been involved in minehunting operations across the world, including the Gulf and off Libya. The new contract with Thales will see three sets of mine hunting equipment be procured, consisting of:

Autonomous vessel – a boat controlled and operated from a “mother ship” or base.

Towed sonar – a sonar which is towed/dragged behind the vessel to locate ordnance.

Mine neutralisation system – a remotely operated underwater vehicle which is used once the mine is located to neutralise the device and prevent its detonation.

First Sea Lord Admiral Tony Radakin said:

I am enormously excited by the potential of the future minehunting capability. This will allow us to deliver minehunting more effectively, more efficiently and more safely, and to integrate even more closely with our French counterparts in this important area.”

Alex Cresswell, CEO of Thales in the UK, said:

Technologies such as autonomy and AI are transforming societies and warfare at an exponential rate. This contract represents the next generation for Anglo-French minehunting, delivering a world leading capability that will keep our armed forces safe and create and secure vital jobs across the UK and our supply chain. We look forward to delivering the next stage in this exciting hi-tech programme.”

The first equipment sets are due to be delivered in late 2022. It will commence operational evaluation prior to entering service with the Royal Navy."
