Alongside the development of secure products, secure handling of information is also a fundamental part of everyday operations at Thales Deutschland. For Thales, information security does not only mean protecting its own information, but also that of its customers and partners. This has an impact on all business processes, from communication to supplier selection and up to product development. Since 2019, Thales Deutschland has been operating an Information Security Management System (ISMS) certified according to ISO/IEC 27001:2013 in order to ensure information security.

f.l.t.r.: Oliver Dörre, Chairman of the Management Board of Thales Germany, and Alexander Barth, Chief Information Security Officer

In June 2021, TÜV Rheinland also audited all other Thales Deutschland business divisions (Land & Air, Microwave & Imaging Sub-Systems, Naval, Secure Communications & Information, Training & Simulation) as well as THALES Immobilien Deutschland GmbH and Thales Management & Services Deutschland GmbH – where the core operations of Thales Deutschland take place – as having an effectively operating ISMS in accordance with ISO/IEC 27001:2013.

Risk management as a basis

“The successful certification acknowledges our company as an effective threat and risk manager adhering to an internationally recognised standard procedure,” Oliver Dörre, Chairman of the Management Board of Thales Germany, explains. “As a digital champion, it is important to exemplarily live information security also within our company. This important certification strengthens our customers’ trust in us and in our cyber security solutions,” Dörre continues.

The certification is valid for three years and requires an annual audit of the ISMS. However, the work of the information security organisation does not end with certification. Information security is an ongoing task that Thales takes very seriously and thus continues to work on an appropriate protection of information assets."
Civil society calls on French company Thales to put an end to suspected indirect support to the Myanmar Junta - Reporters sans frontières,"Tue, 30 Nov 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vcnNmLm9yZy9lbi9jaXZpbC1zb2NpZXR5LWNhbGxzLWZyZW5jaC1jb21wYW55LXRoYWxlcy1wdXQtZW5kLXN1c3BlY3RlZC1pbmRpcmVjdC1zdXBwb3J0LW15YW5tYXItanVudGHSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Reporters Without Borders (RSF), along with three other organisations, Info Birmanie (IB), Justice For Myanmar (JFM) and Sherpa, denounce exports of military technology carried out by French transnational company Thales to an Indian intermediary partner of the Myanmar military junta, which could allegedly be carried out in violation of the restrictive measures imposed by the European Union (EU), after the February 2021 attempted coup in Myanmar. The organisations call on Thales to stop these exports, and ask the French authorities to take the necessary measures to put an end to this partnership and adopt a law making it possible to penalise violations of arms embargoes.

A JFM investigation published last spring revealed that one of Thales' long-time partners, the Indian company Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL), has a particularly close relationship with the Myanmar junta, and exports military technology to it. On the basis of these revelations, IB, RSF and Sherpa wrote a letter to Thales on November 26, 2021, calling on the French company to put an end to any transfer of its technologies to the junta in Myanmar, and more generally to definitively end its business relationship with BEL and with any other partner of the Myanmar junta.



JFM's investigations outline BEL's close ties to the junta and demonstrate the supply of equipment to the military, which BEL confirms in its 2020-2021 annual report. According to the information gathered, BEL has carried out at least seven exports of radars and equipment for the benefit of the Myanmar junta since the attempted coup of February 1, 2021, even though international sanctions were taken against Myanmar and that States and companies were called upon to take all necessary measures to avoid fuelling the junta's human rights abuses. BEL also reportedly exported a remote-controlled weapons system, partly managed by executives of the BTSL joint venture created between BEL and Thales Systems Limited.

In view of this information, it is likely that the technology shared by Thales to BEL, and re-exported by BEL in its equipment, is therefore directly transmitted to the Myanmar military junta, and potentially used to perpetrate its atrocities. These exports could then constitute a violation of the European restrictive measures and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.

“Terrorist”

“More than 1,290 people have been killed by the military junta since its attempted coup, including children, said Yadanar Maung, of JFM. The military is now stepping up its campaign of terror through indiscriminate airstrikes, destruction of homes and villages, killings and rape. This is the context in which Thales' partner, Bharat Electronics Ltd, continues to do business, supplying equipment to the military junta with knowledge of the crimes being committed. Thales must sever its relations with Bharat Electronics, stop transferring technology and end all direct and indirect support to the military, who are terrorists.”

IB coordinator Sophie Brondel states:“this case confirms the urgent need for a global arms embargo in Myanmar, as 136 organizations around the world called for in February, including Justice For Myanmar and Info Birmanie.”

""Thales must put an end to its business relations which benefit the Myanmar junta,"" declares RSF’s legal officer, Paul Coppin. ‘Business as usual’ is no longer possible with a country like Myanmar, whose ruling junta fiercely represses journalists and destroys civil society. ""

Laura Bourgeois, litigation and advocacy officer at Sherpa, considers that ""French companies which directly or indirectly supply armed groups and thus support their actions are not sufficiently worried or held accountable: the existing rules to sanction them are special rules too scattered and restricted to be dissuasive. It is time for French legislators to create an offense punishing violations of embargoes. ""

The Member States of the EU, and therefore the French State, have the responsibility to take all necessary measures to guarantee the scope and effectiveness of EU law, notably of the restrictive measures, and to put in place sanctions at the national level that are effective, proportionate and dissuasive.

The four signatory organisations do not exclude taking legal action on these revelations, and mobilizing civil society and the competent authorities so that they make the best use of the rules applicable to the violation of EU restrictive measures.

Legal background

European Council Decision 2013/184 / CFSP renewed until April 30, 2022 by Council Decision (CFSP) 2021/711 of April 29, 2021 prohibits ""the sale and supply in Myanmar, as well as the transfer and export to that country, by nationals of the Member States or from the territory of the Member States (…) of equipment liable to be used for internal repression, whether or not it comes from their territory.”

Article 3a of Council Regulation 401/2013 concerning restrictive measures imposed due to the situation in Myanmar as amended by Council Regulation 2021/479 of March 22, 2021 prohibits ""the sale, supply, transfer or export, directly or indirectly, dual-use items and technologies listed in Annex I to Council Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 (…) to any entity or body in Myanmar or for the purposes for use in that country, if these goods and technologies are or may be intended, in whole or in part, for military use, for a military end user (…)” being specified that “when the end user is the Myanmar Army, any dual-use good and technology supplied to it is considered to have military use. ""

Principle 13 of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights provides that:

""The responsibility to respect human rights requires that business enterprises:

(a) Avoid causing or contributing to adverse human rights impacts through their own activities, and address such impacts when they occur;

(b) Seek to prevent or mitigate adverse human rights impacts that are directly linked to their operations, products or services by their business relationships, even if they have not contributed to those impacts.""

The Court of Justice of the European Community ruled in its time, on September 21, 1989, that ""it should be noted that, when a Community regulation does not contain any specific provision providing for a sanction in the event of violation or refers to this in relation to national laws, regulations and administrative provisions, Article 5 of the Treaty requires Member States to take all appropriate measures to guarantee the scope and effectiveness of Community law."" (Case 68/88, Comm. V. Greece, §23).

Thales and Diehl join Airbus to develop flight control computers for CityAirbus NextGen - Airbus,"Wed, 17 Nov 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMS0xMS10aGFsZXMtYW5kLWRpZWhsLWpvaW4tYWlyYnVzLXRvLWRldmVsb3AtZmxpZ2h0LWNvbnRyb2wtY29tcHV0ZXJz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Cologne, 17 November 2021 – Airbus has signed a trilateral agreement with Thales and Diehl Aerospace for the joint development of the flight control computers of CityAirbus NextGen. The central flight control system of CityAirbus NextGen, the electric vertical take-off and landing vehicle (eVTOL) being developed by Airbus, will combine extraordinary computing power with lightweight design and highest safety standards.

Diehl and Thales are joining Airbus in investing into the emerging eVTOL market. Both partners are developing their own system that will be integrated into a dissimilar architecture to comply with the new EASA regulation for eVTOL. This architecture is essential to ensuring the redundancy of the computers and the vehicle’s safety. The developments will be supported with public funding from the German and French governments, respectively.

Thales is responsible for the primary computing system, while Diehl is developing the secondary flight control computer. The system ensures that the second, independent flight control computer monitors the data of the primary computer system permanently, and it can also take over the flight control itself.

“I'm delighted to announce today the first system partnership for the development of our CityAirbus NextGen” said Jörg Müller, Head of Urban Air Mobility (UAM) at Airbus. “UAM is a joint effort. Nobody can do it alone. Airbus is reaching out to potential partners from the industry to design and build an optimised vehicle for safe and efficient air transport in urban environments. With Thales and Diehl, we are proud to have two excellent partners with a lot of expertise on board.”

“In the future, eVTOLs will be a key part of mobility and will enormously enrich it – in our cities but also beyond. For this, the safe operation of the innovative aircraft, of course, plays an essential role”, said Josef Köcher, CEO at Diehl Aviation. “We see a trend-setting partnership in the close collaboration with Airbus and Thales for the reliability and safety of the CityAirbus. We are proud to be on board with our expertise, and we are looking forward to seeing the CityAirbus in the skies soon.”

""We are thrilled to see that our close cooperation with Airbus and Diehl is once again delivering concrete results through an agreement that will add a whole new dimension to air mobility,"" said Yannick Assouad, Thales Executive Vice President, Avionics. ""With this safe and innovative flight control solution, we are working together to build an airspace environment we can all trust.""

Thales has more than 40 years of experience in electrical flight controls, having supplied the systems for the first ever fly-by-wire commercial airliner, the Airbus A310. Diehl Aerospace, a joint venture of the French partner Thales and Diehl Aviation, has many decades of experience in avionics for civil and military aircraft and helicopters.

The fully electric CityAirbus NextGen was revealed in September 2021 at the Airbus Summit. It is equipped with fixed wings, a V-shaped tail, and eight electrically powered propellers as part of its distributed propulsion system. It is designed to carry up to four passengers in a zero emissions flight in multiple applications. CityAirbus is being developed to fly with a 80 km range and to reach a cruise speed of 120 km/h, making it perfectly suited for operations in major cities for a variety of missions. It is optimized for hover and cruise efficiency, while not requiring moving surfaces or tilting parts during transition. Designed with simplicity in mind, CityAirbus NextGen will offer best-in-class economic performance in operations and support. The first flight of a prototype is planned for 2023. Airbus is developing a UAM solution with eVTOLS not only to offer a new mobility service for urban areas but also as a first step in its quest to reduce emissions in aviation all over its product range.

Diehl Aerospace, jointly with Airbus and Thales, have signed a trilateral agreement on the development and supply of the flight control computers for the new CityAirbus NextGen. For Diehl’s part, the order includes the secondary flight control computer for the fully electrically powered CityAirbus NextGen.

The system ensures that a second, independent flight control computer monitors the data of the primary computer system permanently, and it can generally also take over the flight control itself. Partner Thales is responsible for the primary computing system. Based on this dissimilar concept of the two flight control computers, the required standard of operating safety under a later EASA approval is reached. The central part of Diehl’s computer platform is the Remote Computing Module (RCM). The computer platform enables multifunctional applications beyond the pure flight control and thereby achieves a high-performance, scalable, expandable and cost-optimised solution.

Diehl Aerospace, a joint venture of the French partner Thales and Diehl Aviation, has many decades of experience in avionics for civil and military aircraft and helicopters. This expertise is particularly relevant in the development project for the CityAirbus NextGen. After all, the limited installation space and the strict requirements for low weight and low energy consumption represent a special challenge. For modern eVTOLs, therefore, new approaches are required in the system architecture.

Known by the French acronym CERES, the system lifted off on an Arianespace Vega rocket from the country’s spaceport in French Guiana. It will reportedly be positioned at an altitude of 700 kilometers (434 miles) in low-Earth orbit.

The CERES was developed to detect and geo-locate electromagnetic signals emitted by radio communication systems and radars that surface sensors cannot reach. They are designed to allow the military to adapt more quickly and effectively to all operational scenarios.

The system features three identical satellites that carry signals intelligence (SIGINT) payloads and user and ground control segments. It provides in-depth information even in adverse weather conditions.

Airbus integrated the global system and space segments into the CERES, while Thales was responsible for full mission chain, system performance, and supplying the satellite platforms.

‘Completing Intelligence Capability’

According to the developers, the CERES satellites are based on experience gained from the ESSAIM (communications intelligence) and ELISA (electronic intelligence) micro-satellite demonstrators launched more than a decade ago.

They explained that the technical and operational lessons they acquired from these systems were “key” to enabling the CERES’ high performance in electromagnetic detection and compatibility.

Thales executive vice president Philippe Duhamel expressed his belief that the newly-launched system will complete the strategic and tactical defense intelligence capabilities of the French military.

“DGA (French Armament General Directorate) trusts Thales to be in charge of the CERES end-to-end mission performance, for which we rely on our experience of more than 20 years in space-based SIGINT, our unique know-how in satellite payloads, and our wide knowledge in SIGINT and electronic warfare in all environments,” Duhamel said, as quoted by Australian Defence Magazine."

Thales has announced the launch of its latest Ground Master family radar portfolio member, the ‘GM400 Alpha’.

The three-dimensional (3D) long-range, air surveillance radar has five times more processing power, an extended range of up to 515km, and advanced artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities.

It is also claimed to offer enhanced cybersecurity features and the highest current update rate to complete long-range surveillance missions.

Built on the field expertise of the GM400, GaN technology, and other surveillance capabilities, the new GM400 Alpha radars enable operators to identify all short-range and long-range threats at all times.

The GM400 Alpha surveillance radar features digital stacked beam technology.

It can detect targets from jets and missiles to helicopters and tactical unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) flying close to the ground, or hiding close to the radar.

GM400 Alpha can also identify and track higher-altitude targets, including fighter jets at ranges of nearly 515 km.

Thales senior vice-president Surface Radars activities Serge Adrian said: “Already supporting 17 nations around the world, the Ground Master 400 radar family is a reliable and proven partner for air surveillance.

“The GM400 Alpha’s software design and processing architecture make it easy to upgrade current fielded GM400 systems, ensuring the radars’ resilience to emerging threats. Some of our customers have already started the upgrade process of their GM400.”

Due to its advanced processing technology and detection algorithms, the radar can analyse large sets of complex data, resulting in an improvement in detection range."

The partners announced their trilateral agreement on Nov. 17 at the European Rotors trade show in Cologne, Germany, where Airbus also unveiled a one-tenth scale model of CityAirbus Next Gen. The system partnership is the first to be announced for the aircraft, although Joerg Mueller, head of Urban Air Mobility (UAM) for Airbus, told eVTOL.com that others will be forthcoming.

“UAM is a joint effort,” Mueller stated in a press release. “Nobody can do it alone. Airbus is reaching out to potential partners from the industry to design and build an optimized vehicle for safe and efficient air transport in urban environments.”

Thales and Diehl will develop separate computing systems that will be integrated into a dissimilar architecture to comply with European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) requirements for eVTOL air taxis. Thales will be responsible for the primary flight control computer, while Diehl — a joint venture of Thales and Diehl Aviation — will create the secondary system. Their efforts will be supported with public funding from the French and German governments, respectively.

According to Airbus, the arrangement will ensure that the second, independent flight control computer monitors the data of the primary computer system, while also being able to take over flight control itself. Yannick Assouad, Thales’ executive vice president for avionics, said that this “safe and innovative flight control solution” will contribute to building trust in urban air mobility.

The fully electric CityAirbus NextGen was revealed in September at an Airbus summit on sustainable aerospace. The four-seat, winged multi-rotor aircraft features six propellers on wing-mounted booms, and two fixed-tilt propellers on a V-shaped tail.

It has a projected range of 80 kilometers (50 miles) and a cruise speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) — targets well below those of some competing developers, but nevertheless sufficient for the vast majority of intra-city UAM missions, Airbus claims. The company expects to perform the first flight of a prototype in 2023."

Running cybersecurity like a military operation - Thales,"Thu, 04 Nov 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi93b3JsZHdpZGUtZGlnaXRhbC1pZGVudGl0eS1hbmQtc2VjdXJpdHkvZW50ZXJwcmlzZS1jeWJlcnNlY3VyaXR5L25ld3MvcnVubmluZy1jeWJlcnNlY3VyaXR50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Running cybersecurity like a military operation Cybersecurity Share this article

The Security Operations Center (SOC) in Huizen watches over the digital wellbeing of organizations like banks, energy networks and also Thales itself. The cyber service delivery manager is the linking pin between the SOC’s techies and customers.

Once in a while, it’s all hands on deck at Thales’ Security Operations Center (SOC) in Huizen. “For customers like banks, energy networks and our own company, we’re monitoring their network, end-points and servers,” explains Jaimy Thepass, the SOC’s cyber service delivery manager. “Sometimes, the system raises a red flag. This can be triggered by seemingly trivial things, like an employee logging in at an unusual hour. Or someone has clicked on a link in a phishing mail and, even worse, left his username and password. When our ensuing investigation finds the customer to be compromised, we turn the SOC into a war room. It’s really like being on a mission again.”

Thepass started her career as a petty officer at the Royal Netherlands Army. Working for the signal corps, she took care of military telecommunications – radio, telephone and digital. On a mission in Mali, she got ‘infected by the cyber virus.’ “We noticed some communication irregularities and started looking into them. In the end, we also implemented countermeasures to better protect the soldiers when they went on the internet or phoned home. This sparked my interest. I decided to develop my cyber skills. In 2019, I got promoted to the rank of officer at the army’s Cyber Training Center.”

After two years of advising on cyber issues and planning and coordinating internal training programs on cyber awareness, Thepass was ready for a new adventure. When the opportunity at Thales presented itself this past January, she accepted the challenge. “A cyber service delivery manager is the linking pin between the customer on the one hand and the techs in the SOC on the other. But I’m doing much more than the official job description. Eighty percent of my days I spend on resource planning and managing people.”

Purple teaming

The Security Operations Center in Huizen is part of Thales Cyber Defense. “The Dutch Cyber Defense team has 23 people in total, 11 of whom work in the SOC. Thales has several SOCs worldwide, but Huizen houses the only one in the Netherlands,” says Thepass. “Compared to the larger SOCs in other companies in the Netherlands, which employ 50, 75 or more, we’re relatively new. But we have great growth ambitions. We need to, because the importance of cyber is growing fast as well and the customers are lining up.”

Thales is a marketleader in security and digital identity. Innovations in the security domains are going so fast it can be a challenge to bring customers along for the ride. “But we do see that our customers are taking their security very seriously. That is why you choose Thales. Our mentality is to do ‘whatever it takes.’ This means that one week, we’re in meetings with customers for days on end, discussing new threats we’ve seen in the world and how to improve their monitoring systems, while the next, we’re focusing on the actual hardware improvements and we don’t see any clients. The advantage of working at a tech giant like Thales is that we can use a lot of our own cyber hardware and software, mostly developed by our colleagues in France. This is an important reason why many new customers choose us.”

Thales also has its own team of ‘hackers’ in Huizen. Getting to collaborate with them is another appealing aspect of Thepass’ job. “They’re the red team – the offensive party – and we at the SOC are the blue team – the defensive side. In separate projects, they’re asked by customers to try and get into their systems. We take their reports to see where we can raise the clients’ defenses. We also regularly work together, looking at specific cybersecurity issues from both angles. In this purple teaming, as it’s called, we learn a lot about how both sides think and how combining our knowledge helps us improve security at our customers.”

“The team is very young and very open to improvement ideas,” replies Thepass, asked to characterize the SOC. “And the work is very exciting and challenging. We all need to pull together and perform to the best of our abilities to win a contract, and when we reel in a customer, we’re almost always embarking on a new adventure.”

Cyber women

Her military background has helped Thepass a great deal. “I always say I’ve had three parents: my father, my mother and the army. The discipline, the perseverance and the stress resistance I developed there come in extremely handy in my current position at Thales. When the shit hits the fan, so to speak, I know how to act. That’s also what I want to infuse a bit more into the team; when my manager hired me, he told me to run things like a military operation.”

Thepass would also like to see a bit more femininity infused into the cyber world. “At Thales in general, there are quite some efforts to increase the number of women in the workforce and bring together the ones who’ve already found their way to the company. In the SOC in Huizen, they’re reasonably well represented. But in cyber as a whole, there’s still a world to win. When people read my first name, they often assume I’m a man. It’s great to witness them realize their mistake: ‘Oh, you’re a woman. Not what I was expecting.’ The cyber world could use a similar wake-up call.”

Building on ESSAIM and ELISA signal intelligence demonstrators

@AirbusSpace @ThalesDefence @CNES #DGA @AVIO @Arianespace @Thales_Alenia_S #CERES #SpaceMatters #NextSpace

Kourou, 16 November 2021 – The CERES space system (Capacité de Renseignement Electromagnétique Spatiale or Space-based Signal Intelligence Capability) satellites designed and built by Airbus Defence and Space and Thales for the French Armament General Directorate (DGA) have been successfully launched from the European spaceport in French Guiana, on-board a Vega launcher.

“We are ready to go with the next generation of space surveillance capability for France: CERES! Entrusting Airbus with the construction and full space system responsibility is a ringing endorsement of our expertise and the quality of our technology, acquired in particular from the ESSAIM and ELISA demonstrators,” said Jean Marc Nasr, Head of Space Systems at Airbus. “The three CERES satellites will provide France with its first satellite system for signal intelligence, thus confirming our ability to act as prime contractor for French space-based intelligence systems,” he continued.

CERES is designed to detect and geo-locate electromagnetic signals from radio communication systems and radars from areas where surface sensors cannot reach. From its low Earth orbit, CERES is free from airspace overflight constraints and can operate in all types of weather. The system will provide in-depth information to support military operations for the French Armed Forces, thus improving situational awareness.

“CERES will complete the French strategic and tactical defence intelligence capability with its first signal intelligence (SIGINT) satellite system. DGA trusts Thales to be in charge of the CERES end-to-end mission performance, for which we rely on our experience of more than 20 years in space-based SIGINT, especially with ESSAIM and ELISA, our unique know-how in satellite payloads and user ground segments, and our wide knowledge in SIGINT and electronic warfare in all environments”, said Philippe Duhamel, Executive Vice-President, Defence Mission Systems at Thales.

The system includes the space segment consisting of a swarm of three identical satellites carrying the SIGINT payload, as well as the user and ground control segments.

Airbus Defence and Space and Thales are co-contractors for the full end-to-end system. Airbus is responsible for the global system integration and the space segment comprising the three satellites, while Thales is responsible for full mission chain and system performance, going from on-board payload to user ground segment. In addition, Thales Alenia Space acted as a subcontractor to Airbus in supplying the satellites’ platforms. The French space agency, CNES, as assisting partner to the DGA, procured the launch services and the ground control segment.

CERES draws on Airbus and Thales’ experience acquired from the ESSAIM (communications intelligence) and ELISA (electronic intelligence) micro-satellite demonstrators launched in 2004 and 2011 respectively. The technical and operational lessons learnt from these systems were key to enabling the very high performance in electromagnetic detection and compatibility, demanded by this mission."

Could you summarize your career to date?

After earning my engineering degree, I started my career at Thales Alenia Space in 2000. My first assignment was a fascinating ESA project called GOCE, the agency’s first satellite designed to map the Earth’s gravitational field with unprecedented accuracy. I helped develop the satellite’s main instrument, an extremely sophisticated gradiometer.

© Boris Wilensky / Human Value

From project to project, I developed my expertise, especially in mechanical engineering. For instance, I studied special materials for hyper-stable structures: with ceramics, or optical mirrors that are used in some Earth observation satellites. I moved on to several R&D management positions, before being named coordinator of the EROSS+ (European Robotic Orbital Support Services) project in 2020.

What does the EROSS+ project entail?

After having coordinated the H2020 project I3DS (Integrated 3D sensors), aimed at developing an array of sensors for space exploration missions, Thales Alenia Space led another project, dubbed EROSS, dedicated to On Orbit Servicing. There are a number of enabling technologies needed for orbital maintenance operations; we have to develop sensors, robotic arms and grippers to work on the object in orbit, as well as docking and refueling systems. At the same time, we have to develop the guidance, navigation and control system that allows our space vehicles to safely approach the target satellite.

In January 2021, the European Commission chose the EROSS+ project proposed by Thales Alenia Space and partners, awarding a preliminary project (phase A/B1) contract for a dedicated On-Orbit Servicing demonstration.

Following on from the original EROSS project, EROSS+ aims to develop a European solution for tomorrow’s on-orbit servicing missions. These spacecraft will be tasked with a wide range of operations in orbit, including deorbiting satellites at end of life, robotic manipulation, extending satellite lifespan, refueling, inspection, etc. Kicking off in February 2021, the 24-month project aims to design a demonstrator, while at the same time maturing the main technology building blocks needed for this type of mission.

The typical sequence for this type of demo mission includes the complete in-orbit phase for the “Servicer” spacecraft’s rendezvous with a “Customer” satellite, then docking together to carry out the work. The overall purpose is to validate its ability to perform in-orbit operations of this type for future missions. Our aim is to perform an in-flight demonstration by 2026 so we can validate all the technologies needed for On Orbit Servicing.

What’s the scope of possibilities for this type of spacecraft?

By capitalizing on Thales Alenia Space’s proven expertise in space exploration, robotics and orbital infrastructures, we want to establish a position as the leader in the On Orbit Servicing market. These three projects within the scope of Europe’s Horizon 2020 program, I3DS, EROSS and EROSS+, which we coordinated along with all our partners, provide a real springboard to address this new market.

As you know, it costs a lot of money to get a satellite into orbit! One that operates in geostationary orbit (circling a fixed point on the Earth at an altitude of 36,000 km) generally offers a design life of 15 years. If a technical issue were to arise in orbit, we can’t fix it. It would be impossible to send an astronaut to the satellite at that orbit; not only would the cost be prohibitive, but you’d probably need dozens of astronauts like Thomas Pesquet or Samantha Cristoforetti to carry out all the missions needed to extend the life of satellites, or repair them as we do on the ISS.

On Orbit Servicing is the ideal solution for this type of mission. As I said earlier, spacecraft fitted with robotic arms, grippers, tools, etc. would span a wide range of applications. The Servicer spacecraft would start by inspecting the customer satellite’s environment, then rendezvous with it to perform the required maintenance.

For instance, consider the problem of space debris. Today, some 5,400 satellites are circling over our heads, but only 40% of them are in service: the balance – over half – therefore constitute space debris. The number of satellites in orbit has doubled in the last three years, and more than 10,000 satellites are expected to be launched in the next ten years. There are now some 34,000 objects larger than 10 centimeters in orbit as space debris. And if we consider all objects larger than 1 millimeter, the total explodes to 130 million! At the end of a mission, the On Orbit Servicing spacecraft will either redirect the satellite to a graveyard orbit, as done for geostationary telecom satellites, or send it back into the atmosphere to burn up, the preferred solution in the coming years for satellites in low Earth orbit.

At Thales Alenia Space, we’re betting on the satellite life extension solution. By refueling these birds, or conducting maintenance, we can increase their service life. And in the near future, we could well see dual launches of a geostationary telecom satellite, for instance, paired with a Servicer under the same fairing.

Looking ahead, we will soon be seeing human missions to the Moon, and eventually even further into space. Today, you hear a lot about NASA’s Artemis mission, designed to bring astronauts back to the Moon, which will also be used as a waystation to prepare for missions into deep space, hopefully starting with Mars. Astronauts on Mars will no longer be in the realm of science fiction, and this long dreamed of scenario is beginning to take shape. Thales Alenia Space’s Turin plant built fully half of the pressurized volume on the International Space Station, and we leveraged this expertise to design three pressurized modules for the Gateway lunar space station, as well as two key components in Axiom, the world’s first commercial space station. We are prime contractor for ExoMars, the program designed to detect traces of past or present life on Mars, and we also contribute to the European service module for NASA’s crewed spacecraft, Orion, designed for exploration missions into deep space. Given this current slate of exploration programs, On Orbit Servicing spacecraft really come into their own, especially for robotic rendezvous and docking operations. I have every confidence in the growth of this very promising market, which is also eco-friendly. These new types of spacecraft will allow us to deploy a practical response to space debris. We are aiming for a market rollout towards 2028.

This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 101004346.

Cyrille Dupont

As the Carrier Strike Group continues its deployment in the Indo-Pacific region, we sat down with Cyrille Dupont, President and CEO of Thales in Japan. He spoke about Thales Japan’s portfolio, collaboration with wider industry, and his regret at missing the opportunity to go on board HMS Queen Elizabeth.

How did you come to join Thales?

Before joining Thales, I held Sales and Marketing and General Manager roles in Safran and Selecom respectively, accumulating nearly 15 years’ experience between the two. My Thales career has spanned 20 years and has included Project Manager, Sales and Marketing, and Business Development Director roles, before becoming the Chairman and CEO of Thales Hellas and Country Director for Greece, Cyprus & Eastern Balkans. For the last three years, I’ve been President & CEO of Thales Japan.

What does your current role entail?

First and foremost my role, with the support of my local team, is business development. That means promoting the full Thales portfolio, no matter what country a solution originated in. It could be Australia, France, Germany, the US, the Netherlands and, of course, the UK, which has a very strong footprint in Japan in the defence sector.

What markets and industries does Thales serve in Japan?

Historically, our footprint in Japan has been in defence and focused on the Japanese Armed Forces, especially the Navy and Army. But since we acquired the Gemalto Group in 2019, two-thirds of the team here is dedicated to our digital ID and security business. This is a fast-growing area for us and encompasses cybersecurity, data protection, digital security, identity control and biometric systems, in particular for industry and the financial services sector.

We also have a strong footprint in the medical industry, offering a wide range of high-end x-ray flat-panel detectors, imaging solutions, and digital radiography systems. Plus, we also provide in-flight entertainment systems to Japan Airlines. So all in all, a diverse portfolio.

Do you deal directly with the Japanese Government?

The business model’s a bit different in Japan, as we don’t sell directly to the end-users like the Japanese, Navy, Army or air Force. Instead, we go through established local industry partners like Mitsubishi Electric, Mitsubishi Heavy Industry, Hitachi, and Toshiba. Usually, we do this via technology transfer, so they integrate our tech into their products and solutions before selling them to the end-users.

Do Thales Japan and Thales UK work together?

We’re working very closely on naval projects, particularly underwater systems. We’re also looking to support the Navy as their information warfare needs develop. There’s an increasingly close relationship between the Japanese Navy and the Royal Navy, which is very encouraging for Thales in both countries.

Can you talk a bit about Thales’s VIGILE-D capability?

VIGILE-D is our shipborne ESM (electronic support measure) system. It detects radio signals and identifies them as friend or foe – even in dense electronic signal environments with multiple overlapping signals. For example, it can distinguish the radio frequency (RF) waves between a mobile phone and a missile, which in the past was extremely hard to do. VIGILE-D is also a real breakthrough because it’s fully digital, when most ESM systems are analogue. It provides Navies with a key advantage and will certainly be a key differentiator for the Japanese Navy in the current geopolitical environment.

All in all, Thales has a lot to offer the Japanese Navy in terms of mine warfare, mine hunting, optronic systems, sonar technologies, and onboard communications – both for submarines and surface vessels.

Did you get a chance to go aboard the HMS Queen Elizabeth, while it was in the Yokosuka Naval Base?

Sadly, due to Covid-19 and quarantine measures in Japan, I was unable to go aboard or see her up close. But I did see a lot of pictures and watched various videos. All of us here in Thales Japan encourage CSG to return and visit us again in the future.

Anything else you’d like to add?

Only that, historically, Japan has relied heavily on the US for support, but Japan is now willing to expand its alliances with other friendly nations that share the same values. So it’s really encouraging to see the Japanese Navy develop and cement an ever-closer relationship with the Royal Navy. And this deepening Navy-to-Navy relationship between Japan and the UK, I think, will encourage more industry-to-industry relationships for technology transfer between the two countries. Not only to sell to Japan, but to export to other allies around the world.

The 5G Industrial IoT – how it will change different verticals - Thales,"Fri, 19 Nov 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGFsZXNncm91cC5jb20vZW4vd29ybGR3aWRlLWRpZ2l0YWwtaWRlbnRpdHktYW5kLXNlY3VyaXR5L2lvdC9tYWdhemluZS81Zy1pbmR1c3RyaWFsLWlvdC1ob3ctaXQtd2lsbC1jaGFuZ2UtZGlmZmVyZW500gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Estimated reading time: 5 minutes

Last updated February 2023

Part 1 of this analysis explores how the new industrial IoT will be powered by ultra-fast mobile broadband



To understand the amazing benefits of innovation, think of the lightbulb. In 1750 BC, you had to work for 400 hours to buy enough sesame oil to light a lamp for an hour. By 1800, it cost 50 work hours to pay for 60 minutes of candle light. A century later, three hours of labor bought an hour of gas lamp illumination.

Today, to pay for 60 minutes of light from an energy saving bulb, you have to work for the blink of an eye.

What’s more remarkable is that the innovation is still continuing. Today, we are on the cusp of sweeping improvements across all industry sectors. As before, machines are driving these advances. However, this time the machines are not merely strong. They’re smart.

The Industrial IoT is coming – and many believe it will be the catalyst for unprecedented levels of productivity. But it can’t happen without fast and reliable connectivity that can extend to even the remotest locations.

5G provides it. And it’s already here. 5G networks are now rolling out across the world. According to the GSA, there were 180 commercial services in 72 countries in September 2021. Meanwhile, 465 operators in 139 markets are planning live deployments.

So the conditions are in place for the Industrial IoT to flourish. Indeed, the first pioneering services have been built. Let’s explore the potential impact in five key verticals.



Manufacturing

150 years ago, the manufacturing sector went through a sudden transformation; the production line was born. Before this, single artisans made most products in their own. Mass production and assembly lines drastically improved the speed – and decreased the cost – of making everyday items.

Today, again, manufacturing is at the heart of similar step change: the era of IoT-enabled smart production, also known as Industry 4.0 or the industrial IoT.

In this new age, a factory’s traditionally linear systems become dynamic and interconnected. Smart machines work together to do much more than merely physical work. Instead, they collect, share and analyse data in order to:

• Keep track of products and assets

Factory managers will be able to track parts as they move through the assembly process using smart sensors. This will give them a real-time view of output. And this visibility will extend across the entire supply chain. The Industrial IoT will give them potential access to real-time data from their transport and logistics partners.

• Monitor product quality

The addition of environmental sensors inside factories could help companies improve the quality of their goods. The sensors can send alerts when conditions drop below ‘optimal’.

• Identify faults before the happen (predictive maintenance)

Machine faults are costly. But are they unavoidable? Not necessarily. With the clever use of sensor data, it is possible to detect when a machine is showing signs of malfunction before it ceases to work completely. This raises the prospect of proactive repair – also known as predictive maintenance. The benefits? Reduced downtime, longer equipment time spans and safer factory environments.

What makes the above possibilities even more exciting is how the products themselves can play a part.

With the addition of 5G always-on connectivity and miniature-embedded sensors, you can give ‘dumb’ products the ability to feed information back to the factory. This way, quality issues can be detected. More than that, the factory can learn about routes to market and customer choices – and then use these insights to make better products in the future.

Examples are already here. In 2020 pharmaceutical company Bayer announced a printable NB-IoT-based tracking label, which costs just a few euros, to monitor its products through the supply chain.



Automotive

Opinions differ on the future of connected transport. Some experts insist the final destination is a world of completely autonomous vehicles. Others believe driving will always require a degree of human intervention.

Either way, there is no doubt that the automotive is industry is on the road to some degree of connectivity. It’s inevitable – and it’s what drivers want.

Indeed, in McKinsey’s 2020 consumer survey on the topic, 37% of respondents said they would switch brands to achieve improvements in connectivity, electrification, and shared mobility.

So what is vehicle connectivity? At present, it is measured in six levels.

• Level 0 – No automation

• Level 1 – Assistance with some driving tasks such as cruise control

• Level 2 – The driving task is shared between the vehicle and the driver

• Level 3 – Conditional driving automation. The driver must be ready to take back control when the vehicle calls for it.

• Level 4 – High driving automation. The vehicle can handle highly complex driving situations,

• Level 5 – Full driving automation. No human attention.

Every year the degree of connectivity in new cars goes up. According to ABI Research, 30 million new connected vehicles were sold in 2020, making up around 40% of new car sales worldwide. But the number will rise fourfold by 2025 to hit 115 million by 2025.

Needless to say, tomorrow’s connected cars will generate vast volumes of data. According to McKinsey, this could be as much as 1 to 2 terabytes of raw data per vehicle each day.

But the quantity of data is not the only consideration. There’s also the complexity of the value chain. A connected car needs to ‘talk’ to a diverse range of other ‘things’ in the network: traffic lights, road sensors, lighting systems and – of course – other cars.

This Vehicle to Everything or V2X ecosystem places onerous demands on the network, which obviously needs to be able to process data in vast quantities and with minimal latency.



For technical reasons discussed earlier, cellular 5G fits the bill. It also helps that the mobile industry has developed eSIMs that car makers can solder into place to 5G-connect their fleets. They can configure them remotely. What ’s more, eSIMs are also rugged, so they can withstand high temperatures and vehicle vibration.



Smart City

If the UN is correct, 68% of the world’s population will live in urban areas by 2050. With population growth, that will add another 2.5 billion people to cities over the next three decades. Meanwhile, the World Bank says there will be more than 1.2 billion cars on the road by 2030.

How can cities keep their inhabitants flourishing and safe? How can they keep the growing automotive fleet moving while minimizing the impact on the environment?

Forward-looking urban planners believe their best hope lies with making cities connected.



In a smart city, a huge network of sensors sits inside the built environment – in the street furniture, the light systems, the buildings and even the road surfaces. These sensors collect information, crunch it, and then send it to the cloud (and to other devices) in order to build a data map of the area.

City planners can deploy the smart city to better manage all aspects of civic life:

Traffic flows, electric vehicle charging, waste collection, real-time surveillance systems (security cameras, connected locks etc.) and more.

They can do this by programming smart objects to make real-time adjustments, such as re-calibrating traffic lights to ease congestion or even using flexible pricing to flatten spikes in parking.

The smart city is not a new idea. As a case in point, the New York City Department of Transportation's Midtown in Motion launched in 2012. It placed 100 microwave sensors and 32 traffic video cameras at 23 intersections to measure traffic speeds.



But 5G will change what’s possible. High speed, low latency 5G will turn a web of merely connected objects into self-learning intelligent networks.

The work has already started. In the US, AT&T is helping to build what it calls the first 5G Smart City at scale in Crystal City, Virginia. AT&T says it will use a combination of mmWave and sub-6GHz 5G spectrum to connect side-mounts, street furniture and a network of underground infrastructure. The aim? “To give businesses, residents, and visitors the opportunity to connect everything and everyone in near real time.” The initial deployments are planned for 2022.



Healthcare

For much of the last decade, supporters of telehealth tried to convince the world about the benefits of video consultations, remote patient monitoring, wearable monitors and other digital centered medical technologies.

Then came the pandemic, and the world had no choice but to experiment. Healthcare professional and patients got to try these technologies first hand. Indeed, a report by S&P Global found that telehealth patient volumes increased by almost 4,000% in the year to June 2020.

This growing acceptance suggests that digital telehealth is here to stay. 5G connectivity will take it to the next level. High speed and ubiquitous, 5G will give medical professionals the ability provide round the clock care to patients in hazardous or remote areas.

They will be able to use wearable monitors to track patients’ vital signs. And in the process, patients themselves will be freed from the need for time-consuming in-person hospital appointments.

There should be considerable cost efficiencies. According to eMarketer, 5G could save the healthcare industry $600 million in 2021—with annual global savings reaching nearly $94 billion by 2030.

Further ahead, there is the prospect of even more dramatic interventions. How about remote surgical operations? The first experiments have already happened.

In Birmingham UK, a doctor used a zero-latency 5G connection to perform a procedure. The clinician viewed the patient through a VR headset to guide a paramedic through the process with haptic glove technology.

Elsewhere, even more ambitious projects are underway. In Korea, KT Corporation and Samsung Medical Centre are building a 5G private network to enable a ‘smart hospital’. It will provide support for digital diagnostics, surgical education, AI-enabled care for inpatients, and even an autonomous robot for an operating room.

The two companies say the delivery robot can remove contaminated materials and bring in surgery supplies. This will reduce the risk of infection. 5G-enabled connectivity will enable the robot to exchange data with minimal latency.



Agriculture

The agricultural IoT is not good news for shepherds. In a world of remote animal tracking devices and autonomous drones, there are new ways to ‘watch your flock by night’.

Take, for instance, the ChickenBoy. It’s a ceiling-suspended robot that uses a set of sensors to measure thermal sensation, air quality, light and sound in poultry housing. Farmers can use a cloud platform to configure The ChickenBoy to send mobile alerts that update them on the health of their stock.

Remote monitoring is just one example of many ‘agtech’ innovations that are transforming agriculture. In truth though, the digital revolution that has already swept across other verticals – media, music, news – has taken its time to change farming. This is partly because the agricultural product itself – animals, plants – cannot be transformed.

But now the Internet of Things (IoT), edge computing, blockchain, machine learning, robotics and drones are combining to help farmers unlock new efficiencies, eliminate waste and develop new ways to track commodities from the farm to the market.

Behind all of these impactful technologies is, of course, 5G. For farmers, the particular benefit of 5G is its reach into remote areas. Rural areas will likely get a form of 5G called ‘low-band’, which will have less capacity but will extend into previously unserved areas. It will still have very low latency and be able to connect massive networks of industrial sensors.

This will give farmers the ability to monitor remote livestock and crops constantly and in real time, without the need to physically visit.

Meanwhile the high data throughput of 5G will enable a different set of benefits. Take, for example, farm machinery company John Deere’s ‘See & Spray’ tech. It fits tractors with high-resolution cameras that can capture 20 images per second, and then study the pictures to note the difference between cultivated plants and weeds. Armed with this information, it can reduce its use of pesticides.

Thales photo. FRANCE. Thales has launched the latest member of the Ground Master family radar portfolio, the GM400 Alpha. The platform is a 3D, long-range air surveillance radar, with five-times more processing power and an extended range of 10%.

Featuring digital stacked beam technology, the GM400 Alpha is designed to detect targets from jets and missiles, to helicopters and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). A feature of the GM400 Alpha is the detection and tracking of threats such as tactical UAVs flying close to the ground, hiding near the radar, while detecting and tracking higher-altitude targets.

By applying the latest processing technology as well as advanced detection algorithms, the radar is engineered to process large amounts of complex data. The result is an improvement in detection range representing an increase of coverage surface with no change to the energy required by the transmitter or receiver parts of the radar.

The company also claims that the increase of processing capacity also provides the opportunity to include upcoming new capabilities using advanced artificial intelligence algorithms as well as enhanced cybersecurity features."
Thales introduces its new Ground Master 400 Alpha - EDR Magazine,"Fri, 19 Nov 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVkcm1hZ2F6aW5lLmV1L3RoYWxlcy1pbnRyb2R1Y2VzLWl0cy1uZXctZ3JvdW5kLW1hc3Rlci00MDAtYWxwaGHSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Paolo Valpolini

With over 75 Ground Master 400 3D long range radars sold to around 17 different nations, Thales further evolved its system in order to cope with new scenarios. “In the last few years we have seen a big evolution of air surveillance needs with new types of targets . The emergence of drones is of course one of the biggest challenges, while at the same time in many parts of the world face regular testing of their airspace protection, with unidentified flights mixed into a dense civilian traffic, and the environment is also becoming harder due i.e to the deployment of large land and maritime wind farms, which do not ease the acquisition of potential targets,” Pierre Andurand, head of the Ground Master product family, explains. To cope with those situations Thales carried out an improvement programme that led to the Ground Master 400 Alpha, a new member of the Ground Master family with greater capabilities in terms of detection and identification, it is capable to pick-up targets such as Class 2 and above rotary and fixed wing tactical drones flying at low altitude, around 150 meters over the ground, that systems available could hardly find due to the clutter, providing a greater instrumented range compared to its predecessor, which provided a superior situational awareness to air defence command and control systems.

All this was done with minimal hardware changing, the Ground Master 400 Alpha maintains many commonalities with the Ground Master 400, most of the improvements coming from software development. “In fact transmitter-receiver modules are identical, hence the power emitted as well as the power consumption remain the same, the instrumented detection range having however been increased by 10% from 470 km up to 515 km thanks to a considerable work done on software, as well as to the increased computing power. The latter comes from the adoption of the new digital hardware processor named CPU rack, which allows to compute five times the data of the GM 400, which allow improving detection in complex situations thanks to the increased number of data considered and the capability to implement advanced algorithms,” Thomas Desert, project line manager for the Ground Master 400 explains.

Thales worked on this evolutionary system for two years, developing advanced algorithms and introducing Artificial Intelligence elements, which allow to improve performances especially in cluttered environments. Not only the GM 400 Alpha allows detecting threats at greater range, allowing more decision time to commanders, but it can also detect at the same time low flying drones or hovering helicopters hiding in clutter and high flying fighter bombers, within an elevation arc of 40°. “We can cope with drones ranging from Class 2 to Class 4, while for smaller ones the ideal radar is our GM 200.” The GM 400 Alpha can obviously be interfaced with C-UAS systems and jammers.

According to Thales the current configuration of the Alpha is just the start of the evolution; new performances were obtained thanks to new waveforms and new processing, but further improvements are foreseen as the computing power available in the GM 400 Alpha together with the use of AI will allow addressing specific situations, also aiming at speeding up targets classification and identification, especially in difficult environments, thanks to future software upgrades. “We are currently working on better detection and discrimination especially for targets manoeuvring in cluttered and low altitude environments, the aim being to improve the classification of such targets. A second step we will implement is the insertion of the very latest AI technologies, such as transformers that are capable to process not only many data but many data together with their context,” Thomas Desert says. According to Thales there are many possible applications based on the GM 400 active tracking capability, including performance improvements such as enhanced TBM capacity. “At the same time we are also working on new cybersecurity solutions. AI also offers many new possibilities of implementing new algorithms with deep learning technologies. In the last two years we performed many experiments on these algorithms, and they have shown a great potential for evolution,” Pierre Andurand adds. Easy upgrade and seamless integration thanks to the software design and the digital architecture of the GM 400 Alpha upgrades are simple ensuring the radar resilience to new threats. That said, while the versatility of the Alpha allows it to cope with ELSS targets, dealing with hypersonic threats is a different story; “the Alpha can detect fro low flying up tactical drones up to supersonic fighters. We are working on the hypersonic issue, seeking new solutions, that will probably materialise in different bandwidths.”

According to Thales the Ground Master 400 Alpha will also become more mobile, “even if the GM 400 has already the shortest deployment time in its category,” Pierre Andurand says. Also the GM 400 Alpha fits into a 20 ft container, which is equipped with a lifting system allowing easy loading on a truck, the radar being able to operate either on the truck or in a fixed position. High availability, efficiency and stability thanks to the robustness of the GaN technology, reduced maintenance and low life cycle cost, are the other key features of the radar.

The new Thales product is fully industrialised: “We are already producing our very first Alpha for a European NATO country, so we can say that it will be deployed in a few months,” Thales representatives say, underlining that GM400 Mode 5 version radars delivered in the last few months have already the capability to be software upgraded to the Alpha version.

Beside promoting its new GM 400 Alpha, Thales is also ready to upgrade existing GM 400 to the new standard, by installing the new CPU-rack benefiting of the same functionalities of new radars. “Some of our customers have already started the process and have taken the opportunity to implement the new Mode 5 Level 2 IFF interrogator which is also part of the Alpha configuration,” Thomas Desert points out concluding the briefing.

A Millionaire Private School Operator is Maxing Out Campaign Donations to Wake Municipal Candidates - INDY Week,"Mon, 01 Nov 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vaW5keXdlZWsuY29tL25ld3Mvd2FrZS9taWxsaW9uYWlyZS1wcml2YXRlLXNjaG9vbC1vcGVyYXRvci1tYXhpbmctb3V0LWNhbXBhaWduLWRvbmF0aW9ucy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Robert L. Luddy, the founder of the Thales Academy chain of private schools and CEO of commercial kitchen ventilation systems company CaptiveAire, makes a lot of political donations.

Over the years, Luddy and his wife Maria have given thousands of dollars to Republicans in North Carolina and across the country—and Luddy’s not sitting out this municipal election cycle, either.

Pre-election campaign finance reports filed Thursday show that Luddy donated $5,000 each to three candidates for Apex Town Council: Christine Hale and Tim Powell, both Republicans, and Gordon Williford, who is unaffiliated. Luddy also gave $5,000 to Sean Mayefskie, a Republican who is running for mayor of Holly Springs.

Voter records indicate Luddy is a resident of Wake Forest. He hasn’t made any donations to candidates running for office in his hometown, and he also hasn’t responded to requests for comment regarding these donations.

Thales Academy has two school locations in Apex, an elementary school and a junior high/high school, as well as locations in other parts of the Triangle, including in Cary, Holly Springs, Knightdale, Raleigh, Rolesville, and Wake Forest (and in Virginia, Tennessee, and South Carolina).

At its North Carolina locations, the private school chain has been in the news during the pandemic.

Thales Academy reopened its eight North Carolina campuses to students to learn in person in August of 2020 while COVID-19 case numbers were still rising and public schools were teaching virtually. Initially, masks were optional. Outbreaks of COVID-19 occurred on various campuses, and parents began complaining about the lack of a mask policy. Luddy reportedly told a parent in an email that “the flu is far more serious for children than COVID.” For the 2021-2002 school year, Thales Academy made masks optional.

Christine Hale, one of the candidates for the Apex Town Council, has been vocal on social media about her opposition to masks. She’s also on the board of the Carolina Teachers Alliance, a group that formed within the last year as an alternative to the state’s teachers unions with the mission of fighting masks in schools and opposing critical race theory.

Hale did not respond to the INDY’s request for comment.

On August 24, five days after the town of Apex instituted a policy requiring face coverings in all government buildings, all three town council members—Hale, Powell, and Williford—attended a town council meeting in person without wearing masks.

“I carried a mask with me, as I have done for the past year, just in case there was a mask law in Apex that was being enforced,” candidate Powell wrote in an email to the INDY. “When I arrived and saw that this was not the case, and knowing that I was well that day—I had no fever, no symptoms, had been social distancing and working outdoors all day—and that others in the building were also not wearing a mask, I kept my mask handy just in case I needed it.”

Williford also said that he felt he didn’t need to wear a mask to the meeting.

“From a mask perspective I feel that you should follow the rules per the location that you are in,” he wrote in an email to the INDY. “Masks were recommended but not required at the Council meeting and I chose not to wear one as I had not been exposed to anyone with COVID and was not showing any symptoms. There were law enforcement personnel present at that meeting as they are at all of them to enforce the rules and I was never asked to put on a mask.”

Hale, Powell, and Williford have been campaigning as a bloc. A flyer from the Wake County GOP promotes the candidates’ platforms as “Prioritize Election Integrity,” “Cut Government Spending,” “Stop Critical Race Theory,” and “Ensure Public Safety.”

When asked why prioritizing election integrity and stopping critical race theory is relevant to the campaign platforms of candidates for town council, Powell and Williford said they didn’t have input in the GOP flyer.

“That was a GOP flyer stating high level GOP platform statements,” Williford wrote. “Election integrity is something that every citizen should be concerned about as every vote needs to be counted to ensure a fair democracy regardless of your political views.”

“I was not involved in the creation or distribution of the flyer,” Powell wrote. “Apparently, the Wake GOP used party priorities to encourage Republicans to go vote for me.”

Powell said he was grateful for Luddy’s campaign donation but said he doesn’t know Luddy or have any connection to him and that the donation came as a surprise to him. His children, he wrote, have attended Wake public schools for a combined 15 years. Powell added that having school choices “is important for a town like Apex.”

"Thales Unveils New Radar, Shares Overall Strategy For The Near Future - Breaking Defense","Wed, 03 Nov 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vYnJlYWtpbmdkZWZlbnNlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzExL3RoYWxlcy11bnZlaWxzLW5ldy1yYWRhci1zaGFyZXMtb3ZlcmFsbC1zdHJhdGVneS1mb3ItdGhlLW5lYXItZnV0dXJlL9IBb2h0dHBzOi8vYnJlYWtpbmdkZWZlbnNlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzExL3RoYWxlcy11bnZlaWxzLW5ldy1yYWRhci1zaGFyZXMtb3ZlcmFsbC1zdHJhdGVneS1mb3ItdGhlLW5lYXItZnV0dXJlLz9hbXA9MQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS: Changing battlefield environments are pushing the radar market away from traditional large systems and towards more expeditionary designs and artificial intelligence, executives from Thales believe — a shift driving where the French aerospace and defense electronics giant invests its R&D funding for the future.

To that end, the company has unveiled a new radar system, the Ground Observer 20 Multi-Mission (GO20 MM). The technology was shown for the first time during an early October visit to the company’s headquarters. (Breaking Defense, like other outlets, accepted travel accommodations from Thales for the trip.)

The company’s ambition is to design smarter radar solutions to address the needs of its customers, said Eric Marceau, director of strategy of surface radars activities.

“Our objective is to focus on what we can implement in our current solutions in order to deal with the evolution led by new types of threats for the next five years,” Marceau said. “We want to get the performance we want in a difficult environment, and for that, we have deeply invested in new technologies over the years and are now in a position to embed algorithms based on artificial intelligence to cover a larger spectrum of threats on a lower altitude.”

One of the main challenges the company is working on is the ability to detect slow targets inside an active environment filled with things like trees or windmills that creates clutter for a system. “The objective here is to discriminate between the different targets as they are becoming smaller and smaller,” Marceau added, with main threats being advanced stealth fighters, jammers, and ballistic missiles.

“In short, we need to detect smaller targets and spend much more time on it, something extremely important because when done, you can better detect, recognize and classify your targets,” he explained.

Serge Adrian, Thales’ vice president of surface radars, said that there are more than 1,000 Thales surface radar units in service, with over 45 countries equipped with land and naval defense radars. Figures by the company show that sales have reached up to $700 million, with 80% of equipment exported.

“We are very focused on innovation and we spend a lot of money on R&D, either from our money in self-investment or from the money given to us from our customers to develop new things,” he said, adding that the company spend around $150 million in pure R&D every year.

New Radar System

The first salvo of Thales future line of products is the GO20 MM, single mode radar for continuous 360° 3D detection, tracking and automatic classification of the full threat spectrum. Reporters got their first glimpse of this new design during the visit.

“This radar provides continuous coverage, not only on the ground, but also in the airspace in 3D for the first time in the family,” explained Arndt Ulrich, product line manager. “It can also detect, track and classify targets, particularly UAVs — a capability the company plans to lean on in marketing the system.

“We can’t really say it will replace another radar because it is a brand new one, but adding the counter-UAV capability is the added value here,” Arndt said, “because the counter-UAV market is the new market in which our customers have different expectations, especially ones related to the low level airspace coverage.”

The radar is compact, has a modular configuration and is easily transportable and deployable. “In five minutes, two soldiers can set it up and quickly redeploy for a new mission, whether on a mast or for off-board operations,” he explained.

Thales also unveiled new processing capabilities allowing to use artificial intelligence inside their radars.

“The CPURACK new processing building block will better classify the threats and make threat assessment even more robust,” said Josephine Carvois Faucaud, product manager C-UAU and GO20 MM. “It also allows us to use highly complex and modern algorithms for the best UAV detection through its scalable and future-proof architecture.”

The fact that the radars are all digitalized means that Thales can easily upgrade those by adding new software. “This means we can improve our detection for UAV’s without changing the hardware of our radars, so our customers will benefit from a customizable system that will be able to tackle all kinds of threats,” Faucaud added.

The company is convinced enough in the GO20 MM that it has begun production in limited quantities. “The system is fully industrialized and we aim to produce several tens per year,” Arndt added.

Other Productions

Thales’ average annual production of tall Ground Master radars is 10 to 15 units, and the plan is to have over 140 Ground Master radars in 20 countries by next year. These include the Ground Mater 200, Ground Master 400, and Ground Master 200MM/A, the latter of which Breaking Defense saw in operation.

“We build the radars before even knowing who the customers will be because this allows us to deliver our units faster when needed. All we have to do is integrate the software and hardware upon the customer’s request and we are good to go,” Faucaud said.

Outside of radars, the company showed off its SpyRanger 330 UAS through a static display at the company’s headquarters and a live demo at their training site. Now operational with the French forces under a contract of 70 units, the system is also contracted to another unidentified customer, according to Pascal Secretin, product line manager for imagers and sensors.

When asked about their expansion plans, Secretin said the company aims to sell 30-50 units per year. “We are leaders in this area and we still aim to be. With new kind of payloads and algorithms, we will keep competing in the market and carry on with the development of our line.”

In total, the SpyRanger needs 12 minutes to be assembled and launched, explained Marc Bour, head of UAV flight tests. It is also fitted with a “high rate, secured and resilient to jamming data link system that has an anti-reply solution preventing the enemy from taking control of the UAV.”

While the system can fly at a maximum range of 30km, the live demonstration took place over a few hundred meters for a couple a minutes because of location restrictions. Thales also showed off two of its software packages for drone operations, the ScaleFlyt Remote ID and ScaleFlyt Geocaging on board of civilian drones. These allow identification and secure long-range drone operations."
Thales inertial navigation system boards French Navy vessel - GPS World magazine,"Tue, 02 Nov 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdwc3dvcmxkLmNvbS90aGFsZXMtaW5lcnRpYWwtbmF2aWdhdGlvbi1zeXN0ZW0tYm9hcmRzLWZyZW5jaC1uYXZ5LXZlc3NlbC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales and CS Group partner to offer navies a cybersecure, jam-resistant navigation system inspired by civil aviation

Thales and CS Group have partnered to offer a complete navigation system for navy surface ships. At the heart of the system is the Thales TopAxyz inertial navigation unit, which is integrated with CS Group’s real-time computer to combine high-level performance and resilience in an electronic warfare environment. The system provides high-precision pointing, gyrocompass, location and navigation functionality for all types of naval platforms, from surface combatants and submarines to autonomous vehicles.

The TopAxyz inertial navigation unit has delivered outstanding performance in the rigorous conditions of civil aviation, clocking more than 20 million hours of operation. The naval version of the unit was integrated on a French Navy vessel in less than a day by CS Group, and has already proven its operational value for maritime navigation in a sea trial.

“After proving their value on board aircraft, space launchers and French Army land vehicles, Thales inertial navigation systems are now available for naval platforms,” said Tristan Grivel, vice president business development and sales for Thales’s flight avionics business.

“CS Group has supplied real-time navigation computers, military-grade GPS receivers and other solutions to the French Navy and Naval Group for many years, explained Gilles Rigal, director of CS GROUP’s naval systems business line. “This partnership with Thales allows us to offer an innovative, robust and resilient maritime inertial navigation system for surface ships,” Rigal said.

Countering electronic warfare

In today’s constantly changing naval environment, crews need to contend with the threat of cyberattacks, electronic warfare activity and the high risk of jamming and spoofing of GPS-based radionavigation solutions. Accurate navigation data, real-time data distribution and resistance to external threats are crucial for every mission conducted by a naval vessel today.

Thales and CS Group have worked together for more than 20 years to address these issues. Drawing on their combined expertise across all the key navigation system technologies, the two companies are now proposing a new approach to maritime navigation based on more trustworthy and reliable navigation data.

The TopAxyz inertial unit uses accurate, reliable navigation information that is independent of sea state and vessel location, combined with a function that detects attempts to spoof GPS signals. The navigation data calculated by TopAxyz is distributed in real time by the NDDS (Navigation Data Distribution System) developed by CS Group’s onboard computer.

The computer uses the latest technological advances in cybersecurity, guaranteeing the best level of resilience to attacks. Its architecture offers three key advantages: safer navigation, reduced costs and integration risks, ease of use and simplified maintenance of the system. No calibration is required during the service life of the system, reducing the total cost of ownership.

The new maritime navigation system are now available, and are being manufactured at the companies’ production and integration facilities in Châtellerault and Aix-en-Provence in France."

The agreement was announced during the Feindef 2021 defense exhibition currently held in Madrid, Spain.

SAES & Thales have declared their intention to reinforce their cooperation in the field of ASW as part of the global commercial collaboration that both companies are strengthening, more particularly within SonoFlash and Dipping Sonar. SonoFlash is a new generation of active and passive sonobuoys to be deployed from fixed & rotary wing aircrafts, as well as UAVs (MALE) for armed forces.

SAES (S. A. Electronica Submarina) is a major player in the fields of sonar technology and anti-submarine defence, backed by its participation in the Spanish Navy’s major naval programmes for more than 30 years. Among others, it has been an essential part of the Spanish Segura class minehunters, the S-70 and S-80 submarines, the F-100 and F110 frigates and the P-3M maritime patrol aircraft, all of them dedicated to the submarine defence of our coasts.

About Thales SonoFlash

Thales won in January 2021 a DGA contract for the development, qualification and mass production of the new SonoFlash sonobuoy. This game changing active-passive sonobuoy is a strategic tool to complement the ASW systems currently deployed by the French Navy, providing France with a sovereign solution for high-performance acoustic buoys.

SonoFlash will be available for export to France’s allies, for all current and future air platforms: MPAs, ASW helicopters and unmanned platforms (unmanned surface vessels, rotary wing UAVs and fixed wing UAVs).

According to Thales, the SonoFlash’s innovative design and advanced technology incorporate several key features that deliver unmatched performance. Today’s buoys are either passive or active, but the SonoFlash combines the two modes in a single sonobuoy: an optimal, powerful low-frequency transmitter and a passive receiver with a high directivity gain. The combination of these two capabilities with high endurance makes the SonoFlash buoy very versatile.

The memorandum of understanding (MoU), signed in the presence of the Prime Ministers of France and Vietnam, outline an ambitious set of goals around digitizing Vietnam’s economy, strengthening its cybersecurity and telecommunications infrastructure, and supporting digital identity. ‘Digital Identity & Biometrics’ is one of four “key digital topics” identified in the arrangement.

The digital ID aspect will include a secure ID wallet project for digitized ID documents for remote and online identity verification. VNPT is the government-owned telecommunications and postal service provider in the country, and developed and implemented Vietnam’s civil registry database.

Thales has also supplied technology for smart and safe city projects in Mexico City and Nice, France, according to its website.

Position paper on Responsible and Ethical Facial Recognition

Thales has also published a new position paper on designing ethical and socially accountable facial recognition systems.

The 11-page e-book begins by touching on how many faces people can recognize, and the accuracy with which they can match people to pictures, what facial recognition is and how it works. Thales explains the difference between authentication and identification, and how the technology is used in airports and large workplaces.

The company characterizes facial recognition as “a mature, reliable, very accurate, fast matching technology,” but also recognizes a set of concerns that could act as roadblocks to its adoption.

General public mistrust is attributed to the newness of the technology, with Thales suggesting that wider communication about how facial recognition works will allay some common fears.

“But to a greater extent, these concerns highlight the need for well-defined legal frameworks and for facial recognition solutions to be used in strict compliance with these,” the company argues.

Differences in accuracy between demographics, or bias, and lack of transparency are also addressed, along with the contrasting legal frameworks for facial recognition in the EU and U.S.

“Our engagement to technologies goes far beyond the quality and the accuracy of our solutions. Today the main stake is not only to launch new solutions but to make sure they are designed to be ethically used, in line with Thales purpose and with people expectations” says Youzec Kurp, VP of Identity & Biometrics Solutions at Thales in the announcement of the position paper. “Biometrics being a highly-sensitive technology it became critical to call for more transparency and ethics in its usage; so we can build the trust we need to welcome such innovations in our daily lives.”

The Thales Lithgow Facility was recently recognised for its 20-year long partnership with the western region's largest Group Training Organisation, Skillset. In the past two decades both Thales and Skillset have produced over 60 of the region's most talented tradespersons - specialising in the mechanical, electrical and electroplating trades - to ensure manufacturing in Australia continues to be best in class and meets the demands of local and international customers.

Lithgow’s General Manager Operations Bruce Hutton was presented a 2021 Partnership Award plaque and certificate from Skillset’s Workforce Programs Manager Ben Ruddy at an event held at Thales Lithgow. The award recognises an organisation that Skillset has collaborated with over the last 12 months to form a meaningful partnership with, and one that best serves its stakeholders and the wider community.

Each year, Thales approaches Skillset with the number of apprentices it wants to sponsor and the trade areas required. Skillset then runs a comprehensive recruiting process that includes candidate profiling to determine who is the best fit for Thales. On average, the annual apprenticeship vacancies at Thales Lithgow attract up to 70-80 applicants and Skillset then narrows the talent pool to select the best contenders for the three positions available.

Even after the hire, Skillset continues to work with Thales throughout each successful candidate’s four-year apprenticeship to ensure training plans are managed and relevant government rebates are received by both our organisation and the individual. Both Bruce and Thales Australia’s Lithgow-based Business Development Manager David Forbes agree this approach works for all parties.

The Thales/Skillset partnership plays to each of our strengths. The burden and compliance of administration, recruitment, and government funding is left to those who do it best and the training is left to us who have been training apprentices since 1912. David Forbes, Business Development Manager at Thales Australia.

Our Lithgow business currently has nine apprentices and they form an important part of the team’s culture. As David points out, apprenticeships are a big part of Lithgow’s history and many of today’s technical, engineering and middle management on site started out as apprentices. “We truly believe at Lithgow that we reap what we sow, and the time we invested in our apprentices will ensure that our sovereign capability into the future is secured,” says David.

Skillset has operated since 1982 and was established by Bathurst, Orange, Blayney, Parkes, Lithgow and Dubbo Councils and Chambers of Commerce, to help regional businesses by supplying them with apprentices. Through its partnership with Thales and other organisations it has changed the lives of thousands of young adults living in regional New South Wales by supporting them in establishing a successful career through apprenticeships, traineeships or first-time employment.

HMAS Waterhen in Sydney is the Royal Australian Navy's lead establishment for Mine Warfare, and home to some of the most advanced Mine Countermeasure equipment and technology in the world. It is also where approximately 30+ Thales staff and contractors are based; providing in-service support to the Royal Australian Navy’s (RAN) Mine Hunter Coastal (MHC) fleet.

The MHCs, and other platforms at HMAS Waterhen, are scheduled to complete External Maintenance Periods (EMP) twice a year; where they receive required maintenance including refurbishment and replacement of critical mission systems.

Typically, ships Maintenance Availability’s are sequentially planned, with a potential overlap with another platform of around one week however, due to COVID-19 and associated stoppages and restrictions, the team were recently faced with providing critical support to three platforms at once.

This was the first time in the history of the MHC ISS Contract, the team were faced with the challenge of providing maintenance support to the 3 MHCs.

Justin Bayliff, Minehunter In-Service Support Program Manager, said in addition to COVID-19 safety requirements, including Rapid Antigen Testing and social distancing, the team implemented a range of initiatives to ensure the platforms could be supported while keeping everyone safe.

‘Firstly, our scheduling process became incredibly granular, almost down to the hour, which helped manage who was in attendance and how many people were working at one time. We also utilised our technical support network to move work to other vendors which mitigated issues associated with people travelling in from LGAs of concern.’

Implementing these strategies and working within the new requirements was a challenging experience for the team, but also a rewarding one, with the three platforms receiving their EMP safely and with minimal disruption. Justin attributes this to not just the initiatives that were implemented by his team, but to the collaboration of all involved.

‘This really was a joint effort with Navy, Capability Acquisition and Sustainment Group and our local supply chain. It demonstrates the importance of communication and collaboration to achieve the best for the Navy.’

As noted by the company, an unprecedented 3D long-range air surveillance radar, with 5 times more processing power, an extended range of 10% (up to 515 km), upcoming advanced artificial intelligence algorithms and enhanced cybersecurity features, it offers the most trusted radar on the market for long-range air surveillance.

Given the multitude of threats in constant evolution, building a reliable, accurate, up-to-date Recognized Air Picture (RAP) is becoming a challenge. To maintain airspace sovereignty, Forces need to rely on assets that provide superior situational awareness at all times.

- ADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW -

Leveraging on years of successful GM400 field experience, GaN technology and surveillance capabilities, Thales’ GM400 Alpha allows operators to detect all threats at short and long-range at all times and at all levels.

Featuring digital stacked beam technology, the GM400 Alpha detects targets from fast jets and missiles, to hovering helicopters and UAVs. A unique feature of the GM400 Alpha is the detection and tracking of threats such as tactical UAVs flying close to the ground, hiding in the clutter near the radar, while simultaneously detecting and tracking higher-altitude targets, such as fighter-bombers at ranges of up to 515 km.

By applying the latest processing technology, 5 times more powerful, as well as advanced detection algorithms, the radar can process large amounts of complex data. The result is an immediate improvement in detection range, up to 515 km or 278 NM, representing an increase of coverage surface of more than 20% compared to GM400, with no change to the energy required by the transmitter or receiver parts of the radar. The increase of processing capacity also provides the opportunity to include upcoming new capabilities using advanced artificial intelligence algorithms as well as enhanced cybersecurity features.

“Already supporting 17 nations around the world, the Ground Master 400 radar family is a reliable and proven partner for air surveillance.

Morocco strengthens air defense with Thales Ground Master 400 Radar – The North Africa Post - The North Africa Post,"Tue, 09 Nov 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vbm9ydGhhZnJpY2Fwb3N0LmNvbS81MzY5OC1tb3JvY2NvLXN0cmVuZ3RoZW5zLWFpci1kZWZlbnNlLXdpdGgtdGhhbGVzLWdyb3VuZC1tYXN0ZXItNDAwLXJhZGFyLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Morocco has reinforced further its airspace defense with the acquisition of Thales Ground Master 400 radar, offering the Royal Armed forces tactical advantage as the mobile radar system can easily deploy and detect all types of aerial threats.

The delivery of the long-range radar was made end July 2021 under a contract signed in 2019 with the Royal Moroccan Air Force (in addition to a previous order placed in 2013), said the French group in a press release issued Monday.

“With the Ground Master 400, the Royal Moroccan Air Force has a decisive advantage in terms of territorial protection and air surveillance. Thales is a long-standing partner of the Kingdom of Morocco”, said Christophe Salomon, Executive Vice President, Land & Air Systems, Thales.

The GM-400 “deployment reflects Morocco’s continuing confidence in Thales. We are proud to have reached the 100Th milestone of the Ground Master family, a game changing family of radars for superior situational awareness with a solid reputation for performance and reliability for national sovereignty”, underlined Mr. Salomon.

Designed to offer unprecedented deployability and survivability, the GM400 fits into compact 20 ft containers with built-in lifting systems, and offer excellent redeployment times. Fixed versions of this radar system are also available for countries planning a permanent air surveillance of their national airspace.

In another development, several press reports said that Israeli defense company Rafael has voiced readiness to supply Morocco with its “Iron Dome” missile-defense system which is used by several countries including the United States.

Last week, Spanish daily La Razón reported the deployment of missiles by Algerian army near border with Morocco which the Algerian military junta falsely blames for the death of three Algerian truck drivers.

Tension is building between Morocco and Algeria over the Sahara issue. Frustrated by its diplomatic & economic failures amid a growing popular protest movement, the Algerian regime has cut diplomatic ties with Rabat, closed its airspace to Moroccan aircraft and stopped exporting gas to Europe via the pipeline crossing Morocco in a bid to weaponize its gas supply."

New French radar processes information five times faster - Bulgarian Military,"Tue, 16 Nov 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vYnVsZ2FyaWFubWlsaXRhcnkuY29tLzIwMjEvMTEvMTYvbmV3LWZyZW5jaC1yYWRhci1wcm9jZXNzZXMtaW5mb3JtYXRpb24tZml2ZS10aW1lcy1mYXN0ZXIv0gFiaHR0cHM6Ly9idWxnYXJpYW5taWxpdGFyeS5jb20vMjAyMS8xMS8xNi9uZXctZnJlbmNoLXJhZGFyLXByb2Nlc3Nlcy1pbmZvcm1hdGlvbi1maXZlLXRpbWVzLWZhc3Rlci8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS, ($1=0.88 Euros) – Bringing together all of the Air & Space [AAE] airspace detection and surveillance resources, the Aerospace Operations Command and Control System [SCCOA] is evolving incrementally. Currently, this program is in its phase 4.2, which provides for the acquisition of new fixed and tactical 3D radars, a 3rd ACCS [Air Command and Control System, note], 2D approach radars, as well as the “Large Network Adapted to Space Watch” [GRAVES] renovation, which enables space debris to be monitored as well as foreign observation and listening satellites operating at an altitude of between 400 and 1,000 km.

In 2022, phase 5 of the SCCOA program should be launched, with an envelope of 863 million euros in commitment authorizations. It will therefore be a question of modernizing the detection capabilities at high and very low altitudes, which are based in part on Thales Ground Master 406 [or GM 406], which has a range of 450 km.

In the meantime, Thales has just unveiled a new radar with significantly improved performance compared to that displayed by its previous models in the GM400 range.

Indeed, called Ground Master 400 Alpha, this radar has five times the processing power, an instrumented range of more than 10% [515 km], and “advanced” artificial intelligence algorithms.

Long-range 3D radar, the GM400 Alpha “offers the highest update rate on the market for all surveillance missions” and thanks to “its great mobility, high availability, ease of upgrade and integration transparent”, it will be for the armed forces a “precious tool for obtaining a tactical advantage, by detecting all types of threats early, thus offering precious minutes for decision-making and action,” assures the industrialist.

The operation of this GM400 Alpha is based on digital superimposed beam technology, which allows it to detect targets “ranging from jets and fast missiles to helicopters and hovering drones”. Above all, Thales insists on its ability to detect and pursue the threat of “tactical drones flying close to the ground”, while doing the same, simultaneously, for fighter-bombers operating at “higher altitudes”.

“By applying the latest processing technology, 5 times more powerful, as well as advanced detection algorithms, the radar can process large amounts of complex data. The result is an immediate improvement in detection range, up to 515 km or 278 NM, which represents an increase in the coverage area of ​​over 20% compared to the GM400, with no change in the energy required by the transmitting or receiving parts of the radar”, details Thales, which does not fail to underline the integration of “improved cybersecurity functions ”.

According to Serge Adrian, head of “Surface radar” activities at Thales, some GM400 users have already “started an upgrade process” to the “Alpha” version.

“Already supporting 17 nations around the world, the Ground Master 400 radar family is a trusted and proven partner for aerial surveillance. The software design and processing architecture of the GM400 Alpha make it easy to upgrade existing GM400 systems in the field, ensuring radar resiliency in the face of emerging threats,” said Adrian.

Morocco receives Thales Ground Master 400 radar in milestone deal - Military Africa,"Wed, 10 Nov 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pbGl0YXJ5LmFmcmljYS8yMDIxLzExL21vcm9jY28tcmVjZWl2ZXMtdGhhbGVzLWdyb3VuZC1tYXN0ZXItNDAwLXJhZGFyLWluLW1pbGVzdG9uZS1kZWFsL9IBbGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pbGl0YXJ5LmFmcmljYS8yMDIxLzExL21vcm9jY28tcmVjZWl2ZXMtdGhhbGVzLWdyb3VuZC1tYXN0ZXItNDAwLXJhZGFyLWluLW1pbGVzdG9uZS1kZWFsLz9hbXA9MQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales delivered its 100th Ground Master (GM) radar, a Ground Master 400, to the Royal Moroccan Air Force in July 2021, under a contract signed in 2019.

According to Thales, it “delivered its 100th radar from the Ground Master family – a Ground Master 400 (GM400) to Morocco end July 2021, under a contract signed in 2019 with the Royal Moroccan Air Force (in addition to a previous order placed in 2013).”

Thales Ground Master family of radars celebrated a milestone in September 2021 as it achieved its 100th deployment worldwide.

Thales GM400 is a network-enabled, digital, S-band full-Doppler radar which uses digital beam-forming, generating stacked beams for maximum time on target.

On-site acceptance tests of a Ground Master 400 radar were carried out by the Royal Air Force (FAR). This radar can detect current and future air threats up to 500 km, with a very high level of detection at low altitude.

Thales Land and Air Systems executive vice-president Christophe Salomon said: “With the Ground Master 400, the Royal Moroccan Air Force has a decisive advantage in terms of territorial protection and air surveillance.

“Thales is a long-standing partner of the Kingdom of Morocco, and this deployment testifies national authorities’ continuing confidence in Thales.

“We are proud to have reached the 100th milestone of the Ground Master family, a game-changing family of radars for superior situational awareness with a solid reputation for performance and reliability for national sovereignty.”

The easy-to-deploy GM tactical radars have become a crucial asset for detecting threats at long range, up to 500km, and low altitudes.

Since its first delivery in 2010, the GM family of radars is constantly adapting to ever-evolving threats, in particular UAVs at low altitudes.

The radar’s digital architecture enables flexibility to innovate and anticipate new emerging challenges such as innovative algorithms mitigating the impact of wind turbines.

The long- and mid-range GM versions fit into compact 20ft containers with built-in lifting systems and offer excellent redeployment times.

Fixed versions are available for deployment as part of permanent air surveillance infrastructure to protect national airspace.

According to Thales, over 24 GM radars have been sold in 2020 alone. The radar type have been exported to Senegal which was integrated with the country’s already existing SkyView command-and-control system mounted at Ouakam Air Base in Dakar.

In May, Egypt also took delivery of Ground Master 400 (GM400) AESA long-range mobile air defense radar.

Passenger experience on Air Canada 737 MAX is head scratcher - - Runway Girl Network,"Tue, 30 Nov 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMjEvMTEvYWlyLWNhbmFkYS03MzctbWF4LWlzLWhlYWQtc2NyYXRjaGVyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"With the aim of visiting family in Vancouver last month, I began searching travel options from my home base of New York City. Roundtrip fares were as high as $700, but a flight from Montréal to Vancouver was selling for $305 with a checked bag included. Therefore, I decided to drive to Montréal and fly westward. This meant crossing the land border in New York where Interstate 87 meets Autoroute 15.

Anyone entering Canada must use the ArriveCAN app, which collects COVID-19 vaccination information and produces a QR code for use at the border. The app boasts a smart design and is extremely easy to use. Travelers must also show a negative COVID-19 test result of the PCR variety, taken less than 72 hours before arrival at the border. This required minimal effort on my part as New York City has plenty of test centers.

The drive to Montréal on a Sunday afternoon in late October was uneventful. At the border, I was greeted by six empty lanes, two of which were staffed. My immigration officer was friendly and fast, and in about 30 seconds I was in Canada without my ArriveCAN app being scanned. I suspect my information was already in the system as the officer checked my vaccine card against her screen.

A few days later, I made my way to Montréal–Trudeau International Airport for my Air Canada flight on a Boeing 737 MAX 8 (C-GEHV). I checked in via kiosk and delivered my tagged luggage to the unmanned bag drop.

Security was busy on this Friday evening with a few European-bound redeyes departing at a similar time. After security, it dawned on me that I had not been asked for any identification or COVID-related documents (Canada’s vaccine requirement didn’t go into effect until a day later). But in my decades of flying, I have never made it to a gate area without showing ID. I was asked to show ID at boarding, as was everyone else.

I knew there would be no complimentary food during the five-hour flight. And so, I consumed a brisket sandwich at Pork and Pickle, one of the few restaurants open in the terminal. Courtesy of my Priority Pass membership, I was not charged as the bill fell below the C$37 value offered to cardholders. However, I did have to show proof of my vaccinated status to enter the restaurant.

I then boarded the relatively new Air Canada 737 MAX, which includes 16 business class recliner seats and 153 economy seats.

From nose to tail, the aircraft features in-seat IFE and the signature cool blue LED lighting and large overhead bins of the Boeing Sky Interior. On our full flight, there was still a bit of overhead bin space available.

The lavatories are the opposite of spacious, however. They are truly tiny and required a bit of yoga to get situated correctly.

The large-screen Thales IFE system, which has a crisp user interface, snappy response and excellent options, featured an impressive fifteen language options. It also allowed me to pin a small map to my screen while watching other content.

Unfortunately, at the end of the second movie, the system would not work for the remaining hour and forty-five minutes of the flight.

With a 30” pitch and what is billed by SeatGuru as an 18″ width (surprising for the type), the seat itself was simply not comfortable for me on such a long route. The tray table was tiny and not sufficient as a working surface.

While each seat triple shared two power outlets — and each IFE screen has a USB port — Air Canada does not yet offer inflight Internet on its MAX twinjets, despite the presence of a radome atop the fuselage.

For its part, Air Canada years ago promised that the MAX would offer “faster Wi-Fi due to antennas with the highest bandwidth available in the industry, available starting in early 2018”.

Non-alcoholic drinks were complimentary onboard. But all food items — as listed on the IFE’s menu screen — required payment in economy. I found this to be a major negative considering that flights of a much shorter duration in the US include a few biscuits or snacks. The staff wore protective clothing and gloves while serving us.

The one area of excellence was Air Canada’s adherence to COVID-19 safety measures. These were announced at the start of the flight, and cabin attendants regularly reminded passengers to keep their masks on. A couple in the row ahead had to be reminded several times and were ultimately warned that they could be reported. The airline also distributed a safety kit with wet wipes, hand sanitizer and a spare mask.

All in all, this was a confusing experience. While the free checked bag and COVID-19 measures were confidence inducing, the lack of snacks or Wi-Fi, a buggy entertainment system and cramped interior left me tired and hungry.

(A note to AvGeeks: during my three weeks in Vancouver, I noticed that Air Canada’s roughly four daily flights on this route were operated by A223, A321s, A333, 789, 737 MAX and 77W aircraft during different times of the week. This route is like a showcase of the Air Canada fleet.)

The companies say the move enables the 'accelerated delivery' of a Sovereign Guided Weapons manufacturing and sustainment capability in support of the Guided Weapons and Explosive Ordnance (GWEO) Enterprise.

The immediate focus of the collaboration is the review of manufacturing the SPIKE LR2 Anti-Tank Guided Missile’s advanced rocket propulsion system, warheads, hot-integration and associated storage requirements.

The SPIKE LR2 ATGM is a 5th generation precision guided weapon system selected for the Land 400 and Land 159 Lethality System programs.

According to VRA, a transfer of Technology (ToT) program will upskill Australian industry to deliver domestic guided missile production and comprehensive in-service support to the ADF.

VRA, from its facility in South East Melbourne, has recently completed the manufacture of SPIKE Integration Kits (SIKs) for Boxer vehicles and is currently engaged by the Commonwealth to support Technical Certification of the SPIKE LR2 ATGM towards the missile's introduction into service.

VRA and Thales Australia have also begun reviewing and advancing SPIKE LR2 sovereign supply and sustainment capability. The companies say they will bring new SMEs into the GWEO enterprise ecosystem."

Australian companies H2X and Thales New Energy have signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Malaysia’s state-owned Sarawak Economic Development Corporation (SEDC) through its wholly owned subsidiary SEDC Energy. The agreement with see the trio form an incorporated joint venture to develop Samalaju Hydrogen Production Plant, which is proposed to be a massive 1.3 GW, capable of producing as much as 170,000 tonnes per year of liquid hydrogen or 970,000 tonnes per year of ammonia for export.

The plant is proposed for the newly built Samalaju Industrial Park and Port and will produce its green hydrogen via electrolysis powered by hydroelectricity. Sarawak, the state where the facility is to be housed, is home to the majority of Malaysia’s hydro assets, which are currently the country’s main renewable energy source while it seeks to expand its solar assets through its large-scale government-run tender programme.

According to the companies, Australian-based renewable developer Thales New Energy has already undertaken pre-feasibility studies for the project over the past 12 months. Thales New Energy seems to be a rather new player in the renewable development game, listing a number of hydrogen projects on its website all of which seem to be in early stages. This may have been a driver in its decision to team up with H2X, an Australian hydrogen fuel cell startup. Just a few years old, H2X has hit the ground running, announcing a steady stream of partnerships, projects, and vehicle designs this year.

Going forward, Thales New Energy and H2X will work closely together with Malaysia’s SEDC Energy to “quickly progress”, they say, to detailed feasibility and engineering for the Samalaju Hydrogen Production Plant. The trio expect the project will be able to secure requisite development approvals in 2022. It will then build the project over several phases, with first exports possible from 2024/25.

The companies have also said they will “look to develop local electrolyser build capabilities in Sarawak,” leaving the door open to a manufacturing component which seems to be a growing focus for H2X.

The state of Sarawak sits on Borneo island, stretching along its northwest coast. The Malaysia region is reportedly gearing up to become a hub for the emerging ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) hydrogen energy market, planning a range of hydrogen infrastructure projects. The state’s high penetration of hydro assets, as well as its strategic coastal location in the centre of south east Asia clearly adding to its attractiveness for such propositions.

Earlier this month, Sarawak Economic Development Corporation signed a different MoU with H2X Global to manufacture, assemble and develop H2X’s transport projects. Under that agreement, the pair will form a different joint venture which will see them “immediately begin” the assembly of relevant vehicles, including H2X’s hyped Warrego ute, as well as city buses and H2X hydrogen-powered generators. Presumably this means H2X will not primarily be manufacturing in Australia after all, though exactly what this means for its vision of returning manufacturing to Australian shores is unclear."

The investment, to accelerate sovereign guided weapons manufacturing capability, follows close on a $6.5 million commitment to the first phase of a plan to redevelop its Lithgow Arms facility, creating a new manufacturing and integration hub for next generation weapons systems.

The latest investment goes to new, large-scale preparation and mixing equipment which will enable a 500 per cent increase in the size of rocket motors able to be manufactured at Mulwala, supporting production of advanced guided weapons and hypersonic weapons.

Thales said in a statement: “Building on Thales’s 25-year in-country legacy of manufacturing world-leading sovereign munitions for the Australian Defence Force (ADF) and strategic Defence Industry partners, the new equipment will deliver a step-change in Australia’s sovereign capacity to produce guided munitions.

“(This will enable) the manufacture of more than 90% of the ADF’s current strategic rocket propulsion inventory and delivering the capability to manufacture future guided and hypersonic weapon systems.”

Thales said the investment represented a significant acceleration and scaling up of Australia’s guided weapons manufacturing capability to produce large rocket motors essential for advanced guided missiles.

Thales Australia’s Chief Executive, Chris Jenkins, said: “We are committed to investing in the resources and technology necessary to support the ADF and Australian Government’s ambition to accelerate the creation of a Sovereign Guided Weapons Enterprise, boosting skilled jobs and helping secure Australia’s sovereign defence capabilities.

Improving the production of piezoelectric materials for naval sonar systems - ANSTO,"Fri, 19 Nov 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuc3RvLmdvdi5hdS9uZXdzL2ltcHJvdmluZy1wcm9kdWN0aW9uLW9mLXBpZXpvZWxlY3RyaWMtbWF0ZXJpYWxzLWZvci1uYXZhbC1zb25hci1zeXN0ZW1z0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales Australia, a key supplier to the Australian Defence Forces, provided an industrial challenge to National Graduate Innovation Forum participants relating to the production of piezoelectric ceramic components used in naval sonar arrays and systems.

Such systems are used in a wide variety of applications on ships and submarines. Piezoelectric ceramics have properties that make them useful in navigation, measuring distances, detecting objects or vessels on or under the surface of the water and communication.

The technology has been in operation widely since the Second World War and is one of several types of materials used in underwater sonar transducers.

“It is the same basic technology, but obviously there are great opportunities in the development of new materials and in making improvements to manufacturing processes,” said Peter Goodwin, Thales Acoustics Centre of Excellence Director Under Water Systems.

Thales manufactures a diverse range of piezoelectric ceramic components for clients, including the Australian Defence Forces.

Although costlier, higher-performing single crystals have been developed, for some applications, the well-established workhorse piezoelectric ceramic may still be the technology of choice.

“You need large arrays of ceramics to send a signal or “ping” many kilometres through the water column and then listen for the reflected signal to try and find something such as a submarine,” explained Goodwin.

Thales wanted to improve the characterisation of the piezoelectric material, lead zirconium titanate during the complex manufacturing process, specifically while milling the raw ingredient and product sintering.

There are a wide range of parameter that need to be managed which directly impact the performance of the final product.

Thales’ Acoustics Centre of Excellence manufactures its ceramics with a “mixed oxide” technique designed to produce optimal properties at a minimal cost. This process involves the blending of raw material oxides, pre-reacting them, grinding the oxides to a fine particle size, forming the powder into the desired shape and sintering or firing the body.

“We are pushing the materials to the actual maximum of what they can do. And you must be absolutely certain it will work 200 metres under the surface of the ocean when you are a thousand kilometres offshore,” said Peter Goodwin.

“A lot of production processes controls, such milling speed, have been unchanged for a long time but that doesn’t mean they can’t be improved as we found recently,” said Goodwin.

He thinks good analytical data of characterisation parameters during milling and sintering may reveal opportunities for improvement.

“It has been a little challenging for the participants not to be able to see the production process in person, but we are really encouraged by what they have explored so far. Considering those constraints, they have done extremely well,” said Goodwin.

“They were asking the right questions and not just at the surface level.”

The Underwater Systems business unit of Thales Australia, and its Acoustics Centre of Excellence is located in Sydney, Australia, and has been manufacturing piezoelectric ceramics for around 50 years. The group has developed its own range of piezoelectric ceramic compositions based predominately on lead zirconate titanate (PZT) and also specialist materials including lead magnesium niobium titanate (PMNT) and lead-free formulations based upon barium titanate (BT).

ANSTO has a long association with Thales Australia on materials research."

Phase 1 of the plan will establish a modern manufacturing and integration hub for the design, development and precision manufacture of next generation weapons systems for the ADF, industrial partners and export customers.

According to Thales, this phase of the new development will integrate both traditional precision manufacturing and digital technologies, including 3D printing, and the installation of automated electro-plating and other metal treatment capabilities. It will also include a new purpose-built live firing test and evaluation capability to support systems integration, and the acceleration of research and technology development of digitised small-arms and weapon system platforms.

The new development will expand the precision-manufacturing capability of Lithgow Arms to support new manufacturing partnerships for strategic ADF programs, including the recently announced partnership with Rheinmetall Defence Australia to manufacture key components for Rheinmetall in support of Land 400.



“Lithgow has been the home of small arms manufacturing for over a century. Transforming Australia’s manufacturing capability benefits Australia’s self-reliance and evolves the capability of the broader Australian advanced manufacturing sector, which is essential in growing local jobs, and delivering advanced capability advantage to the ADF,"" Corry Roberts, Vice President Land, Thales Australia & New Zealand, said.

“It’s a real privilege to see our design team push the boundaries of traditional small arms solutions. Our future systems include automated and augmented features enabled by modern networked sensors and sovereign Artificial Intelligence while the system architecture is being developed to support integration with next generation soldier systems. Our industrial plan is designed to support the manufacture, maintenance and upgrade of our future systems and seeing this first phase come to life is very rewarding for our Lithgow teams,"" Graham Evenden, Director Integrated Weapons & Sensors, said.

The precinct will also provide facilities to enable collaboration across research institutions, SME partners, and key industrial partners."
Norway pension fund divesting from companies tied to weapon production - Benefits Canada,"Thu, 04 Nov 2021 14:25:06 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZW5lZml0c2NhbmFkYS5jb20vY2FuYWRpYW4taW52ZXN0bWVudC1yZXZpZXcvc3RyYXRlZ2llcy9ub3J3YXktcGVuc2lvbi1mdW5kLWRpdmVzdGluZy1mcm9tLWNvbXBhbmllcy10aWVkLXRvLXdlYXBvbi1wcm9kdWN0aW9uL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Read: Connecticut treasurer overseeing $37b in public pension funds aims to divest gun stock

The fund said in a statement that the weapons “by their nature violate fundamental humanitarian principles.”

As of this month, KLP won’t do business with companies including Britain’s Rolls Royce Holdings, Massachusetts-based Raytheon Technologies Corp. and France’s Thales. KLP said Rolls Royce produces components for a number of vessels capable of launching nuclear weapons, Raytheon develops missiles that can carry nuclear warheads and Thales develops and produces components for nuclear missiles.

A United Nations’ treaty on eliminating nuclear weapons took effect in January, so investors like KLP must apply more stringent standards to companies that contribute to making those weapons, said Aziz.

In recent years, pension and wealth funds around the world have divested stocks, bonds or investment funds from companies that they have deemed unethical or morally ambiguous.

Earlier this year, KLP divested from 16 companies that operated in Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank. They appeared on a UN list of 112 companies that it said were complicit in violating the human rights of Palestinians by operating in the West Bank.

Last year, KLP excluded Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone because of its ties to Myanmar’s military, which staged a coup. It also previously cut investments in British security company G4S, saying the group was operating in countries such as Qatar and United Arab Emirates where there is a risk of violating international labor norms.

The latest exclusions mean that KLP has sold shares worth just over 1 billion kroner ($117 million) and debt securities in the form of bonds worth around 200 million kroner ($23.5 million).

Sacre Bleu! Defence's new blow to France over Sydney dockyard. - @AuManufacturing,"Wed, 03 Nov 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1bWFudWZhY3R1cmluZy5jb20uYXUvc2FjcmUtYmxldS1kZWZlbmNlcy1uZXctYmxvdy10by1mcmFuY2Utb3Zlci1zeWRuZXktZG9ja3lhcmTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Department of Defence is canvassing views on the future management of the Captain Cook graving dock at the Garden Island Defence Precinct in Sydney – a move which could see French-owned Thales dumped as facility manager.

Thales has had responsibility for ongoing operations and services of the dock and facilities at Garden Island Naval base since 1999 with any move to dump Thales sure to raise the ire of France which is embroiled in a bitter dispute with Prime Minister Morrison.

This is especially so as Thales has consistently invested in improvements and upgrades to the Garden Island Naval Dockyard including the introduction of the 65-ton capacity fixed dock side crane, electricity sub-stations and dry dock civil infrastructure.

With controversy raging over Morrison’s sudden cancellation of a $90 billion contract with French-owned Naval Group to build submarines in Adelaide, the announcement of a Request for Information on the dock’s future would seem to be particularly poorly, even provocatively, timed.

Amazingly a media release announcing the move hit journalists’ inboxes even as France’s ambassador to Australia Jean-Pierre Thébault was speaking to the National Press Club, where he condemned the Australian government over its handling of the Aukus nuclear submarine deal, declaring it had treated France in a deliberately deceitful manner and that “alarm bells should have rung on the likely consequences”.

Head Maritime Systems at the Department of Defence, Rear Admiral Wendy Malcolm today released the request to Australian industry as part of a ‘full appraisal of the operation and support arrangements for the dock’.

RADM Malcolm said: “As we plan for an evolving regional landscape and implement Plan Galileo – our national approach to sustaining our Navy’s existing and future capabilities – it is appropriate to review the management of critical Defence assets such as the Captain Cook graving dock.”

“Australian industry has an important role to play in ensuring we develop optimal future arrangements.”

The Request for Information has been released via AusTender and industry has three weeks to respond.

The government said themes that emerge from the Request for Information, along with other considerations, will inform the future procurement strategy.

The current operations and support contract for the dock is due to expire in May 2024.

The dock was constructed during World War 2 with first ship to use the 347m dry dock the 225m aircraft carrier HMS Illustrious.

Resembling a giant bath tub, the dry dock is the last remaining facility in Australia capable of docking ships that have a displacement of more than 12,000 tonnes, and its importance is highlighted in the 2020 Force Structure Plan.

Moroccan Air Force receives Ground Master radar - defenceWeb,"Wed, 17 Nov 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuY2V3ZWIuY28uemEvZmVhdHVyZWQvbW9yb2NjYW4tYWlyLWZvcmNlLXJlY2VpdmVzLWdyb3VuZC1tYXN0ZXItcmFkYXIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Royal Moroccan Air Force (RMAF) has received a Ground Master 400 radar from Thales in the company’s 100th delivery of the system.

Thales said the milestone delivery of the 100th Ground Master, to Morocco, took place in July, with a site acceptance test in September under a contract signed in 2019 with the Royal Moroccan Air Force.

This is in addition to a previous order placed in 2013, which saw three Ground Master 403 radar systems delivered between 2013 and 2014.

“With the Ground Master 400, the Royal Moroccan Air Force has a decisive advantage in terms of territorial protection and air surveillance. Thales is a long-standing partner of the Kingdom of Morocco, and this deployment testifies national authorities’ continuing confidence in Thales. We are proud to have reached the 100th milestone of the Ground Master family, a game changing family of radars for superior situational awareness with a solid reputation for performance and reliability for national sovereignty,” said Christophe Salomon, Executive Vice President, Land and Air Systems, Thales.

The Ground Master 400 has been selected by more than a dozen countries. In 2020 alone, Thales sold 24 Ground Master radars.

The S-band radar has a detection range of 5-470 km (although Thales claims more than 500 km for later versions) at an altitude up to 30 500 metres and can be deployed in a single 20 foot shipping container. It can also be vehicle-mounted – it is available in mobile or fixed versions.

Thales said its Ground Master radars have been evolving to meet new threats, including low-flying unmanned aerial vehicles. “The GM radars’ digital architecture enables flexibility to innovate and anticipate new emerging challenges such as innovative algorithms mitigating the impact of wind turbines”.

The Ground Master 400 was the first radar of the Ground Master product family, and was followed by the Ground Master 200, a mid-range radar covering both air surveillance and air defence missions. The Ground Master 200 family now exists in two new versions – Multi-mission/All-in-one (MM/A) and the Multi-mission/Compact (MM/C) – both featuring active electronically scanned array (AESA) technology. The product family also includes the Ground Master 60, a short-range tactical radar addressing land force protection.

A decade ago, Morocco acquired eight Raytheon AN/MPQ-64F1 Sentinel air surveillance radars for approximately $67 million. These were delivered between 2012 and 2013. The AN/MPQ-64F1 Sentinel low altitude air surveillance and air defence radar is a 3D, phased array X-band unit capable of automatic target detection and tracking. The towed radar has a range of around 40 km and can detect targets from cruise missiles to unmanned aerial vehicles and helicopters."

Under the agreement, Dhaka airport will get the new and modern radar with an air traffic control system in the next three years which is aimed at enhancing the safety and security of the country's airspace, said reports.

The radar currently operational at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport belongs to instrument landing system (ILS) category, while the new one falls under communication, navigation and surveillance/air traffic management (CNS/ATM) category.

The installation of the radar is expected to take roughly three years and will cost BDT 658.4 crore, according to reports. The project is expected to be completed by June 2023 with full government funding.

The agreement would cover the supply, installation and operation of navigation and surveillance systems, including radar and related air traffic management equipment.

According to the deal, the data collected through the radar must be kept secret by the French company to ensure that airspace security is not compromised.

Reports said, Bangladesh hasa long maritime boundary and it is not possible to charge flights that use its airspace at present. The whole area cannot be covered with the existing radar. On top of that, take-off, landing and traffic management are very risky with the current radar.

The existing 37-year-old analogue radar currently installed at the airport cannot detect foreign aircrafts flying over the sea, according to CAAB.

Hence, the government decided to purchase the new radar after considering all these aspects. After the new radar is installed, it will be possible to cover the entire maritime area of Bangladesh, allowing the government to earn more revenues and ensuring airspace safety.

The new radar will increase surveillance over Bangladesh's territorial waters and airspace. It will also allow Bangladesh to collect fines from trespassing aircraft, which are required to pay a minimum of USD 500 for a single infringement.

Moreover, the new system will be able to detect aircraft that are landing or taking off. Such procedures have to be conducted with an element of risk due to the current radar's inability to detect such activity.
