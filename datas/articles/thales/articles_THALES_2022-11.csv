However, sources close to the matter tell Breaking Defense that the published data is not linked to any of the company’s major defense or national security programs.

The sources, speaking under condition of anonymity, expressed confidence that military and security projects were not affected by the breach, but admitted that it’s possible information was stolen that has yet to be discovered or made public. Even with that caveat, that sensitive defense information has yet to become public is a good sign for the firm.

Among the key projects that appear to have been protected from the intrusion are the Rafale and Eurofighter Typhoon subsystems, radars, military satellites, counter drones and counter-mine systems, airport security and cybersecurity systems.

On Nov. 11, Thales revealed that an extortion and ransomware group known as LockBit 3.0 had released on its publication platform data stolen from the company. In its statement, Thales said that there has been no intrusion of its IT systems, that it had opened an internal investigation and that it has informed France’s ANSSI national cyber security agency.

“Thales security experts have identified one of the two likely sources of the theft, which has been confirmed through the user account of a partner on a dedicated collaboration portal. This has led to the disclosure of a limited amount of information, and Thales continues to investigate the other source of theft,” the firm said in its statement.

Thales is a provider of defense, aeronautics, space, transport and digital security technologies for different countries around the world.

According to Reuters, the firm’s shares dropped as much as 8.5% on the news. But in its statement, Thales insisted that the drop in its share price is not linked to Lockbit.

“Thales reiterates that, as of now, there is no impact on the Group’s operations. The firm is working closely with its partner and is providing all of the necessary technical support and resources to minimize any potential impact to concerned customers and stakeholders,” the statement said. The company remains vigilant towards any data theft, systematically mobilizing its teams of security experts, “as data security of any of our stakeholders is our utmost priority.”

LockBit 3.0, also known as LockBit Black, is a ransomware family that was announced in July 2022. The capabilities can encrypt and exfiltrate all the files on an infected device, apparently allowing the attacker to hold the victim’s data hostage until the requested ransom is paid. This ransomware is now active in the wild, and is causing a lot of concern.

“Lockbit is a hacking group and has arguably become the dominant and most prevalent RaaS (Ransom as a service) provider,” cyber security expert and CEO of Dreamlab cybersecurity firm, Nicholas Mayencourt told Breaking Defense.

He added that this new generation of the system has improved its evasion of analysis and tracking techniques. The group even went so far to go through a paid for public bug bounty program to eliminate any vulnerabilities in their crimeware.

Mayencourt also sees a silver lining to this attack, noting that “Thales as a company offers cyber security services and products as well. After an initial compromise and frustration, this case could be a good case for Thales to demonstrate its capabilities. It is already not a good sign that this [hack occured], yet Thales has now all the possibilities to show and make the difference and re-establish trust.”

Anytime a Western defense company is hacked, questions quickly arise as to whether Russia or China are behind it, as opposed to just normal criminals looking to score some money via ransomware. Mayencourt couldn’t say what the reason for this particular attack is, but did note that there is a history between Lockbit and an older group, known as Conti, which has been tied to Russia in the past.

“As Conti has been a Ukrainian and Russian “joint venture” the group quickly imploded after the war started,” he noted, with Lockbit taking up a lot of the room that Conti had been acting in."
NASA's Artemis I successfully launched - Thales,"Wed, 16 Nov 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi93b3JsZHdpZGUvc3BhY2UvbmV3cy9uYXNhcy1hcnRlbWlzLWktc3VjY2Vzc2Z1bGx5LWxhdW5jaGVk0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The first mission of the Artemis program, named Artemis 1, has successfully been launched today aboard NASA's new mega rocket. Extremely visible in the media, the Net and social networks, this launch was extremely awaited and for good reason... 50 years after the last mission of the Apollo program, the Moon is back, more flamboyant and attractive than ever.

Why is the Moon suddenly back in sight, when the last crewed mission to the lunar surface was Apollo 17 in 1972? Well, since then a host of scientific discoveries have made this celestial body as rare as it is precious. First, as we suspected – but it was only confirmed in 2008 – there’s water on the Moon. We’ve also found oxygen and hydrogen atoms. And these could also be extracted from the lunar ice to make rocket fuel, for example. Other resources include Helium-3, an energy-producing isotope, which could power future rockets for the next step in the space race: sending people to Mars and deep space. The Moon could serve as a staging post for even more ambitious missions to the Red Planet. What used to be the stuff of science fiction is now becoming reality.

The unmanned mission launched today will serve to validate the proper functioning of the spacecraft. As astronauts, dummies have been placed on board the spacecraft, equipped with multiple sensors and instruments that will allow us to experience this unusual expedition in near real time, from the ground. This mission prefigures Artemis 2, scheduled for launch in 2024, with real astronauts on board. Artemis 2 will orbit the moon but will not land. It will be necessary to wait until 2025, with Artemis 3, so that the Humanity can again walk on the Moon.

NASA's ambitious Artemis program has three major objectives: to build a cislunar space station, Lunar Gateway, to establish a physical and sustainable presence on the Moon’s surface, and to anticipate manned exploration missions to Deep Space.

Thales Alenia Space: Sustaining Life on Humanity’s Return to the Moon

Human space exploration is rapidly evolving toward long journeys and enabling life in deep-space has become the cutting-edge technology challenge. NASA's Artemis program is its brand new chapter: lunar exploration that will send humans farther into space than ever before.

We are going back to Moon to stay in a sustainable way, a challenge tackled by Thales Alenia Space, a joint venture between Thales (67%) and Leonardo (33%), that is designing the entire lunar ecosystem, working on vehicles, orbital human infrastructures and surface solutions to enable to reach the Moon, living and exploiting resources to foster the new lunar economy.

Through its unique expertise in space infrastructures and its “Space for life” aspiration, Thales Alenia Space gives rise to all these elements, whose synergy becomes a crucial part of the “Forward to the Moon” strategy.



European Service Module - the backbone of Orion that enables human life inside the capsule

Many key technologies for Orion, the spacecraft that will bring the astronauts to the Moon’s orbit within the Artemis mission, are provided by Thales Alenia Space through the European Service Module (ESM), developed under a European Space Agency (ESA) contract. Thales Alenia Space provides the subsystems that are an essential part of the module, ensuring vital and safe conditions for the crew during the entire mission.

Thales Alenia Space provides critical subsystems for all 6 modules to Airbus Defence and Space, Orion's ESM prime contractor, including the structure, thermal control and main life support capabilities. The state-of-the-art technology used for the primary structure enables the ESM to be light enough to fly farther and longer, while being strong enough to perform its mission.

A few months ago, Thales Alenia Space delivered the backbone of Orion’s ESM4. The module is now in Airbus Defence and Space’s clean rooms in Bremen, Germany, where it will complete the integration and undergo final tests, supported by Thales Alenia Space engineers on-site. In addition to ESM4, as for previous modules 1, 2 and 3, the forthcoming ESM5 is currently being developed in Thales Alenia Space facilities in Turin.

Leonardo is also partnering the program, supplying the photovoltaic panels (PVA) and Power Control and Distribution Units (PCDU) for ESM modules 1 to 6.



Humanity’s first deep space living quarters: safety, comfort and breathtaking view

Thales Alenia Space key role in Artemis mission continues: the Company, partnering with Northop Grumman, is contributing to HALO, NASA’s habitation and logistic module that enables the “initial” life environment on Lunar Gateway, and acts as a prime contractor for the International Habitation Module (I-HAB), the European home in Lunar Orbit and the breathtaking new windowed module ESPRIT, (European System Providing Refueling, Infrastructure and Telecommunications) ensuring enhanced communications, refueling capability and additional pressurized environment making history for the new industrial solutions to get to the Moon and beyond.

Thanks to its unprecedented expertise, drawing on the experience gained with five Automated Transfer Vehicles (ATV) and development of a large part of the elements for the International Space Station (ATV Integrated Cargo Carriers, Nodes 2 & 3, Cupola, Columbus, MPLM, PMM, Cygnus PCM, Bishop Airlock), Thales Alenia Space is not only leading the race for pressurized modules, but contributing to the development of the “new Apollo” – and to human exploration of space beyond low-Earth orbit."
"Thales: Lockbit releases stolen data, company denies any intrusion into its IT systems - Le Monde","Sat, 12 Nov 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5sZW1vbmRlLmZyL2VuL3BpeGVscy9hcnRpY2xlLzIwMjIvMTEvMTIvdGhhbGVzLWxvY2tiaXQtcmVsZWFzZXMtc3RvbGVuLWRhdGEtY29tcGFueS1kZW5pZXMtYW55LWludHJ1c2lvbi1pbnRvLWl0cy1pdC1zeXN0ZW1zXzYwMDM5MjFfMTMuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Thales Group, which specializes in cybersecurity among other sectors, has been targeted by a cyberattack. Data belonging to the group was released on the web. AFP/PASCAL PAVANI

An archive of 9.5 gigabytes ""of data related to [the French company] Thales"" was published overnight on the website of the cybercrime gang Lockbit. The archive contains data related to Thales contracts and partnerships in Italy and Malaysia.

Contacted by Le Monde, Thales confirmed that the data had been posted on the hackers' site, but said that there had been ""no intrusion"" into the company's IT system. ""Thales' security experts have identified one of the two likely sources of the information theft. It was a partner's account on a dedicated exchange portal that led to the disclosure of a limited amount of information,"" said a company spokesperson, adding that its teams are working to identify the second source. Thales also said that the data leak has no impact on its business.

The documents posted by Lockbit on its site mention, among other things, a project by Thales and Malaysia-based Novatis Resources to implement aerial surveillance tools for Malaysia's Kota Kinabalu airport, a program that was announced in 2018. The documents, which are dated 2021, mention the project and the monitoring done by the company. Other files refer to contracts awarded by Thales in Italy, particularly in Florence, to support an automated ticket sales system for public transport services. The archive does not appear to contain any personal data belonging to the company's employees.

Lockbit had announced earlier this month that it was in possession of data stolen from Thales and threatened to post it on its website. The cybercriminal group then set up a countdown to a November 7 release. On that day, the site posted a message indicating that the data had been published, but did not give access to it, making observers doubt the reality of the attack. Then the stolen files finally appeared on the site during the night of November 10 to 11.

This is not the first time Lockbit has claimed an attack against Thales: In January, the group announced that it had stolen data from the group. The data released at that time contained mainly code repositories from an external server of the company, data considered ""not very sensitive"" by the French company.

One member of the group arrested in Canada

On Thursday, US authorities announced the arrest of a person based in Canada accused of working for the Lockbit group. This citizen, who has dual Russian and Canadian citizenship, is currently in custody awaiting extradition to the United States.

According to the documents published by the US justice system, a search conducted in August by law enforcement agencies resulted in the seizure of the suspect's computer, which revealed traces of logins to the control panel of the ransomware developed by Lockbit, as well as messages exchanged with LockBitSupp, an account used by the cybercriminal group to provide support for its software. Also according to the US Attorney's Office, a file containing a list of past and future targets of the Lockbit group was identified on the suspect's computer. During a second search, investigators also traced a cryptocurrency wallet held by the suspect containing 0.8 bitcoin (€13,482 according to the price of bitcoin at the time of publishing this article). The source of this bitcoin corresponds to a ransom payment by one of the Lockbit group's victims. The suspect faces up to five years in prison.

Lockbit is one of the most active cybercrime groups. It boasts of numerous victims on its website, though in some cases its success has been mixed. For example, Lockbit announced the hacking of data belonging to the French Ministry of Justice, before actually publishing data from a law firm in Caen. The group had already made numerous false claims in the past. However, it has made serious damage in France, including at the hospital in Corbeil-Essonnes (Paris region) in August. The hospital's systems were paralyzed for several days following the attack, and stolen data was released by the group in early September.

French defense multinational Thales confirmed Friday that ransomware group LockBit published internal documents, emphasizing in a public statement that its operations were unaffected by the hack.

The digital extortion gang added Thales to its list of hacking victims in late October, giving the 1.6 billion-euro electronics, avionics and troop transport maker until Nov. 7 to pay a ransom. Among the 9.5 gigabytes worth of records listed by hackers are Thales' account files, details regarding software applications and other data that LockBit describes as ""high-risk and confidential.""

Thales says the source of the leak is likely the compromised user account of an online partner collaboration site.

""Thales reiterates that, as of now, there is no impact on the Group's operations,"" the company says.

LockBit is a prolific ransomware group. It has been active since late 2019 and is often considered the winner of the contest to succeed Conti as the world's most recognized digital extortion gang. In June, it released version 3.0 of its ransomware with a call to ""Make Ransomware Great Again!"" (see: Keys to LockBit's Success: Self-Promotion, Technical Acumen).

Canadian law enforcement recently arrested suspected LockBit affiliate Mikhail Vasiliev, 33, in Ontario in an international sting conducted with the involvement of the FBI and the French National Gendarmerie. U.S. authorities are seeking his extradition to New Jersey, where he faces federal charges of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion."
ASCEND: Thales Alenia Space to lead European feasibility study for data centers in space - Space Ref,"Mon, 14 Nov 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VyZWYuY29tL3VuY2F0ZWdvcml6ZWQvYXNjZW5kLXRoYWxlcy1hbGVuaWEtc3BhY2UtdG8tbGVhZC1ldXJvcGVhbi1mZWFzaWJpbGl0eS1zdHVkeS1mb3ItZGF0YS1jZW50ZXJzLWluLXNwYWNlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Station Data Center V2 Thales Alenia Space

Thales Alenia Space, the joint company between Thales (67%) and Leonardo (33%), has been chosen by the European Commission to lead the ASCEND (Advanced Space Cloud for European Net zero emission and Data sovereignty) feasibility study for data centers in orbit, as part of Europe’s vast Horizon Europe research program.

Thales Alenia Space, the joint company between Thales (67%) and Leonardo (33%), has been chosen by the European Commission to lead the ASCEND (Advanced Space Cloud for European Net zero emission and Data sovereignty) feasibility study for data centers in orbit, as part of Europe’s vast Horizon Europe research program.

Digital technology’s expanding environmental footprint is becoming a major challenge: the burgeoning need for digitalization means that data centers in Europe and around the world are growing at an exponential pace, which in turn has a critical energy and environmental impact.

A consortium led by Thales Alenia Space has been set up to find an ambitious solution for Europe, namely to install data center stations in orbit, powered by solar power plants generating several hundred megawatts. This project could help meet Europe’s Green Deal goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 and would also be an unprecedented development in the European space and digital ecosystem.

This concept makes direct use of the energy produced in space outside of the earth atmosphere: the only link with the ground would be high-throughput Internet connections based on optical communications, a technique for which Europe has mastered the underlying technologies.

For the ASCEND feasibility study, Thales Alenia Space is leading a consortium of companies with complementary areas of expertise spanning the environment (Carbone 4, VITO), cloud computing (Orange, CloudFerro, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Belgium), launch vehicles (ArianeGroup) and orbital systems (German aerospace center DLR, Airbus Defence and Space and Thales Alenia Space).

The first objective of this study will be to assess if the carbon emissions from the production and launch of these space infrastructures will be significantly lower than the emissions generated by ground-based data centers, therefore contributing to the achievement of global carbon neutrality. The second objective will be to prove that it is possible to develop the required launch solution and to ensure the deployment and operability of these spaceborne data centers using robotic assistance technologies currently being developed in Europe, such as the EROSS IOD demonstrator.

This project is expected to demonstrate to which extent space-based data centers would limit the energy and environmental impact of their ground counterparts, thus allowing major investments within the scope of Europe’s Green Deal, possibly justifying the development of a

more climate-friendly, reusable heavy launch vehicle. Europe could thus regain its leadership in space transport and space logistics, as well as the assembly and operations of large infrastructures in orbit.

French defence and technology group Thales said on Tuesday that the hacker group LockBit 3.0 claims to have stolen some of its data and is threatening to publish it.

Thales, the defence and electrical systems firm, confirmed that a hacker group claims to have stolen some of its data and is threatening to publish it.

Thales said the extortion and ransomware group has announced plans to release the data on 7 November. It added that so far it had not received any direct ransom notification.

Thales has launched an internal investigation and has informed the ANSSI national cyber security agency, but so far has not filed a complaint with the police, a company official said.

The hackers have not provided proof they have obtained any Thales data, the official added.

Lockdowns

Earlier this year, Thales itself warned that companies in general face increased vulnerability for cyber attacks as a result of people working from home on their private devices.

Thales quotes a 2021 FBI Internet Crime Report, which notes that cyber crime is on the rise as a direct result of company employees working from home – a rising trend since the lockdowns generated by the Covid-19 pandemic - using private computers and mobile devices that are often not equipped with company-level security.

""People are tricked into downloading apps loaded with malware,"" according to the report.

""In 2021, the percentage of organisations that experienced the installation of malware on a remote device doubled from 3 percent to 6 percent.

The report also pointed out that ""phising"" – luring people into clicking links that may allow malware to enter their computers – is ubiquitous, with five out of six organisations confirming that they had experienced an email-based phishing attack that tricked users into risky action, such as clicking a bad link, downloading malware, providing credentials or executing a wire transfer.

Earlier this year, a hospital in south-eastern Paris was crippled by an cyberattack claimed by LockBit as well.

That attack drastically reduced the number of patients who could be admitted and forced a temporary return to pre-digital workflows.

On Tuesday, the French multinational publicly stated that it had seen posts on the dark web by ransomware group LockBit 3.0, claiming to have stolen data from Thales and threatening to post it online on 7 November. The company quickly informed the Agence nationale de la sécurité des systèmes d'information (ANSII), and began an internal investigation.

However, the investigation has found no evidence of exfiltrated data, nor even any trace of intrusion into company systems. At the time of writing, the group has not posted further threats nor provided the company with evidence of the attack.

LockBit's historical stunts

This isn’t the first time that the LockBit group has posted that it has made claims about having attacked a company, only for it to be discovered that no such attack was made.

In June 2022, the group claimed that it had breached the network of cyber security giant Mandiant and posted a notice on its website claiming that the release of more than 350,000 stolen company files was imminent.

However, Mandiant never found evidence that such an attack had taken place, and the countdown to the leak on LockBit’s website came and went without the data ever being published.

A McAfee blog post covered a similar claim by LockBit, in which it claimed to have stolen data from an unnamed company. However, in an investigation both McAfee and intelligent security firm Northwave were unable to establish any evidence that the compromised systems experienced private data exfiltration.

Available through the ransomware as a service (RaaS) model, and in use by a number of other threat actors such as sanctioned Russian group ‘Evil Corp’, it is hard to categorically link the use of LockBit ransomware strains with the group.

LockBit continues to be the most widely-used strain in attacks, and in August vowed to be 'more aggressive' after being hit by a large distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack.

It accounted for 35.1% of all ransomware activity in Q3 2022, even as ransomware activity declined slightly. Its meteoric rise has been linked, in part, with the demise of rival group Conti, which ceased all activity in June following a public attack on the Costa Rican government and subsequent threat to overthrow it if the $20 million ransom was not paid in full.

The company’s vice president for the Middle East, Emmanuel de Roquefeuil, said the French firm currently has some 1,500 people in the region and is aiming to double that figure within five years. To do that, and in light of local restrictions on foreign firms operating independently, Roquefeuil said Thales will expand its use of subsidiaries and partnerships with local firms, universities and government entities.

The demand for Thales products, from mine countermeasures to counter-UAV tech, has only increased, he said. The industry’s future will all be about localization.

“The Middle East is a strategic region for Thales, and it has started its journey towards industrial and digital autonomy to localize defense industrial spending,” he said. “Thales wants to contribute to the development of a local digital ecosystem in line with the policies in the region, accelerating transfer of knowledge and technology, as well as creation of high-value data-scientists jobs.”

Breaking Defense spoke to Roquefeuil during the Euronaval conference in Paris in October, where several of the firm’s systems were on display. The following transcript has been edited for length and clarity.

BREAKING DEFENSE: What is Thales’s strategy in the Middle East and what are its main interests in the region?

ROQUEFEUIL: Thales strategy in the Middle East is based on three major pillars: our customers, stakeholders and people. We have a definite strategy for each of them.

The customers: We are increasing our engagement in industrialization and localization to facilitate increasing our industrial footprint in Middle East countries, through a certain number of activities. We mainly capitalize on the systems, which have been produced and delivered, to our customers in the region. To serve them and maintain the delivered equipment, we are increasing our level of industrial proximity.

Stakeholders: We constantly innovate, research, develop and implement new technologies to ensure continuity of critical operations and functions for our stakeholders across all business units. We invest 1 billion euros ($1 billion USD) a year in self-funded research and development, and around 30,000 Thales employees are involved in research and technology. This can support our stakeholders in the Middle East to achieve their industrialization goals, through innovating some products for our local customers and exporting from the Middle East.

People: With our main concern for education and local employment, at Thales, we are employing more nationals from the Middle East, taking into consideration each country’s policies. Thales seeks to deepen its presence in the region by contributing to the national vision development plans. One of our main targets is Emiratization, which has the highest level of requirements for companies like us, followed by Omanization, and Bahrainization. Therefore, we are answering the needs of each of those countries, as well as giving priority to education and training through institutions and universities with which we have links and channels. We are aiming to train and empower local youth and communities to support innovation in Middle East.

With localization efforts, it is harder for foreign companies to increase exports to the Middle East. How is Thales dealing with this?

In the Middle East we are 1,500 people and we have been in the region for 50 years. We are generating a significant portion of revenues, and 60 percent of this revenue is defense-related with the development of sovereign technologies. In this context, the best way to innovate is to do it locally with our customers. We are thus clearly developing local companies like Thales Emarat Technologies in the UAE. There is a strategic relationship between France and the UAE in the domain of sovereign technologies. Based on Thales products line that is put at the disposal of Gulf countries, we can generate new IPs and products with the Middle Eastern countries.

Thales has developed its local footprint in UAE, through localization strategy. Thales Emarat Technologies is the best example of this. It is embedded in the UAE ecosystem and is fully aligned with the UAE’s national strategy and the visions of its leadership to develop a nation that is at the forefront of innovation, has strong human capital and is self-reliant. Thales Emarat Technologies was created to develop centers of excellence in critical systems such as radars, digital communications and a variety of defense aerospace technologies.

Related to innovation, the Competence Centers that we have developed are key in maintaining a privileged link with local entities and in developing innovative solutions. Moreover, Thales is never acting alone in an environment like the Middle East. Thales is embedded in the local industrial ecosystem and rely as much as possible on the local supply chain.

What is Thales pitching the Middle East countries? And what particular Thales systems are of interest to this region?

Warfare is intensifying, so collaborative combat and resilience are clearly a priority to the region as we have recently witnessed attacks by drones in the Middle East. In this regard, Thales is supporting [confronting] certain scenarios, like attacks by drones, including UAVS at low-speed, low altitudes and unmanned surface vessels. Clearly counter-UAV is a capability, which mainly governments are looking for today, whether aerial or naval. As a result, we are aiming to develop the market of counter UAV systems in the region.

Another emerging threat and technology is anti-mine warfare, and protecting the shores, especially in the ME and the Gulf. Different countries around the world, not only in the ME, have shown interest in Thales Mine Counter Measure (MCM) systems. ME countries are looking for radars (and mainly the new version of digital radars such as Thales SeaFire) to be integrated on frigates, or other types of ships. As threats are increasing, I am confident that we will see this type of technologies in the ME.

In the space sector, how is Thales supporting the ME countries develop their defense capabilities?

Today we are part of UAE’s FalconEye satellite system with Airbus, and the system is operational and delivering excellent services to the country. Thales is also part of the telecommunication satellite in the UAE, and in the space sector, we are in discussion with Gulf Cooperation Council countries that are really looking for acquiring space capabilities for observation or military communication.

What is your next five-year plan in the region?

Today Thales has 1500 employees in the ME, five years from now we expect to double this number.

The Middle East is a strategic region for Thales, and it has started its journey towards industrial and digital autonomy to localize defense industrial spending. This is in line with the ambitious national vision to reduce reliance on foreign import, attract and develop the intellectual capital needed to allow them to compete on the global stage. Thales wants to contribute to the development of a local digital ecosystem in line with the policies in the region, accelerating transfer of knowledge and technology, as well as creation of high-value data-scientists jobs.

Hence, the main target is to bring security, safety and growth, whilst preserving state sovereignty, providing sustainable economic development, and fostering local talent."
Thales deploys an energy usage and efficiency plan - Thales,"Tue, 29 Nov 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi9ncm91cC9yZXNwb25zYWJpbGl0eS9uZXdzL3RoYWxlcy1kZXBsb3lzLWVuZXJneS11c2FnZS1hbmQtZWZmaWNpZW5jeS1wbGFu0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales deploys an energy usage and efficiency plan Share this article



LinkedIn

As part of its strategy for a low-carbon future launched in 2019, Thales is strengthening its approach to energy usage and efficiency. The Group is aiming for a 10% reduction in electricity and gas consumption in France by 2024 compared to 2019.

Thales is a low-energy intensive company compared to other industrial players. Indeed, the core of its energy consumption comes from laboratories and the Group is already committed to using energy responsibility for the long term.

The focus of the Group’s actions has been on electricity, which accounts for the majority of its energy mix (86% in 2021). In 2022, Thales achieved an important milestone with 100% of its electricity supply in France now coming from renewable sources (32% Worldwide).

In the current context of a global energy crisis, amplified in Europe by the war in Ukraine, Thales is elevating its ambition by deploying a new energy usage and efficiency plan.

In line with Thales’s technology-driven DNA, the plan includes four prongs:

Standardisation of good practices and raising awareness of eco-actions among employees; Self-production and energy efficiency; Real estate footprint optimisation; Strengthening of sustainable mobility initiatives.

© Thales

This plan is part of the Thales strategy for a low-carbon future, which aims to reduce operational CO₂ emissions by 35%* in absolute value between 2018 and 2023, 50% by 2030, and net-zero in 2040.

Outside of France, the Group will develop energy efficiency plans for its operations in ten other countries that account, with France, for more than 90% of its energy consumption: Australia, Belgium, Canada, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Singapore, the United Kingdom and the United States.

Our energy saving initiatives are neither short-term nor temporary. They are part of our commitment to the protection of the environment, which is one of the three structuring axes of Thales's CSR policy. This is a long-term approach, with a gradual deployment throughout the Group.

Sophie Le Pennec, Vice President, Thales Group Health, Safety and Environment

THE PLAN FOR FRANCE IN DETAIL Standardisation of best practices across the Group and raising awareness among employees Adoption of four best practices across the Group Regulation of temperatures of tertiary activity buildings between 19°C (heating) and 26°C (air conditioning)

Regulation of temperatures of data centres and data rooms

Switching off lighting and neon signs, equipment and ventilation at night and outside working days, as well as in unoccupied areas, in strict compliance with on-site Safety and Security rules.

These best practices will be deployed across the Group and in compliance with local regulations where the Group is present. Actions to raise awareness among employees: Publication of a guide on good practices to adopt

A communication and education plan to reduce energy consumption in the workplace Self-production and energy efficiency

No fewer than 100 self-production and energy efficiency projects are being rolled out in France. Installation of parks of photovoltaic panels on suitable sites Projects already rolled out in Toulouse and Cannes.

Projects planned for La Ciotat, Brest, Etrelles, Ymare and Gemenos in 2023.

Additional projects under study could eventually make Thales's photovoltaic panel installations one of the largest industrial parks relying on such technology in France by 2026. Heat recovery, especially in data centres Projects already in place in Toulouse, Blagnac.

In Elancourt, heat recovery from data centres will allow us to heat all the buildings on the site and drastically reduce – and eventually end -- local gas consumption. Local initiatives on all sites: optimisation of data centres, replacement of energy-consuming equipment, replacement of lighting with LEDs, installation of new types of equipment (biomass, heat recovery, heat pumps, etc.) Real estate optimisation : the Connect project

The Connect project is an investment plan covering four expansion and transformation projects in the Paris region. It concerns the optimisation of the real estate footprint of 12 sites, representing 20% of employees in France. Underway since 2021 and with an end date scheduled for 2027, it aims, among other things, to improve the carbon footprint and energy management of the sites concerned. Sustainable mobility Initiatives

Between 2023 and 2026, the entire Thales global vehicle fleet will switch to electric and/or hybrid engines**.

*Scope 1&2 and Scope 3 business travel

**On an exception basis, fuel-powered vehicles could be included in the policy based on each country’s energy mix."

LinkedIn

By bringing together their expertise in the area of Automatic Train Operation (ATO), Thales and Knorr-Bremse are looking to develop automated features for the Digital Freight Train (DFT)

Automatic Train Operation will greatly assist train drivers in their daily work and thus help to counter the sector’s looming staff shortages, as well as improve rail freight’s efficiency, punctuality and competitiveness

Knorr-Bremse, the global market leader for braking systems and other mission-critical systems for rail and commercial vehicles, and Thales, a global leader in advanced technologies have signed a Memorandum of Understanding to cooperate on the development of Automatic Train Operation (ATO) solutions for locomotive-hauled freight and passenger trains.

“In our industry, Automatic Train Operation is a key lever for making rail freight more efficient and more available, increasing transportation capacity, and further optimizing lifecycle costs for operators”, explains Dr. Nicolas Lange, Chairman of the Management Board of Knorr-Bremse Rail Vehicle Systems. “Our partnership agreement with Thales has enormous potential for bringing about the innovations required to enable safe and smooth Automatic Train Operation and thus improve, for example, energy efficiency and punctuality.”

“Full autonomy is still a work in progress, although the necessary technologies are maturing rapidly. ATO is one of them, as a necessary step toward achieving fully autonomous driving. Thales has a clear vision for autonomy and is pleased to partner with Knorr-Bremse, a leading company in braking systems and other mission-critical train systems, with the aim of accelerating the development of automated train functions in the freight market”, adds Dr. Yves Joannic, Vice President Main Line Signalling and Managing Director Ground Transportation Systems at Thales Germany.

Automatic Train Operation (ATO) will deliver multiple benefits for the rail freight sector. These include anticipated gains in efficiency and capacity, energy savings, performance enhancements and better punctuality. Train punctuality in particular (Estimated Time of Arrival) depends on smooth, consistent train driving based on factors such as track characteristics, topography and surrounding traffic, as well as train-specific parameters such as load, which influences traction and braking performance.

Intelligent interaction to drive ATO for existing rail fleets

While many of these criteria are still monitored manually, digital and automated functions will significantly improve how they are tracked and utilized. By using sensor-based, real-time data, for example, new features will be able to deliver intelligent insights to train drivers and devise optimal driving strategies. Therefore, the smart interaction of the expertise of the two companies will be crucial. Especially in existing fleets, Automatic Train Operation will support drivers in their daily work. Among other advantages, this will help to counter looming staff shortages in the rail freight business.

With respect to 2030 climate targets, i.e. reducing transportation emissions by at least 18% (European Commission, 2020), upgrading the rail freight sector is imperative for shifting large amounts of freight from trucks and airplanes to green, rail-based transportation. Rail consumes 12 times less energy and emits up to 11 times less CO2 per passenger / ton kilometer compared with cars and trucks (IEA 2021)."

SMRT Trains, Singapore’s pioneer and dominant rail operator, and Thales have signed a repair collaboration agreement to establish a local repair facility on the rail operator’s premises at Bishan Depot to reduce repair turnaround time and improve cost efficiencies.

Thales’s renowned SelTracTM Communication-Based-Train-Control (CBTC) signalling system is used on the North-South and East-West lines (NSEWL) of Singapore’s rail network, both of which are operated by SMRT Trains. Currently, critical electronic cards for the signalling equipment are produced and repaired by Thales at its dedicated facilities in Canada and France.

With this agreement, Thales’s rail experts will work closely with SMRT Trains’ Integrated Electronic Workshop to set up the repair facility. This includes training and transfer of expertise and technical know-how to enable technicians from SMRT Trains to diagnose and repair faulty components.

On the digital front, SMRT Trains and Thales have signed an agreement to jointly develop an intelligent rail analytics platform for the smart monitoring of rail signalling systems. Under this agreement, SMRT Trains’ engineers and Thales experts will organise a series of Design Thinking workshops to define specific use cases and identify key maintenance priorities.

Built upon Thales’s Urban Rail Signalling – Rail Analytics Platform, the tailored digital platform will leverage condition-monitoring devices, data analytics and cloud computing to automate the analysis of signalling system health and performance, and to identify and address potential maintenance issues before they occur. This will help to better manage engineering resources and improve systems reliability and performance.

“SMRT Trains is continuously looking at ways to enhance the safety, reliability and productivity of our rail maintenance regimes. We are excited to collaborate with Thales to strengthen our maintenance capability and resilience, as well as bolster our staff’s expertise.

The use of digital technologies to preempt maintenance issues is also a key strategy for SMRT Trains as we strive to provide smooth journeys for commuters.” Lam Sheau Kai, President, SMRT Trains

“Thales truly appreciates the continued trust that SMRT Trains has placed in us. With these agreements, we will tap into Thales’s renowned expertise in managing complex, global rail projects to deepen local expertise and capabilities in Singapore’s rail ecosystem. We look forward to co-innovating on cutting-edge digital solutions in intelligent rail analytics. This will help ensure safer and more reliable rides for commuters.” ​ Emily Tan, Country Director & Chief Executive, Thales in Singapore

The two agreements signed between SMRT Trains and Thales follow the recent announcement of a joint initiative by the partners called “The Next-Generation Green CBTC Project”, which aims to reduce electricity consumption and further improve traction energy efficiency of the NSEWL."
Worried about your datacenter carbon footprint? Why not put it in orbit? - The Register,"Wed, 16 Nov 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJlZ2lzdGVyLmNvbS8yMDIyLzExLzE2L2RhdGFjZW50ZXJfb3JiaXQv0gE8aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlcmVnaXN0ZXIuY29tL0FNUC8yMDIyLzExLzE2L2RhdGFjZW50ZXJfb3JiaXQv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The European Commission is to carry out a feasibility study on putting datacenters into orbit as part of its wide-ranging Horizon Europe research program, and has now announced companies taking part in the project.

Thales Alenia Space, a joint venture between European aerospace and defence companies Thales and Leonardo, announced that it has been selected by the European Commission to lead the ASCEND feasibility study, which stands for Advanced Space Cloud for European Net zero emission and Data sovereignty.

The impetus behind this project is apparently environmental, according to Thales Alenia Space. The ever-expanding market for IT services means that datacenters in Europe and across the globe are growing at a rapid pace, which in turn has an impact on energy consumption and can harm the environment.

It isn't perhaps an obvious solution, but Thales Alenia Space will lead a consortium of companies examining whether datacenters can be put into orbit, powered by solar energy and use optical communications to provide a data link with facilities on the ground.

The company said the project could help meet Europe's Green Deal goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, and would also be an ""unprecedented development in the European space and digital ecosystem.""

According to Thales Alenia Space, the energy to power such orbital datacenters could come from solar power plants capable of generating several hundred megawatts, while the link with the ground would use high-bandwidth internet connections based on optical communications, ""for which Europe has mastered the underlying technologies.""

The first objective of the study will be to assess if the CO 2 emissions from the building and launching of the space infrastructure would be significantly lower than the emissions generated by simply building more ground-based datacenters.

A second objective will be to prove that it is possible to develop the required launch solution – ie, that it is actually feasible to stick a datacenter on a rocket and put it into orbit in a working state – and to ensure the operability of the space-borne datacenters.

According to Thales Alenia Space, the latter could be accomplished using robotic assistance technologies currently being developed in Europe, such as the EROSS IOD demonstrator.

EROSS IOD (European Robotic Orbital Support Services In Orbit Demonstrator) is a project to develop technology for in-orbit servicing of satellites in order to extend their usable life, and is also led by Thales Alenia Space.

The idea may sound wacky, but at least the European Commission is stumping up the cash to investigate how achievable it is. It seems likely that an orbital datacenter would be constrained by what fits atop the largest launch vehicle, and thus would be much smaller and have far less capacity than ground-based datacenters, unless they can perhaps be linked together in orbit.

Other concerns would be that it would be very difficult to send out an engineer to fix a failed storage array, and the lifecycle of servers means that the infrastructure would be out of date after about five years or so.

ASCEND was detailed in a factsheet published in October by the European Commission and stems from the 2021 Horizon Europe calls for space-based proposals. It states that ASCEND will receive a grant of over €2 million ($2.08 million).

The consortium includes numerous companies with relevant areas of expertise, including the environment (Carbone 4, VITO), cloud computing (Orange, CloudFerro, HPE Belgium), launch vehicles (ArianeGroup) and orbital systems (German aerospace center (DLR), Airbus Defence and Space and Thales Alenia Space). ®"

The European Commission has contracted Thales Alenia Space to lead the ASCEND feasibility study for data centers in orbit.

The data centers would rely on solar power plants generating several hundred megawatts, which would also be in space.

They would then link to the Earth via high-throughput optical communications.

The military contractor is teaming up with several others for the study - climate companies (Carbone 4, VITO), cloud computing and IT businesses (Orange, CloudFerro, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Belgium), launch vehicle developers (ArianeGroup), and orbital systems makers (German aerospace center DLR, Airbus Defence and Space, and Thales Alenia Space).

The first stage of the study sets out to answer a critical question - whether the emissions created by producing and launching the space data centers would be less than that generated by ground based ones.

Then it will study whether it is possible to develop the necessary launch solution and to ensure the deployment and operability of these spaceborne data centers using robotic assistance technologies, with a particular focus on those developed in Europe, such as the EROSS IOD demonstrator (also made by Thales Alenia Space).

Thales Alenia Space notes that if the project is successful, it could justify the development of a more climate-friendly, reusable heavy launch vehicle.

The company, jointly held by Thales (67 percent) and Leonardo (33 percent), was last year contracted by NASA to study a data center on the Moon.

That facility, which we profiled in 2021, would be built for lunar operations, reducing latency for astronauts and machines - rather than being used by terrestrial humans.

NTT and SKY Perfect JSAT also plan to build a number of compute- and storage-focused satellites that would together form a single data center via optical communications."

Thales press release

Thales has a long history of partnering with experts in their own field to help deliver the next generation of maritime technology capability. But few projects can be as potentially fast, formidable and game-changing as the K50 KRAKEN gunship.

Capable of 65 knots (nearly 75mph) fully laden, the KRAKEN is a built-for-purpose, ultra-high performance offensive platform, designed for solo operations or swarmed force projection to protect assets at sea.

Heavily-armed with missiles, Miniguns, 30mm canon, torpedoes and designed for rapid precision engagement, it is not a sight any would-be adversary would want to see coming over the horizon.

Designed by British-based Kraken Technology Group (KTG), the KRAKEN will be built at a new advanced engineering and technology centre in the UK.

The development of the platform has also taken another step forward with the recent announcement that the company has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Thales for the development and provision of bespoke systems.

Thales in the UK will provide the ability to integrate a range of sensor and weapons equipment on board with scalable command and control, communication and networking systems.

The memorandum has also identified the world-leading Thales Lightweight Multi-role Missile (LMM) as a candidate for integration onto the platform.

Ivor Humphrey, Business Development Executive at Thales who has been working with KTG, said: “LMM has a proven capability in air defence and surface attack and is able to defend against a number of threats, including fast inshore attack craft, unmanned aerial vehicles and fast jets.

“The system also complements perfectly Kraken’s key design principles of multi-role thinking, high performance and modular adaptability.”

“When combined with Thales’s suite of sensors, communications and decision support systems, it becomes a formidable and potent capability.”

Ivor Humphrey, Business Development Executive at Thales

This integration is in conjunction with Thales’s other partners MSI-DSL, who are developing a new lightweight launcher matched to LMM, as well as remote weapon stations for several other gun systems on board.

Mal Crease, Founder and CEO of Kraken Technology Group, said: “We are exceptionally pleased to be teaming with one of the most well-respected names in the defence and security industry.

“The K50 platform is a game-changer for a number of reasons. We have designed it as the spiritual successor of the renowned allied Motor Torpedo Boats and PT Boats of World War Two. These boats were small, but armed with unmatched speed and firepower to hunt in packs both in offensive and defensive capacities.

“K50 KRAKEN is about performance. The top speed of 65 knots is based on a fully laden condition, designed and engineered from the keel up to operate as a fully integrated weapons platform, which far exceeds anything currently available. It will push boundaries in every respect. It can operate solo, but is also designed to collaborate in swarms both offensively and in deterrent modes. The Motor Torpedo Boats were revered as the ‘Spitfires of the Seas’, and we see the KRAKEN in much the same way in today’s context, as the maritime ‘Apache of the Seas’ – a formidable, fast threat and a visual deterrent to hostile actions

Mal Crease, Founder and CEO of Kraken Technology Group

Kraken Technology Group has a strong pedigree in high performance technology, but also draws on the experience and expertise of former UK and US special forces military personnel in its team.

Mal added: “The input of the ex-operators is crucial. The KRAKEN is not an adapted patrol or insertion boat rebadged as a gunship. It is a dedicated design, tailored for high-speed precision-engagement, with end-user insights of the fast-paced reality of littoral operations and the need for integration and modularity being key.

“It is designed for a fully laden top speed of 65 knots which is a real market differentiator. It has a cruise speed of 50 knots and a range of 400 nautical miles which can be significantly enhanced through the use of extended-range fuel tanks.

“We know that the threats in the maritime environment are ever changing and believe that the KRAKEN will directly address the interdiction, interception and fast patrol needs of navies, border patrol and law enforcement agencies around the world.”"

Maddison Illsley

Thales in the UK is proud to be sponsoring one of its engineers who has achieved a remarkable sporting achievement after being selected for the ultra-competitive Great Britain Women’s Bobsleigh squad in her first year of trying the sport.

Our Thales Engineering team in the UK were very supportive of Maddison and her sporting ambitions, and with help from the business, they made the sponsorship possible.

Maddison Illsley, who works at the Thales Crawley site in West Sussex, has now left the UK to start her winter training in Norway, before the team competes in the Europa Cup and events across Europe.

Former degree apprentice, and now a systems engineer with Thales, Maddison’s selection for this season’s GB team is all the more amazing in that – although she is an experienced track and power athlete – she was only selected for bobsleigh training earlier this year.

Thales in the UK has also implemented a hybrid working scheme that allows her to balance her engineering career with the unique demands of her sport; Maddison is able to commit to a high level of athletic training, while still developing her engineering career.

She said: “When I told my line management about being selected for the GB team, they were incredibly supportive. The sponsorship from Thales is going to make a huge difference. The chance to represent your country is an absolute honour and to have your company behind you is just amazing”.

Speaking from her winter training camp in Norway, Maddison reflected on her experiences growing up that have led her to this remarkable position.

She said: “As a kid, I wanted to be a pilot and engineering has always been there as a passion for me. My Dad was a huge inspiration for my brother and I; he is an engineer and scientist so it was just a family thing. Taking things apart, putting them back together was just a part of my childhood.

“When I got to sixth form and my friends were thinking about university, I wasn’t sure if it was for me. My dad was once again the inspiration – he had done an apprenticeship which also led to getting his Masters, so I started researching the largest UK engineering companies that could offer apprenticeships while studying for a degree.

Maddison’s experience with Thales so far has included time at Crawley and Glasgow, working on programmes such as the Royal Navy’s next generation Type 31 warship and optronics technology for the highly-advanced Astute submarine.

She said: “Engineers have a shared enthusiasm for understanding how things work and I’ve loved the fact I’ve been exposed to these sort of high-profile programmes already. It was definitely the right choice for me.

“Also, being an engineer has helped me understand the sport of bobsleigh that little bit better. The mechanics, the technical and weather challenges, how the sled moves on ice – that understanding of how things happen.

“It is a choice to do both and it takes commitment from both sides to make this work. But Thales have been amazing”.

Mike Seabrook, Company Secretary for Thales in the UK, said:

We are incredibly proud of Maddison’s achievements and wish her and the squad the very best as they head into the winter season. For us, it is incredibly important we provide the right level of support in such a demanding schedule.

Sharing Skies Above Heathrow: Operating Crewed and Uncrewed Aircraft Safely and Efficiently - Thales,"Wed, 16 Nov 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi9jb3VudHJpZXMtZXVyb3BlL3VuaXRlZC1raW5nZG9tL25ld3Mvc2hhcmluZy1za2llcy1hYm92ZS1oZWF0aHJvdy1vcGVyYXRpbmctY3Jld2VkLWFuZC11bmNyZXdlZNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Sharing Skies Above Heathrow: Operating Crewed and Uncrewed Aircraft Safely and Efficiently Share this article



LinkedIn

How do you operate crewed and uncrewed aircraft in some of the world’s most congested airspace, safely and efficiently? ‘This is the big question that a Consortium led by Operational Solutions Limited, in which Thales UK is a key player, is looking to answer at one of the world’s busiest international airports.’ HADO® is an ambitious two-year project to deploy and operate a highly-automated 24/7 BVLOS (beyond visual line of sight) drone operation at London’s Heathrow Airport (LHR).

Thales’s involvement in this ground-breaking project will include supporting the development of automated technologies, skills, operating procedures, use cases, and safety-case approvals required to deploy the TopSky UAS Airspace Manager. In particular, to support Project HADO’s four-month 24/7 live BVLOS drone operations in the high-intensity environment of LHR. Use cases will demonstrate operational, economic, and societal benefits in areas such as infrastructure inspections, logistics support and security operations.

For Thales, the key challenge Project HADO aims to address is coordinating uncrewed traffic management (UTM) with well-established air traffic management (ATM) operations in a defined volume of airspace. Our contribution to the project will build on the successful UTM trials currently being conducted across several European airports, as well planning for state-wide operations in the US.

Bringing it all together

As well as supporting the HADO consortium to define use cases, Thales will work with OSL to build a UTM interface with a command and control (C2) node able to bring together data from numerous sensors across Heathrow to create a single, composite situational awareness picture. It’s this rich data source that we’ll use to support traffic management.

The future of airport operations

Attractive use cases for drones across LHR’s 12 km2 estate and proximate airspace are numerous and diverse. Security monitoring, perimeter surveillance, small-scale logistics, airport maintenance, and drone traffic (including non-authorised flights) monitoring are all areas where drones could significantly enhance operations, while also reducing costs and environmental footprint. What’s more, part of the BVLOS UAS evaluation will include missions that move in and out of the Heathrow perimeter.

Another area of huge potential benefit is sustainability. Using drones instead of standard vehicles to carry out many routine airport activities could reduce the carbon footprint of airport operations and engineering teams, while supporting Thales’s own journey to carbon neutrality.

“If you can deploy drones in a safe and efficient manner, without adversely impacting existing airport operations, endless possibilities exist to monitor, manage, or measure all manner of important airport activities. We envisage that costs, time, and carbon savings will be demonstrably significant as use cases and operating concepts are refined in coordination with the authorities and other stakeholders at Heathrow. Project HADO will be a major first step to achieving all of these things.” Neil Watson, Market Development Manager (AMS), Thales in the UK

“Enabling autonomous beyond visual line of sight drone operations in intensely busy areas is key to unlocking drone-enabled economies and a future of smart airports and smart cities. We believe that HADO is a unique project with potential to unlock significant commercial opportunities in the UK.” Mark Legh-Smith, CEO, Operational Solutions Limited (OSL)

“There are lots of challenges that need to be overcome for us to safely integrate autonomous drones into our existing airspace. The information project HADO gathers during its ambitious four-month trial, in the challenging environment of Heathrow, will be vital in helping the industry understand how we can resolve issues before we scale up further.” Gary Cutts, Future Flight Challenge Director, UKRI

Taking UTM to new heights

HADO has two clear aims. First, to demonstrate that commercially beneficial Autonomous BVLOS operations are possible using uncrewed aerial systems (initially, in the under 25 kg category) in high-intensity, controlled airspace environments. And second, to inform and help shape future autonomous BVLOS regulations by providing evidence-based recommendations to Regulators about the technology and operating procedures needed to achieve safe and cost-effective BVLOS operations in mixed-traffic environments.

Ultimately, HADO aims to create a world-leading and world-first capability that will revolutionise the use of automated UAS in complex air traffic environments, and put the UK at the forefront of global thinking in this sector. And in doing so, create a model for commercial autonomous UAS operations that can be quickly scaled and rolled-out across hundreds of sites in the UK and globally.

What is the UK defence sector doing to respond to the challenges and evolving security risks associated with the climate emergency? Should the defence sector even be considering emissions when the risks they deal with are immediate and life threatening?

And what role should the industry play in moving the planet to net zero?

Steve Murray, VP of Strategy and Marketing from Thales, explains why defence and tackling the climate emergency are critically linked.

What does Climate Change and sustainability mean to Thales and to the defence industry?

Thales sees tackling climate change as core to our purpose and inextricably linked to defence. In order to be able to decarbonise, you first need a foundation of national stability and security.

The war in Ukraine demonstrates this most starkly. Clearly any thoughts about decarbonisation in Ukraine are very much second order to preserving the nation state and the lives of its citizens at the moment.

Dramatic changes to the climate increase the chance of hostilities over access to environmental resources, like water and crops, but as extreme weather events become more common, defence will also have a greater role to play in providing humanitarian assistance.

Translating that into activity that Thales undertakes as a business – we’ve committed to becoming a net zero organisation, for activities that we directly control, by 2030. This includes such things as how we heat our buildings and buying 100 per cent renewable electricity.

The most complicated piece for industries more generally – not just the defence sector – is when we buy goods and services from our supply chains. Working with our key suppliers, we’re establishing carbon action plans that will see a 35 per cent reduction in our indirect carbon footprint – also by 2030.

Products and services within the defence industry also have a role to play, such as through the incorporation of eco-design principles into our products and finding environmental applications for existing products. For example, an unmanned surface vessel – currently part of an autonomous counter mine programme, has already been trialled using military-grade surveillance cameras to inspect wind turbine blades as they rotate – giving them more time to spend generating clean energy.

Where do you see the most potential to exploit existing technologies to make big strides forward and pick up the pace of change?

There are clear areas where we can establish some quick wins and pick up the pace. The process of digitisation, for example, can develop, test and optimise systems with a much smaller environmental footprint than traditional approaches of live testing and evaluations.

We’ve also seen a huge benefits in the use of Thales’ advanced flight simulators. In the UK, aviation accounts for two thirds of all defence emissions – with defence, in turn, accounting for half of all government emissions. However, by training air crew in simulators, we’re able to dramatically reduce the need for live flying by 90 per cent – which is hugely impactful in saving emissions.

There are also green energy and renewable solutions that have applications first in the civil market that can then be applied to defence. For example, electric vehicles, energy generation, and storage batteries, are going to be developed first for the larger civil markets. The defence customer can then take the best from this technology and adapt and integrate it to their own needs. Thales has an opportunity to play a significant role in encouraging these cross-sector developments, as our footprint in the civil markets is as large as it is in our defence business.

Finally, we expect our customers to start considering the total life-span of products – ensuring that the products are recyclable, and we’re able to recapture increasingly valuable raw materials.

High-G Training Simulator

Are there any new technologies coming through the pipeline now which are going to have a significant impact on energy consumption, or that will need to change?

From 2025 onwards, we’re looking at the military using technologies including AI, autonomy, quantum computing, quantum sensing and so forth. These will dramatically increase the demand for processing power and, ultimately, electrical energy. So, while technologies are emerging to improving energy efficiencies, the demand for energy will continue as present and could rise.

The defence industry is looking at other technologies to offset this effect, such as edge computing, where the processing is done in the deployed vehicles or on the soldier, rather than transmitting large amounts of data back to a central hub, which is by its nature inefficient. We’re also looking at making so-called “frugal AI” systems, which require less data and are much less energy consuming.

The evolution away from fossil fuels will inevitably lead to more electric propulsion. However, this is only a positive step if the power generation is also sustainable, and could potentially lead to deployable renewable or nuclear power solutions.

Lastly – with some elements of climate change here to stay, we are going to see frontline soldiers and their equipment operating in increasingly hostile and unpredictable weather conditions. This means equipment will have to undergo much more rigorous testing to ensure it is able to operate in all extremes.

What role do you see for legislation and government support in driving decarbonisation in defence?

For organisations working in the UK with the Ministry of Defence (MoD) and for His Majesty’s Government, you are working within a framework that is driving towards net zero in less than 30 years.

The recently released Defence Capability Framework for the first time, gave the defence industry a very clear indication on future capability acquisition plans from the MoD – there is an opportunity to go further and link up the capabilities required to their Climate Change & Sustainability Strategy.

SMRT Trains and Thales share a goal to provide safe, reliable and comfortable journeys in Singapore. They have inked two agreements – for the joint establishment of a local rail signalling repair facility and also the joint development of an intelligent rail analytics platform – to reinforce the reliability of the nation’s oldest MRT lines operated by SMRT Trains.

SMRT Trains, Singapore’s pioneer and dominant rail operator, and Thales have signed a Repair Collaboration Agreement to establish a local repair facility at the rail operator’s premise in Bishan Depot to reduce repair turnaround time and improve cost efficiencies.

Thales’ renowned SelTracTM Communication-Based-Train-Control (CBTC) signalling system drives the North-South and East-West lines (NSEWL) of Singapore’s rail network, which are operated by SMRT Trains. Currently, critical electronic cards of the signalling equipment are produced and repaired overseas by the original equipment manufacturer, Thales, at its dedicated facilities such as in Canada and France.

With this agreement, Thales’ rail experts will work closely with SMRT Trains’ Integrated Electronic Workshop to set up the repair facility. This includes the training and transfer of expertise and technical know-how for SMRT Trains’ technicians to diagnose and repair the faulty components.

On the digital front, SMRT Trains and Thales have signed an agreement to jointly develop an intelligent rail analytics platform for the smart monitoring of rail signalling systems. Under this agreement, SMRT Trains’ engineers and Thales’ experts will come together to define specific use-cases and identify key maintenance priorities over a series of design-thinking workshops.

Built upon Thales’ Urban Rail Signalling – Rail Analytics Platform, the tailored digital platform will leverage Condition-Monitoring Devices, Data Analytics and Cloud Computing to automate the analysis of signalling systems’ performance and health state, and to identify and address potential maintenance issues before they occur. This will help to better manage engineering resources and improve the systems’ reliability and performance.

SMRT Trains is continuously looking at ways to enhance the safety, reliability and productivity of our rail maintenance regimes. We are excited to collaborate with Thales to strengthen our maintenance capability and resilience, as well as bolster our staff’s expertise. With the establishment of the repair workshop at Bishan Depot, we aim to cut down repair turnaround time and cost. The use of digital technologies to preempt maintenance issues is also a key strategy for SMRT Trains as we strive to provide smooth journeys for commuters. Lam Sheau Kai, President, SMRT Trains

Thales truly appreciates the continued trust that SMRT Trains has placed in us. With these agreements, we will tap on Thales’ renowned expertise in managing complex, global rail projects to deepen local expertise and capabilities in Singapore’s rail ecosystem. We look forward to co-innovating on cutting-edge digital solutions in intelligent rail analytics. This will help ensure safer and more reliable rides for commuters. Emily Tan, Country Director & Chief Executive, Thales in Singapore

The two agreements signed between SMRT Trains and Thales follow the recent announcement of both parties’ joint initiative called “The Next-Generation Green CBTC Project”, which aims to reduce electricity consumption and further improve traction energy efficiency of the NSEWL.

This system of mini-drones allows the Army to strengthen its intelligence capability as close as possible and beyond the contact zone. Each system consists of three identical Spy'Ranger drones and a ground station. Equipped with a high-definition optronic ball operating day and night, these aerial vectors offer increased detection, recognition and identification performance compared to that of their predecessor (the DRAC, contact intelligence drone). With a wingspan of almost 4 m and a weight of 15 kg, the drones have an autonomy of around 2h30.

The system is deployed in 12 minutes by a team of two soldiers: installation of the launch pad, assembly of the drone, initialization of the ground station and performance of the tests before takeoff. Thanks to its data link, the drone can reliably and securely transmit high-definition video streams in real-time up to 30 km from the ground station.

The SMDRs have been deployed in overseas operations as part of Operation Barkhane since the end of 2020. The Army received 23 systems as of today and will have a fleet of 35 systems by 2023. The contract, worth 120 million euros, provides support in terms of training, logistics and maintenance for 10 years.

The range of Spy'Ranger mini-drone systems developed by Thales provides units deployed on the front line with autonomous intelligence gathering and offensive reconnaissance capabilities, allowing them greater versatility, better protection and seamless connection.



Spy'Ranger was designed from the outset as a family of systems intended to perform a wide range of missions with an optimized logistics footprint. This range currently includes two models: Spy'Ranger 330 and Spy'Ranger 550. Although the cells are adapted according to the mission profile, both systems use the same high-definition day/night payload, secure data links and a power chain. The ground control station and user interface are identical to allow operators to easily switch between systems.

Knorr-Bremse and Thales have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to cooperate on the development of Automatic Train Operation (ATO) solutions for locomotive-hauled freight and passenger trains.

ATO will greatly assist train drivers in their daily work and thus help to counter the sector’s looming staff shortages, as well as improve rail freight’s efficiency, punctuality, and competitiveness.

ATO: making rail freight more efficient

“In our industry, Automatic Train Operation is a key lever for making rail freight more efficient and more available, increasing transportation capacity, and further optimising lifecycle costs for operators”, Dr. Nicolas Lange, Chairman of the Management Board of Knorr-Bremse Rail Vehicle Systems, said. “Our partnership agreement with Thales has enormous potential for bringing about the innovations required to enable safe and smooth Automatic Train Operation and thus improve, for example, energy efficiency and punctuality.”

“Full autonomy is still a work in progress, although the necessary technologies are maturing rapidly. ATO is one of them, as a necessary step toward achieving fully autonomous driving,” Dr. Yves Joannic, Vice President Main Line Signalling and Managing Director Ground Transportation Systems at Thales Germany, said. “Thales has a clear vision for autonomy and is pleased to partner with Knorr-Bremse, a leading company in braking systems and other mission-critical train systems, with the aim of accelerating the development of automated train functions in the freight market.”

ATO: delivering multiple benefits for the freight sector

ATO will deliver multiple benefits for the rail freight sector. These include anticipated gains in efficiency and capacity, energy savings, performance enhancements and better punctuality. Train punctuality in particular (Estimated Time of Arrival) depends on smooth, consistent train driving based on factors such as track characteristics, topography, and surrounding traffic, as well as train-specific parameters such as load, which influences traction and braking performance.

While many of these criteria are still monitored manually, digital and automated functions will significantly improve how they are tracked and utilised. By using sensor-based, real-time data, for example, new features will be able to deliver intelligent insights to train drivers and devise optimal driving strategies. Therefore, the smart interaction of the expertise of the two companies will be crucial. Especially in existing fleets, ATO will support drivers in their daily work. Among other advantages, this will help to counter looming staff shortages in the rail freight business.

In respect to 2030 climate targets such as reducing transportation emissions by at least 18 per cent (European Commission, 2020), upgrading the rail freight sector is imperative for shifting large amounts of freight from trucks and airplanes to green, rail-based transportation. Rail consumes 12 times less energy and emits up to 11 times less CO2 per passenger/tonne kilometre compared with cars and trucks."

Who we work with

Thales has been working in partnership through the summer of 2022 with STEMettes, a national social enterprise that inspires and supports young women and schoolgirls to explore STEM careers.

As part of the STEMillions programme, three female engineers from Thales provided inspirational “meal plans” that describe their career journeys, for students aged between seven and 11, in 10 participating state schools.

Inspiring role models from Thales have been introducing primary school children, many in deprived parts of the UK, to the possibility of a career in science and engineering.

Through the summer of 2022, Thales worked with national social enterprise STEMettes to provide classroom teachers with a STEM box, full of exciting classroom activities, in 10 state primary schools across England and Northern Ireland.

STEMettes was founded in 2013 to encourage more girls and young women to take an interest in STEM subjects (Science Technology, Engineering and Maths). The organisation runs panel events, hackathons, a mentoring programme and a platform for girls interested in STEM careers.

As part of its 10-week STEMillions programme which ran from February to July, Thales and STEMette resources supported teachers providing young students, aged from 7 and 11, to deliver a range of STEM-based challenges and after-school activities, which can earn teams national certificates and prizes.

Thales spokesperson Kirsti Godson said: “Partnering with STEMettes, our engineers helped to inform and inspire more young people across the country to take an interest in STEM subjects and to explore future job opportunities in the field.

“The activities showcased the great diversity of the role models we have in Thales, which didn’t go unnoticed by the students, and we look forward to working together again with STEMettes in the future.”

The majority of the ten schools were located in the lowest 50% most deprived areas in the country, based on ONS figures, with 74% of participants eligible for free school meals.

A report of the programme, which ended in July, highlighted some impressive results. 40% of teachers saw a high level of engagement, including among girls, and an improvement in mental health. It also revealed that the students taking part benefitted in a number of other ways:

Opportunities to develop problem solving skills

Raising interest and career aspirations in sciences, especially among girls

Revealing opportunities for girls in STEM careers

Introduce new topics and encouraging “outside the box” thinking

The participants shared what they had learned from the scheme’s activities, with female pupils responding strongly to the Thales role models. Feedback showed they were more confident not only in themselves but also in their ability to excel in STEM subjects.

Less confident students were also able to realise that they could enjoy science, with teachers reporting a buzz created across their entire school.

Each activity box provided teachers with 10 hours’ worth of “meal plans” by inspirational female scientists and engineers full of advice, useful links and activity ideas, and all the equipment and instructions needed for a range of classroom activities.

Activities included projects involving coding and are designed to increase children’s perception of STEM careers, while building confidence in skills, developing leadership and widening their knowledge of STEM subjects."
Eutelsat satellite to get last ride from SpaceX's oldest active Falcon 9 booster – Spaceflight Now - Spaceflight Now,"Mon, 21 Nov 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VmbGlnaHRub3cuY29tLzIwMjIvMTEvMjEvZXV0ZWxzYXQtc2F0ZWxsaXRlLXRvLWdldC1sYXN0LXJpZGUtZnJvbS1zcGFjZXhzLW9sZGVzdC1hY3RpdmUtZmFsY29uLTktYm9vc3Rlci_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"EDITOR’S NOTE: Updated at 9 p.m. EST on Nov. 20 with 24-hour launch delay.

A 12,000-pound European broadband communications satellite designed to beam internet signals to airplanes and ships is ready to rocket into a high-altitude orbit from Cape Canaveral Tuesday night, marking the 11th and final flight for SpaceX’s oldest active Falcon 9 booster. The rocket will devote all of its lift capability to deploying the Eutelsat 10B satellite into as high of an orbit as possible.

The Eutelsat 10B satellite is buttoned up for launch inside the nose cone of the 229-foot-tall (70-meter) Falcon 9 rocket. Liftoff from pad 40 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station is set for 9:57 p.m. EST Tuesday (0257 GMT Wednesday), but there’s just a 20% probability of favorable weather for launch, according to the official outlook from the U.S. Space Force’s 45th Weather Squadron.

A launch attempt Monday night was scrubbed a couple of hours before liftoff to “allow time for additional pre-flight checkouts,” SpaceX said.

A few miles north of pad 40, SpaceX is readying a different Falcon 9 rocket for launch Tuesday from Kennedy Space Center on a resupply mission to the International Space Station. The weather forecast for that launch, set for 3:54 p.m. EST (2054 GMT) Tuesday, is also iffy with a 30% chance of acceptable conditions for liftoff.

Eutelsat 10B will deploy from the Falcon 9 rocket’s upper stage about 35 minutes after launch. The rocket will aim to release the spacecraft into a “super synchronous” transfer orbit with an apogee, or farthest point from Earth, well above Eutelsat 10B’s final operating altitude of 22,000 miles (nearly 36,000 kilometers). The target apogee for the Eutelsat 10B mission at spacecraft deployment will be above 37,000 miles, or about 60,000 kilometers, according to Pascal Homsy, Eutelsat’s chief technical officer.

Instead of reserving some of its propellant for landing on a drone ship, the Falcon 9’s first stage booster will burn its nine main engines a few seconds longer than usual, giving an extra burst of speed to the rocket’s upper stage. That will allow the Falcon 9’s second stage engine to place the Eutelsat 10B satellite into a higher orbit than would have otherwise been possible.

SpaceX still plans to retrieve the two halves of the Falcon 9 rocket’s payload fairing for refurbishment and reuse.

A spokesperson for Thales Alenia Space, the manufacturer of Eutelsat 10B, said the deployment of the satellite into a super synchronous transfer orbit will shorten the time needed for it to reach its final operational geostationary orbit by about 10 days. Based on Thales’ Spacebus Neo satellite platform, Eutelsat 10B will use plasma thrusters for the orbit adjustments needed to circularize its orbit at geostationary altitude 22,000 miles over the equator, where it will circle Earth in lock-step with the planet’s rotation.

Eutelsat 10B’s total launch mass is about 5.5 metric tons, or roughly 12,000 pounds, a Thales spokesperson told Spaceflight Now on Monday.

The expendable Falcon 9 mission will be the third time this month that SpaceX has disposed of a Falcon rocket booster, following the intentional disposals of a core stage on a Falcon Heavy rocket Nov. 1 and a Falcon 9 booster on a mission Nov. 12. The Nov. 12 mission lofted two communications satellites for Intelsat, which said it paid a premium for the extra performance from the Falcon 9, resulting in the booster’s disposal in the Atlantic Ocean.

“The reason why Eutelsat choose an expendable booster for this mission is because of the mass of the satellite, which requires the full capacity of fuel and extra performance of the Falcon 9 rocket and a proper orbit injection,” Homsy told Spaceflight Now in response to written questions.

Homsy declined to say how much, if anything, Eutelsat paid SpaceX for the additional performance from the Falcon 9 on the Eutelsat 10B mission.

Once in geostationary orbit next year, Eutelsat 10B will steer itself to an operating position along the equator at 10 degrees east longitude. The satellite will add capacity for internet connectivity services for airplanes and ships across the highly-trafficked North Atlantic corridor between Europe and North America. Eutelsat 10B will also provide similar services over Europe, the Mediterranean basin, and the Middle East, according to Eutelsat, the satellites Paris-based owner and operator.

Eutelsat 10B carries two multi-beam high-throughout Ku-band payloads for aviation and maritime internet services. These two payloads have 116 spot beams capable of processing more than 50 GHz of bandwidth, and offering a throughout of approximately 35 gigabits per second, Eutelsat said.

The satellite also hosts two wide beam C-band and Ku-band payloads to extend services currently provided by the aging Eutelsat 10A satellite, which launched in 2009.

Eutelsat 10B is scheduled to enter service in the summer of 2023, Homsy said.

The launch of Eutelsat 10B marks the fourth large Eutelsat communications satellite to launch in the last two-and-a-half months, beginning with the Eutelsat Konnect VHTS satellite which launched in September on an Ariane 5 rocket. Two Hotbird TV broadcasting satellites joined Eutelsat’s fleet after launches from Florida on Falcon 9 rockets in October and earlier this month.

“Quite a challenge for the Eutelsat engineering teams, who have been up to the challenge,” Homsy said.

Atlas Elektronik press release

The scope of the supply contract includes the delivery of two shipboard ASW mission modules as well as the provision of a corresponding shore facility for the initial and support training of the German Navy. The mission modules enablethe F126-class frigates to conduct long-range ASW operations and to build up an extensive subsurface picture. The modular system approach chosen for the F126 class allows for mission-specific equipment of the frigates and at the same time non-ship-specific deployment of the ASW modules.

To provide the German Navy with the best possible support in fulfilling its missions, the latest active and passive sonar technology from ATLAS ELEKTRONIK will be used for the mission modules.

“With the F126 MM ASW, we are launching a new, very powerful ASW system to meet both the current and the future challenges of our customers.”

Michael Ozegowski, CEO of ATLAS ELEKTRONIK GmbH

The contract already formally entered into force on 1 September 2022. The frigate F126 (originally known as the MKS 180 multi-role combat ship) is being built in cooperation between the Dutch Damen Shipyards Group, the Thales Group and Blohm+Voss with the involvement of German Naval Yards.

Moore was joined by Carsten Maple, Professor of Cyber Systems Engineering at the University of Warwick, England, in a Linkedin Live event following the release of Thales’ 2022 Digital Trust Index that focuses on the current cyber threat landscape and building customers’ trust in today’s digital world.

Breaching lots of smaller organizations rather than one of the big organizations can be much more profitable for organized gangs, as it allows them to keep the awareness level down and stay out of the press, explained Moore. The media often does not deem it very newsworthy to cover the data breaches happening in smaller organizations.

Thales’ Digital Trust Index report showed that 20 per cent of customers are likely to leave a company after a major data breach. This represents a significant loss for smaller businesses that are dependent on a smaller customer base.

But our reliance as consumers on big organizations does not help smaller businesses either. The report showed that despite trusting big organizations the least, more than 80 per cent of consumers still want to use a big company after a data breach.

Interestingly, the report showed that only a fraction of consumers (31 per cent) want heavy fines levied against the big organizations for failing to protect customer data. Most wanted the company to immediately disclose that there had been a breach. SMBs can capitalize on that and seek to offer better communication and transparency to their customers, affirmed Moore.

SMBs can differentiate themselves by showing they care about their customers’ data, and are willing to go the extra mile to protect customer data and apply the appropriate security controls, said Moore.

“An SMB that puts security first will attract more new customers and retain them after a breach occurs. For an SMB, being able to show that they were well-prepared (from a data security perspective) before a breach will help stem the loss of customers after the breach.” said Moore.

He added that while SMBs can be particularly vulnerable, they are dealing with less complexity than bigger organizations, and can therefore contain “data sprawl” and communicate the immediate security measures they have put in place.

Moore recommends that all organizations, including SMBs, apply a straightforward security strategy: Discover, Protect and Control. This entails knowing where your critical data is situated, where it is moving (data flows and visibility), protect the data through encryption, tokenization and access controls, and finally, control the data via centralized key management and consistent security policies.

“SMBs may have the most to lose from a data breach. These smaller companies should be even more prepared to protect their company’s and their customers’ data. If SMBs don’t prepare themselves properly, consumer trust is difficult to gain, but very easy to lose.” said Moore."

​”At this stage, Thales is able to confirm that there has been no intrusion of its IT systems,” said the announcement, reiterating that there is no impact on the group’s operations and the company is providing the necessary technical support and resources to minimize any potential impact on customers and stakeholders.

​

As the gang has already started releasing some of the data packets, it could mean that the company might have refused to pay the ransom.

Thales and the recent cyberattacks

Thales has been the target of hackers for the last few months. This is the second LockBit attack on the company this year. The threat group initiated the first attack in January 2022 and followed the same method used in the recent attack. The company refused to pay the ransom in January.

Lockbit, then operating their 2.0 leak site, claimed responsibility for a cyberattack against the company on January 3. The company refused to pay the ransom, after which the ransomware gang exposed several hundred Zip files that contained internal tools, including computer code, for developers of Space Ops solutions from Thales Alenia Space, the space-exploration joint venture with Italian defense business Leonardo.

The Thales group then conceded that the data was exfiltration, most of which was copied from a code repository server “external to the group’s main information systems."

Kongsberg Defence and Aerospace has signed a memorandum of agreement (MoA) with Thales UK to collaborate on the Protector Remote Weapon Systems (RWS) programme.

Through this joint initiative, the two companies aim to work in close cooperation to promote the Protector RWS to a larger number of military platforms in the UK Armed Forces, as well as in other countries’ forces.

Kongsberg Land Systems executive vice-president Eirik Tord Jensen said: “Protector programmes, projects, and capability areas Kongsberg and Thales UK aspire to collaborate in have steadily grown since we signed the last agreement in 2017.

“Both companies have expressed a high level of ambition to expand our relationship over the coming five years.”

The new MoA builds on the existing partnership between the two companies.

The first teaming agreement between Kongsberg and Thales UK was signed in 2007 and, over the years, the companies have partnered to promote the Protector programme.

Artist rendering of data center in space from Thales Alenia Space



The European Union is looking to send data centers into space in an effort to fight climate change. Thales Alenia Space is spearheading a study called ASCEND, which is part of the EU's ""Horizon Europe"" initiative.The need for digitalization means that data centers around the world are growing at a never before seen pace. In turn, it is having a tremendous impact on both energy and the environment. This has led the European Union to seek out alternatives for future data centers, in an effort to reduce global warming . ASCEND, or Advanced Space Cloud for European Net zero emission and Data sovereignty is a feasibility study for data centers to be placed in orbit.Thales Alenia Space, a joint company between Thales and Leonardo, was chosen to lead the ASCEND study. Its purpose is to determine the viability of installing data center stations in low-Earth orbit, powered by solar power plants generating several hundred megawatts. ASCEND is just one of many projects currently being looked at to help meet Europe's Green Deal goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.According to Thales, the first objective of the study will be to determine if the carbon emissions from the production and launch of these infrastructures will be substantially lower than the emissions generated by ground-based data centers, or even Microsoft's ocean-based Project Natick . The second objective will be to prove that it is possible to create the required launch solution and to establish the deployment and operability of these spaceborne data centers using robotic assistance technologies currently in development in Europe.As of right now, the ASCEND study has been funded with a $2 million Euro budget. It is important to note that this is simply an exploratory study, and may end up finding that creating a space-based data center is not feasible for a number of reasons. Factors such as the cost of launching such an endeavor, maintaining it, and overall efficiency will all come into play along with determining just how eco-friendly a project of this magnitude would actually be.Top Image Credit: European Commission: Defence Ministry and Space"

SMRT reinforces alliance with industry - International Railway Journal,"Tue, 15 Nov 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJhaWxqb3VybmFsLmNvbS9wYXNzZW5nZXIvbWV0cm9zL3NtcnQtcmVpbmZvcmNlcy1hbGxpYW5jZS13aXRoLWluZHVzdHJ5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"SINGAPOREAN public transport group SMRT and its subsidiary Strides International signed several notable memorandums of understanding (MoU) with technology and transport equipment suppliers at the Fourth LTA-UITP Singapore International Transport Congress and Exhibition (SITCE) held in Singapore.

SMRT Trains and Thales signed two agreements. The first is for the joint establishment of a local railway signalling repair facility at the operator’s depot in Bishan to support the Thales SelTrac CBTC system used on the North-South and East-West lines (NSEWL) of the Singapore metro network, which are operated by SMRT.

Circuit boards used by the signalling system are produced and supplied from Thales’ facilities in France and Canada. SMRT Trains president, Mr Lam Sheau Kai, says relocating this to Singapore will reduce turnaround times and costs. “SMRT Trains is continuously looking at ways to enhance the safety, reliability and productivity of our rail maintenance regimes,” he says.

Secondly, SMRT will collaborate with Thales to jointly develop an intelligent rail analytics platform for the smart monitoring of signalling systems, which the partners say will improve the reliability of Singapore’s oldest metro lines.

Built on Thales’ Urban Rail Signalling-Rail Analytics platform, the tailored platform will leverage condition monitoring devices, data analytics and cloud computing to automate the analysis of the signalling system’s performance and condition, and to identify and address potential maintenance issues before they occur, helping to better manage engineering resources while improving overall reliability and performance. SMRT and Thales will work to define specific use cases and identify key maintenance priorities during a series of design workshops.

“The use of digital technologies to pre-empt maintenance issues is also a key strategy for SMRT Trains as we strive to provide smooth journeys for commuters,” Lam says.

The two announcements follow confirmation of the Green CBTC project at InnoTrans in September. Under this initiative the two parties are working to reduce electricity consumption and the traction energy efficiency of the NSEWL.

Alstom

SMRT and Alston signed an agreement committing the partners to explore the use of technology, including 3D printing of replacement components, autonomous robots, and vision computing for predictive maintenance automation, and recovering energy from braking.

The partners say the agreement will harness SMRT’s extensive local knowledge of rail network operations and Alstom’s global research and development resources. This will see teams from Alstom’s Innovation Station located in Singapore and SMRT leveraging the latest technologies in additive manufacturing, data analytics, artificial intelligence and cybersecurity as well as existing infrastructure such as CBTC simulation facilities to optimise the efficiency and security of rail operations and maintenance.

“With SMRT’s experience in operating and maintaining train networks and Alstom’s R&D expertise, we are confident that this collaboration will enhance productivity, cybersecurity and sustainability,” Lam says.

Egis Rail

Strengthening collaboration on cybersecurity is also at the heart of an MoU signed by Strides International and Egis Rail. The partners plan to enhance their cooperation to support consultancy on cybersecurity for rail operators around the world. “This partnership with Egis will assist our customers to fast-track the adoption of industry standards and to become even more cybersecure,” says Mr Lee Ling Wee, president of Strides International.

A*STAR

SMRT also confirmed the signing of a Master Research Collaboration Agreement with Singapore’s Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*Star) on research and co-innovation projects that will include work on AI, intelligent automation, and data analytics. The agreement runs until 2025.

Areas for exploration include productivity enhancements for the reliability, availability, maintainability and safety (Rams) of transport systems, safety enhancements to benefit staff and human factors management, and sustainability improvements that will benefit operations and maintenance.

One potential project highlighted by the partners is the development of a condition-based monitoring system to improve diagnostic inspections of the waveguide used for SMRT signalling. Inspection and maintenance of the waveguide is a labour-intensive process that can only be undertaken at night. A condition-monitoring system could reduce the estimated 380 nights and 6800 man-hours required to monitor the entire Singapore metro network.

Another project under consideration seeks to use technologies to enhance station operation, including more effective monitoring of intrusion, unusual behaviour, potential hazards and suspicious objects.

“A*Star has deep research strengths that are useful for a public transport operator like SMRT,” says Mr Tan Pengenna Kuan, president of SMRT Engineering. “Our collaboration with A*Star will help us to continue building capabilities for the reliability, safety and productivity of our operations and maintenance.”

Finally, SMRT Trains and East Japan Railway (JR East) signed an MoU promising to exchange best practices on rail operation, customer service, safety, and maintenance to leverage each other’s strengths within Singapore and Japan, respectively. Both companies will collaborate on future technological developments and cross-border business opportunities."

1 year ago

Students from Sheffield Action Group disrupted University of Sheffield’s careers event this morning to protest the university’s ties to arms companies.

The group held banners up at the front of the fair that said “get military out”, blocking students in attendance from seeing a presentation.

The protest is specifically in relation to the university’s ties with Boeing, Rolls Royce and Thales. Sheffield Action Group (SHAG) claim that the university has received over £72 million from arms companies since 2012 and a further £1.1 million from Thales alone. The protestors claim that Thales allegedly supplies Russia with arms.

🚨 CAREERS FAIR DISRUPTED! UoS has received £1.1M from Thales, an arms company which supplies Russia. 🎯 We will target all careers fairs until ties are cut with arms companies. ‼️No complicity with imperialist agression‼️#ArmsOffCampus pic.twitter.com/X2z8nX8Xga — Sheffield Action Group (@sheffaction) November 25, 2022

SHAG say they will target all careers fairs on campus until the university meets their demands and cuts all ties with companies that deal with arms.

This disruption of the careers fair comes after the group occupied a corridor in The Hicks Building last night in solidarity with striking lecturers.

This is not the first time SHAG has occupied a university building. Earlier this year, the group occupied The Diamond Building on University of Sheffield’s campus, again calling for the university to cut ties with arms dealers.

A spokesperson from the University of Sheffield, said: “The university has a wide range of research, development and learning partnerships that work to further innovation, provide opportunities for students and find solutions to some of the world’s most pressing challenges.

“Our connections with industrial partners mean we can help to influence positive change and accelerate more sustainable manufacturing practices – making things faster, cheaper and greener to support our regional and national economy. For example, our work in high-performance lightweight materials has led to the production of lighter, more fuel-efficient cars and planes.

“We have a code of ethics for all of our research and innovation, which ensures there is rigorous governance in place.

“We are also committed to providing our students with information about a wide range of organisations offering placements and graduate jobs at our careers fairs, so they can make personal informed decisions about their future careers.”

A spokesperson for Rolls Royce said: “Rolls-Royce acts with integrity and strictly abides by all export control regulations that apply to our business and will continue to follow UK Government guidelines.”

The Tab Sheffield contacted Boeing and Thales for comment.

Indonesian corvettes to get further upgrades - Asian Military Review,"Fri, 11 Nov 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFzaWFubWlsaXRhcnlyZXZpZXcuY29tLzIwMjIvMTEvaW5kb25lc2lhbi1jb3J2ZXR0ZXMtdG8tZ2V0LWZ1cnRoZXItdXBncmFkZXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales has entered into an agreement with state-owned defence electronics specialist PT Len Industri to provide a range of C4ISR enhancements to the Indonesian Navy’s (TNI-AL’s) four Diponegoro-class guided missile corvettes, among other work announced on 4 November.

The company said it will refurbish the ships with “an Integrated Missions System including the TACTICOS Combat Management System, as well as the latest in software-driven radar technology able to combat the highest level of threats”.

It added that modernization work will be carried out over the next five years with post-sales support provided by trained teams at Thales’ Naval Service Centre in Surabaya. This latest upgrade follows a similar programme undertaken for the service’s Bung Tomo-class corvette KRI Usman-Harun l in 2020.

“As a leading partner to the Indonesian Navy for the last forty years and the appointed supplier of combat systems for most Indonesian warships currently in service, Thales is bringing its best capabilities to help extend the lifecycle of the Navy’s fleet and ensure that the ships remain equipped for optimal performance,” the company said in a statement.

The TNI-AL’s four Diponegoro-class corvettes were commissioned between 2007 and 2009.

Earlier in October 2021, Terma was awarded a contract to upgrade the existing C-Guard decoy launching system on board the Diponegoro-class corvettes with anti-submarine warfare (ASW) capabilities.

The vessels are presently equipped with two six-tubed DL-6T decoy launchers from Terma as part of its C-Guard ship self-protection suite. The launchers can fire both mortar and rocket-propelled decoys to defeat precision-guided munitions.

The corvettes could also benefit further from a planned mid-life upgrade (MLU) should foreign loan funding sought by the Ministry of National Development Planning (BAPPENAS) be approved by the Ministry of Finance.

USyd Chancellor has ties to Thales Garden Island union busting tactics - Honi Soit,"Wed, 02 Nov 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vaG9uaXNvaXQuY29tLzIwMjIvMTEvdXN5ZC1jaGFuY2VsbG9yLWhhcy10aWVzLXRvLXRoYWxlcy1nYXJkZW4taXNsYW5kLXVuaW9uLWJ1c3RpbmctdGFjdGljcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"University of Sydney Chancellor Belinda Hutchinson’s ties to union-busting efforts at the Thales Garden Island Dry Dock are no surprise. USyd management is increasingly using anti-union tactics to pursue an agenda of corporate austerity that harms staff, students, and quality education.

Hutchinson is Chairman of the Australian arm of Thales, a French weapons manufacturing company and the eighth largest arms manufacturer globally, who are allegedly complicit in war crimes in Yemen and have been the subject of corruption and bribery charges.

Thales operates the largest dry-dock in the Southern Hemisphere at Garden Island in Sydney. The facility docks and repairs ships of the Royal Australian Navy and allied navies.

Seemingly not content with its sales revenue expected to reach over 17 billion euros for 2022, Thales is now waging a vicious campaign against its unionised workforce at Garden Island in response to their push for industry standard pay.

On 14 October, the Maritime Union of Australia (MUA) held a protest at the Garden Island Dry Dock following the sacking of union delegate Scott Parkinson.

MUA organiser Shane Reside said Parkinson was sacked as a reprisal for the MUA attempting to negotiate better pay.

Reside, who is party to Garden Island’s current negotiations, said that: “A conservative estimate would be that [crane operators at Garden Island] are earning 30 per cent below industry standards.”

Thales made Parkinson’s position redundant and has refused to acknowledge the MUA’s right to represent workers at Garden Island.

Reside describes Parkinson’s sacking as “a dirty industrial tactic that is available to well-resourced companies like Thales.” He says that the MUA has launched a legal challenge against Thales’ refusal to allow the MUA to represent workers, but it “will take months to resolve”.

“In that time, they’re going to put a lot of pressure on the workforce to sign an inferior agreement.”

“To even know that that was a tactic available to them, they would need to have some very well-paid anti-union lawyers to identify that option to them.

“They have made it clear that they would by far prefer to spend a lot of money on these kinds of grubby legal tactics than to just negotiate openly and honestly with their own workforce.”

It is no coincidence that the union busting drive at Garden Island has disturbing parallels with the tactics that management is using in bargaining with staff at USyd.

Belinda Hutchinson sits at the top of the corporate oligarchy that runs both SUSyd and Thales. She lives in a $20 million mansion in Point Piper while both Thales and USyd attack the pay and conditions of their workers.

According to Reside, “[USyd] is an elite institution, it’s a jewel in the crown of Sydney’s ruling class.

“The alumni of the [U]niversity are sprinkled liberally across the various top companies in Sydney and the Liberal Party and they really want to make sure that they retain control of Sydney University.”

On the same day of the MUA’s protest against Parkinson’s sacking, NTEU members at USyd were on their second day of a 48-hour strike for secure work, an end to forced redundancies, an end to wage theft, and a pay rise above inflation.

Despite generating a $1 billion surplus in 2021, university management has thus far refused to meet the key demands of staff throughout 13 months of negotiations.

Perhaps worse than this, they have flown in notorious union busting lawyer Stuart Pill of Clayton Utz from Melbourne for negotiations. While senior members of management would normally be present for negotiations, they have instead been represented by Pill.

Previously, Pill was employed by Murdoch University during their negotiations with its NTEU branch in 2017. The negotiations successfully terminated the Enterprise Agreement between Murdoch and the NTEU, making it easier for the university to sack and exploit staff through restructuring.

Apparently, Pill was so proud of this achievement that he hosted a forum on how a university can successfully apply for a termination of its enterprise agreement.

Reside was scathing about the way that corporatism has affected universities.

“Despite the fact that [Sydney University] is supposed to be a public institution they very much consider it their own and they treat it like their own,” he says.

“And the way that these people behave in the private sector is exactly the way that they’re behaving in Sydney Uni.

“We don’t want that kind of untethered ruling class prerogative in the private sector, and we don’t want it in the public sector either.

“Private sector and public sector workers — MUA members and NTEU members — we’ve got everything to gain from standing together, because it’s only with each other that we are going to find the power to resist the edicts of these princes and princesses that seem to run all of these large organisations.”

With regards to the outcome of the MUA’s legal challenge would be, Reside says: “We always like to say at the MUA, ‘you can never win at the negotiating table or the courtroom what you can’t hold at the gate.’”

The only answer to union busting is solidarity and collective action. The MUA have come to pickets and helped run NTEU barbecues during the strikes at USyd. If the MUA needs support, staff and students at Sydney Uni must be ready to answer the call. We have a common enemy and a common struggle."
Bahrain Airport Company and Thales-SITA renew partnership at Bahrain International Airshow - Routesonline,"Fri, 11 Nov 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yb3V0ZXNvbmxpbmUuY29tL2FpcnBvcnRzLzEyODQ4L2JhaHJhaW4taW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC1haXJwb3J0L25ld3MvMjk4OTU1L2JhaHJhaW4tYWlycG9ydC1jb21wYW55LWFuZC10aGFsZXMtc2l0YS1yZW5ldy1wYXJ0bmVyc2hpcC1hdC1iYWhyYWluLWludGVybmF0aW9uYWwtYWlyc2hvdy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Bahrain Airport Company (BAC) and Thales-SITA, a consortium specializing in airport operations and communications systems.

Belfast assembled missiles intended for Ukraine could be 'reverse engineered' by Iran after falling into hands of Russia - Belfast Telegraph,"Tue, 08 Nov 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZWxmYXN0dGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvLnVrL25ld3MvcG9saXRpY3MvYmVsZmFzdC1hc3NlbWJsZWQtbWlzc2lsZXMtaW50ZW5kZWQtZm9yLXVrcmFpbmUtY291bGQtYmUtcmV2ZXJzZS1lbmdpbmVlcmVkLWJ5LWlyYW4tYWZ0ZXItZmFsbGluZy1pbnRvLWhhbmRzLW9mLXJ1c3NpYS80MjEyODk0Ny5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"An anti-tank missile which is partly assembled by the Thales Group at the firm’s factory in Belfast could have been transported to Iran after falling into the hands of Russia.

According to Sky News, a security source has claimed a Russian military aircraft secretly flew the NLAW anti-tank missile, a US Javeline anti-tank missile, a Stinger anti-aircraft missile and around 140m Euros in cash to an airport in Tehran back in August.

Thales – which has a factory in east Belfast and an operation in Crossgar – assembles a number of weapons which have been used in the Ukraine conflict.

The French company took over what was Shorts Missile Systems in 2001 and supplies a range of weapons to the Ministry of Defence and others.

It employs around 650 locally, with the Belfast factory designing and manufacturing two weapons which have been used in Ukraine — the LNM and the STARStreak missile.

It also assembles Saab’s next generation light anti-tank weapon (NLAW).

Both former Prime Minister Boris Johnson and current PM Rishi Sunak have previously visited the Belfast factory to inspect the NLAW system.

According to the anonymous security source, the weapons had been part of a shipment of UK and US equipment intended for the Ukrainian military.

The source also told Sky News Iran could seek to potentially “reverse-engineer” the weapons and use them “in future wars”.

Satellite images received by Sky appear to show two Russian military cargo planes at an airport in Tehran on August 20.

It is understood by the source the transportation of the cash and equipment is part of a deal between the two countries in exchange for Iran supplying Russia with more than 160 unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), including 100 Shahed-136 drones.

It is also reported the government in Tehran has agreed to supply more of the drones in a further deal, alongside bigger and more sophisticated ballistic missiles to Russia.

Speaking to Sky News, Vadym Prystaiko, the Ukrainian ambassador to the UK, said if the reports were confirmed this would “pose a real, real threat"".

""If they [Iranian ballistic missiles] come in numbers, we will have real trouble,” he added.

Iran has dismissed the missile allegation as ""completely false"" but admitted to supplying ""a limited number of drones"" to Moscow.

However, according to the Iranian foreign minister Hossein Amirabdollahian this happened before the Russian invasion of Ukraine back in February.

Formerly known as Thomson-CSF until a rebrand in 2000, Thales has had a long local connection dating back to 1936, working with Shorts for years before taking over its missile systems arm at the turn of the millennium.
