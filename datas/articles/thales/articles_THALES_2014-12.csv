Thales, who counts Airbus as one of its top customers, is very proud to contribute to the entry into service of the newest and most advanced aircraft, the A350-900.

Thales is involved in the A350 XWB program since 2008 for the development and supply of large avionics shipset and electrical power conversion and since 2010, for in-flight entertainment and connectivity. Thales is the most present Original Equipment Manufacturer present on the platform. All Thales avionics equipment now has A350-900 EASA Type Certificate Approval. To date over 2,000 pieces of equipment have been delivered.

Several technological leaps have been developed by Thales specifically for this platform.

To know more about what Frank Chapman, Airbus flight test chief pilot thinks about the A350-900 cockpit, see the video below.

Q&A with Xavier Labbé, head of the A350 XWB program at Thales

What are the main avionics innovations on board the A350-900?

I would go for three ones. The first is the Air Data Inertial Reference Unit (ADIRU): this is the first civil inertial unit that has been developed, certified and produced by Thales. The unit features state-of-the-art technologies and performs as expected with a remarkable level of accuracy and stability, thus contributing to the global performance of the aircraft’s air data chain.

The second would be the six large 15-inch displays. Once again this is the first time that such large screens have been installed in an Airbus cockpit. Other than the displays that are solely devoted to avionics information (navigation screen, primary flight displays, system information), these screens also provide information from the open world. Interactions with pilots and automatic reconfiguration enable perfect homogeneity between the different display systems onboard the whole Airbus range of aircraft. Qualifications for pilots are thus facilitated with the different models between the A320 and A350-900.

Another would be the Integrated Modular Avionics, or IMA. IMA has been first implemented on the A380 and the A400M, and embarks twice as many applications than previous generations, thus allowing reduced weight, enhanced performance and lower ownership costs for airlines. For the first time on the A350 XWB, remote data concentrator located near the sensors and the actuators, produced in partnership with Diehl Aerospace, enables the optimized processing of specific interfaces. Previously, each function was hosted by separate computers.

How did the program go with our customer, Airbus?

For the A350-900 program, Airbus implemented its “new system policy”, thus giving more responsibilities to its tier-1 suppliers.

Therefore we played a key role in advising for system pre-integration, on the inertial unit for instance. We were committed to achieving maturity for the first flight. After 15 months of flight tests, checking our equipment provided a means of confirming the high level of maturity which was attained more than one year before the certification of the aircraft. Early validations combined with a perfect collaboration with our customer in total transparency allowed us to achieve such results.

What are the next steps of the program for Thales?

The most important is to succeed in quickly ramping up production thanks to an industrial maturity aimed at ensuring quality and the on-time deliveries. We are also organized in order to provide Airbus’s first airline customer a flawless support for its operations, as early as the end of the year.

At the same time, we are continuing to work on complementary developments for the A350-1000, which will mainly be devoted to new add-on functionalities.

Exclusive: United to stream DirecTV to some passengers' devices - Runway Girl Network,"Thu, 04 Dec 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTQvMTIvZXhjbHVzaXZlLXVuaXRlZC10by1zdHJlYW0tZGlyZWN0di10by1zb21lLXBhc3NlbmdlcnMtZGV2aWNlcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"As United Airlines puts planes into service without in-seat screens questions are being asked about the future of the inflight entertainment systems on those aircraft. For Thales’ LiveTV unit the answer to those questions represents a significant part of the company’s future plans.

LiveTV provides the in-seat DirecTV system and ViaSat ‘Exede’-powered Ka-band inflight connectivity system on United’s 737 fleet. Because the very latest aircraft have been fitted with the connectivity solution, the radome atop these aircraft is same one that is used for the combo in-seat TV/connectivity system with two antennae. That’s just one hint of what the future holds.

The latest iteration of the LiveTV platform, expected in service in mid-2015, will still not include in-seat screens on United’s newest airplanes but that doesn’t mean it will lack live television options. By tying the DirecTV and on-board Wi-Fi systems together LiveTV and United will be able to offer customers the ability to stream the same 100+ channels of live television to their own personal electronic devices, similar to how they can stream stored content from an on-board server today.

Glenn Latta, president of Thales’ LiveTV unit, explains the system thusly: “The streaming TV system allows us to show lots of content from [the DirecTV] system on a PED. It allows us to offer all of the choices and then down-select to those that are picked on the aircraft to stream. You’ll get 100+ channels of choice; the first people to select what they want to watch will pull the stream in [to action]. I’m going to let the passengers decide what they want to watch out of the 100 channels. The first 20-30 passengers will use up the bandwidth of the Wi-Fi for that.”

LiveTV has plenty of data about watching habits from all its customers and over they years the company has realized that an aircraft will almost never see more than 25 unique channels in use, even on a plane with 150 passengers and 99% usage of the system. So LiveTV expects to be able to meet passenger needs for TV streaming, and still be able to deliver high-speed Internet connectivity to passengers who prefer that service [operating over the separate Ka antenna].

Meanwhile, some media outlets have predicted that wireless entertainment will ultimately replace seat-back systems, and have cited United’s decision not to fit its new 737s with embedded IFE as an example. But with as many as 50 airline requests for proposals (RFPs) for embedded IFE circulating in the industry, it’s difficult to see how embedded IFE will quickly become a thing of the past. In short, United’s IFE decision for its new narrowbodies doesn’t necessarily represent a bellwether for how the industry will evolve, at least not how the wideobody sector will trend. Indeed virtually all long-haul aircraft are ordered with embedded IFE. Even so, airlines and airframers remain open to possible change as wireless technology – and with it the ability to stream more and better quality content – improves.

Asked during the recent Future Travel Experience (FTE) Global 2014 conference if embedded IFE will be around in another ten years, Airbus head of cabin design office Ingo Gäthje said, “The answer is no I can’t answer. Because we see that a lot of airlines have different requirements and different approaches for IFE for now and even more for the future. And if you look ten years back and you look ten years ahead, we don’t know what will come up so for an OEM, it’s quite important to be flexible with and open for all these future trends. And therefore standardization of the interfaces and easy adaptation of new products is key.”

Thales VP product management Lori Salazar added, “I don’t see seat-back IFE for the widebody market going to be displaced for at least 20 to 30 years. I do see more opportunities on single-aisle for wireless IFE”

Seat-back screens will, however, continue to get thinner and lighter, assured Rich Salter, chief technology officer at IFE firm Lumexis. “I think in the long term you’ll see more flat screens on sidewalls, almost any blank surface is a candidate for a screen.”

Will flexible displays be introduced? “We’d like to think so,” said Panasonic Avionics executive director of corporate sales & product management. “I don’t think the technology is mature enough to get the kind of high-resolution that you want. We showed [flexible screens] at APEX Expo… it’s the first curved smart monitor we’ve ever done, which takes up more space than a flat screen, so in economy it would be hard.”

There is a possible wild card in the long-haul market, however. Lufthansa’s supervisory board yesterday approved the carrier’s plan to launch long-haul, low-cost service under its LCC Eurowings brand in partnership with SunExpress. We’ve asked Lufthansa if it will offer embedded IFE on the long-haul, low-cost A330 service or if it will opt for a purely wireless cabin. Despite repeated requests, the carrier has not provided comment. If Lufthansa chooses not to offer embedded IFE – AND if this service proves successful – then the dominoes may start to fall as other low-cost, long-haul carriers follow suit. But of course, if this type of service proves hugely popular, and ultimately surpasses the popularity of Lufthansa and other legacy carriers’ core products – which currently feature embedded IFE – then a far greater shift will transpire in the industry (and the change in IFE from embedded to wireless will be a mere footnote). Time will tell.

However, the big focus in the short-haul market is without a doubt, BYOD [bring your own device] and for airlines to provide inflight connectivity, wireless IFE and in the case of United – and indeed Southwest Airlines – streaming TV to these devices. In-seat power is also a must. “You have to have USB power; the airlines believe in that firmly…you don’t want to run the tablet down on a flight so lots of demand for that on short-haul,” noted Acro Aircraft Seating managing director Chris Brady at FTE Global.

He added, “There is no way of foreseeing the future and we’re stuck with development life cycles to a certain extent, so I suspect the answer is to work in the development life cycle and make it quicker to certify something. That’s got to be an industry response to a changing commercial environment – get better at certifying stuff.” To that end, airframers and suppliers are collaborating to shorten the lead time for integrated embedded IFE/seats.

Samsung Techwin will sign a contract on Wednesday here with Poland's state-funded defense manufacturer HSW. The contract is valued at roughly US $320 million, according to the officials.

It is the second export of the K-9 Thunder self-propelled 155mm howitzer after a deal with Turkey in 2001. Under the $1 billion license agreement, the first eight K-9s were produced in South Korea, while the remaining batch of more than 300 units was built in Turkey. The Turkish variant is called the T-155 Firtina.

Samsung Techwin will sign the same type of license agreement with Poland, according to a DAPA spokesman.

""Samsung Techwin will produce the first 24 units here before 2018, and after that, HSW is to build the remaining 96 units,"" the spokesman said.

The K-9 was developed in 1998 as a replacement for the K55 self-propelled howitzer, a variant of the M109.

Fitted with an automatic fire-control system, the artillery has a maximum rate of fire of 6 rounds per minute and is capable of multiple-round simultaneous-impact firing. It has a firing range of 40 kilometers.

The vehicle is powered by a German MTU MT 881 Ka-500 diesel engine, developing 1,000 horsepower.

The latest K-9 deal comes after a merger and acquisition agreement over Samsung Techwin.

Last month, Samsung Group agreed to sell a 32.4 percent stake in Samsung Techwin for $765 million to Hanwha Corp., a defense business arm of Hanwha Group. Hanwha also gained managing rights over Samsung Thales, an electronics weapon maker jointly funded by the French Thales Group as Techwin owns a 50 percent stake in Samsung Thales. ■

Thales employees have been supporting the annual WISE awards in London, an annual event that recognises individuals who have made a significant contribution to the issue of women working in the fields of science and engineering.

The black tie dinner and awards ceremony was held earlier this month in London. The Princess Royal was invited to present the Awards as patron of the WISE campaign.

The awards categories reflect the two strategic areas of the organisation’s campaign. The first is for individual women and girls who are ideal role models to inspire the next generation of girls. The second recognises teachers, careers advisers and women in leadership for growing the talent pipeline.

This year, the awards were preceded by a WISE daytime event at the city’s Southbank Centre. This included a programme of challenging panel discussions, lively debate and key industry speakers.

Thales employees involved across the day were Marion Broughton, Dr Paul Gosling, Eve Maywood, Lydia Prentice, Dawn Ohlson, Dawn Gilbert, Carol Marsh, Laura Shrieves, Anna Sandham and Gemma Adam.

Dawn Bonfield, President of the Women in Engineering Society, also joined the Thales table at the evening awards.

Marion Broughton, Vice President, Land and Air Systems, was one of a number of our employees who spoke to Princess Anne.

It was great to meet Princess Anne who was well informed on all the businesses that people represented on the evening; we discussed the origins of Thales in Racal and Pilkington and the value we place on our graduate programme as an excellent source of female talent.” Marion Broughton

Sasha Roberts, a Thales maritime engineer, was also at both events in her new official capacity as a member of the inaugural 10-strong Young Women’s Board for WISE.

The board members, who are all WISE members, were selected through certain criteria: the women must be born after the WISE campaign was established, hold technical qualifications and work in a technical position.

WISE provides its members with a variety of STEM related resources and workshops and membership is free for any student; membership fees for companies and individuals are available from the organisation. For more information on WISE, visit www.wisecampaign.org.uk."

Thales Australia has successfully delivered a significant upgrade to the Collins submarine Platform Training Simulator (PTS), which now has the highest levels of reliability and availability since entering service in 1993.

Thales completed the complex upgrade of the dual simulator on time and with an accelerated installation schedule in order to minimise simulator downtime.

The company worked closely with the customer to deliver the upgrade, which included improvements to the computing and Input / Output system, instructor facilities, Integrated Ship Control Management and Monitoring System (ISCMMS), and audio systems.

The work on the PTS, which is located at HMAS Stirling in Western Australia, follows similar upgrades carried out by Thales globally for the UK’s Vanguard class and Norway’s Ula class submarine simulators.

Chris Lloyd, Thales Australia’s Vice President Maritime & Aerospace, said: “This cost-effective, low-risk upgrade will ensure that Australian submarine crews continue to receive the highest standards of training.”

The upgrade included the addition of the latest generation Thales C2000-X simulation technology, and newly developed interfaces with ship components. A recording system was also developed to provide instant replay capability at the trainee consoles, with minimal input from instructors.

With greatly enhanced software development capabilities now installed, further upgrades are in progress to enhance training realism and track future changes to the Collins submarines.

In the final stage of the upgrade, Thales is working with the Defence Science and Technology Organisation to develop and incorporate the most realistic submarine controls and performance models available in the world.

Lieutenant Commander Ian Dawson, Manager of Engineering Training at HMAS Stirling, said: “The simulator plays a vital role in training our submarine crews. The upgrade should substantially improve reliability and allow us to optimise the training throughput of our future submariners”.

Thales is a major provider of training and simulation solutions for naval forces on platforms such as maritime helicopters and patrol aircraft, submarines and surface vessels.

Beyond the simulator, Thales is a major supplier to the Collins program. The company provides and supports the sonar suite, towed array, communications mast and other key sensors."

In the 80’s and 90’s, Thales renewed the rocket system technology and partially integrated a revolutionary technology of programming and activation by induction, which now arouses the Americans’ interest. Indeed, this technology enables to deploy this armament system in varied configurations; the company considers diversifying the platforms that could host it, which would allow the management combining of this type of ammunitions, while developing newer operational capabilities altogether.

TB : In a scope of a defense budgets decrease, does the rocket provide a permanency in firing with regard to a missile technology more and more expansive?

MK : Absolutely! The sub-metric precision rocket costs around three times less than the American missile HELLFIRE on the TIGER. The rocket is also easier to use because it is much lighter than a missile. So, one could load several types of rockets on the same platform for a ten-hour flight, to destroy four or six targets, which would not be possible with a missile, which is heavier and is designed to destroy or neutralize armored targets.

TB : Who are your major rivals in this field and what does set yourself from them?

MK : There is a big competition, above all with laser guided rockets, because they exclusively follow the American standard, 2.75 inches. If we sum up, the rocket market will be clearly bisected: on one hand, you have the Russian 80mm caliber; on the other hand, the American 2.75-inch caliber. The French 68mm caliber is only 5% of stocks.

In the 90’s, the American military wanted to purchase a laser guided rocket called Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System (APKWS). This market siphoned off some missile manufacturers like LOCKHEED MARTIN, BAE, RAYTHEON, who all tried to develop guidance – kit to equip these rockets but they all keep the American generic standard, which has not evolved since the Vietnam War. So, it is combined with the analog, wired and mechanical technology for its application.

For its part, Thales did its intellectual revolution in the 90’s and replaced the usual rocket, which dated back also from the 60’s, by renewing the system, now improved with induction, digitalization and reaching the absence of connectors. Which means that the warhead equipped with the Thales guiding system fits onto a modern “motor”: the F4 propeller. This is for all these reasons that our guided rocket will be much more efficient than the American one, given that the system infrastructure of the latter is totally unsuited to such a high-performing vector.

TB : I guess that on the TIGER the rocket launchers could be supplied with munitions repeatedly…

MK : That’s correct. The rocket launchers have an unknown lifetime limit. We guarantee that our tubes will be able to fire until 300 rockets because we stopped testing at this amount. Besides, our launchers are maintainable at 100 %, which represents a big difference compared to the American standard, since the 2.75-inch launchers warranty is for only 16 rockets firing per tube and are then thrown away when the number of unusable tube per launcher reach 30%. So, shooting with a “22-round” which equips, for instance, the TIGER’s internal block, you can fire 6,600 rockets before even the first maintenance. It enables you to go on a theater of operations without any launcher in reserve and to fire approximately 20,000 with one combat helicopter, without having a hang-up about maintenance.

TB : These rockets have been used on several theatres of operations like in Afghanistan, Libya and Mali… Which feedback did you get from these deployments?

MK : The feedback from these different conflicts was very positive and was immediately taken into account. Between 2009 (and the deployment in Afghanistan) and 2013 (with Operation SERVAL in Mali), the equipment and ammunitions evolved and the consideration of the rules of engagement were well comprehended by the crews. From now on, these ones use the mix helicopter platform/system of armament in a very efficient way.

TB : We currently find your rockets on aircrafts. Do you envisage adapting them to other platforms: terrestrial, naval, aerial?

MK : It is the great strategy of Thales, which precisely consists in explaining that this rocketing armament, i.e. a munition, can be adapted to series of platforms. The rocket first came back on attack helicopters. We have launchers adapted to the RAFALE’s point 3. We also want to equip armored vehicles, ships and drones with them. Clearly, the idea of Thales is to promote this munition as being adapted to various platforms and to outline that, with the current financing problem, it is relevant for the joint staff to purchase a type of ammunition that can be deployed onto vectors as numerous as possible.

TB : Is the rocket the ideal weapon for asymmetric warfare?

MK : It is clear that the advantage of the rocketing system of armament is a result of the capacity of the same system to fire an unguided ammunition for a show of force, an unguided ammunition to perform a surface shoot over a zone or a guided ammunition for a tactical strike onto a potentially moving target in an environment where collateral damage is strictly forbidden. So, with the very same launcher, we are able to fulfill varied missions. We could call this versatility, which cannot be obtained with a missile dedicated to a certain type of target and to a certain context. And if we put up only one type of ammunition, we won’t be able to fulfill the other missions. It is sure that the rocket system answers an operational context which evolves either slowly in time or fast: the flying aircraft will be able to re-adapt and select the ammunition suitable for the context.

Today, Thales here takes up a unique and different position between the notions of Close Air Support (CAS) and Close Combat Attack (CCA). The rocketing system of armament is rather considered as equipment used in CCA because the crew make alone the decision to use its weaponry and, thus, the fact that it has a versatile rocket system enables it to have at its disposal the most adapted solution against the threat.

TB : Do you intend to develop this system in the SCORPION program our department of Defense has finally launched?

MK : The terrestrial version is not officially included in the SCORPION program but there are currently negotiations to study it as an alternative to the “all-missile” scope.

TB : As a conclusion, we could affirm, taking the example of Thales, that one can ally high technology and Low Cost?

MK : It is always too expensive for our customers but it is clear that we propose a product with performances close to the missile’s own, I mean in terms of maneuverability.

In term of capabilty a munition while guided cannot replace a missile which will be able to defeet target heavier in term of balistic protection or with active protection like flairs. However, Thales positions itself actually on a whole spectrum of missions with technically top-of-the-range ammunitions because they results from statements of requirements of the Direction générale de l’armement (“General Directorate for Armament”), which is very severe with regard to safety and reliability. Our ammunitions are much reliable and far more performing than competing products. To reach such a level of reliability, we have to carry technology: a laser-guided ammunition with a submetrical accuracy, i.e. an ammunition able to reach its target at 6 km into a 1-meter circle. The performance of unguided ammunition depends on the shooting platform used: on a combat helicopter or a fighter plane, the performances vary due to the fact that these carriers have a different motion speed.

Unlike the other manufacturers of guided ammunitions and missiles, Thales masters the whole system. We produce the firing driver which could be embarked on the platform, the launcher, the ammunition with its rocket, its propeller and its warhead. Today, Thales can offer its customers not only a simple ammunition but a genuine operational capability. We are able to incorporate this system onto a flying platform we have to arm. This enables Thales to provide the technical solution that fits the best to the targeted capability and to his core needs, which something else than simply showing him a catalog, however complete it be. We show him the solutions.

TB : Mister Krouri, we thank you for this introduction.

Partnership a testament to Destini's ability in integrated engineering - The Borneo Post,"Sat, 20 Dec 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWJvcm5lb3Bvc3QuY29tLzIwMTQvMTIvMjAvcGFydG5lcnNoaXAtYS10ZXN0YW1lbnQtdG8tZGVzdGluaXMtYWJpbGl0eS1pbi1pbnRlZ3JhdGVkLWVuZ2luZWVyaW5nL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"KUCHING: The recent appointment of Malaysian integrated engineering solutions provider Destini Bhd (Destini) as the key industry partner for Thales Asia Holding Pte Ltd (Thales Asia) will help boost the group’s position across industries as well as diversify its income stream.

The KIP partnership policy is aimed at helping Thales Asia to identify and qualify local partners within a country, possessing industrial capabilities with whom they would like to establish a working relationship.

The Group underwent an extremely rigorous and thorough vetting process to obtain this KIP status which included due diligence investigations among other various processes to meet the requirements set out for qualifying.

Speaking about the appointment, group managing director of Destini Datuk Rozabil Abdul Rahman said it was a testament to the high level of technological ability combined with a strong 15-year track record within Destini that we have been granted this status.

“Through our new strategic partnership with Thales Asia we believe that we will be able to further consolidate our position in the different industries we are currently involved in and equip us to better compete for new contract opportunities.

“It affirms that our strategic growth plan is heading in the right direction and we hope is a sign of even better things to come,” he said in a statement.

“We remain optimistic of not only performing well going forward, but also of continuing to diversify our income streams to ensure cash flow stability and earnings visibility which will add value to our business and benefit both our shareholders and stakeholders.”

The Thales Group originally began as a defence company with a strong presence in the French market, and has now expanded their operations to over 50 countries, where they provide sophisticated solutions in the aerospace, space, ground transportation, defence and security sectors.

With the appointment of Destini as a KIP, the group will not only be able to participate in Thales Asia’s projects in Malaysia but also promote its products and services.

The KIP status is valid for a period of three years during which Destini will operate as Thales Asia’s KIP in both the defence and commercial sectors of business.

Both Thales Asia and Destini will be looking at multiple future collaboration opportunities which will be formalized through agreements on a project by project basis.

The partnership policy has already begun to bear fruit and has resulted in the Group securing a contract for the supply of FZ rocket launchers to the Royal Malaysian Air Force worth RM46 million.

This contract is for a duration of three years, with the first shipment expected to be delivered in mid-January 2015."
