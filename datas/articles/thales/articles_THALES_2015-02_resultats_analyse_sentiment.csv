Mission success for the IXV atmospheric reentry demonstrator, developed by Thales Alenia Space !

Developed by Thales Alenia Space for the European Space Agency, the Intermediate Experimental Vehicle (IXV), was successfully launched by Arianespace, on February 11th 2015, on board a Vega rocket from the Guiana Space Center. It is a demonstrator aiming to test systems and technologies for future European atmospheric reentry vehicles. Thales Alenia Space capitalized on its acknowledged expertise in orbital infrastructures to act as prime contractor for this demonstrator. Below, we take a closer look at this exciting new program.

Mission

Launched successfully on February 11th 2015, the aim of the IXV program was to develop an independent system that could validate, under real conditions, atmospheric reentry technologies, namely aerodynamics, aerothermodynamics, and the thermal protection, navigation and control systems.

An exciting program, in space and at sea!

The IXV separated from the launcher at an altitude of 320 kilometers, continuing its ascent until reaching an altitude of 412 kilometers. It then began the reentry phase, during which experimental data was acquired via the instruments on the vehicle. The IXV reached a speed during its atmospheric reentry of approximately 7.5 km/sec at an altitude of 120 km, typical of a reentry from low Earth orbit, similar of those of the International Space Station. Following the mission, that lasted about 1 hour and 40 minutes, the demonstrator splashed down in the Pacific Ocean, using a parachute. It was then recovered by a specially outfitted ship. The ship's crew, including propulsion staff from Thales Alenia Space, had to passivate (neutralize) the IXV and to recover the data recording devices. The ship will then sail through the Panama Canal on its way to Genoa, carrying its precious cargo.

From orbital infrastructures to tomorrow's space transport systems

Having already supplied half of the pressurized volume on the International Space Station, Thales Alenia Space leveraged its unrivaled expertise in orbital infrastructures and space transport to meet new challenges, including the IXV for ESA, and the pressurized compartment on SOAR (Sub-Orbital Aircraft Reusable), which will carry both scientific experiments and astronauts. Thales Alenia Space will also be a leading contributor to the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV) being developed by NASA.

""With this mission, France and Europe confirm their excellence in space exploration, one of the major challenges facing us in the years ahead. We are addressing scientific, technological and strategic challenges, along with the question of French and European sovereignty. At the same time, these scientific projects make us dream, illuminate our research on the origins of the Universe, and inspire young people to choose scientific and technical careers, areas where we lack human resources. To meet all these challenges, we have to develop expertise in the enabling technologies, and especially those needed by a manned or unmanned spacecraft to return safely to Earth. What I saw today at Thales Alenia Space's plant in Turin, along with my Italian counterpart Stefania Giannini, shows that Europe has what it takes to meet these exciting challenges."" - Geneviève Fioraso, former French Minister of Higher Education and Research (Thales Alenia Space - Turin - February 11th, 2015.

CEO: Thales To Book Nearly €1B on Egypt Deal - Defense News,"Sat, 28 Feb 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS9pbmR1c3RyeS8yMDE1LzAyLzI4L2Nlby10aGFsZXMtdG8tYm9vay1uZWFybHktZXVyMWItb24tZWd5cHQtZGVhbC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — The French government's recent €5.2 billion (US $5.9 billion) sale of arms to Egypt will bring in close to €1 billion to Thales, an ""extra large"" deal, Patrice Caine, chairman of the electronics company, said.

Thales' share of the deal with Egypt is ""not far from €1 billion,"" he told a press conference on the company's 2014 financial results. The company expects to seal further deals worth more than €500 million, he said.

Orders worth more than €500 million rank among the ""extra large,"" while ""large"" refers to those more than €100 million, he said.

On Feb. 16, Egypt signed orders for 24 Rafale combat jets, a multimission frigate and missiles worth a total of €5.2 billion.

Thales is not a prime contractor on the Egyptian deal but supplies systems on the Rafale and the frigate, and holds contracts with missile maker MBDA and with DCNS on the torpedo, Caine said.

Another defense order for equipment and service worth hundreds of millions of euros has landed from Lebanon, for which the first payment just arrived, Caine said.

Lebanon has ordered armored vehicles, patrol boats, combat helicopters, ammunition and communication systems, and will receive training from the French services, the French Defense Ministry said in a Feb. 25 statement.

Saudi Arabia is funding the $3 billion deal agreed with Beirut and Paris last year, aimed at re-equipping the Lebanese forces, the ministry said.

Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian welcomed the ""effective launching of this program"" with the first payment, and the first deliveries would start in April, the ministry said.

Thales has declined to give a definitive figure for the Lebanese order as this is likely to change and is managed by ODAS, a company set up by the French government to handle arms exports to Saudi Arabia, Senior Executive Vice President Pascale Sourisse said.

Thales will supply equipment, subsystems to prime contractors and service, which makes it hard to arrive at a definite figure, she said. ""We expect to put this in the extra large category,"" she said.

Of the $3 billion order for Lebanon, two-thirds is for equipment and one-third for maintenance, website La Tribune has reported.

Regarding a $3.4 billion tender in Turkey for the Loramids air defense system, Sourisse said talks were expected to continue through the year and a selection was unlikely this year.

""Discussions cover a number of issues, we're actively working, we hope to clear various stages this year, but we do not on the industry side expect an order contract this year,"" she said.

Thales is partnered with missile maker MBDA through the Eurosam joint venture, which is pitching the Aster 30 to Turkey. The European team competes with Lockheed Martin and Raytheon, which have offered the Patriot, and China Precision Machinery Import-Export Corp.

There are state-to-state talks on the tender, which opens the door to Ankara forging an alliance with Paris and Rome, Sourisse said.

""It would be an excellent opportunity to form a very strong alliance linking up France, Italy and Turkey on a large system which would be interoperable with NATO systems,"" she said.

NATO and US officials have told Turkey if the Chinese missile system is picked, the weapon would not be allowed to be integrated into the NATO and US joint air defense system.

Eurosam is a French-Italian joint venture which markets the Aster missile.

On the Egyptian deal, Thales will receive 25 percent of the Rafale contract and 20 percent of the frigate, while supplying the seekers on the MBDA missiles, Sourisse said.

For 2014, Thales listed 19 large orders, including the Falcon Eye spy satellite for the United Arab Emirates. Airbus Defence and Space is the lead on the industrial team, with Thales Alenia Space co-prime to supply the payload.

Thales reported operating profit slipped 3 percent to €985 million from a year ago, a decline stemming from its 35 percent stake in DCNS, which reported a heavy loss for 2014.

Stripping out the DCNS holding, operating profit rose 13 percent to €1.10 billion, on sales up 2 percent at €12.97 billion.

Net attributable profit fell 12 percent to €565 million, hit by problems on civil transport contracts signed with new clients and DCNS.

Orders rose 11 percent to €14.4 billion, while those from emerging markets climbed more than 40 percent over two years to €4.3 billion.

The core defense markets in Europe are mature but delivered an unexpected rise in orders, including France. New orders for defense and security rose 4 percent to €7.1 billion.

State-owned DCNS reported a net loss of €336 million on Feb. 24, on sales of €3.1 billion, stemming from cost overruns on the Barracuda nuclear powered submarine and civil energy projects.

DCNS has forecast a gradual return to profit, which Thales says it will help support, to improve its own profit line.

Turkey's Gokturk-1 Imaging Satellite in Limbo at Thales Alenia Space - SpaceNews,"Thu, 05 Feb 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS90dXJrZXlzLWdva3R1cmstMS1pbWFnaW5nLXNhdGVsbGl0ZS1pbi1saW1iby1hdC10aGFsZXMtYWxlbmlhLXNwYWNlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Turkey’s Gokturk-1 high-resolution optical reconnaissance satellite remains stuck, largely completed, in a production facility in France because of last-minute issues between the Turkish government and the satellite’s French and Italian contractors, government and industry officials said.

Scheduled for launch aboard a European Vega rocket, Gokturk-1 has disappeared from the 2015 manifest. Even if it were released from Thales Alenia Space’s Cannes, France, facility immediately, the satellite must undergo extensive final assembly, integration and testing at a showcase new Turkish facility that is expected to demonstrate its new technical know-how with Gokturk-1.

Assisting Turkey transition from satellite buyer to satellite builder was one of Ankara’s goals both in the Gokturk-1 satellite contract, signed in 2009 with Telespazio of Rome, and in Turkey’s recent telecommunications satellite projects. Telespazio contracted with its sister company, Thales Alenia Space, to build Gokturk-1.

Turkey’s national telecommunications satellite operator, Turksat, in recent years has gradually increased its satellite manufacturing knowledge in contracts with Thales Alenia Space of France and Italy, and more recently with Mitsubishi Electric Co. of Japan.

Mitsubishi is prime contractor for the Turksat 4A and Turksat 4B satellites. Turksat 4A was launched in February 2014. Turksat 4B is waiting its turn in the backlog of launches scheduled on the Russian Proton rocket, and is expected to be launched this year.

Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI) in December contracted with the Turkish government to build a Turksat 6A, a Ku- and X-band satellite that will be labeled Turkey’s first domestically built telecommunications satellite but likely will feature substantial foreign content.

In a briefing here Feb. 4 during Paris Space Week, Cem Unal, head of the contract office at TAI, said his company has begun to search for Turksat 6 component suppliers.

The assembly, integration and test (AIT) facility in Ankara was expected to be fully qualified this year based on the processing of Gokturk-1. TAI hopes to develop the facility into a regular stop for satellites from many nations that would be assembled and tested in Turkey and then shipped directly to their spaceports.

“AIT is the most important capability of TAI in space,” Unal said. “It is not 100 percent functional at the moment because we are waiting for the Gokturk-1 satellite from Thales Alenia Space.”

Turkey’s role in Gokturk-1 extends beyond AIT functions, however. TAI provided the satellite body side panels, which were delivered to Thales Alenia Space in September 2013.

Unal declined to speculate on when Gokturk-1 would be shipped to Ankara. He said “the governments” are negotiating a resolution of the issue. It remained unclear whether the sticking points were related to Turkey’s final milestone payments to Telespazio, which then would pay Thales Alenia Space, or some other issue.

In its early going, the Gokturk-1 program was a subject of debate about what limits should be put on high-resolution satellites sold for export, and whether “shutter control,” or the ability of the selling nation to determine what images are taken, and where, would be a mandatory part of the contract.

In the end, Turkish officials made clear they would not accept shutter control. Since then, the issue has lost some of its force as multiple satellites with ground-sampling distances sharper than 1 meter have been sold in the Middle East and South America.

As such, other parts of the world have caught up with Gokturk-1, whose performance characteristics are similar to France’s two commercial/military Pleiades satellites in orbit.

A Telespazio spokesman on Feb. 4 said the company would decline to comment on the status of the Gokturk-1 contract and referred questions to the Turkish government.

Unal said the AIT facility is capable of handling satellites intended for low Earth orbit, such as Earth imaging spacecraft, and the higher geostationary orbit, the destination of most telecommunications satellites. A spacecraft weighing up to 5,000 kilograms at launch could be processed through the plant, he said.

Unal said the Turkish government has recently approved a Gokturk-3 satellite, this one equipped with a synthetic-aperture radar imager. The TAI contract for now extends only to the end of the preliminary design review, before construction starts. Hardware manufacturing, with non-Turkish assistance but under TAI management, should start in 2016, he said.

Thales Leites Wants To Fight Tim Kennedy - LowKick MMA,"Fri, 06 Feb 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmxvd2tpY2ttbWEuY29tL3RoYWxlcy1sZWl0ZXMtd2FudHMtZmlnaHQtdGltLWtlbm5lZHkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"UFC middleweight Thales Leites has gone through a significant career resurgence as of late. Since returning to the UFC in 2013, Leites has rattled off five-straight wins, looking very impressive in the process.

He’s also showed that he is not just a Brazilian Jiu-jitsu guru, but has vastly improved striking as well. His latest win was a second-round submission over Tim Boetsch at last weekend’s (January 31, 2015) UFC 183. Now, Leites is eying a Top 10 opponent.

The Brazilian would apparently like to face off with former Strikeforce title contender Tim Kennedy next. Kennedy is currently ranked No. 8 in the middleweight rankings and coming off of a controversial loss to Yoel Romero, so Leites believes the time is right for a bout with “The Sniper.” He spoke to MMAFighting.com:

“I usually don’t choose opponents, I leave that to the UFC, but I believe Tim Kennedy is the best option for my next fight,” Leites stated in a release. “I always want to be among the best, always respecting my opponents. He’s tough, he’s well ranked, and it would be an interesting fight.”

Leites is known for his decorated ground game, but his submission win over Boetsch was his first submission win since 2012. Leites knows the fight starts on the feet and he wants to be well-rounded, despite deeply loving jiu-jitsu. When it’s all said and done, however, he obviously loves submitting his opponents:

“I always go for the submission, but I know the fight starts standing and that’s how things go,” he said. “It’s getting harder every time to take my opponents down, and it’s even harder to keep them there. The feeling of submitting (an opponent) is amazing. I’m a jiu-jitsu guy and I love to put on the gi and train with my friends. That’s part of my job, but also one of my hobbies.”

He also spoke of his coach, the highly accredited Andre Pederneiras of Nova Uniao, predicted that Leites would finish Boetsch with an arm-triangle:

“Right before the fight, ‘Dede’ talked about the arm-triangle choke and said I would win that way. And it happened,” Leites said. “He later said he had a premonition, and I asked him to let me know if that happens again next time.”

Being 5-0 in his second stint with the UFC, it’s definitely time for Leites to face a true test. How do you think he would fare against Kennedy?","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.5657684206962585}",neutral,0.5657684206962585,0
ATV-5 bows out! - Thales,"Sun, 15 Feb 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi93b3JsZHdpZGUvc3BhY2UvbmV3cy9hdHYtNS1ib3dzLW91dNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"ATV-5 bows out! Share this article



LinkedIn

The fifth ATV (Automated Transfer Vehicle) separated from the International Space Station on February 14, signaling the end of the European Space Agency's ATV program. ATV-5, nicknamed Georges Lemaître in honor of the Belgian physicist, father of the Big Bang theory, undocked from the Space Station on Saturday, February 14 at 13:40 UTC, then plunged back into the atmosphere the following day, burning up with waste offloaded from the ISS.



ATV-5: mission feedback

Launched by Arianespace in July 2014 from the Guiana Space Center, Europe's Spaceport in French Guiana, the ATV-5 rendezvoused automatically with the ISS, bringing it experimental equipment, spare parts, food, oxygen and water for the crew. It carried a total of 2.7 metric tons of cargo, along with 2.1 metric tons of propellant to maintain the Space Station in its nominal orbit, and 860 kg of propellants for the propulsion system on the Russian service module, as well as 850 kg of water and 100 kg of oxygen.

Thales Alenia Space, a lead role on the ATV



Thales Alenia Space was a major partner in this large-scale European program, as supplier of the pressurized Integrated Cargo Carriers (ICC) for all five ATVs, which were named, starting with the first: Jules Verne (writer), Johannes Kepler (astronomer) Edoardo Amaldi (Italian space pioneer), Albert Einstein (physicist who developed the theory of relativity) and Georges Lemaître. Over the course of its five resupply missions to the International Space Station, Europe's ATV – and especially the ICC from Thales Alenia Space – carried some 31.5 metric tons of cargo to the International Space Station, including propellants, oxygen and water.

From orbital infrastructures to tomorrow's space transport systems

Thales Alenia Space has built fully 50% of the pressurized volume on the International Space Station, including the Node 2 and 3, MPLM, Columbus, Cupola and PMM modules, along with the pressurized service modules on all five ATVs. It also won the contract from NASA to provide nine pressurized cargo modules for Cygnus spacecraft. Building on this unique expertise, Thales Alenia Space will also be a leading contributor to the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV) being developed by NASA, to be used for exploration missions beyond low Earth orbit.

The Eyes of the Future RN Carrier Strike Force - Defense Update,"Sun, 08 Feb 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vZGVmZW5zZS11cGRhdGUuY29tLzIwMTUwMjA4X2Nyb3dzbmVzdC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The British MOD is set to select soon the future Airborne Early Warning (AEW) system to be deployed on the future Royal Navy (RN) Queen Elizabeth II aircraft carriers. The Crowsnest airborne surveillance and control (ASaC) program set to become operational in 2019, will providing the Queen Elizabeth Class aircraft carriers an organic air surveillance and battlespace management for the carrier strike force from 2020.

Thales UK and Lockheed Martin submitted final offers for the Crowsnest solutions last month, competing for the £500 million ($761 million) contract. Although the two radar systems proposed by the companies are designed for the Royal Navy AgustaWestland EH101 Merlin Mk 2 ASaC helicopters, they are profoundly different in their mission approach, future capabilities and cost. As part of the U.K. defense ministry’s assessment of the two options, both have been flight tested on a Merlin Mk. 2.

As the Sea King family helicopters is due to retire in 2016, MOD is extending the service of a number of the Sea King helicopters operated by 849 Naval Air Squadron through 2018, to prevent a capability gap between the withdrawal of the Sea King ASaC.7 and the introduction of Merlin ASaC.2. 10 of the Merlin helicopters are to be modified to accept the Airborne Surveillance and Control (ASaC) system, configured as ‘roll on/roll off’ kit.

Leading a £750 million ($1.15 billion) upgrade to 30 of the Royal Navy’s legacy Merlin HM1 helicopters, Lockheed Martin UK has been awarded a £24 million contract to run a competition to design, develop and demonstrate Crowsnest. As the company is also one of the competitors for the tender, the Merlin team has to be ‘firewalled’ to prevent leaking commercially sensitive information to Lockheed Martin UK.

The solution proposed by Thales UK recapitalizes existing the Searchwater 2000 radars currently providing the AEW mission for the Royal Navy on board HMS Ocean. These helicopters carry the mechanically rotating radar in a retractable drum-shaped dome lowered into position below the helicopter after takeoff. Positioned below the fuselage, the rotating radar gains unobstructed view of the hemisphere below, thus covering effectively 360 degrees. Thales plans to utilize this system for the new platform, using a modernized and updated radar along with its associated Cerberus mission system – both are currently used on the Sea King ASaC7.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999892711639404}",neutral,0.9999892711639404,0
Lockheed advances credentials of AESA-based Crowsnest bid - Flightglobal,"Wed, 25 Feb 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vbG9ja2hlZWQtYWR2YW5jZXMtY3JlZGVudGlhbHMtb2YtYWVzYS1iYXNlZC1jcm93c25lc3QtYmlkLzExNjAxNS5hcnRpY2xl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Lockheed Martin UK has rebuffed claims of costliness and over-complexitylevelledat its bid for the UK’s Crowsnest requirement by Thales UK, its rival for the £500 million ($770 million) contest, which is now entering its final stages.

The winner is to supply 10 radar and role-fit mission system kits to allow conversion of the Royal Navy’s AgustaWestland AW101 Merlin HM2 anti-submarine warfare (ASW) helicopters into an airborne early warning (AEW) platform.

A fleet of aged Sea King 7 airborne surveillance and control (ASaC) rotorcraft currently provide the latter capability, but these will finally be retired from service in 2018.

Thales UK proposes adapting and modernising the Cerberus mission system and Searchwater 2000 mechanically scanned array radar used by the Sea Kings.

Lockheed’s solution, known as Vigilance, is more complex. It proposes a pair of ""fifth-generation"" Elta Systems-made active electronically scanned array (AESA) radars, each using two arrays, mounted in pods on either side of the helicopter, coupled with its ASW consoles, which are already installed in the Merlin HM2.

Lockheed Martin

Roll-on, roll-off equipment racks are mounted on the helicopter’s existing seat rails and a pre-installed software cartridge in the existing ASW consoles will recognise the switch to the AEW mission, says Younus Mustafa, airborne military solutions director at the firm’s Integrated Systems business. It claims the helicopter can be swapped between roles in just 3h.

And Mustafa dismisses suggestions that its AESA-based bid would be an unreliable “technology demonstrator” when used on the Merlin, describing it as a ""low-risk solution"".

“You would struggle to go any major supplier in the world and find one that is not working on an AESA radar to combat the next generation of threats,” he says.

“[Mechanically scanned array] radars were developed for threats in the 1980s; we are now developing a radar for threats that are out there in the next 10-15 years.”

He argues that the capability enhancement offered by the AESA-based sensors and the new mission system – which features a number of operator ""decision aids"" such as the sensor correlation engine from the US Navy's Lockheed/Sikorsky MH-60R Seahawk –- makes its bid the more compelling.

“We have looked at the customer’s requirements and the capability they require and developed an AESA radar solution that meets them,” he says.

With the life of the Merlin HM2 variant potentially extending all the way to 2040, Mustafa sees its offer as a way to ""future-proof"" the helicopters while also reducing whole-life costs.

Lockheed Martin

Flight trials using the Vigilance pods were conducted from July to November 2014 at partner Qinetiq’s Boscombe Down facility in the southwest of the UK. In all, some 22h of flight time was amassed across 11 sorties and the pods, which weigh slightly more than a standard torpedo load, “had no adverse effects on the handling of the aircraft”.

Thales has promised early delivery of full operational capability (FOC) of its solution, but Lockheed says it will match that timeline, reaching the FOC milestone a full 12 months in advance of the UK defence ministry’s 2018 deadline. All its individual systems are at technology readiness level 7, notes Mustafa.

“Cerberus is a good system and it has served the navy well over the last 20 years, but we looked at it and thought new technology was the best way for the navy to address future threats,” he says.

Vigilance also has export potential, he says, with several “international parties” already interested.

The Ministry of Defence is expected to reveal its choice early in the second quarter.

The contract will be for 21 months and will allow JAC to remain focused on the operation and deployment of the UAE’s military aircraft, the company said in a statement.

The new deal is also expected to facilitate a performance-based logistics (PBL) arrangement between the two organisations when AMMROC opens a new MRO centre at Nibras Al Ain Aerospace Park.

AMMROC, which is a joint venture between Mubadala, Sikorsky Aerospace Services and Lockheed Martin, added that PBL arrangements represent a significant change in the approach to supplying military aviation MRO services in the UAE.

Under this model, all material and maintenance activity are provided under a cost per flight hour model that provides greater flexibility to the armed forces while improving efficiency, the statement said.

“This contract represents the continuing fulfilment of UAE Armed Forces’ longstanding vision to maintain all rotary and fixed wing aircraft through outsourced experts, enabling core JAC personnel to focus on operations and deployment,” said Fahed Ghareeb Al Shamesi, CEO of AMMROC.

The UAE has been investing heavily to ramp up its MRO facilities with a number of deals announced at the recently concluded defense exhibition IDEX 2015.

Another firm Abu Dhabi Ship Building (ADSB), which specialises in providing construction and repair services for naval military vehicles, announced that it signed a deal with defense equipment maker Thales.

As per the deal, ADSB will collaborate with Thales to provide life-cycle management solutions for ships for a number of defense stakeholders in the region.

Defense related deals worth Dhs2.5 billion were signed on February 25, the concluding day of IDEX, organisers said.

Other commercial contracts announced during the show include a Dhs24 million contract between the UAE Armed Forces and Abu Dhabi Autonomous Systems Investments Company to provide spare parts for unmanned vehicles.

The UAE Armed Forces also signed a Dhs18 million deal with Thales to purchase spare parts for military devices.

The Emirates’ military authorities are also finalising a Dhs192 million deal with American firm ATK for an aircraft military system, IDEX organisers said.

Overall, the UAE raked up deals worth Dhs18 billion at the event, up 30 per cent from its spend in 2013.

The Gulf country also sealed a Dhs2.27 billion deal with Boeing for the purchase of two C-17 military transport planes.

Other major contracts announced during the week-long event were a Dhs3.75 billion deal with Airbus and Thales to purchase two satellites and their land control stations, and a Dhs732 million contract with AgustaWestland to buy nine AW139 helicopters.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998726844787598}",neutral,0.9998726844787598,0
Qatar Rail signs deal for driverless Doha Metro trains - Doha News,"Sun, 22 Feb 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vZG9oYW5ld3MuY28vcWF0YXItcmFpbC1zaWducy1kZWFsLWRyaXZlcmxlc3MtZG9oYS1tZXRyby10cmFpbnMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The latest contract awarded by Qatar Rail sheds new light on what passengers will experience while riding the Doha Metro once the system starts operating in 2019.

Coinciding with a weekend visit to Japan by Qatar’s Emir, a consortium of five firms led by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. announced on Friday that it had signed a letter of conditional acceptance with Qatar Rail.

The deal includes the sale of railway vehicles, laying of track and various systems including signals, power distribution, telecommunications and tunnel ventilation.

No contract value was disclosed.

The announcement included several tangible details about what future passengers will experience, including:

Automated fare collections : Thales is one of the five firms in the consortium and provides contactless systems that typically involve passengers pre-paying their fare online or at the station and then holding a card or token up to a sensor at a gate. Thales is also the company that supplied the fare collection system for the Dubai Metro;

Thales is also the company that supplied the fare collection system for the Dubai Metro; Platform screen doors : Increasingly common in new and retrofitted metro systems, these are separate doors that act as a safety barrier between the platform and the tracks; and

: Increasingly common in new and retrofitted metro systems, these are separate doors that act as a safety barrier between the platform and the tracks; and Trains without human operators, akin to the system built in Dubai.

The order for 75 sets of three-car trains, which will be supplied by Kinki Sharyo Co., is described as “fully automated” and “driverless.”

In addition to Kinki Sharyo, Thales and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, the full consortium – which will also be responsible for maintaining the system for 20 years after it is completed – includes Mitsubishi Corp. and Hitachi Ltd.

According to Qatar Rail’s website, five companies and joint ventures were invited to bid on the project. Three responded: the winning consortium, German industrial giant Siemens and a JV between Italian transportation firm Ansaldo STS and Spanish railway firm CAF.

Above-ground plans

Separately, another firm announced this weekend that it received a US$79-million contract to act as a project management consultant for the approximately 16km of elevated and ground-level portions of the Doha Metro.

New Jersey-based Louis Berger Egis Rail Joint Venture is already familiar with the project, having previously been named a project management consultant for the Gold Line and major stations in 2012.

The following year, it was commissioned to provide certification services for early enabling works and utility diversions.

The Doha Metro is expected to be fully operational in less than five years. The first phase will consist of four lines:

The Red Line North , running from a connection with Lusail’s light-rail line to Msheireb via West Bay;

, running from a connection with Lusail’s light-rail line to Msheireb via West Bay; The Red Line South, running from Msheireb to Hamad International Airport;

running from Msheireb to Hamad International Airport; The Green Line , running from Al Rayyan Stadium to Msheireb via Education City; and

, running from Al Rayyan Stadium to Msheireb via Education City; and The Gold Line, running from Villaggio Mall to the area around the old Doha International Airport, via Msheireb.

The metro will also connect to two other separate rail projects: The Lusail light-rail line, which contractors say will be operational by 2018 and a long-distance passenger and freight service that will initially run between Education City and Saudi Arabia.

The latter initiative was also supposed to be operational by 2018, but a recent decision by Qatar Rail to restart the prequalification process for would-be contracts is casting doubt upon that timeline.

AIDN Young Achiever of the Year Award - Australian Defence Magazine,"Thu, 12 Feb 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1c3RyYWxpYW5kZWZlbmNlLmNvbS5hdS9uZXdzL2FpZG4teW91bmctYWNoaWV2ZXItb2YtdGhlLXllYXItYXdhcmTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"At the ADM Congress this week, Australian Industry & Defence Network (AIDN) and ADM took the opportunity to announce the winner of the AIDN Young Achiever Award for 2015.

The winner was Tamara Perry of Thales Australia, from the NSW chapter of AIDN.

The state finalists however were an exceptional crop of up and coming Defence professionals. Their details can be found below.

Stephen Bornstein, BAE Systems, AIDN-Vic Finalist

Stephen Bornstein is a Mechanical Engineer – Weapon Systems at BAE Systems in Richmond. Stephen currently works on the mechanical design, manufacture and testing for NULKA and ESSM components.

To combat the asymmetric warfare from enemies such as Islamic State there is a large emphasis on special operations. The defence industry needs to align its products and services with the needs of special operations to ensure the ADF is well equipped for this fight.

Courtney Cole, QinetiQ, AIDN-ACT Finalist

Courtney Cole is a Principal Consultant with QinetiQ in Canberra. Courtney’s experience includes the provision of procurement and contracting support to the LHD SPO where she was a central figure in development and implementing the LHD sustainment strategy.

Courtney believes that the Defence industry continues to struggle with the retention of corporate knowledge, experience and technical know-how needed to support Defence in reaching its strategic goals and political objectives.

Fiona Yue Kan, TAE Gas Turbines, AIDN-Qld Finalist

Fiona Yue Kan is the Project Manager for TAE's Royal Malaysian Air Force Rolls-Royce Adour Engine, Test Cell Data Acquisition System and Facility Controls System Upgrade at Amberley, following her graduation with a Bachelor of Aerospace Engineering and a Bachelor of Science.

Fiona believes that one of the main issues facing the defence industry is the challenge of being able to employ sufficient people with engineering and/or other technical skills.

Tamara Perry, Thales Australia AIDN-NSW Finalist

Tamara Perry is an Acoustics Engineer for Underwater Systems with Thales, at Rydalmere. Her role includes prototyping and testing transducers.

The ability of Defence to meet its own Capability Plan is a persistent and continuing concern. Another key issue is the stifling of technical knowledge and innovation in Australia. There is a possibility of future projects looking off-shore for capability requirements, and of a ‘hiatus’ in design and manufacturing sectors that will cause a significant loss of skills.

Chanelle Pogas, General Dynamics Land Systems, AIDN-SA (DTC) Finalist

Chanelle Pogas is a Human Resources & Administration Manager at General Dynamics Land Systems, Australia. Her role is to maintain and improve an effective HR system, taking into account the operating environment of GDLS-A and legislative compliance covering all HR functions.

GDLS initially didn’t have dedicated WHS resources. Chanelle identified these issues and presented a business case to management and was given approval to recruit more resources. These resources were allocated and Chanelle and the team have worked together to overcome the challenges.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999224066734314}",neutral,0.999224066734314,0
"Radar failure threatens aviation safety - Truth, for its own sake. - New Era","Mon, 16 Feb 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3ZXJhbGl2ZS5uYS9wb3N0cy9yYWRhci1mYWlsdXJlLXRocmVhdGVucy1hdmlhdGlvbi1zYWZldHnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Mathias Haufiku WINDHOEK – Namibia’s radar system, which tracks the movement of planes and on which air traffic controllers provide surveillance service, is said to be failing. The secondary surveillance radar system’s dual referencing beacon, which consists of twin-transponders, is said to be failing, with a persistent fault detected in the last two years, but no concrete actions have yet been taken, according to documents shared with New Era. However, the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Works and Transport, Peter Mwatile, said he was not aware of such a failure when approached for comment last week. “I am not aware of the situation because it has not been reported to me yet,” said Mwatile. Communication memos shared with New Era indicate that besides the beacon being sent back to the manufacturers in France for repairs on two occasions, an engineer was also in Namibia in late January this year to repair the faulty component that was repaired in France. The repaired component only worked for some weeks before it failed again. Sources say although the situation could land the country in trouble with international aviation watchdogs for not rectifying the situation, it seems the Civil Aviation Directorate is yet to inform government of the precarious situation. According to international standards, if the self-check units of a monitoring system have malfunctioned, the radar should be switched off and air traffic controllers should revert to procedural control. Deputy Director of Aviation Administration and Navigation in the Directorate of Civil Aviation, Tobias Gunzel, pleaded ignorance on the matter and requested New Era to send questions to Mwatile for an official response. Communication memos indicate that the beacons have not been operational for about two weeks now and that both of them have never been functional simultaneously since the system was launched in 2011. In the documents, Gunzel downplays the significance of the secondary radar beacon saying, “It is considered sufficient to monitor the secondary radar’s performance using the primary radar.” Gunzel’s assertions in the e-mail memos contradict his statements in the media on the importance of the secondary radar where he said: “On top of the primary is a smaller secondary radar referred to as the intelligent radar, which sends out a signal that is received by the aircraft, and the aircraft then inserts its information and sends it back. The intelligent radar works with codes. Therefore, if the aircraft has a radio failure it sends a specific code to inform the air traffic controllers based at Eros airport.” Although Gunzel acknowledges problems with the monitoring device of the secondary radar, he asserts that the windhoek terminal area is still covered by the primary radar as well as the Wider Movement Area Multilateration System. Aviation sources say the beacon was sent to France more than once for repairs and that a French engineer came to Namibia last year to rectify the situation but the outcome was not positive. “The units have been reset several times but then they only work for a while and malfunction again,” aviation experts in the ministry say. Government signed the N$175 million agreement in 2009 for the installation of surveillance radar with the Thales. The primary and secondary radar systems have since been installed at the Hosea Kutako International Airport. The primary radar is used to detect any aircraft or moving object in the air while the secondary radar obtains information such as altitude and speed from the aircraft. This information is then combined and the air traffic controller sees all the information on a screen. During the signing ceremony, government said Thales will train locals as well as make use of the military-owned August 26 Holdings for the maintenance work, but it seems that has not been done adequately because engineers had to be flown in last month to attend to the problem. contacted Thales South Africa on Friday afternoon for a comment, although the company promised to revert back, it failed to uphold its promise.
