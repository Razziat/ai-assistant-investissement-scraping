The trial was successful: all launched missiles performed a successful intercept. In the first part of the trial, a Banshee drone was eliminated by a missile launched by the new Royal Danish Navy Frigate HDMS Peter Willemoes (Iver Huitfeldt-class) .

With pinpoint accuracy APAR guided the missile to the target, resulting in a successful threat elimination. Subsequently, three Banshee drones were launched simultaneously, necessitating the launch and guidance of three missiles. Thanks to APAR’s unique Interrupted Continuous Wave Illumination technology, enabling the simultaneous guidance of multiple missiles to various targets; this part of the trial was also successful.



The trials were performed at the Missile Test Range off the Scottish coast in the Atlantic Ocean. HDMS Peter Willemoes was escorted by HDMS Niels Juel.



Gerben Edelijn, Thales Nederland’s CEO says: “This excellent result proves that Thales’ APAR and the unique technology are the standard in missile guidance.”



HDMS Peter Willemoes is one of the three Iver Huitfeldt class air defence frigates of the Royal Danish Navy. The other two ships are HDMS Iver Huitfeldt and HDMS Niels Juel. These ships share their Anti-Warfare suite with the Royal Netherlands Navy’s De Zeven Provincien-class frigates and the German Navy’s Sachsen-class frigates. The Thales sensors of this suite include the long range surveillance radar SMART-L and the multi-function radar APAR."

The MUSIS project was approved by the European Defence Agency (EDA) in March 2009. Image courtesy of ESA. OCCAR-EA placed the MUSIS federating activities Phase B-1 contract with Thales Alenia Space Italia, EADS Astrium France, and Thales Alenia Space France in July 2011.

The multinational space-based imaging system (MUSIS) is a next generation programme designed to provide space based imaging capabilities for surveillance, reconnaissance, intelligence and earth observation operations of the European military. The system is scheduled to begin services from 2015.

The MUSIS programme was initially launched by six European Union member states, including Belgium, Germany, Greece, France, Italy and Spain, while Poland also joined the programme in December 2010. It will allow the nations involved in the programme to share imagery from several military satellites using a common, generic user ground segment (UGS), as per the agreed rules.

The programme is being implemented in two phases – MUSIS Phase B1 and MUSIS Phase B2. It is intended to transmit requested images from space components, including two optical (optical space component or CSO and Ingenio) and two radar (SARah and CSG) systems to a common ground-user segment using next-generation technologies.

The CSO, Ingenio (SeoSat), SARah and CSG will succeed the French Hélios II, German SAR-Lupe and Italian COSMO-SkyMed systems.

MUSIS programme development details

The architecture and feasibility studies of the MUSIS programme were launched in December 2006 and submitted in 2007. Development of the project began with the Besoin Operationalle Commun agreement signed by the five nations (France, Germany, Belgium, Spain and Greece) in November 2008.

MUSIS was approved as a Category B programme by the European Defence Agency (EDA) in March 2009. The Polish Ministry of National Defence signed a contract in December 2010 to support the project.

""The Polish Ministry of National Defence signed a contract in December 2010 to support the project.""

In May 2011, France and Italy signed the programme decision for the MUSIS federating activities (FA) programme which is managed by Organization for Joint Armament Co-operation (OCCAR-EA). The MUSIS FA will allow the two countries to access optical and radar images produced by the CSO and CSG systems. The nations also agreed in June 2012 to launch MUSIS preliminary definition phase.

OCCAR-EA awarded MUSIS FA Phase B1 contract to Thales Alenia Space Italia, EADS Astrium France, and Thales Alenia Space France, in July 2011, to carry out a study phase to define a Common Interoperability Layer (CIL) between the Ground Segments of the COSMO-SkyMed second generation and the CSO system. The study was completed in August 2012.

Airbus Defence and Space secured a €300m ($410m approximately) contract from the DGA, in January 2014, to build the UGS for the MUSIS programme.

Composante spatiale optique (CSO)

The CSO system integrating optical and radar space components is the French government’s contribution to the MUSIS configuration. The French national centre for space studies (CNES) is responsible to carry out the over €1bn CSO project.

""The French national centre for space studies (CNES) is responsible to carry out the over €1bn CSO project. ""

DGA and the CNES signed a protocol for the design of the CSO project in May 2009. It will consist of two satellites, the first of which is expected to be launched in December 2016.

CNES awarded a €66m ($81m) contract to EADS Astrium in June 2010 for the design, technological developments and management of the CSO project. France will lead the CSO HR and THR satellites, which will be placed in a Sun-synchronous orbit.

Astrium secured a €795m ($1.05bn) contract from DGA, in December 2010, for the development of two CSO satellites to replace the Helios 2 military space observation system. The contract also includes an option for the third satellite. The satellites will identify smaller targets and provide more images of the crisis zones.

Thales Alenia Space España secured a €11m ($15.5m) contract in June 2011 to design, develop, produce, qualify, and supply electronics for the focal plane of the optical instrument (FPPB) and the service module (MSI) for the first two CSO satellites.

Thales Alenia Space France will deliver optical payload for the system. It will provide Astrium with solar arrays, X-band downlink sub-system, and encryption unit.

Sofradir was awarded a four-year contract in October 2011, to supply infrared detectors for the engineering and flight model phases of the CSO satellites. Deliveries are expected to be completed by 2015.

In March 2012, Astrium secured a $267m, six-year through life-support agreement with the French DGA for the maintenance and upgrade of ground-based user segment for the Helios 2 military reconnaissance satellite and its successor system, CSO."
Casa Grande: Rotterdam Review - Hollywood Reporter,"Mon, 24 Feb 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9uZXdzL2dlbmVyYWwtbmV3cy9jYXNhLWdyYW5kZS1yb3R0ZXJkYW0tcmV2aWV3LTY4MjUzOS_SAVxodHRwczovL3d3dy5ob2xseXdvb2RyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vbmV3cy9nZW5lcmFsLW5ld3MvY2FzYS1ncmFuZGUtcm90dGVyZGFtLXJldmlldy02ODI1MzkvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The travails of a Rio de Janeiro 17-year-old are used as a prism to explore wider issues facing 21st-century Brazil in Casa Grande, a confident and quietly promising feature debut from director/co-writer Fellipe Barbosa. Showcasing a fine, consistently believable and sympathetic central performance from big-screen newcomer Thales Cavalcanti as the conflicted Jean, the picture premiered in competition at Rotterdam and will reap further festival bookings over the coming months–boosted by a general vogue for all things Brazilian during the summer it hosts the soccer World Cup. Domestic prospects are dicey for a film which features some recognizable faces from the world of telenovela but in terms of execution falls somewhere between arthouse and mainstream modes.

It’s much less edgy and confrontational than the latest Brazilian export to make international festival waves, Kleber Mendonca Filho‘s Recife-set Neighboring Sounds (2012), although both films were shot by DP Pedro Sotero. The approach here is steady and conventional, Barbosa’s screenplay (co-written with Karen Sztajnberg) functioning primarily as a bildungsroman profile of the thoughtful, artistically-included, hormonally-volatile Jean (Cavalcanti). He and his younger sister Nathalie live with their ostensibly successful parents Hugo (Marcello Novaes) and Sonia (Suzana Pires) in a tastefully opulent, gated villa in the Rio suburbs – the “big house” of the title.

But in Brazil the term “casa grande” has other connotations besides simply size, harking back to the sugar-plantations which provided much of the nation’s wealth in previous epochs. Barbosa explicitly nods to Gilberto Freyre‘s classic 1933 text Casa Grande e Senzala, known in English as The Masters and the Slaves, which dealt with racial and economic divides in this supposedly ‘melting-pot’ culture. In the 21st century, slavery may no longer exist but Brazil’s wealth disparities are notoriously stark, with issues of race seldom far from the surface.

These are dramatized here via Jean’s enforced adaptation to his family’s straitened economic circumstances. The father-surrogate servant who previously drove him to work (in one of the family’s four autos!) is “let go,” meaning Jean has to get the bus to his exclusive Catholic boys’ school. Using public transport brings him into contact–and then a relationship–with Luiza (Bruna Amaya), a spirited lass who, if she isn’t quite from the favela, is certainly from much lower down on the social ladder, a mixed-race beneficiary of the affirmative-action quota policies recently signed into Brazilian law.

Transitioning to features after 2007’s multi-award-winning short Salt Kiss and 2011’s New York-set documentary Laura, Barbosa’s attempts to incorporate discussion of controversial matters as the quota-system veers towards the preachy at times. And there’s something simplistic about the way he contrasts the stultifying, hypocritical, appearances-maintaining dullmess of Jean’s pseudo-European family–his mother, who tutors French at her home, has given her offspring Gallic names–with the lively, forro-dancing demi-monde occupied by their sensual, salt-of-the-earth employees in their humble abodes just down the road.

Barbosa’s debt to the world of telenovela is obvious, not just in casting-choices like selecting small-screen veteran Novaes as the milquetoast dad, also in its concentration on the tricky relations between masters and servants in an advanced 21st century economy. The results, however, feels more like a classy pilot for a serial than a properly distanced commentary on the form itself–a trick pulled off by Chico Teixeira in his Sao Paulo-set Alice’s House (2007). Regardless of such cavils, Cavalcanti–an occasional TV performer whose considerable musical gifts the guitar-strumming Jean shares–makes for a consistently engaging and intriguing protagonist. As this Carioca cousin of Jean-Pierre Leaud‘s Antoine Doinel, he strikes just the right balance between confident swagger and callow insecurity, emotions constantly brewing behind a perpetual mask of foxy watchfulness.

Thales to upgrade Baku metro - AzerNews.Az,"Mon, 03 Feb 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiK2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF6ZXJuZXdzLmF6L2J1c2luZXNzLzY0MDE2Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"3 February 2014 18:56 (UTC+04:00)

By Nigar Orujova

A French company is set to modernize several Baku metro stations. The Director for the Development of Business in Security and Transport section of Thales Company said: ""The company will modernize equipment in five metro stations across Baku.""

Addressing reporters in Paris, Sergei Romanets went on saying that: ""Metro in Azerbaijan has seen rapid developments in recent years. This has prompted Thales to plan for further developments of Baku metro stations.""

""Thales has already started the project. Preliminary works and researches were carried out on five stations from Nizami to Me'mar Ajami station back in 2012,"" he added.

According to the company's official, Thales is also planning to set up a depot at Darnagul.

The company is to replace the existing relay equipment with a modern microprocessor centralization (MOC) system at these stations. In general, the work is expected to take from 12 to 18 months.

""Now we are ready for the implementation phase. That's to say, for the installation of new equipment. Currently we are awaiting approval of the budget,"" Romanets said.

""The work on installation of new electronic equipment at the depot is expected to start this year,"" Romanets said.

Thales also intends to install new CBTC technology (system to control the movement of trains) at the stations on Baku Metro's purple line, which is under construction. It is necessary to carry out a preliminary design as part of the CBTC installation.

""Agreements on this issue have already been reached and it is expected to be signed soon,"" he said.

Thales Company is a global leader at the markets of aerospace, defense and transport technology. It is also a leader in the sphere of ensuring security. The company has offices in 65 countries.

The 46-year old Baku Metro operates 23 stations in two lines - Red and Green with the total length of 34.6 kilometers. The number of subway lines is planned to increase from two to five, its length up to 119 kilometers, and the number of stations up to 76 by 2030.

Over the next five years, Baku Metro plans to construct 11 new stations. Eight new stations will be operational in the next three years and then three more stations will be commissioned. Five stations will become operational as a Violet Line, while the remaining six will continue the Green Line.

Baku Metro completed the construction work on the Avtovagzal and Memar Ajami-2 stations in 2013. New subways are planned to be open in the capital in 2014."

"Pvt sector firms gain ground in defence equipment market - BusinessToday - Issue Date: Mar 02, 2014 - Business Today","Fri, 14 Feb 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzdG9kYXkuaW4vbWFnYXppbmUvZmVhdHVyZXMvc3RvcnkvcHJpdmF0ZS1zZWN0b3ItbWFudWZhY3R1cmluZy1vZi1kZWZlbmNlLWVxdWlwbWVudC0xMzQxNzQtMjAxNC0wMi0xNNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In 2012, Centum Group, a Bangalore-based provider of aerospace and defence electronics, broke into the select group of contractors supplying to US-based defence solutions provider Thales. Centum became the first Indian company to ink a sweeping pact with Thales. It can now supply directly to any of the 70-plus sub-groups that make up Thales's diversified business, from military communications in combat management systems for ships to integrated air defence systems for the US military.

Separately, in late 2011, Tata Power Strategic Engineering Division (SED) - an unlisted Tata group company - won a $186 million (Rs 950 crore) contract from the Indian Army to manufacture two electronic warfare systems to be deployed in mountainous regions. Tata Power SED narrowly beat Israeli firm Elta to bag the deal. A few months earlier, Tata Power SED had also won a $260 million (around Rs 1,170 crore) contract to modernise 30 Indian Air Force bases. It was preferred over Selex ES, an Italian arm of Finmeccanica which also owns AgustaWestland, most recently in the news for the cancelled deal to supply choppers to India.

Indeed, as the above examples illustrate, Indian private sector companies are making inroads in the defence equipment market - both globally and locally. For long considered a set of obscure contractors making small parts, Indian manufacturers are coming of age. ""In the last three years, Indian private companies have developed adequate real capabilities,"" says G. Balachandran, Consulting Fellow at the Institute of Defence Studies and Analysis.

Besides Centum and Tata Power SED, several small companies - such as Dynamatic Technologies, Avasarala Technologies, DefSys, Ravilla and Taneja Aerospace - have in the past three years acquired advanced technological capabilities and are just a step or two away from creating whole systems, as opposed to parts.



Step by step

In defence contracting, there are three distinct phases of manufacturing. The first, ""build-to-print"", is the most basic capability. Here contractors manufacture according to designs provided by an external client. In 2010, 92 per cent of the private sector's order inflow in India was build-to-print, which requires the least technical proficiency. In 2014, experts estimate it to have shrunk to about 80 per cent of the orders.

The second, ""build to specifications"", is where the executor of the project can own intellectual property. Here, the client comes with an idea of a product, and asks the executor if it can be manufactured. Often, these products require developing new intellectual property that may belong to the Indian contractor. The third part is developing products from scratch, either to create new capabilities for a particular defence need or upgrade an existing product. Indian manufacturers have now started building capabilities in the second phase, say defence experts.

""In the last three years, the build to specifications part, which requires significant capabilities, has increased for India's private sector companies,"" says Rahul Gangal, Principal, Roland Berger Strategy Consultants. And that is where some Indian companies have started getting large value contracts.The Indian private sector is estimated to have a relatively small share - about five per cent - of the Indian defence equipment market. Some large volume contracts are with the nine defence public sector undertakings (PSUs), which account for about 20 per cent of the market. Over 70 per cent of the equipment needs is met through imports.

India's total defence imports were a mammoth Rs 40,000 crore in 2013 and it is a big domestic market for private companies to tap into, says Nidhi Goyal, Director, Deloitte India. More so, with the Indian government stressing indigenous development and self reliance in production in the defence procurement policy announced in 2013. Between 2004 and 2013, the government issued 209 licences to Indian companies to manufacture defence equipment domestically. The rate of granting licences has increased over the last five years, points out Goyal.

Globally too there is a big opportunity for Indian companies. This is partly due to the labour arbitrage opportunities in India. Indian companies have also developed the ability to manufacture accurately to specifications, particularly in aerospace, metalworking and electronics, say experts. Today, a $7 billion to $8 billion global market exists for the Indian private players, says Gangal. In 2011, private Indian companies exported defence equipment worth $2 billion, up from $73 million in 2007.

Indeed, in many ways the government's policy for the defence sector is similar to that of South Korea. The emergence of South Korea as a defence manufacturing powerhouse, particularly in naval defence and aerospace, is based as much on its industrial ability as its policy. In a planned way, the country has targeted niche segments and has managed to secure orders from partners overseas in areas where they need to develop expertise.

This has borne fruit. In the 10 months ending November 2013, South Korea exported $2.6 billion worth of arms, up from $250 million in 2006. This will further grow, since last year India alone signed a $1.2 billion contract with the Korean Kangnam Corporation for eight mine-counter-measure vessels, along with a transfer of technology condition.

Like South Korea, India is trying to ensure that more technology is either developed in India - particularly in select sectors such as aerospace - or remains in the country after the technology is imported and products designed or built.Indian private companies are looking to make the most of the opportunity. The Tata group, for instance, has ramped up operations. Tata Power SED is the only company in India to have an in-house ballistic test facility, used to test ammunition. ""Tata Power SED has the ability to design, develop, manufacture, assemble and upgrade mission critical systems in seven core areas of defence,"" says an emailed response from the company.

Tata Power SED is also a prime contractor for the Ministry of Defence for indigenous defence production. It has secured orders for Pinaka Multi Barrel Rocket Launcher, Akash Army Launcher and Integrated EW System for the Indian Army and the Akash Air Force Launcher for the Indian Air Force.

Bharat Forge too has set its sights high and is aiming to become a major player in the artillery and specialised vehicles segment. ""Our objective is to create artillery systems, and eventually complete land systems,"" says Amit Kalyani, Executive Director, Bharat Forge.

Defence projects have a very high gestation period, says Centum's Chairman and Managing Director Apparao Mallavarapu. He spent between Rs 20 crore and Rs 25 crore in 2006 to set up capabilities for defence. It was then primarily a supplier to ISRO for its space programmes with annual revenues of about Rs 100 crore. In 2013/14, 25 per cent of Centum's revenues have come from defence and space projects. In the nine months ending December 2013, revenues were at Rs 313.4 crore. It was 10 per cent of Rs 257.4 crore revenues in 2011/12. ""I had no expectations five to seven years ago,"" says Mallavarapu. Dynamatic Technologies, the Bangalore headquartered company which makes assemblies of vertical fins for Sukhoi 30 Mk-I fighter bombers, too has seen a robust growth in revenues of late - from Rs 51.72 crore in 2011/12 to Rs 64.66 crore in 2012/13.

Balachandran says Indian companies have taken big strides forward technologically in recent years and can now match international standards. But the problem isn't getting contracts. It is in doing original R&D, and thereby creating completely new capabilities. The Indian private sector can build over 80 per cent of the equipment required for naval defence and 70 to 75 per cent of the equipment required for the army, says Gangal. Most of these capabilities are concentrated in small and medium sized companies, adds Gangal. ""Big boys aren't necessarily the bigger players in the sector. People don't go by name here. Federal conglomerates are not preferred,"" he says.

The contract was signed by CAAP Director General William K. Hotchkiss lll and Raymond Lions, manager of the Thales Australia Limited Philippine branch office who also signed for Pacific Hemisphere.

The upgrade will cover the existing area control center and is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of this year.

CAAP said the improvement is essential because the P13 billion next-generation satellite-based Communications, Navigation, Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) project that was signed during the previous administration was delayed and would not be in place until the end of 2015.

The aviation regulator said the absence of a ready substitute is a cause for worry for CAAP because if the Eurocat bogs down, the operational load of air traffic will be affected and flight disruptions will have an effect on Philippine airspace.

By adopting the CNS/ATM technology program, the Philippines will put the country at par with the rest of the world.

Thales Australia is a conglomerate that makes a wide range of products from aerospace technologies, security systems and solutions to arms and advanced military equipment.

Its TopSky air traffic management system ensures the safety of operators and passengers at a time when soaring growth in air traffic poses a range of complex technical challenges.

The company says in its website that technologies supplied by its global center of excellence, based in Melbourne, are deployed in Australia and across Asia and the Pacific region.

Details about its Philippine partner, Makati-based Pacific Hemisphere, are scanty and efforts by PortCalls to talk to a responsible officer proved futile with staff saying the managing director is out of town.

The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has agreed to give signatories such as the Philippines until 2016 to adopt the satellite-based CNS/ATM system, although many countries around the world have already been using it for the last few years.

CAAP said the technology works by having aircraft transponders receive satellite signals and using transponder transmissions to determine the precise locations of aircraft in the sky.

The CNS/ATM technology includes a computer-based flight data processing system that will enable aircraft operators to meet their planned departure and arrival times and adhere to their preferred flight profiles with minimum constraints and without compromising agreed levels of safety."
Hawkei leads the charge at V8 Utes finale - carsales.com.au - carsales.com.au,"Sat, 15 Feb 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcnNhbGVzLmNvbS5hdS9lZGl0b3JpYWwvZGV0YWlscy9oYXdrZWktbGVhZHMtdGhlLWNoYXJnZS1hdC12OC11dGVzLWZpbmFsZS00MTY1NC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Forget run-of-the-mill pace cars, the thunderous Hawkei led the field for the final round of the Auto One V8 Utes Racing Series at Sydney Olympic Park

The military-vehicle genre seems well-removed from the world of motorsport, but the Thales Hawkei PMV (Protected Military Vehicle) still proved an attention-grabbing ‘pace car’ for the parade laps prior to the final round of the 2013 Auto One V8 Utes Racing Series at Sydney Olympic Park.

Touted as a showcase for homegrown engineering (even as the Australian car industry is on the verge of grinding to a halt), the imposing Hawkei was designed to fulfil the Australian Defence Force’s requirement for a light armoured patrol vehicle to replace some of its Land Rover Perentie variants.

Speed and potency are said to be among its hallmarks, as it’s billed as a highly mobile, highly protected, seven-tonne vehicle with built-in systems to allow it to be used as a fighting platform.

Thales joined forces with Boeing Australia, Plasan (Israel) and PAC Group to develop the Hawkei, for which the key criteria were off-road mobility, integrated vehicle electronic architecture and the ability to carry substantial payloads.

It also needed to offer high levels of protection against land mines, improvised explosive devices and ballistic weapons while being light enough to be air transported by military helicopters.

Propulsion for the Hawkei comes from a 3.2-litre turbo-diesel engine that sends 200kW and 610Nm to all four wheels via ZF 6HP280 transmission and a two-speed transfer case, endowing the vehicle with the required speed (it can hit 130km/h) and mobility.

Interestingly, the transmission reportedly belongs to the same family used in the Ford Falcon and Territory.

Capable of hauling six crew members up to 600km, the Hawkei can be used for troop movement, command and control, electronic warfare, liaison, surveillance and reconnaissance.

V8 Supercar star Craig Lowndes, the ZF Services Australia ambassador, was quoted as saying, “It's amazing what we can achieve here in Australia, our manufacturing industry is alive and kicking.”

The Hawkei is offered in three configurations – Special Operations Vehicle, Border Protection and Utility – adding to its versatility. In the last of these modes it can haul a payload of 3000kg and can accommodate four 1000mm × 1200mm NATO standard military pallets or a single tricon (one-third ISO 20ft) container.

Its weapons system options include up to 12.7mm guns or 40mm grenade systems in various mounts with a remote-operated option.

The Hawkei is currently in the prototype testing and development phase, which if successful will see upwards of 1300 vehicles produced at the Thales base in Bendigo.
