ODAS was set up at the request of the French government to promote international sales of defence, security and other advanced technology products and services. The company focuses on both government-to-government and commercial contracts. ODAS's shareholders include the French state and the country's leading defence and security contractors.



The deal which should take effect as early as September involves DCNS, Thales and MBDA.



We can assume that the deal involves significant upgrades to both kind of ships, with the fitting of new Combat Management Systems, new Anti-ship and SAM systems as well as new sensors and other electronics."
