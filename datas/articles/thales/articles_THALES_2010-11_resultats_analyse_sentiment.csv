Thales Alenia Sees Opportunity in Space Station's New Chapter - SpaceNews,"Mon, 29 Nov 2010 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS90aGFsZXMtYWxlbmlhLXNlZXMtb3Bwb3J0dW5pdHktc3BhY2Utc3RhdGlvbnMtbmV3LWNoYXB0ZXIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"TURIN, Italy — Thales Alenia Space’s space infrastructure facility is negotiating the decline in contract volume following completion of the international space station’s construction and setting its sights on fresh work as part of the station’s prolonged operational life, company officials said Nov. 24.

Extending the life of the orbital complex by at least five years, to 2020, holds out the promise that the company’s 1,000-person site here will be able to leverage its expertise in large payload modules for additional government and commercial contracts.

The idea, company officials said, is to use each contract as a door to open further work. Building the shell of Europe’s Columbus space station laboratory led to work for NASA providing space station connecting nodes and three models of a U.S space shuttle-launched multipurpose logistics module, which has flown 10 times.

That created an opening to provide the structure for Europe’s Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV) cargo carrier, which is destroyed on atmospheric re-entry after each mission. One ATV has flown, a second is scheduled for launch in February and three other ATVs are in preparation.

On the strength of its ATV and other station work, Thales Alenia Space Italy in 2009 won a contract valued at 180 million euros ($245 million) to provide Orbital Sciences of Dulles, Va., with nine Cygnus cargo modules. Orbital is using Cygnus to provide station cargo under contract to NASA.

The first Cygnus canister is scheduled for launch aboard Orbital’s new Taurus 2 rocket in October 2011.

“This contract [with Orbital] is strategic for the company,” said Luigi Maria Quaglino, Thales Alenia Space’s senior vice president for space infrastructures and transportation. “We were selected for the work not because of any government-to-government agreement or as part of a barter arrangement with NASA. We were selected because of the quality of our work, and we know the ‘Buy America’ pressure in the United States.”

Quaglino said the contract with Orbital — the first Cygnus module will be shipped to the United States in February, with the ninth and last to be delivered in 2015 — allows the company to present to the Italian government concrete evidence of the snowball effect of government investment.

The nine Cygnus modules were placed under contract before the space station partners agreed to keep the facility operating until 2020. The European Space Agency (ESA) has yet to endorse the extension, although ESA and other European government officials say it is a foregone conclusion. What is less clear is what ESA governments will do at the station with the five extra years, knowing that doing more means paying more.

Absent a complete reversal of NASA policy or a major anomaly at Orbital Sciences, the station’s extension almost certainly will result in more Cygnus orders, Thales Alenia Space officials said. Dino Brondolo, the company’s director of space infrastructures, said that for now, Orbital and Thales Alenia Space are focused on the first demonstration launch, and that a contract for new Cygnus modules after 2015 can wait until 2013.

Roberto Provera, Cygnus program manager at Thales Alenia Space, said a NASA-Orbital Sciences team is expected here the week of Nov. 30 for a demonstration of Cygnus cargo loading and unloading procedures. The standard-size Cygnus, to be used for the demonstration mission and the first two commercial launches, can carry 2,000 kilograms of cargo. The enhanced Cygnus, to be used for the six follow-on launches, can carry 2,700 kilograms of cargo. Provera said the cargo demonstration is meant to validate future Cygnus missions carrying closer to the maximum payload complement, and will not have an effect on the date of the inaugural launch.

Thales Alenia Space has been able to use its ATV experience to find weight savings for Cygnus without compromising its mission. One example: The aluminum shell is 3 millimeters thick, as opposed to 3.2 millimeters thick for the ATV, without sacrificing resistance to micrometeorites. The weight savings is equivalent to some 50 kilograms.

ESA’s ATV plans are unclear. Europe is obliged to pay 8.3 percent of the station’s common operating costs, and can make good on this by sending cash to NASA or by providing in-kind services, including ATV launches and other station-related resources that NASA wants. Beyond its pro rata share of station utilities costs, ESA is free to invest as it wishes in the station.

The Italian government recently traded a modified logistic module for a future flight to the station of an Italian astronaut. The module is an enhanced version of the Leonardo module that has visited the station inside the space shuttle. It has been upgraded to become a permanent part of the station and is scheduled for launch aboard NASA’s next shuttle flight, in December. “This is like getting 70 cubic meters of storage space for the station, with minimal development,” Quaglino said.

Brondolo said Thales Alenia Space assumes ESA will continue to provide ATV launches to the station in partial payment of the NASA bill. But ESA has yet to confirm a sixth ATV order, and plans to upgrade ATV to enable it to return cargo to Earth appear to be on hold.

Similarly, a contract to retrofit the three ATVs still in the factory to enable them to carry more cargo has not been fully approved, although preliminary work has begun. Brondolo said the retrofit includes replacing the ATV’s outer shell with lighter-weight Kevlar fiber to protect against debris and meteorites, and changing out heavy payload racks with lighter models. The total weight saving: about 300 kilograms.

“When you consider that the cost of putting a kilogram of payload into orbit is between $30,000 and $40,000, this may be viewed as substantial,” Brondolo said.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9988663196563721}",neutral,0.9988663196563721,0
ADA fires Starstreak - defenceWeb,"Wed, 24 Nov 2010 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuY2V3ZWIuY28uemEvbGFuZC9sYW5kLWxhbmQvYWRhLWZpcmVzLXN0YXJzdHJlYWsv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"104 Battery of 10 Air Defence Regiment has fired an undisclosed number of Thales Starstreak at a firing camp at the Overberg Test Range near Cape Town to allow its operators to develop experience in firing live missiles.

The missiles were fired against the indigenously manufactured BAE Systems Land Systems Dynamics Locats (low-cost aerial target system) aerial targets. Thales Defence Systems, which supported the exercise, says in a media statement the Air Defence Artillery “took the opportunity to conduct day and night firings, introducing their new Starstreak thermal imager to provide a full 24-hour air defence capability.

“The success of the camp, underlined by an unprecedented number of target kills, is even more impressive given that the Locats targets destroyed were totally un-enhanced, proving Starstreak’s capability against unmanned air vehicle targets,” the statement added. Locats has a maximum speed of 310 km/hr, a wingspan of 3.2m and length of 2.9m.

SA ordered two Thales Page continuous-wave (CW) low-observable battery air defence local warning radars, eight Lightweight Multiple Launchers (LML) as well as about 100 VSHORAD (very short range air defence) high-velocity missiles in December 2002. At the time Armscor in a statement said the cost was R796 700 389 and deliveries would be complete in 36 months. It was reported in October 2007 that Starstreak missiles cost about R1 million each and that Guardian had by then cost R801 million. The battery that can be parachute dropped also includes two two radars with a 20km range. Denel, the Guardian systems integrator, credits the VSHORAD missiles with a range of 5km (Thales says 7km).

Speaking from the range Lt Col Jacques Baird, Chief of Staff of the ADA, said: “I am delighted with the performance of the Starstreak system and of course our operators. Indeed, at one stage I thought that we would run out of targets before the end of our camp.”

ADA Formation General Officer Commanding Brigadier General Jabu Mbuli added that if “this camp has proved anything it is that Starstreak can defeat a wide variety of air targets, both the traditional and the emerging small low-infrared signature threats. We spent quite some time evalu-ating various missile systems as our ground-based air-defence (GBAD) solution and what we have witnessed at this exercise clearly demonstrates that we made the right choice.”

Starstreak represents the cornerstone of the success of phase one of the GBAD project. “Our relationship with Thales is first class,” said Hanlo Pretorius GBADS Programme Manager of Armscor. “From the moment the contract was signed we have formed a partnership to deliver the best product and service to the user and I have no doubt this teamwork will continue to bring benefits.”

Christian Lamoureux, CEO of Thales South Africa, noted “It is extremely pleasing to be able to support a successful firing camp like this, especially against challenging targets like these. Once again Starstreak has demonstrated its unique capability and why customers worldwide are showing a great deal of interest in the system. I look forward to a long and successful relationship with the Armed Forces in South Africa for many years to come.”

Starstreak was designed to counter low-flying high-performance aircraft and helicopters. It employs semi-automatic command line of sight guidance consisting of a stabilised tracking system and an automatic guidance system. While the operator tracks the target using the stabilised tracking system, a laser beam for missile guidance is transmitted along the target sight line. The system compensates for crosswinds and low-level targets and a lead-angle is automatically generated to launch the missile ahead of crossing targets.

In its simplest form, Starburst is a man-portable, shoulder-launched system consisting of an aiming unit and a missile. The missile is contained in a canister that acts as a recoilless launcher when firing takes place. The aiming unit is clipped on to the canister and together they provide the firing and guidance control for the missile. At the end of the engagement, the aiming unit is quickly detached, the used canister discarded and a new canister fitted for the next engagement. The system can be operated by a single person. However, a second person reduces reaction time.

Armscor in March 2007 told Parliament that when finally delivered at the end of November 2009, the project would be 54 months over deadline. Armscor told MPs the project was extensively delayed by problems with subcontracts with local suppliers, by challenges in translating systems specifications and by design shortcomings affecting the thermal imager, radar power supply and radio interface module. As a result, Denel was to pay a R80 million penalty.

Noteworthy is that the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms records SA imported 96 Starstreak missiles in 2005. There are no previous or subsequent references to the Northern Irish-made VSHORAD.

In May 2008 Denel Dynamics CE Jan Wessels said about 30 companies were involved with the project. “The missile and radar are European and the software was written by five companies, some in SA,” says Wessels. “Our job [as prime contractor and systems integrator] is to put it all together to make it work.” Wessels added the delays and problems encountered have made the project one “where you have to grind your teeth”. “There are 32 entities that must deliver. We’ll just have to take the pain until they all do so satisfactorily. Although there is a lot of contractual baggage, we are quite chuffed about progress with the programme.”

Denel Integrates Systems Solutions executive manager Ralph Mills added the first live firings of the Starstreak missile in October 2007 “went very well”. A further set of firings, were scheduled for late 2008 and it was said media would be invited. It is not clear if the firings ever happened.
