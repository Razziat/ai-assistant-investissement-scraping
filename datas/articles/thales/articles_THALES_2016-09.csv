SES enters Ka-band airline connectivity market with Thales Avionics as customer - SpaceNews,"Mon, 12 Sep 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9zZXMtZW50ZXJzLWthLWJhbmQtYWlybGluZS1jb25uZWN0aXZpdHktbWFya2V0LXdpdGgtdGhhbGVzLWF2aW9uaWNzLWFzLWN1c3RvbWVyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Satellite fleet operator SES, in a direct challenge to competitors ViaSat, Eutelsat and Inmarsat, is investing $500 million in a large, all-Ka-band spot beam high-throughput satellite to launch over the Americas in 2020 for aeronautical connectivity and other mobility applications, industry officials said.

Luxembourg-based SES has secured a long-term contract from in-flight entertainment provider Thales Avionics, which will commercialize its FlytLIVE service starting in 2017 using two existing SES satellite before the tailor-made spacecraft, called SES-17, is launched in 2020.

SES and Thales are expected to announce their agreement on Sept. 12 at the World Satellite Business Week conference here, organized by Euroconsult.

Industry officials said SES’s total investment in the system is around $500 million, including the satellite, its launch, the network of ground gateways and insurance.

SES has been hinting for months that it was seeking ways to combine the strengths of its O3b medium-Earth-orbit constellation of high-throughput satellites with the company’s existing fleet of geostationary-orbit satellites.

SES-17 will be built by Thales Alenia Space of France and Italy, which is prime contractor for the 12 existing O3b satellites. The company is under contract for another eight O3b spacecraft.

Officials said SES-17, using all-electric propulsion, will generate 15 kilowatts of power to the payload of 200 Ka-band spot beams at the end of its 15-year service life.

Adding U.S.-based Thales Avionics gives SES the fourth large in-flight-connectivity/entertainment provider. Thales Avionics competitors Gogo, Global Eagle Entertainment and Panasonic Avionics are already large SES customers for Ku-band capacity.

Competitors ViaSat Inc. and Eutelsat are partnering to offer airlines connectivity in the North Atlantic and European air routes, and ViaSat has announced a three-satellite ViaSat-3 constellation for global coverage for 2019. Two of those satellites are under construction.

London-based Inmarsat’s Global Xpress Ka-band broadband capacity is in service through three satellites in geostationary orbit, and Inmarsat is building out an air-to-ground network in Europe to handle demand that is considered too great in that region’s crowded airspace to be handled by satellites alone.

Satellite fleet operator Intelsat, which like SES operates a 50-satellite fleet worldwide, has up to now shared SES’s preference for Ku- rather than Ka-band for high-throughput satellites and is a minor shareholder in the planned OneWeb network of hundreds of satellites in low Earth orbit scheduled to launch by the end of this decade.

SES-17 represents SES’s first all-Ka-band satellite in geostationary orbit. In addition to airline passenger connectivity, the satellite is expected to provide bandwidth for what some officials say to could be an even greater market: the connected aircraft for cockpit and aircraft-maintenance services.

A Boeing 787 aircraft generates more than 30 terabytes of data per month of flying. Airlines are gradually moving from heavy physical flight bags to electronic flight bags.

Industry estimates of how much revenue this could provide to the service providers — fleet operators like SES and the direct airline suppliers like Thales Avionics, Gogo, Global Eagle and Panasonic Avionics.

By some estimates, average annual revenue per commercial aircraft from in-flight connectivity could more than double, to $300,000 per plane, within five years."

HiFiction Thales AV tonearm Page 2 - Stereophile Magazine,"Sat, 17 Sep 2016 14:33:35 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0ZXJlb3BoaWxlLmNvbS9jb250ZW50L2hpZmljdGlvbi10aGFsZXMtYXYtdG9uZWFybS1wYWdlLTLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Rockport's Andy Payor eventually redesigned the 6000, changing its effective vertical mass to get the arm's resonant frequency within the optimal range. But by then I couldn't justify to myself the hassles and tradeoffs inherent in any so-called tangential-tracking arm. I think the amount of distortion added by aand well-designed pivoted arm is lower than what's added by the rest of a typical audio system.

The HiFiction Thales AV

Designed and manufactured by Micha Huber, a fastidious young Swiss mechanical engineer, musician, and watchmaker, the HiFiction Thales AV tonearm ($12,360) offers the promise of a tonearm boasting the advantages of both pivoted and linear tangential-tracking arms, and the disadvantages of neither. He was granted a Swiss patent for the design in 2004.

The arm's geometrical basis is the Thales Circle (footnote 1). As Huber describes it, the design ""reduces the perfectly tangential tracking to pivot points, while the pick-up cartridge is taken and aligned on the Thales Circle."" You can examine the geometry via Huber's explanation and an interactive animation.

Basing a tonearm on the Thales Circle is said by Huber to produce four things: zero tracking error (which is difficult to prove in any way other than the mathematical); minimal friction using traditional pivoted bearings; a short tonearm with little resonance; and symmetrical inertia at the tracking point in all axes. While the principle is not much different from the one that inspired the Garrard Zero 100 all those years ago, the design and construction of the Thales AV is in another league altogether, as you can see in the photo.

The arm itself is relatively short, with a conventional counterweight. At one end, the headshell pivots around a very low-friction, backlash-free bearing weighing a mere 1.62gm. This bearing may look like a simple point of rotation, but it contains 25 individual parts including two ball bearings, each comprising seven tiny balls and a precision adjustment mechanism.

The counterweight end of the arm holds one of the system's two cardanic (gyroscopic) bearings, which use four Vee Jewel bearings, each consisting of a steel shaft with a spherical end held in a conically indented sapphire. When these bearings are properly adjusted, Huber claims that there is no chatter, very low friction, and full control of energy flow. Indeed, the first time I met Huber, in Munich a few years ago, he showed me his bearing and gave it a spin. I don't recall it stopping on its own during the entire time we spoke.

Looking at the picture, you see a thin, two-piece mechanism comprising a long horizontal arm and a shorter vertical arm, attached to the back of the headshell (and the tonearm proper) by a pair of precision sapphire bearings. The horizontal and vertical arms are what maintain the tangency of the stylus to the groove. As the tonearm itself moves across the record, the vertical arm, attached to the horizontal arm with a set of sapphire bearings, acts to compensate for the change in length of the mechanism. It, too, is attached to the main base with a cardanic bearing. Thus, as the complete arm moves in an arc across the record, the headshell, guided by the secondary arm, pivots precisely to maintain groove tangency.

The arm and headshell of the Thales AV are made of aluminum alloyed with magnesium and silica. (The AV stands for ""Aluminum Version."") The Thales Original arm ($13,360) is made of pure magnesium while the bearing parts are plated with gold. The parts are not ""cold-formed"" but cut from large cast blocks that, because the material is not mechanically stressed, is said to produce a more uniform pathway for the dissipation of vibrational energy.

Setup and Adjustments

While the Thales AV's baseplate is fairly standard, the downward travel of the vertical arm means that only turntables with sufficient rear/side clearance can be used (footnote 2). Large-plinthed 'tables will require a clearance hole to be cut in the plinth to accommodate the low-hanging rear cardanic bearing and the antiskating adjustment knob.

The Thales AV provides every adjustment function found on a conventional tonearm, including vertical tracking angle (VTA) and azimuth. The counterweight can be rotatednot to adjust azimuth, as on some unipivots, but to adjust for differences in vertical tracking force (VTF) that can occur with this design as the tonearm travels from the outer to the inner groove areas. You can adjust it for uniform VTF across the entire LP side, or have it automatically slightly increase the tracking force for the more-difficult-to-track inner grooves.

Setting up and using the Thales AV requires some new skills; while learning them, it's best to proceed with caution. HiFiction provides an overhang template similar to those used with conventional pivoted arms. The sliding counterweight makes precise adjustment of VTF less than convenient: a slight nudge can produce a big change in tracking force. You're instructed to adjust the grub screw so that the counterweight can only just be slid, but won't be moved by accident.

That grub screw's location, in a recess near the bottom of the counterweight, on the platter side, makes setting VTF even more difficult. Too tight, and the counterweight won't move; too loose, and it won't stay put. I can't understand why, in what is otherwise a work of precision art, Huber left unaddressed this not overly challenging problem. Once you've set the VTF, you should check it at both the start and end of an LP side. Discrepancies can be adjusted by rotating the counterweight as described in the manual.

A pair of tiny setscrews on the main cardanic bearing's outer ring provides some adjustability of azimuth. While VTA is easily adjusted on the fly by turning a small knurled knob in the tonearm's base (after loosening a setscrew), its location requires you to exercise extreme cautionyou can easily bump the horizontal arm, thus setting off potential stylus-destroying movements of the entire assembly.

MBDA Secures £30M Laser Weapon Contract for UK - Defense News,"Fri, 16 Sep 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS9nbG9iYWwvZXVyb3BlLzIwMTYvMDkvMTYvbWJkYS1zZWN1cmVzLXBzMzBtLWxhc2VyLXdlYXBvbi1jb250cmFjdC1mb3ItdWsv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LONDON — Britain's defense secretary has confirmed that MBDA UK has secured a £30 million (US $40 million) deal to build a laser-directed energy weapon demonstrator.





The Ministry of Defence (MoD) is finalizing the deal with the UK arm of Europe's major missile maker to build a one-off prototype laser weapon, Defence Secretary Michael Fallon told an audience of industry executives, allies and others at an event in London on Friday to launch a new innovation initiative. MBDA won the competition being run by the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory to build the demonstrator several months ago, but the announcement was held up after rival bidder Thales UK lodged a protest against the decision.





The grounds for the protest, or the fact the protest had been lodged, were never made public. The Thales protest was recently rejected, leaving the way open for Fallon to make the announcement.





MBDA will lead a consortium, which includes Qinetiq, Leonardo, GKN, BAE Systems, Marshall Aerospace and Defence, and Arke.





The consortium, known as Dragonfire, beat out rival bids from Thales UK, a Babcock-Raytheon team, Lockheed Martin and Rheinmetall.





The prototype is scheduled to be delivered for trials by 2019 as Britain plays catch up in a field dominated in the West by US and German developments.





Earlier this year, Lockheed Martin executives in the US said it was now possible to produce viable laser weapons capable of taking out small targets like missiles and trucks.





In 2014, the US Navy deployed a laser weapon onboard a warship for field testing.





Adm. George Zambellas, the head of the British Royal Navy, told an audience at the DSEI arms exhibition in London last year that the service was to test the prototype on a warship by the end of the decade.





In a statement, the MoD said MBDA will assess how the system can acquire and track targets at range and in varying weather conditions over land and water.





It won't be the first time the Royal Navy has carried a laser weapon onboard one of its warships.





A laser was secretly developed by British scientists and deployed to the Falkland Islands during the war with Argentina in 1982. The weapon was meant to dazzle Argentine pilots but was never actually used.





The new laser demonstrator is part of a wider program being studied by DSTL, which includes the potential of radio frequency-directed energy weapons.

The mortar system and the onboard fire control system was fully developed by Thales South Africa.

At AAD 2016, the Thales Scorpion mortar system was mounted on a 4x4 Toyota Land Cruiser, but the mortar system can be easily fitted on other similar vehicles.



Scorpion is an integrated automated mobile mortar platform, capable of target acquisition, onboard fire control, and automatic laying of the mortar tube.



Mounted on a single palletised platform, it fires from the back of a vehicle in less than 15 seconds. This is made possible through ballistics calculations, orientation methods and recoil absorption.



The Scorpion can operate in day or night conditions. It boasts direct and indirect fire capabilities with high accuracy (pointing and positioning), improved responsiveness and rapid target switching (shoot, shift, shoot).It has a high first round hit probability and is digitally connected to the battlefield.



The scorpion can be networked together into a fire group to provide an highly effective force multiplier.

Organizations that want to survive and thrive in the 21st century need every advantage they can get: top talent, top strategies and of course, top technology. Technology, after all, has helped make business transactions faster, more transparent and more efficient. Big data, cloud computing, the Internet of Things (IoT), robotics, bots and other forms of artificial intelligence are all technologies that your organization is probably considering or reviewing, if they are not already in use.

These technologies also blur or eliminate traditional enterprise perimeters, and present new conduits for cyberattacks. We live in a world of malware, ransomware, spear phishing, insider threats, nation-state attacks, APTs, SQL injections and social engineering. While there are no silver bullets to protect against this reality, CXOs who “follow the money” and focus on an end-to-end approach to data protection can become enablers for new business and technology use, while also promoting the safety of existing operations.



There’s No Data Protection without a Data Protection Plan

First, it’s incredibly important that CXOs have a comprehensive plan for protecting sensitive data regardless of where it is stored or how it is used. Most organizations start thinking about this in terms of compliance and regulation. Compliance and regulatory standards represent minimum requirements for operation, but CXOs should consider them as only starting point. Given the rate at which threats evolve, even the most prescriptive regimes can’t guarantee that data will be safe.

If CXOs are serious about implementing an end-to-end data protection plan, they need to go beyond compliance and think about the need to secure data at each point in its creation, transmission and use. Some critical elements of this are:

secure identities – whether personal or for applications and devices

secure communications that ensure data isn’t exposed or altered in transit

secure storage of information that strongly controls access

secure use that only allows authorized users and applications

These security services rely on a set of underlying technologies for support: encryption, key management, access controls and digital signatures. If you’ve not approached these services before, even getting started can seem intimidating, but there are some good places to start:

meet the compliance bar for basic requirements

determine what data in your business is most sensitive, and all the places is it sent to, used, and stored

secure data stored and used on back end systems, as these are the biggest targets for data thieves

recognize threats posed to existing applications by building in additional security as the application evolves, updating your organization’s security posture as you update the application for new features

when starting a new project, design the security into the project at the start. It’s tempting to prioritize time-to-market over all else, but data security requirements are least expensive and most easily addressed upfront

Keep in mind that your end-to-end plan should go step-by-step. While security is important, it’s best done right. A thoughtful, analytical, data-centric strategy goes a long way. Covering all our (data protection) bases, so to speak, was one of our motivations behind the marriage of Vormetric + Thales.

While the challenges we all face are immense, there’s also so much to be excited about. We live in a time of unprecedented technological growth and change. Which brings us to our next two topics, cloud computing and digital payments.



Protecting Your Data in the Cloud

Organizations are embracing the cloud in unprecedented numbers. Gartner estimates the revenue from the two top cloud providers (AWS and Azure) is over $14 Billion. By 2018 they estimate 50% of applications in the public cloud will be mission-critical.

One of the greatest concerns when moving to the cloud is the issue of the security or your organization’s data. It results from the fact that applications and data are no longer under your organization’s full control. And this becomes critical – after all, you can’t ensure that data and applications remain secure if you don’t fully control access and security. One of the best ways to mitigate this risk is to protect data stored in cloud environments with encryption and access controls. Buy this raises another question– who controls the encryption keys and access policies? Best practice dictates that the data owner should. By keeping control of the keys, organizations can control access to their encrypted data – even eliminating access from the cloud service provider. Today, the major cloud providers have acknowledged that in many situations, organizations need to control their keys, and they now offer Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) capabilities.

The new Thales e-Security organization is a clear leader in this area, with explicit support that enables local control of cloud data with BYOK as well as with traditional encryption and access controls across Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Software as a Service (SaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS) environments.

Good examples for IaaS and PaaS including Amazon’s AWS Key Management Service (KMS) and a similar services in Microsoft Azure cloud with Thales e-Security offerings and a completely enterprise controlled capability using the Vormetric product line. But the most exciting area for BYOK is SaaS, where enterprises have had no control over their data in the past. Salesforce is setting a high bar, offering customers the capability to completely control the keys that encrypt their SalesForce data within the application, keeping the keys within the customers local environments and eliminating access by Salesforce.

Again Thales e-Security’s Vormetric product line is already supporting this, with a Key Management as a Service (KMaaS) offering for enterprises that addresses enterprise compliance and best practices for managing of encryption keys without exposing data within Salesforce to outside access.

Expect other SaaS application providers to follow Salesforce’s lead, giving the control of enterprise data back to their enterprise customers using BYOK.





Balancing Convenience and Security in Mobile Payments

Mobile payments are popular. They’re fast, they’re easy, and they’re convenient. They’re far easier than inserting a card into a point-of-sale, entering a PIN and waiting for transaction authorization. But while convenience may be king for the consumer, convenience isn’t always synonymous with security.

The mobile device is an inherently untrusted device, and for it to play a role in the payments ecosystem a comprehensive security infrastructure needs to be established to support the evolving mobile environment.

There are three key areas that should make up this security infrastructure: Secure identities; security of data in transit; and security of repositories and processing environments (sound familiar?). The good news is that there are proven trust models for minimizing the risk of fraudulent transactions while protecting all critical keys and payment credentials – such as access controls, encryption, digital signatures and data access monitoring. All of these technologies limit exposure to threats and enable user behavior monitoring that reveal when credentials have been compromised.



A Unified Platform: Better, Faster, Stronger

The takeaway here? When pursuing digital transformation though mobile payments, the architecture and security concerns must be addressed at every level of the solution – Encryption, enabled by secure identities, is a basic requirements at every level.The notion of security as a business enabler brings me to my next topic, the Thales/Vormetric acquisition.

Our mission statement, quite simply, is to be the undisputed leader in data protection and digital trust management everywhere data resides. In short, we want to enable businesses to securely conduct business. It’s no easy feat, but we’re up to the challenge.

According to MarketsandMarkets, the cybersecurity market will hit $170B by 2020. The increase in data breaches, proliferation of data to the cloud and to mobile devices, as well as the growing demand for compliance and data privacy have increased the need to protect data at every level

The new combined business will secure and obfuscate data in more environments, in more ways, providing the most comprehensive automated key management throughout the data lifecycle. With the most secure techniques and recognized industry certifications, the company will deliver market-leading non-disruptive, easy-to-deploy and manage security at the lowest life cycle cost.

Both Vormetric and Thales have a heritage of supporting the world’s leading cloud companies. Through our unified data protection platform we plan to further accelerate our cloud security offerings and strategy by securing even more cloud data: on premise (private cloud), in the public cloud (IaaS, SaaS, PaaS), at the database, container file, structured and unstructured, whether at rest or in motion.

I look forward to leading the new collective Thales e-Security team and our partners as we begin the journey to create the undisputed leader in data protection and trust management.

Alan Kessler became the CEO of Thales e-Security following its acquisition of Vormetric. Previously, as CEO of TippingPoint, he led the business through a stage of unprecedented growth, increasing market share at a rate of four times the industry average. Alan is now responsible for leading a world-class team of data security professionals in its mission to be the undisputed leader in data protection and digital trust management."

“Hopefully it will be something that will go on year after year. The money Thales will be injecting into the club will be going in to improve all the club facilities we have got here with an accent on the youth - the square, the nets, better sightscreens. So thank you very much to Thales.”

Mr Jayne, on behalf of Thales, said: “We are really, really pleased to be main sponsor of Three Bridges. Thales is a very significant employer in Crawley and it’s take us a little bit of time to get involved with community projects and we think that’s really important to be involved.

“I am personally pleased we have got involved in grassroots and we are trying to give support to the likes of Three Bridges Cricket Club. From Thales’ perspective we work in schools and we also work through different sports clubs and we sponsor Crawley Wasps.

“Why Three Bridges? Well it’s particularly the focus on the youth. Tonight the club is celebrating the colts and all their achievements this year. It’s well run club and the guys do a fantastic job here. I have been involved in previous years and they do a lot of work and hard effort and it’s a very costly exercise to provide the facilities the players enjoy.

“And hopefully Thales can help provide that on a long term basis.”

On the evening, awards were given to all the youth teams from under-9s up to under-16s. Each team manager gave a speech and gave awards to the batsman, bowler and all-rounder of the year.

Hawkei on the inside - Australian Defence Magazine,"Mon, 05 Sep 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1c3RyYWxpYW5kZWZlbmNlLmNvbS5hdS9uZXdzL2hhd2tlaS1vbi10aGUtaW5zaWRl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"With pilot production getting underway later this year at Thales Australia’s Bendigo facility, Army’s Hawkei light protected mobility vehicle (PMV) will soon gain a higher profile.

Julian Kerr | Sydney

Yet few admirers of the Hawkei’s distinctive styling – honed by a designer who once worked for Ferrari – will be aware that the interior is equally impressive, boasting as it does a built-in Integral Computing System (ICS) that allows information from numerous disparate systems to be presented on a common screen.

As noted by Major General Gus McLachlan, Head of Army Modernisation, “this represents the move of the land platform into the era of the ‘glass cockpit’ in which all the functions of the vehicle and communications and information systems capability are managed through a single common crew interface”. See his From the Source interview for more on this.

Essentially, the ICS is a computing infrastructure that is based on the UK Defence Standard 23-09 Generic Vehicle Architecture (GVA). This defines a single, standard digital electronic and electrical architecture, and addresses the need for a standardised human-machine interface (HMI).

“The ICS is the human/machine interface that defines how that information is presented through common screens.”

“The ICS provides resources on which you can run applications, whether they are C4I applications or other systems that are needed to fulfil a mission,” Sam Keayes, Vice President Secure Communications and Information Systems for Thales Australia explained to ADM. “You can plug in your external and internal communications system, your weapons system, your network management system, your vehicle Health and Usage Monitoring System (HUMS), micro UAVs, Unmanned Ground Systems (UGS), and anything else you like.

“The ICS is the human/machine interface that defines how that information is presented through common screens, and at a technical level it’s the core services and software to allow all those things to be managed and the data prioritised and distributed”.

Thales says the Hawkei concept from its initiation had assumed that the design would include an ICS or something very similar.

Lessons had been learnt from Thales UK and its work with the UK’s Foxhound protected patrol vehicle; from Thales Netherlands in the integration to the CIS of the SOTAS intercom system with the ICS, and from other major vehicle integration programs undertaken by Thales in Europe, the Middle East and elsewhere.

However, the design and development of the ICS and the application of the GVA deskpad into the Hawkei architecture had been the responsibility and the achievement of Thales Australia.

“The standards are published so the art is inputting the system together and integrating it with the platform itself,” Keayes said.

“The objective was ensuring the ICS and the platform went together absolutely seamlessly so as to achieve the best size/weight/power characteristics as well as providing the required information.

”The four-door Hawkei Command variant has .35 square metres of space between the front and rear seats to accommodate ICS equipment in purpose-designed racks – sufficient for the Hawkei requirement but inadequate for the traditional bespoke approach of different systems requiring their own real estate. GVA power is provided through separate buses, wiring harnesses and battery systems to avoid system interference.

The Command platform will have three displays, one for each seated position less the driver. The two-door variant is designed for one display for the commander (passenger) location.

Bezel buttons across the top of the ICS display provide access to a standard menu of available views. Bezel buttons down each side of the screen trigger various elements which can be drilled into, in order to access information or reconfigure systems while on the move.

“The idea is to present information in a consistent way, but as far as possible not add to the training burden by changing the way existing systems will be presented,” Keayes explained to ADM. “You’ll set different parameters depending on the type of mission. You might want all the individuals in the vehicle to be able to access on their screens the optical view from a remote weapon station. Or you may say no, only the driver and/or the commander of the vehicle is able to access that particular view.

”Benefits of the ICS/GVA approach include rapid technology insertion, whether of a new capability or the replacement of an existing system.

“The team writes the interface software in advance, which then helps enable a very rapid insertion,” Keayes said. “A second point is the customer less locked in to system vendors because the switching costs are relatively light; you’re not building the systems into the vehicle, you’re integrating them into an ICS. This will encourage suppliers to innovate and reduce costs more precisely because of their commercial incentive to deliver ongoing benefits.

“The third, obvious, end-user benefit is the saving in weight and space. There is one set of computers and one set of screens. You don’t have the entire vehicle cluttered with several different screens for integrated systems, several different computing boxes to support those screens.

“You have a single system with a single set of computing power on which the other applications are essentially virtualised and presented to the user on a single GVA screen. And because it’s all common, the training burden is decreased”.

Keayes confirmed that ICS had been included in the unsuccessful General Dynamics/Thales bid for Land 400 Phase 2.

Aviation Australia education campus opens at Brisbane Airport - Newsroom,"Wed, 28 Sep 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3c3Jvb20uYm5lLmNvbS5hdS9hdmlhdGlvbi1hdXN0cmFsaWEtZWR1Y2F0aW9uLWNhbXB1cy1vcGVucy1hdC1icmlzYmFuZS1haXJwb3J0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Aviation Australia training facility opening

Construction on the new Aviation Australia education campus at Brisbane Airport is now complete, with the Honourable Yvette D’Ath MP, Attorney-General and Minister for Justice and Minister for Training and Skills officially opening the facility today.

Brisbane Airport Corporation (BAC) funded the $10 million facility with the development managed by BAC’s property division, BNE Property.

BAC CEO and Managing Director Julieanne Alroe said the project is a continuation of a long term relationship with Aviation Australia.

“BAC is proud to invest in new education and training facilities that will enable our long term tenant Aviation Australia to expand its world-class training offer,” Ms Alroe said.

“For Brisbane Airport, new developments like this contribute to our transformation into a commercial, industrial and lifestyle hub.

“It’s all part of our $3.8 billion of investment into the airport over the next decade, and our commitment to creating platforms for economic growth and development for the benefit of Brisbane and Queensland.”

The new 5,000m2 facility is a significant expansion to Aviation Australia’s base at Brisbane Airport, providing 20 new lecture rooms, a technical training centre and café.

The new development takes Aviation Australia’s total lease area to approximately 19,000m2 including the adjacent training centre and airside hangar.

Aviation Australia CEO Bill Horrocks said the new facility will be able to accommodate an additional 500 students at the campus and support the future growth of the business.

“Our new facility will continue to improve the services we offer to the aviation industry and our growing domestic and international customer demand,” Mr Horrocks said.

“Aviation Australia has provided training to over 1,000 students in the last year alone, a significant milestone for our 15th year of operation.

“This new facility further strengthens our ability to provide world-class training in aviation related disciplines including engineering, cabin crew, aviation security, pilot training and ground operations.”

The new training facility features a co-located Thales LifeFlight Simulation Centre with Australia’s first Augusta Westland 139 helicopter full flight simulator to provide multi-mission training, including training for emergency helicopter pilots and crew.

LifeFlight Chairman the Honourable Rob Borbidge AO said the air medical company was proud to partner with BAC, Aviation Australia and Thales to deliver the centre.

“The Thales LifeFlight Simulation Centre will provide life-saving training to hundreds of aviation professionals from around the world each year,” Mr Borbidge said.

“The partnership between LifeFlight and Thales in developing the world’s most advanced commercial helicopter simulator is a special relationship that works for the mutual benefit of both parties.

“This is a strong commercial initiative and partnership which will be advantageous for Thales, LifeFlight and our Training Academy.

“A major benefit in this project has been the 20-plus years in experience that the LifeFlight Training Academy has in all aspects of Helicopter Emergency Medical Services training and its large tailor-made and customised training offering that applies to a wide range of mission profiles, including aeromedical and emergency services.”

Thales Australia CEO Chris Jenkins said: “We have made a multi-million dollar investment into this facility, which will see a state-of-the-art simulator used to train AW139 helicopter crews from all around Australia and from overseas.

“We’re bringing advanced global technology to Australia, and showing how industry partnerships can lead the way in providing world-class training services to national and international markets.”

Ms Alroe said a 500m2 café has been included in the development to cater for the campus’ additional staff and students as well as the businesses in the wider precinct.

“The Airport South precinct is a growing business hub home to a wide range of logistics, aviation, training and technology businesses including DHL, Airservices, Mitsubishi and QUT,” Ms Alroe said.

“Connected to the Brisbane City Council bus network, with retail precinct Skygate just minutes away, the precinct is an attractive business destination,” she said.
