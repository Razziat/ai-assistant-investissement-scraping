SES taps Thales Alenia Space for final two C-band replacement satellites - SpaceNews,"Fri, 07 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9zZXMtdGFwcy10aGFsZXMtYWxlbmlhLXNwYWNlLWZvci1maW5hbC10d28tYy1iYW5kLXJlcGxhY2VtZW50LXNhdGVsbGl0ZXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"WASHINGTON — Satellite fleet operator SES has selected Thales Alenia Space to build two C-band satellites, making the Franco-Italian manufacturer the first European company to win one of 12 replacement satellite orders placed this year as a result of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission’s upcoming C-band spectrum auction.

Thales Alenia Space said it will build the SES-22 and SES-23 television broadcast satellites using its Spacebus 4000 B2 platform. The geostationary satellites will weigh roughly 3,500 kilograms each, and are the last of six satellites SES says it needs in order to vacate a swath of C-band the United States has decided to repurpose for 5G cellular networks.

The Aug. 7 contract announcement follows a flurry of satellite manufacturing and launch deals Luxembourg-based SES has signed with U.S. companies in recent weeks as it races to clear 300 megahertz of C-band spectrum over the next 40 months in order to earn nearly $4 billion in incentive payments.

Under the FCC’s rules for the public C-band auction set for December, the winning bidders are required to reimburse satellite operators for certain costs incurred vacating the spectrum. The majority of those costs, expected to total around $3 billion to $5 billion, stem from replacement satellites needed to continue telecommunications services with less spectrum.

With SES, along with competitors Intelsat and Eutelsat, poised to receive large reimbursements on top of billions in incentive fees for clearing the spectrum early, the FCC faced political pressure to require the satellite operators to order their C-band replacement satellites exclusively from U.S. companies, something the FCC lacks the authority to do.

Still, SES highlighted the benefits to the U.S. space industry in announcing contracts earlier this summer with Northrop Grumman and Boeing for two C-band satellites apiece, and earlier this week in announcing the launches it ordered from SpaceX and United Launch Alliance.

SES said that the satellites ordered from Thales Alenia Space are “contingency satellites” that will ensure SES can clear 300 megahertz of auctioned spectrum two years ahead of the FCC’s December 2025 deadline, earning up to $3.97 billion in “accelerated clearing” incentive payments covered by the auction’s winners.

If SES can clear at least 120 megahertz by December 2021, the company stands to receive the first tranche of incentive payments, worth $977 million, in early 2022, SES Chief Financial Officer Sandeep Jalan said during an Aug. 7 earnings call.

SES would use the money to pay down its $4 billion debt, he said.

The later $2.99 billion tranche would go toward a variety of purposes, Jalan said, potentially including returning cash to shareholders, strengthening the company’s balance sheet, and “value accretive investments.” In order to receive that second and final tranche, SES must clear the remaining 180 megahertz by Dec. 5, 2023. If SES is late, the incentive payments progressively shrink and disappear entirely after 180 days.

SES CEO Steve Collar said SES has a team of “70 full-time equivalents” managing the C-band spectrum transition. “We couldn’t be more focused on this as a business,” he said during the Aug. 7 earnings call.

Of the three satellite operators who say they need replacement spacecraft to continue U.S. C-band service after clearing the auctioned spectrum, SES is the first to have ordered all of its satellites.

Luxembourg and U.S.-based Intelsat — which says it needs seven replacement satellites — has ordered six, selecting Maxar Technologies to build four and Northrop Grumman to build two satellites.

Paris-based Eutelsat says it needs a single replacement satellite, which it has not yet ordered.

Canada-based Telesat and Brazil’s Claro (formerly Embratel Star One), the only other operators deemed eligible by the FCC to receive reimbursement for C-band clearing costs, say the number of C-band customers they have in the United States is small enough for them to adjust their services to use less spectrum without needing replacement satellites.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998464584350586}",neutral,0.9998464584350586,0

Thales Alenia Space will be responsible for the design, production, testing of the satellites and support of the payload in-orbit acceptance tests. SES-22 and SES-23 are based on the proven Spacebus 4000 B2 platform and will be 3.5-ton class satellites at launch.

These satellites are the 11th and 12th satellites based on the Spacebus 4000 B2 platform to be built by Thales Alenia Space. The two satellites will help SES meet the Federal Communications Commission’s accelerated C-band clearing deadlines in the United States and will contribute to the effort to clear spectrum necessary to roll out 5G in the United States.

Hervé Derrey, President and Chief Executive Officer of Thales Alenia Space, said “The robustness and flight proven heritage of our Spacebus 4000 B2 platform, combined with our ability to timely and quickly deliver SES-22 and SES-23, have been key elements leading to the decision of SES working with us to replace its existing C-Band fleet. This demonstrates Thales Alenia Space’s expertise in developing tailored solutions that meet each operator’s specific needs to clear the C-Band spectrum.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999862909317017}",neutral,0.9999862909317017,0
New Vulnerability Could Put IoT Devices at Risk - Security Intelligence,"Wed, 19 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vc2VjdXJpdHlpbnRlbGxpZ2VuY2UuY29tL3Bvc3RzL25ldy12dWxuZXJhYmlsaXR5LWNvdWxkLXB1dC1pb3QtZGV2aWNlcy1hdC1yaXNrL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Society relies so heavily on technology that the number of internet connected devices used globally is predicted to grow to 55.9 billion by 2025. Many of these devices span parts of Industrial Control Systems (ICS) that impact the physical world, assist us in our daily lives at home and monitor and automate everything from energy usage to machine maintenance at work. The potential to abuse these systems has already caught the eye of cybercriminals; according to the 2020 IBM X-Force Threat Intelligence Index, attacks against these systems increased over 2000% since 2018.

As part of their ongoing research, IBM’s team of hackers, X-Force Red, have discovered a new IoT vulnerability that can be exploited remotely. The manufacturer, Thales, has made a patch available for CVE-2020-15858 to customers since February 2020 and X-Force Red has been working together to ensure users are aware of the patch and taking steps to secure their systems.

Of the billions of smart devices in use today, Thales is one of leading makers of components that enable them to connect to the internet, securely store information and verify identities. Thales’ entire portfolio connects more than 3 billion things every year and more than 30,000 organizations rely on its solutions for everything from smart energy meters to medical monitoring devices and cars.

However, in September 2019, X-Force Red discovered a vulnerability in Thales’ (formerly Gemalto) Cinterion EHS8 M2M module used in millions of internet-connected devices over the last decade. After further testing, Thales confirmed that this vulnerability affects other modules within the same product line of the EHS8 (BGS5, EHS5/6/8, PDS5/6/8, ELS61, ELS81, PLS62), further expanding the potential impact of this vulnerability. These modules are mini circuit boards that enable mobile communication in IoT devices.

More importantly, they store and run Java code often containing confidential information like passwords, encryption keys and certificates. Using information stolen from the modules, malicious actors can potentially control a device or gain access to the central control network to conduct widespread attacks – even remotely via 3G in some cases. Using this flaw, attackers could potentially instruct smart meters to knock out a city’s electricity or even overdose a medical patient, as long as the devices responsible for these critical functions are using an unpatched module exposed to an attacker, for example, over the 3G/4G connection this module enables.

About the Vulnerability

The EHS8 module, and the others in its line, is designed to allow secure communications between connected devices via 3G/4G networks. Think of this module as the equivalent of a trustworthy digital lockbox, where companies can securely store a range of secrets such as passwords, credentials and operational code. This vulnerability undermines that function by allowing attackers to steal organizational secrets.

X-Force Red uncovered a way to bypass the security checks that keep files or operational code hidden from unauthorized users. This vulnerability could enable attackers to compromise millions of devices and access the networks or VPNs supporting those devices by pivoting onto the provider’s backend network. In turn, intellectual property (IP), credentials, passwords, encryption keys could all be readily available to an attacker. Put another way, confidential information stored by the module may no longer be confidential. Attackers may even grab the application code to completely change the logic and manipulate devices.

What is the Potential Impact?

The potential impact of this vulnerability varies based on which of the devices using this line of modules attackers may compromise. It’s understood that there are millions of devices around the world using this module, across the automotive, medical, energy and telecom industries.

Given the critical nature of many of these devices, a targeted cyberattack could be significant. Here are some examples of what an attacker might be able to do if an unpatched module is exposed in various types of devices:

Medical Devices: Manipulate readings from monitoring devices to cover up concerning vital signs or create false panic. In a device that delivers treatment based on its inputs, such as an insulin pump, cybercriminals could over or underdose patients.

Manipulate readings from monitoring devices to cover up concerning vital signs or create false panic. In a device that delivers treatment based on its inputs, such as an insulin pump, cybercriminals could over or underdose patients. Energy and Utilities: Compromise smart meters to deliver falsified readings that increase or reduce a monthly bill. With access to a large group of these devices through a control network, a malicious actor could also shut down meters for an entire city, causing wide-reaching blackouts that require individual repair visits, or, even worse, damage to the grid itself.

Technical Details

The EHS8 module, like the other modules in the line, is comprised of a microprocessor with embedded Java ME ™ interpreter and flash storage – as well as GSM, GPIO, ADC, Digital and Analogue Audio, GPS, I2C, SPI and USB interfaces. It also provides higher level communications stacks such as PPP and IP. The embedded Java environment allows installation of Java ‘midlets’ to provide customizable functionality and interaction with the host device, and/or to act as the main logic. The module behaves much like a traditional ‘Hayes’ modem when operating at the fundamental OEM integrator level. This means, that aside from the Java application loaded onto the system, it can be controlled using ‘AT’ serial commands via a physical UART connection built into the circuit.

In practice, this means that the Java application could be bypassed and the control handed back to the low level, allowing an attacker to control the module directly. Once in control of the AT command interface, it is possible to issue a large number of standard commands such as ‘ATD’ – dial a number, or ‘ATI’ – show manufacturer information. There are also a number of configuration commands and a specific subset of commands for accessing a rudimentary filesystem overlaid on the flash memory – ‘AT^SFA’. This provides for reading, writing, deleting and renaming of files and subdirectories.

To facilitate the Java environment, there are also a number of Java related commands, one of which ‘installs’ a Java midlet previously uploaded to the flash filesystem. This effectively copies the Java code to a ‘secure store’ within the flash filesystem, which is theoretically ‘write only’ – i.e., data can be copied to it but never read back. This way, an OEM’s private Java code containing their IP, as well as any security related files such as PKI keys or certificates and application related databases are secured against theft by third parties.

However, the vulnerability discovered by X-Force Red allows full read, write, delete access to the hidden area (though Thales has put additional checks in place for specific file types). This would allow an attacker to read out the full java code running on the system (both the OEM midlets and Thales’ main ‘master’ code) as well as any other ‘hidden’ support files they may have.

Since Java is easily reversed back to human readable code, this could expose the full logic of any application as well as any embedded ‘secrets’ such as passwords, crypto keys etc. and makes IP theft a very simple operation. Armed with this data, attackers could easily create ‘clone’ devices, or more alarmingly, modify the functionality to enable fraudulent or malicious activities.

Figure 1. Code listing with vulnerability

The figure above shows where the vulnerability exists in the code that counts the number of characters in the path substring and checks if the fourth character is a dot (third indexed in characters array). In normal circumstances, any attempt to access hidden files with a dot prefix will be denied (example: a:/.hidden_file). However, replacing the slash with double slash (example: a://.hidden_file) will cause the condition to fail and code execution will jump to a character checking loop which will match any printable character. After the second slash, which will be ignored by the system, nothing prevents an attacker from using the dot prefixed filename, bypassing the security test condition.

Responsible Disclosure and Remediation

Once this vulnerability was discovered, it was immediately reported to Thales who worked with the X-Force Red team to test, create and distribute a patch to its clients in February 2020.

The patch can be administered two ways – either by plugging in a USB to run an update via software, or by administering an over the air (OTA) update. The patching process for this vulnerability is completely dependent on the manufacturer of the device and its capabilities – for example, whether the device has access to the internet could make it complicated to work with. Another item to note is that the more regulated a device is (medical devices, industrial controls, etc.), the more difficult it is to apply the patch since doing so may require recertification, an often time-intensive process.

We want to commend Thales for their handling of this flaw and for spending significant time working with customers to ensure they were aware of the patches and taking the steps to secure their users.

What X-Force Red Suggests

Considering the significant potential implications of this vulnerability, X-Force Red offers the following steps to mitigate risks and address the issue immediately:

Apply the patch: Device manufacturers that used the impacted modules need to follow guidance provided by Thales and offer firmware updates as quickly as possible. And device users need to install these updates immediately while also ensuring they’re using the latest version of the module.

Students at school touted by Pence for reopening must quarantine due to COVID-19

Fourth graders at a school in North Carolina have been asked to quarantine for 14 days after a student there tested positive for COVID-19.

The school, a Thales Academy in Wake Forest, said it was notified on Monday that the student became infected after having contact with an infected family member.

The student was asymptomatic and was last at school on Friday. Teachers who were exposed also will be quarantined.

Thales Academy, a network of private non-sectarian community schools with eight locations in North Carolina, made the news last week after Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos visited a classroom and applauded the school for reopening.

Pence and DeVos visited a campus in Apex, not Wake Forest.

""We're here today because to open up America, we've got to open up America's schools and Thales Academy is literally in the forefront,"" Pence said.

Pence also said that the administration was going to make sure schools had the resources to open safely.

""We really do believe that it's in the best interest of our children to be back in the classroom,"" the vice president added.

Thales welcomed students back July 20. It offered parents two options: fully online or fully in-person, according to ABC Durham affiliate WTVD.

Students had their temperatures taken and completed a medical questionnaire after they were dropped off, according to WTVD. Staff and faculty also reminded students to wear masks.

Because the school network is private, it doesn't have to adhere to North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper's school reopening guidelines.

Cooper announced in July that schools could reopen with both in-person and remote learning.

He said that schools that choose to reopen should operate in person at no more than 50% capacity and buses at no more than 33%.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has swayed on national guidance for reopening schools. Originally, the federal agency warned of the risks that come with reopening schools and issued recommendations. But on Thursday, two weeks after President Donald Trump demanded schools reopen, the CDC shifted its tone and released statements about children not being at a high risk of getting seriously ill, though its original guidance still remained on its website.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999622106552124}",neutral,0.9999622106552124,0

IBM Finds Flaw in Millions of Thales Wireless IoT Modules

Insulin Pumps Could Be Manipulated and Smart Meters Could Be Wrecked, IBM Warns

A patching effort has been underway for six months to upgrade Thales wireless communication modules that are embedded in millions of IoT devices, including smart meters and insulin pumps. Left unpatched, a vulnerability in the modules could allow attackers to control devices, IBM warns.

See Also: Reducing Risks from IoT Devices in an Increasingly Connected World

These types of large-scale remediation efforts have become familiar when IoT devices sold by a variety of vendors share a common but problematic component. Rather than announce a vulnerability in tandem with the patch, a concerted effort takes place to remedy as many devices as possible before going public.

On Wednesday, IBM’s X-Force Red team revealed the vulnerability, CVE-2020-15858, which it found last September in Thales’ Cinterion EHS8 M2M modules. The flaw is also in related products, including the BGS5, EHS5/6/8, PDS5/6/8, ELS61, ELS81 and PLS62 modules. The modules are used in devices in a variety of industries, including healthcare, automotive, energy and telecommunications.

Adam Laurie

The modules, which IBM describes as mini circuit boards, enable 3G or 4G connectivity, but also store secrets such as passwords, credentials and code, according to Adam Laurie, X-Force Red’s lead hardware hacker, and Grzegorz Wypych, senior security consultant, who wrote a blog post.

“This vulnerability could enable attackers to compromise millions of devices and access the networks or VPNs supporting those devices by pivoting onto the provider’s backend network,” Laurie and Wypych write. “In turn, intellectual property, credentials, passwords and encryption keys could all be readily available to an attacker.”

In a statement, Thales says ""it takes the security of its products very seriously and therefore has, after communicating and discussing this issue with affected customers, delivered software fixes in Q1/2020.""

Full Read, Write Access

The modules run microprocessors with an embedded Java ME interpreter and use flash storage. Also, there are Java “midlets” that allow for customization. One of those midlets copies custom Java code added by an OEM to a secure part of the flash memory, which should only be in write mode so that code can be written there but not read back.

“This way, an OEM’s private Java code containing their IP, as well as any security related files such as PKI keys or certificates and application related databases are secured against theft by third parties,” IBM says.

""This vulnerability could enable attackers to compromise millions of devices and access the networks or VPNs supporting those devices by pivoting onto the provider’s backend network. In turn, intellectual property, credentials, passwords and encryption keys could all be readily available to an attacker.""

—IBM X-Force Red

X-Force Red found, however, the modules had full read, write and delete access to what should be a restricted area.

“Using information stolen from the modules, malicious actors can potentially control a device or gain access to the central control network to conduct widespread attacks – even remotely via 3G in some cases,” IBM says.

The possibilities for attack are sweeping: Smart meters could be wrecked or an insulin pump could be manipulated to overdose a patient, according to the researchers. Because Java code can be easily reversed, it would also be possible to clone a device or modify its functionality, they write.

How to Patch

The patch can be installed either over the air or via USB, IBM says. But it might not be completely straightforward.

“The patching process for this vulnerability is completely dependent on the manufacturer of the device and its capabilities – for example, whether the device has access to the internet could make it complicated to work with,” IBM says. “Another item to note is that the more regulated a device is (medical devices, industrial controls, etc.), the more difficult it is to apply the patch, since doing so may require recertification, an often time-intensive process.”

IBM says Thales spent “significant time working with customers to ensure they were aware of the patches and taking steps to secure their users. We commend Thales for their handling of this flaw.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9983512163162231}",neutral,0.9983512163162231,0
This robotic maritime bomb squad keeps humans a safe distance away - Popular Science,"Tue, 04 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvcHNjaS5jb20vc3RvcnkvdGVjaG5vbG9neS90aGFsZXMtbWFyYXRpbWUtbWFpbi1jb3VudGVybWVhc3VyZXMtc3lzdGVtL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"At the end of this year the French and British navies will start testing a prototype of a new anti-mine system, designed to detect, identify, and even destroy dangerous mines all while keeping humans far away from them. It’s called the Maritime Mine Counter Measures (MMCM) system, and it is being developed by French defense electronics group, Thales, and its partners.

Maritime mines are “simple, cheap, efficient, improvised explosive devices of the sea favored by poorer states and terrorist organizations,” says Antoine Caput, Thales’s MMCM program director.

These modern mines can be on the seabed, moored, or floating and drifting, but they’re not the only threat of their kind to shipping. Hundreds of thousands of unrecovered mines remain around Europe’s coastlines, according to Caput—they’re a dangerous legacy of both World Wars. Now 80 years old, their detonation systems are unlikely to function, but the explosive material could still cause damage. So when a mine is found, it needs to be neutralized.

Sea mines are often triggered by magnetism, so passive methods of dealing with the threat include changing ships’ magnetic signatures. Active methods include building ships specifically to find and destroy the mines: those are minesweepers and minehunters.

Minesweeping involves either dragging a wire through the water to cut the explosives’ mooring wires, or mimicking a ship to make the mines detonate. Minehunting, on the other hand, involves carefully searching an area for potential mines and then destroying them.

These operations are dangerous. Britain and France’s new mine countermeasures system, however, is intended to keep humans safe: between 14 and 35 miles away. Thales and its partners—Swedish defense company Saab, French robotic specialist ECA, and British shipbuilder ASV—won the contract from France and Britain in March of 2015 to develop it.

The system actually consists of six tools: a 40-foot-long uncrewed surface vehicle (USV); a remotely operated vehicle called the Multi-Shot Mine Neutralization System (MuMNS) that deploys from that larger surface vehicle; three uncrewed undersea vehicles (UUVs); a towed sonar; and a portable operations center in two 20-foot containers. That station is for the human operators, and can be located on land or a ship.

The first phase of a mine hunt is known, in naval terms, as “DCL.” That stands for Detection, Classification, and Location. In layperson’s terms, that means finding an object in the sea or on the seafloor, then classifying it either as a “Mine-Like-Object” (MILO) or something else (such as an old fridge or any of the multitude of objects in the ocean), and then noting its precise location with an inertial navigation system. Unlike a GPS, which gives latitude and longitude, an inertial navigation system tells you where you are in relation to the spot at which you started your journey.

The multi-shot mine neutralization system. Saab

This will all be done from the uncrewed surface vehicle, made by ASV, which can either be actively operated at a distance by the crew in the control center, or be pre-programed to follow a specified route. It tows a sonar that will examine the area under study. If objects of interest are seen, then the three uncrewed underwater vehicles made by French defense robot specialist ECA come into play. These are each equipped with the latest generation of sonars, called SAMDIS, and also made by Thales. The sonar units can image the object in question from three different angles, creating a useful picture. “This gives us an almost 3D image of the object,” Caput says.

The second phase is known as “IN,” for “identification and neutralization.” This is undertaken by the 4.3 ft-long, 2.6 ft-wide remotely-controlled Multi-Shot Mine Neutralization System, manufactured by Saab. It uses its two rear propellers to accurately navigate in currents up to 4.6 mph.

The MuMNS launches from the larger uncrewed surface vehicle from a cradle that tips down from the rear of the vessel. It stays permanently attached to its mothership by a fiber-optic tether that provides it with power and communications. The rover can dive to a depth of 985 feet and has six degrees of freedom.

Like the uncrewed surface vehicle, it can be piloted manually or navigate automatically to a given waypoint. Then, using its sonar and cameras, it relocates the object in question, and if the operator confirms that it is indeed a mine, they will move the MuMNS closer manually.

When it is near enough, the vehicle’s telescopic arm extends to attach an explosive charge onto the mine with a non-magnetic nail gun. This does not risk detonating the mine, explained Carl-Marcus Remén, sales director at Saab’s Underwater Systems Business Unit, “because it just gives the mine a little shake” which it will dismiss as a passing fish, for example. The charge also has a floater, like a little buoy, for radio-communication.

Questions Over Redacted Australian Thales Hawkei Audit - Overt Defense -,"Fri, 07 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm92ZXJ0ZGVmZW5zZS5jb20vMjAyMC8wOC8wNy9xdWVzdGlvbnMtb3Zlci1yZWRhY3RlZC1hdXN0cmFsaWFuLXRoYWxlcy1oYXdrZWktYXVkaXQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Pin 0 Shares

The Australian government is being taken to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal over its decision to redact key parts of a 2018 audit of the acquisition of the Thales Hawkei (also known as the ‘Baby Bushmaster’) for the Australian Army. This latest stoush was instigated by crossbench Senator Rex Patrick who is trying to get the full, un-redacted Auditor General’s report.

Thales made representations to Attorney-General for Australia, Christian Porter, who took the unprecedented step of redacting materials in the report. In particular, Thales wanted six paragraphs censored which compared the Hawkei to the US-produced Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV).

The Australian Auditor General agreed with the report and criticised the cost of the acquisition (as reported by Overt Defense here) at the time of its release. The Australian Army was previously on-track to adopt the JLTV but aggressive lobbying by Thales and local defence firms involved in sub-contracting saw the JLTV dropped as a contender, leaving only the Hawkei.

In court filings Thales claimed instead; “The vehicle cost-comparison in the impugned paragraphs purports to benchmark the cost and capability of the Hawkei and JLTV, in a way that implies that the JLTV is comparable and commensurable to the Hawkei, but approximately half the price.” They further claimed; “This would prejudice Thales, the Commonwealth of Australia and Australian entities in the supply chain for the production of the Hawkei because it would detrimentally impact the marketability, and therefore the export prospects, of the Hawkei.”

In court last week, Australian government lawyers argued similar points; “We say that the disclosure of the exempted material will harm or can be expected to harm the prospects of Thales and the Australian army to selling this vehicle to other buyers. We say that the information in dispute creates an unfair negative impression of the vehicle, including in comparison with a key competitor, and as such it is reasonable to expect disclosure of that information to harm its export prospects.”

There are of course larger questions here in that Hawkei production kept Australian jobs and production lines open at Thales Australia in Bendigo, Victoria. It is also understandable that Thales does not want its pricing policies to be available to competitors although Porter’s 2018 claim that release of the numbers was a national security issue is perhaps stretching the point.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9975347518920898}",neutral,0.9975347518920898,0
Entire NC School's 4th Grade In Quarantine Weeks After Opening - Scary Mommy,"Thu, 06 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjYXJ5bW9tbXkuY29tL25vcnRoLWNhcm9saW5hLXNjaG9vbC1xdWFyYW50aW5lLW1pa2UtcGVuY2XSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Fourth graders are quarantining for 14 days after a student at Thales Academy tested positive for COVID-19

Thales Academy in Wake Forest, North Carolina, is the latest school that has been immediately affected by COVID-19 upon reopening. Thales Academy has 10 campuses total, eight of which are in North Carolina. Vice President Mike Pence, along with Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, visited a Thales campus in Apex just last week, touting the school for reopening during the pandemic. And now the entirety of the fourth grade must quarantine for two weeks after a student tested positive for the virus.

The student was asymptomatic, according to ABC News, and was at school as recently as last Friday, July 31. The school was notified on Monday that the child was infected after having contact with a family member. Teachers who were also exposed are asking to quarantine as well.

On July 29, Pence and DeVos gave the school a PR pat on the back for reopening — and were photographed not wearing masks during the visit. “We’re here today because to open up America, we’ve got to open up America’s schools and Thales Academy is literally in the forefront,” Pence said. “We really do believe that it’s in the best interest of our children to be back in the classroom.”

The Thales school year started on July 20 with in-person instruction. The school did offer parents two options for the year: fully online or fully in-person. According to WTVD, students had their temperatures taken and completed a medical questionnaire after they were dropped off on the first day.

Because the Thales Academy network is private, the schools don’t have to adhere to Gov. Roy Cooper’s school reopening guidelines. Gov. Cooper says schools that choose to reopen should operate in person at no more than 50% capacity and buses at no more than 33%.

“Thales Academy will continue thorough cleanings throughout the school day,” school spokesperson Holly Clark wrote in an email to The News & Observer. “Thales Academy is committed to numerous safety protocols and will continue to work to keep students, staff and families as safe and healthy as possible.”

Per The News & Observer, the Thales Academy location in Raleigh closed temporarily during the first week of school after a visiting staff member tested positive for COVID-19. A kindergartener at the Thales Knightdale campus also tested positive for COVID-19 last week, but the school spokeswoman said that particular school will “continue normal operations.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999860525131226}",neutral,0.9999860525131226,0

Sustainability is increasingly important to the way an organisation does business as consumers demand an eco-responsible approach from the businesses they buy from. Over the last few years people and businesses have been looking at ways to reduce the use of plastic. Even if it is still currently the most used material for traditional payment cards and other banking devices, a lot of banks worldwide offer alternatives whenever possible.

Thales as a leading expert in Digital Identity and Security is deeply committed to accompany companies in this move towards more eco-friendly solutions. By investing in several eco-friendly payment card solutions for banks and card issuers, Thales was the first company to provide a payment card made of Polylactic Acid (PLA) made from non-food corn. This reduces the traditional PVC use by more than 80%. They can integrate features such as contactless just like traditional payment cards. Millions of PLA cards have already been delivered and the demand is about to double in the next few months illustrating the increasing appetite1 for more sustainable products.

The time is right to combine sustainability with the latest payment solutions. According to Sylvie Gibert, SVP Payment Card Solutions at Thales, “moving away from plastics is challenging when embedding sophisticated technology in the banking card, such as the contactless chip and antenna. However, we are committed to finding new eco-friendly solutions for our banking customers.”

Another innovative way of reducing the amount of new plastic, while fighting sea pollution, is a card made of recycled PET (polyethylene terephthalate). These are made from plastic waste gathered during coastal clean-up operations. Thales is proud to support an American leading financial institution as a pioneer in delivering such recycled PET card to its customers and contributing to the reduction of single-use plastic in its operations worldwide.

1: As an example, Mauritius Commercial Bank is one of the first customers to migrate their portfolio to PLA cards.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9496251940727234}",neutral,0.9496251940727234,0
French Navy Starts Trials of Variable Depth Sonar aboard Loire-class Offshore Support Vessel - Naval News,"Tue, 04 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uYXZhbG5ld3MuY29tL25hdmFsLW5ld3MvMjAyMC8wOC9mcmVuY2gtbmF2eS1zdGFydHMtdHJpYWxzLW9mLXZhcmlhYmxlLWRlcHRoLXNvbmFyLWFib2FyZC1sb2lyZS1jbGFzcy1vZmZzaG9yZS1zdXBwb3J0LXZlc3NlbC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"French Navy Starts Trials of Variable Depth Sonar aboard Loire-class Offshore Support Vessel The French Navy (Marine Nationale) and French Armament General Directorate (DGA) started trials of the Thales CAPTAS-1 variable depth sonar (VDS) aboard Loire-class offshore support and assistance vessel (BSAM) ""Garonne"" off Brest, in Brittany.

Naval News first learned about plans to experiment the compact VDS solution aboard the multipurpose vessel during DSEI 2019, while covering Garonne, the fourth and final vessel of the Loire-class.

“There is some project to deploy a towed sonar onboard [Garonne] which would be placed into a container” LT Cmdr Congues, Garonne‘s Commanding Officer, told Naval News during the event in September last year. (see our video below).

One month later, during PACIFIC 2019 in Sydney, Australia, Admiral Prazuck, the Chief of Staff of the French Navy confirmed those plans. He told Naval News that he has been pushing for the experiment to happen and he was happy to see the project materialize.

Then in January 2020, we learned additional details on the upcoming sonar trials from the French Navy:

At this stage, these trials are only an experimentation to assess the relevance of the concept. All options are on the table, from the integration of the system aboard a vessel to the acquisition of a batch of containerized sonars for monitoring our maritime approaches. What follows will obviously depend on the results of the experiment, but also on the evolution of the strategic context, and the options adopted for all the sonar systems of the French Navy and its allies.



French Navy PAO

We contacted Thales about these trials but the defense company said it was not able to communicate on this topic. Naval News then learned from a DGA spokesperson in mid-july that the experimentation formally started last week, in late July. Pictures of the CAPTAS-1 container aboard Garonne were not available at the time of writing this article.

It has to be noted that Garonne is based in Brest, close to the SSBN base of Ile Longue. Fitting CAPTAS-1 VDS aboard those multipurpose vessels could help secure the zone whenever French SSBNs deploy and return from their deterrence missions. This is when the submarines are typically most vulnerable, most exposed and potentially most detectable.

More sonars in the fleet to counter a growing submarine threat

The French Navy is currently looking to increase the number of sonars in its fleet to counter the growing submarine threat (which, according to analysts, is happening globally but particularly in the indo-pacific region).

Three of the five La Fayette-class frigates will be fitted with a Kingklip hull mounted sonar by Thales during their mid-life update. Meanwhile, another frigate of the class, Surcouf, has been fitted with a BlueWatcher hull mounted sonar since early 2018. In addition, the DGA spokesperson confirmed to Naval News that the future Patrol Vessel class of the French Navy (known as the “PO” program for Patrouilleurs Océanique) will likely feature sonar systems as well: “We are moving towards the integration of a yet to be defined hull mounted sonar”.

About Thales CAPTAS-1 Variable Depth Sonar

Unveiled at Euronaval 2014, the CAPTAS-1 is the most compact member of the CAPTAS family of VDS. According to Thales, it provides a very efficient anti-submarine warfare (ASW) capability in littoral waters and is capable of long range detection in shallow and deep water. It is tailored for small and medium-sized surface vessels displacing 300 tons or more.

The system is designed to deploy the array at optimum depth to continuously survey 360 degrees with a well covered water column, thus overcoming harsh propagation conditions and surface-layer problems inherent to Hull Mounted Sonar. It offers very accurate target positioning to prosecute and engage distant submarines with airborne assets. CAPTAS-1 is capable of multi-static ASW with most current low frequency sonars in operation world wide.

CAPTAS-1 can be integrated directly to a vessel or can come as a 20 feet ISO containerized solution (with a dedicated console inside the container for ships not fitted with combat management system, which is the case of Garonne).

During NAVDEX 2017, the UAE Navy announced a contract for the procurement of several CAPTAS-1 VDS containers from Thales, becoming the launch customer. According to Thales sources, a second (undisclosed) customer has since selected CAPTAS-1. Back in 2016, the compact sonar solution was tested aboard CNIM’s L-CAT landing craft.

CAPTAS-1 technical features:

Active Frequencies: 2KhZ

Bandwidth: Wide bandwidth against reverberation effect

Pulse lengths: up to 8s

Pulse Modes: FM, CW and COMBO

Operational limits: Up to sea state 6

Operating depth: Up to 230m depth e.q. 110 m at 12 kts

Detection performance: Up to the first Convergence zone.

About Loire-class / BSAM offshore supply vessels

A short report issued by the Department of Information and Mass Communications of the Ministry of Defence (MoD) of the Russian Federation confirms that, by the end of the year, the Russian MoD will sign two state contracts for the supply of fighter aircraft built by IAZ, including 21 Su-30SM2 fighters and 25 Yak-130 advanced combat trainers. This was announced by General of the Army Sergei Shoigu, minister of defence, at a meeting with representatives of the military-industrial complex in the Irkutsk region.

Shoigu concluded that a decision has already been made and the deal will be signed this year, in addition to the already running state contracts worth more than 100 billion rubles (USD 1,4 billion). He also announced that an upcoming contract for IAZ totaling 7.2 billion rubles (USD 95 million) will be signed in 2021 and will be related to repairs and overhaul of Su-30 fighter aircraft.

It should be noted that this is the first time the designation Su-30SM2 has come up. While the composition of the layout is not entirely clear, it can be concluded that the Su-30SM2 will have the foreign content replaced by indigenous components shared with the Su-35S. Most notably the Thales VEH-3022 HUD will likely be replaced by the IKSh-1K/1M type developed by JSC Ramenskoye Instrument-Making Design Bureau of the Concern Radioelectronic Technologies (KRET). We can also expect replacement of the French-made multifunctional full-color 5x5in LCD displays Thales SMD55S and at least partial unification of the front and rear cockpit layout with the Su-35S.

Dolphin Products, based in Heidelberg West Victoria, are industry leaders in injection moulding and tooling of complex plastics products. They collaborate with Thales on a range of capabilities including Protected Vehicles and with our armaments and explosive ordnance businesses.

Founded in 1946, Dolphin Products was the brainchild of three toolmakers who started the business making children’s toys and industrial products. In the early 50’s the company, based in Preston Victoria, transitioned from toy cars to real cars; making plastic components for the automotive industry. This region subsequently became one of the centres for automotive manufacturing in Australia and in the 80’s and 90’s, Dolphin Products supplied plastic interior trim components to all car manufacturers of the era.

This shift to the automotive industry enabled Dolphin Products to adapt and expand their solutions to the industries they work in today. Providing pathology products for medical industries, components for vehicles like seat belt buckles, cup holders, door handles and plastic speaker grilles; just to name a few. Dolphin Products’ engineering and tooling background gave the company the ability to understand the customers need and innovate design improvements.

It’s this ability to combine these two elements of innovation and customer understanding which Dolphin Products Managing Director Mario Turcarelli, attributes to the longevity and success of the business.

‘Why are we here after 74 years? Our ability to innovate means we can deliver what our customers need and we pride ourselves on our ability to respond rapidly to that.’

If innovation and customer understanding is at the heart of Dolphin Products, right alongside these are their people. Dolphin Products is a family run business; employing 38 people from a diverse range of backgrounds and nationalities.

It’s this family-run dynamic as well as the diversity, experience and cultures of the team that brings an exciting mix to the business.

‘Innovation is our catch-cry and you can’t innovate without diversity. We are proud of our diversity and gender balance in both the office and shop floor and have people working here from various industries such as automotive, hospitality, gaming and even Formula 1’

One of the industries Dolphin Products has decades of experience with is the defence industry. Thales is one of Dolphin Products’ largest customers and are partners in a range of projects; working together at several Thales sites across Australia.

Just some of these projects are the provision of components for Protected Vehicles and parts for rifles which are manufactured at Thales Lithgow. Dolphin Products also produce various components for Defence based munitions for the Benalla operations, incorporating Grenades, Simulators, Packaging and Detonator Demolition device

One particular contract, in which Thales was a major partner, created the diversification to help Dolphin Products continue after the closure of the Australian Automotive Industry in October 2017.

‘We used to provide 44 different trim and plastic components to Holden for the Commodore and when they stopped producing in 2017, there was the potential for significant job losses. However, because of a large contract with Thales and other major stakeholders, we were able to not only retain our workforce, but grow it. Our people are very grateful for this project that provided a foundation for employment growth, as we developed other new business opportunities.’

Thales has a strong record of supporting innovative Australian businesses, recognising their important contributions in delivering world-class capability. Ian Crofts, Industrial Supply Chain Manager at Thales, said that the collaborative relationship with Dolphin Products has been an important partnership.

‘We have worked with Dolphin Products for a long time on complex projects and they consistently deliver high-performing products. Their ability to meet changing requirements with agility and innovation, as well as their focus on customer needs, is perfectly aligned with Thales’s values.’

The relationship between Thales and Dolphin Products has been a strong one for over 20 years and the secret to its success, according to Mario, is trust and the ability to work well on long-term technical projects together.

‘We enjoy dealing with Thales. They’re not only like-minded people, but they treat us fairly and respectfully and that makes for a successful business relationship.’

Stunning discovery of a distant galaxy similar to the Milky Way - Thales,"Wed, 12 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi93b3JsZHdpZGUvc3BhY2UvbmV3cy9zdHVubmluZy1kaXNjb3ZlcnktZGlzdGFudC1nYWxheHktc2ltaWxhci1taWxreS13YXnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Stunning discovery of a distant galaxy similar to the Milky Way Thales Alenia Space Science Share this article



LinkedIn

Scientists have just revealed an amazing scientific discovery. Calling on the state-of-the-art technologies offered by the ALMA ground-based radiotelescope, astronomers have unveiled an extremely distant galaxy that could practically be mistaken for our own Milky Way. This galaxy is so far away that its light took over 12 billion years to reach us! Scientists explain that what we now see is the galaxy as it was when the Universe was “only” 1.4 billion years old.

Designated SPT0418-47, this recently discovered galaxy has at least two major similarities to our own: a rotating disk structure and a bulge, a central, tightly packed group of stars around the core. It’s the most distant of the galaxies that resemble our Milky Way.

Since we’re talking about galaxies far, far away, it’s virtually impossible to carry out precise observations, even with today’s most powerful telescopes. Scientists overcame this problem by using a nearby galaxy as a magnifying glass – a technique better known as gravitational lensing – and allowing ALMA to go far back in time, providing details never before seen. The gravitational pull from the neighboring galaxy distorts and bends the light from the distant galaxy, giving it a misshapen and magnified appearance. This makes the distant galaxy look like a nearly perfect ring of light around the nearby galaxy. The research team used data from ALMA to reconstruct the actual shape, based on a new computer modeling technique.

While the new SPT0418-47 galaxy has a disk and other characteristics similar to those of known spiral galaxies, the research team also expects it to evolve into a very different galaxy from the Milky Way and join the category of elliptical galaxies.

Being able to study distant galaxies is a key to understanding how galaxies are formed and evolve. This latest unexpected discovery suggests that the early Universe was not as chaotic as we thought, and also raises a number of questions about how a well-ordered galaxy could have been formed so soon after the Big Bang. This treasure chest of galactic data will drive cosmic research for many years to come.

ALMA: reaching astronomical heights!

Located on the Chajnantor plateau in the Atacama desert of northern Chile, the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) is also an array of superlatives. One of the largest radiotelescope ever built, ALMA is no ordinary ground-based astronomy system. The array consists of 66 giant dish antennas, 54 twelve meters in diameter and 12 seven meters in diameter, observing at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths. This colossal facility is an international partnership between Europe, the United States and Japan.

A new view of space

ALMA’s main objective is to observe the “cool” Universe, the molecular gas and dust between the stars, providing astronomers and scientists with new insights into how stars and planets form and detecting nascent galaxies as they may have existed more than 10 billion years ago. As you’ve undoubtedly understood, the ALMA observatory will provide fresh clues to existential questions about our “cosmic” origins.

A daunting design challenge

As lead company in the European consortium AEM, Thales Alenia Space was prime contractor for the 25 antennas supplied by Europe for this project. It took 10 years to build the subassemblies in Europe, transport them to Chile, install them at the site in the Atacama desert, 5,000 meters above sea level, then calibrate them and demonstrate compliance with technical specifications.

Achieving the requisite performance for these huge antennas — including a reflector surface accurate within 11 microns RMS, or one-fifth the thickness of a human hair, combined with extreme pointing accuracy on distant objects — called for an unprecedented feat of engineering. All of these antennas need to point at exactly the same location in space at exactly the same time, despite operating in the extreme conditions of the high-altitude desert environment. Program partners rose to these challenges, including the effect of Earth’s gravity, wind gusts and temperature fluctuations in the desert of almost 40°C in just a few hours. Even the slightest design weakness could compromise pointing accuracy. In operation for several years now, the ALMA antennas have proven flawless!

Sitting on top of the world!

To transport the huge antennas from the ALMA base camp at 3,000 meters above sea level to the Chajnantor plateau at more than 5,000 meters, ALMA and the European Southern Observatory (ESO) built a 47-kilometer access road and ordered two heavy haulers, each designed to carry one antenna at a time. These custom-built trucks were 20 meters long and 10 meters wide, weighed 130 metric tons and were powered by twin diesel engines, each developing over 1,000 horsepower. A trip up the mountainside took three to four hours. How can an observatory on such a colossal scale, with its giant 100-ton antenna installation, achieve such extraordinary levels of pointing accuracy? That’s ALMA’s secret!

The antennas are working perfectly, their performance recognized by users and ESO alike. Hardly a week goes by without the ALMA observatory announcing a new scientific discovery, some complete with spectacular images – just a click away on the ESO website!
