presents Thales' naval defence products and services at Euronaval 2012.



Above Water Warfare



Thales above-water combat systems meet a wide range of needs. Thales’s offer in Above Water Warfare varies from surveillance, command and combat systems to support for weapon systems from both US and European manufacturers. Thales has successfully enhanced this high-value proposition for surface fleets by proactively supporting customers as their missions and operational requirements evolve.



Today, the company is both a trusted instigator of mission-critical combat systems and a design authority and architect for complete naval and maritime solutions. Thales’s solutions encompass all the mission capabilities of a joint seabased force, from anti-air, surface and anti-submarine warfare to peacekeeping operations within multinational coalitions.



The group has the world’s largest portfolio of naval sensors worldwide with Thales Netherland having recently developed the Integrated Mast. Integrating all sensors and antennas in one mast structure solves the problems that most naval ships encounter : sensors often block each other’s view and interfere with each other when operational. The Integrated Mast offers a better performance with lower life cycle costs and is already on board the Royal Netherlands Navy’s HMS Holland.



The Sea-based Ballistic Missile Defence (SMART-L Early Warning Capability) is the Thales solution to counter Ballistic Missiles. SMART-L’s already impressive instrumented range of 400 km will be more than doubled through an innovative upgrade of the sensor. The SMART-L radar is used by navies all around the world including the Netherlands, UK, France, Germany, Italy, Denmark and South Korea.



Thales’s combat management system, Tacticos, fulfils all naval operations as well as joint/combined mission management. The system has a fail proof architecture ensuring full functionality and facilitates full integration of the total mission system. Tacticos has an unrivalled installed base and is used by thirty five navies in all regions of the world for all their operations.

Underwater Warfare



Thales designs and delivers acoustic systems for anti-submarine warfare and antimine warfare. Our solutions and related services are suitable for all types of platforms : submarines, surface combatants, helicopters, maritime patrol aircraft and unmanned naval systems.



With fifty years of experience in undersea warfare, Thales is recognised as an allround leader in undersea warfare for its advanced technologies and ability to adapt to fast-changing operational contexts. The company is the major exporter of sonar and associated systems for navies and air forces and is constantly innovating to provide more powerful, more compact, modular and “user friendly” sonar systems which deliver the best operational capabilities with optimised cost of ownership. The company has delivered, or has been contracted, for more than 300 minehunting sonar systems worldwide.



For many years, Thales has been actively developing unmanned and autonomous naval systems, which are poised to progressively replace conventional solutions. Asemar, an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) dedicated to maritime security, is a project funded by the General Directorate for Enterprises (DGE) in France, involving the industrial companies Thales and ECA Robotic and four educational institutions. Thales is responsible for the overall project coordination, the high resolution sonar sensor and associate on-board intelligence processing, as well as the system deployment. The proven at sea high-resolution side-scan sonar with synthetic-aperture array gives the AUV unparalleled measurement and imaging performance.



Improvements in sonar performance are driven by the increasing need for naval forces to operate in the demanding acoustic environment of littoral waters, and by the emergence of new generations of near-silent submarines. Responding to this evolution, Thales has developed the highly successful CAPTAS family of variabledepth sonars, which are available in two ring (Captas-2) and four ring (Captas-4) configurations.



Thales is the world leader in very low-frequency variable depth sonars. CAPTAS is the only low frequency variable depth sonar in service with NATO and major navies.



Thales has also developed the FLASH (Folding Light Acoustic System for Helicopters), a low-frequency wideband sonar system. Initially designed for helicopters, the FLASH system has also been successfully integrated on unmanned surface vehicles for demonstrations. FLASH is the solution of choice for naval forces around the world, including the US Navy, the UK Royal Navy, the French Navy, the Royal Australian Navy, the Norwegian Navy and the United Arab Emirates Navy.

Information Superiority



The Informational Superiority area will showcase Thales’s ability to connect forces for maritime domain awareness. Thales supports the transformation of naval forces by delivering systems and solutions that ensure that all players acquire, exploit and exchange the required information to act decisively. With its C4ISR solutions, Thales offers naval forces interoperability with land, air, allied and NATO forces.



The Information Superiority area will be divided into the following three zones: Information Acquisition, Information Exploitation and Information Distribution.



In the Information Acquisition zone, Thales proposes a wide range of onboard equipment and systems enabling ships and naval task forces to have a clear view of the operational environment. The Vigile product line is the latest generation of Radar Electronic Support Measure systems. This includes the Vigile LW, which provides a real-time tactical view of the surrounding area and the Vigile DPX, a new radar designed to provide exceptional performance for users with high-end Electronic Warfare requirements. Artemis, a fully passive infrared surveillance system, is able to automatically detect, track and classify both air and surface targets simultaneously. It can be integrated on any type of ships or in shore-based surveillance systems.



Bluegate IFF/ADS-B are the new digital, leading-edge Identification Friend or Foe systems from Thales. They feature all the new civilian and military modes with Mode S, ADS-B and Mk XIIA (including mode 5 standard level 1 and 2).



In the Information Exploitation zone, Thales’s solutions provide decision superiority to operational commanders. The growing importance of maritime cooperation and coordination between the various actors involved (coastal, civilian and naval) calls for a greater level of agility and versatility from C4I systems. Thales’s Integrated Maritime C4I capabilities enable commanders to build and share situational awareness between networked communities of interest. The Geomaker also provides geospatial information services to expert users, delivering high-quality geospatial information services, from maps to high-accuracy digital elevation models.



In the Information Distribution zone, Thales offers solutions that ensure high connectivity as well as secure and interoperable communications. These include Aquilon, the new Fully Integrated Communications System (FICS) including SATCOM communications, which provides an “IP at sea” capability. Aquilon enables platforms to participate in Network Centric Operations and embeds Naval Force Intranet capability.

Maritime Surveillance System



Thales’s Maritime Surveillance System area offers a comprehensive range of flexible solutions from equipment to systems for effective monitoring of maritime safety, security and surveillance activities. These include shore based Maritime Surveillance System Solutions, which support the diverse needs of public and private authorities in charge of safety and security missions at sea.



Thales’s Satellite Surveillance Solutions use a high performance satellite constellation for worldwide maritime surveillance, providing large-scale detection of cooperative and non cooperative vessels. This is of great importance as France is the country with the largest maritime domain in Europe. There is thus a great need to monitor and protect it. A better maritime surveillance is requested by civilian and military end users and space systems are the most relevant ones to cover and monitor huge areas such as open seas.



In the domain of Coastal Surveillance, Thales’s long range coastal surveillance radar, the Coast Watcher 100, ensures the detection and tracking of surface and low altitude air targets. The radar, available in civil or military version, is also the new market reference for maintenance policy thanks to its fault tolerant architecture and simplified maintenance process. Even in a harsh environment, the radar has outstanding small target detection.



AMASCOS, a mission-proven Thales airborne maritime situation and control system, will also be on display at Euronaval. The system ensures the success of maritime surveillance, anti-surface and anti submarine warfare missions. It is designed for all types of platforms and combines a powerful tactical command and control subsystem based on the latest generation sensors and radars.

Services



Thales has earned an unrivalled service record with more than 50 navies around the world. For each customer, Thales covers the complete range of the support spectrum to suit increasing operational constraints and optimises in-service support cost. The Thales services offer is innovative and modular, tailored to each customer’s requirements.



CALAS is Thales’s answer to minimise its customer’s risks and costs by using a lightweight autonomous training target for Anti Submarine Warfare exercises at sea. A highly realistic simulation of submarine acoustic signatures and kinematics enables CALAS to be the light solution in sonar training.



Thanks to DARWIN-S, the in-service life of systems can be extended and optimised. Thales’s innovative approach in technology insertion offers customers a comprehensive and affordable range of services with incremental upgrade options.



NEPTUNE, the high-fidelity training service for airborne maritime surveillance, helps to prepare for tomorrows missions thanks to its latest simulation and training technologies. Thales can thus offer its maritime patrol customers a full range of technico-operational services.



Another example of Thales’s expertise in the services domain is NEWTON, a best of breed electronic warfare training service. It allows navy crews to practice electronic warfare drills regardless of whether their platform has a built-in defence aids suite, without the need for a costly electronic warfare range.



Smart Care is the advanced and proven Thales availability concept for complex systems. Its purpose is to enable global and optimised fleet management, at the best cost and through a modular, adaptable and progressive offer. There will be three demonstrations on the stand, related to Smart Care: an operational overview, an illustration of the availability engineering expertise that is required, as well as the interconnection of multiple information systems to support availability commitment in complex defence systems."
Security Assessment of Intrinsic-ID's PUF Technology Made Public by UNIQUE Partners - Yahoo News,"Tue, 02 Oct 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vc2VjdXJpdHktYXNzZXNzbWVudC1pbnRyaW5zaWMtaWRzLXB1Zi0wNzAwMDAxMjAuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"96 Unique ASICS - each chip includes 6 different PUF types

EINDHOVEN, THE NETHERLANDS--(Marketwire - Oct 2, 2012) - Thales and Intrinsic-ID teamed up with other partners in the European-funded UNIQUE project aimed at the protection of hardware against security vulnerabilities such as: counterfeiting, cloning, tampering and reverse engineering. The UNIQUE consortium published the results of the assessment, which focused on the practical aspects of Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) technology implementations such as reliability, uniqueness, requirements and robustness.

""This extensive security evaluation of PUFs at 65 nm, in which Thales Communications & Security has taken part, is the first of its kind to go public. We are pleased with the promising results that this PUF technology achieved in our assessment. Beyond the protection against counterfeiting, PUFs can be used to securely conceal cryptographic keys used by functions such as local memory protection,"" said Jérôme Quévremont (Head of a SoC/SoFPGA development lab, Thales). ""The PUF technology is a new security primitive that could in the future add a new layer of protection in security chips. Thales will continue to investigate PUF technology and has already started work in a new use case-based R&D project in collaboration with Intrinsic-ID.""

Security mechanisms using PUF technology aim at becoming an essential part of Hardware Intrinsic Security (HIS). HIS is based on the fact that secret keys are extracted like a silicon biometric or fingerprint from silicon hardware directly and only when required. Attackers have nothing to find because no key is stored nor present in the power down state.

""Our evaluation of SRAM PUFs as provided by Intrinsic-ID clearly shows a real protection against attacks like reverse engineering, SCA, light emission, and fault injection towards the key storage,"" added Jean-Christophe Courrège (ITSEF Technical Manager, Thales). ""PUF technology would provide a powerful solution to security product designers in order to address key management problems.""

UK reveals Hermes UAV crash rate in Afghanistan - Flightglobal,"Thu, 25 Oct 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vdWstcmV2ZWFscy1oZXJtZXMtdWF2LWNyYXNoLXJhdGUtaW4tYWZnaGFuaXN0YW4vMTA3NTUzLmFydGljbGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"British Army operations involving leased Elbit Systems Hermes 450 tactical unmanned air vehicles have recorded 11 crashes in the past five years, armed forces minister Andrew Robathan has revealed.

""Since 2007 there have been 11 Hermes 450 crashes in Afghanistan,"" Robathan said in response to a parliamentary question on 24 October. No accidents involving the type occurred in the UK during the same time period, he added.

Thales UK

""An end-to-end review for army unmanned aerial systems training has recently been conducted, which reported at the end of September 2012,"" Robathan said. ""As a result, several changes have already been made to increase airmanship standards in a number of areas, with further improvements to follow.""

Royal Artillery regiments only use the roughly 550kg (1,210lb) air vehicle on operations, but the army intends to conduct future training activities in the UK with its successor Watchkeeper system. An extensive redevelopment of the Israeli-produced Hermes 450, this is being supplied by Thales UK/Elbit joint venture company UTacS.

Contracted via Thales UK, the Ministry of Defence's interim arrangement to use leased UAVs has been extended while the Watchkeeper's introduction to service has suffered repeated schedule slips. More than 60,000 flight hours had been logged with Hermes 450s over Afghanistan and also previously Iraq under the urgent operational requirement service by early this year. The aircraft carries an electro-optical/infrared sensor payload to provide intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance cover.

A date of late 2012 has previously been referred to for the Watchkeeper system's debut use in Afghanistan, but efforts are now being focused on achieving full civil certification before this milestone will be met. Each new air vehicle to enter use under the programme will undergo flight trials from the ParcAberporth test centre in west Wales, with this activity due to conclude during 2015.

"DCNS to unveil new FREMM-ER Frigate variant, updated BRAVE supply ship design at Euronaval 2012 - Navy Recognition","Thu, 04 Oct 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi1wFodHRwczovL25hdnlyZWNvZ25pdGlvbi5jb20vaW5kZXgucGhwL25hdmFsLW5ld3MvbmF2YWwtZXhoaWJpdGlvbnMvMjAxMi1hcmNoaXZlLW5hdmFsLWV4aGliaXRvbnMvZXVyb25hdmFsLTIwMTIvNjQ0LWRjbnMtdG8tdW52ZWlsLW5ldy1mcmVtbS1lci1mcmlnYXRlLXZhcmlhbnQtdXBkYXRlZC1icmF2ZS1zdXBwbHktc2hpcC1kZXNpZ24tYXQtZXVyb25hdmFsLTIwMTIuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The FREMM-ER was designed with a focus on Air Defense and possibly Anti Ballistic Missile Defense. The hull and general platform of the vessel is almost identical to the French Navy's and DCNS' FREMM class. However the two masts (Herakles radar and electronic warfare) found on the current FREMM (such as the Aquitaine frigate) is replaced by a new radar by Thales called SF 500 (or Sea Fire 500). The new Thales radar seems to be similar in concept to the Lockheed Martin's AEGIS - AN/SPY-1D multi-function phased-array radar system with its four fixed arrays noticeable on all 4 sides of the main mast.



Contacted by Navy Recognition DCNS and Thales representatives would not give details on the new radar system, explaining details would be made public during Euronaval. Regarding the vessel itself however, DCNS told us that a FREMM-ER would be able to fulfill the exact same missions as the current FREMM. Indeed, FREMM-ER has the same multi-mission capabilities as FREMM, in particular extensions capability can be installed on FREMM-ER such as:

- Increased ASW capabilities with a VDS (variable depth sonar)

- Increased land attack capabilities with MDCN (Scalp Naval by MBDA)



FREMM-ER's CIC (Combat Information Center) shares the same characteristics as the CIC found on FREMM:

- Large workstations

- Multipurpose Consoles

- Modular configuration



The SETIS modular CMS (Combat Management System) developed by DCNS and the CIC area can implement new and future innovations as they become mature. In FREMM-ER, sailors for example will be able to use augmented reality in the fight against asymmetric threats.
