Thales Alenia Space UK to Introduce 'Mini-GEO' Satellite Bus - Via Satellite,"Tue, 29 Jul 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhdGVsbGl0ZXRvZGF5LmNvbS9pbm5vdmF0aW9uLzIwMTQvMDcvMjkvdGhhbGVzLXVrLXRvLWludHJvZHVjZS1taW5pLWdlby1zYXRlbGxpdGUtYnVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"[Via Satellite 07-29-2014] Thales Alenia Space’s recently created subsidiary Thales Alenia Space U.K. is preparing to take on a major company project, according to CEO Martin Gee. Roughly three months after forming, the subsidiary is planning to take a lead role in the creation of a new “mini” geostationary satellite bus.

“Thales Alenia Space has made of lot of progress in the development of constellations with, for example, the elite-bus platform,” Gee told Via Satellite. “We are now looking to take this engineering forward into a mini-GEO [satellite].”

Gee said the project is an ambition within Thales Alenia Space U.K. as well as other European subsidiaries, and will offer a “launch weight no more than 1.5 tons, 3 kW of power, and up to 12 channels.” Thales Alenia Space U.K. is making major moves in the program, drawing from the expertise gained through the recent acquisition of Systems Engineering and Assessment Limited’s (SEA’s) space activities branch. Currently, SEA is working with Thales Alenia Space on EarthCARE, Bepicolombo and ExoMars satellite programs. According to Gee, the acquisition grew Thales Alenia Space U.K. to slightly more than 60 staff and broadened space program activity. The company can leverage knowledge gained from other projects and apply it to the mini-GEO satellite, Gee said.

“We are exploring this by looking at what opportunities we could have here in the U.K., and developing this in addition to the activities we are carrying out across the Neosat program. This federative program can also open the door to future observation or scientific missions from GEO orbits including local companies and labs in the U.K.,” he said.

Gee said the European Space Agency’s (ESA’s) Neosat program has had a heavy influence on the mini-GEO project. ESA has set the goal of reducing the cost of operating a satellite in orbit by 30 percent. Thales Alenia Space and Airbus Defence and Space are both working on the Neosat next generation satellite program under contracts from ESA. In addition to this, Thales Alenia Space’s work with electric propulsion is another strong influence. In May 2014 the company signed a new contract with Snecma for plasma thrusters. Gee said electric propulsion is a top strength for the subsidiary.

“[Electric propulsion] gives Thales Alenia Space U.K. the opportunity to contribute to [the mini-GEO satellite]. The expertise that we are developing and the relationship we have developed are because of electric propulsion. For the small GEO-satellite I believe electric propulsion is the way to go.”

The U.K. Space Agency’s ambition to grow the country’s role in the global space industry, such that 10 percent of it is domestic, attracted the attention of Thales Alenia Space, but is also alluring to others. Lockheed Martin recently opened a space technology office in Harwell, Oxford. There will be areas of overlap, fostering more competition within Great Britain, but Gee said the build-up of the country’s space industry “can only be encouraging.” He is confident that as more companies place stakes in the country, there will not be too much competitive overlap.

Thales Alenia Space U.K. is temporarily looking to pull resources from France, Spain and Italy for support. Gee said other Thales subsidiaries will enable the company to bolster quality assurance, manufacturing techniques, inspection and even some assembly. As momentum builds in the new satellite project, Gee expressed confidence that it will generate strong interest in the satellite communications market.

“It could lend itself to other missions as well, but primarily the mini-GEO would be telecoms,” he said. “Whether it will be Ka broadband or small missions in DTH … it’s an area that we feel there could be a market for now and in the future.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999693751335144}",neutral,0.999693751335144,0
FARNBOROUGH: Thales develops new missile for UAVs | News | Flight Global - Flightglobal,"Mon, 14 Jul 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vY2l2aWwtdWF2cy9mYXJuYm9yb3VnaC10aGFsZXMtZGV2ZWxvcHMtbmV3LW1pc3NpbGUtZm9yLXVhdnMvMTEzNzUzLmFydGljbGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales has introduced a freefall variant of its precision-guided Lightweight Multirole Missile (LMM) suited for integration on a wide range of unmanned air vehicles (UAVs).

The company partnered with Textron Systems around 18 months ago to perform integration of the 6kg munition on-board an undisclosed UAV, which the partnership is now ready to bring to market.

A 70cm- (27.5in) long, 7.6cm-wide munition with a 2kg (4.4lb) warhead that provides a precision strike – including against armoured vehicles – it utilises an inertial navigation system with optional GPS as well as semi-active laser guidance.

Thales

In June it was announced that Thales would provide the standard configuration of LMM for the UK Royal Navy’s AgustaWestland Wildcat attack helicopters under the Future Anti-Surface Guided Weapons Light (FASGW-L) programme. The LMM will provide a light missile for the navy to use against small boats, fast attack craft and other small targets

“We’re launching this off the back of that good news,” Ricky Adair, sales and marketing director at Thales UK, tells Flight Daily News. “There is a gap in the market…and there is a requirement to prosecute and engage when required.”

Adair says that UAVs have proven their worth as intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance assets, but operators are looking at increasing the capability of those aircraft – especially considering the cost of close air support using manned aircraft.

“We have been working tirelessly to prove this capability,” Adair says.

The company says it is platform neutral, with the UAV's payload the only factor. “We’re looking at creative ways to integrate innovatively to put more of these on-board [UAVs],” he says.

Thales will be able to deliver the freefall LMM in 12 months of receiving an order, and testing for potential customers is due to take place soon.

Textron manufactures UAVs including the RQ-7 Shadow in operation with the US Army and US Marine Corps, and the Aerosonde - designated XMQ-19A in US service.

Does physical fitness improve cognition? - Psychology Today,"Wed, 02 Jul 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBzeWNob2xvZ3l0b2RheS5jb20vdXMvYmxvZy9zbWFydC1tb3Zlcy8yMDE0MDcvaGVhbHRoeS1ib2R5LWFuZC1hLXNvdW5kLW1pbmTSAVxodHRwczovL3d3dy5wc3ljaG9sb2d5dG9kYXkuY29tL3VzL2Jsb2cvc21hcnQtbW92ZXMvMjAxNDA3L2hlYWx0aHktYm9keS1hbmQtYS1zb3VuZC1taW5kP2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Roman poet Juvenile (in his Satires 10.356-64), writing around the 1st Century AD, famously popularized the view that there was a close relationship between physical health and mental power, with the maxim,



“Mens sana in corpore sano” “a sound mind in a healthy body”

In fact, Juvenile was probably paraphrasing an earlier saying attributed to the ancient Greek philosopher Thales, writing around 600 BC, and who is variously identified as the first philosopher and the first scientist. Thales offered a simple prescription for the good life that still seems plausible today:

“Who is happy? ‘The person who has a healthy body, a resourceful mind and a docile nature.’

It is Juvenile who is usually credited with starting the long tradition of linking the development and functioning of the mind and of the body that continues to the present day. In fact, for most of this time this tradition competed rather unsuccessfully with another, present in the writing of an earlier Greek thinker, Plato, and certain strands of the Christian religion, but most commonly associated with the French philosopher René Descartes. This ‘Cartesian’ view portrayed the body not as an inseparable partner of the mind, but as its rather low-rent vessel. It is not difficult to see the influences of this view on most models of schooling and their distinctively disembodied conceptions of human beings, in which the mind is both the subject and object of education, and the body is relegated to a service role that is separate and inferior.

It is only quite recently that science has really caught up with the insights of the ancient Greek to the extent that it can now speak with confidence about the relationships between the body and the mind, and from the perspective of our interests, between physical activity and mental functioning. The evidence is beginning to suggest that Juvenile and Thales may have been on to something.

As was discussed in my last post, serious interest in this issue among researchers can be traced back to the 1960s and 1970s, when scientists began to undertake simple experiments assessing the relationships between levels of physical activity, intellectual performance and educational achievement. At the time, ambition and interest were not matched by access to robust scientific measures, so findings remained frustratingly cautious. More rigorous scientific investigations of the relationship of the brain and physical activity began in the early 1980s, due in large part to advances in scientific measurement and tools. It was around this time, for example, that researchers discovered that physical activity led to an increase in the secretion of endorphins (hormones secreted within the brain and nervous system with a number of physiological functions). This effect was found to be linked to a variety of psychological changes, such as positive mood state changes and improved concentration, and physical changes to the brain, such as increased blood flow, growth of nerve cells in the brain's center of learning and memory, increased density of networks of nerve cells, and increased brain tissue volume.

Numerous tests and measures have been developed since this time. Some of these infer cognitive processes from the observation of behavior (such as the ability to pass psychological or educational tests), while others have been developed that allowed direct measures of brain activity (such as Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, fMRI, and Electroencephalography, EEG). The development of these sorts of technologies has offered a new perspective on the subject of physical activity, fitness, and learning.

Let us focus, for now, on the issue of physical fitness.

It now seems fairly clear that increased physical fitness, especially cardiorespiratory (aka aerobic) fitness, positively effects the brain in numerous ways. Some of the most impressive evidence comes from older people, for whom improved physical capacity can significantly enhance both the quality and quantity of life. Research with children and young people is less advanced, but it is becoming increasingly apparent that fitness is associated with improved cognitive functioning among this group, too. In fact, it seems safe to say that cognitive functioning of people of all ages benefits from increased levels of physical fitness.

There have now been many scientific studies in this area, and I will discuss some of the most significant of these in later blog posts. Let me just mention one particularly interesting set of findings that came from Sweden and examined physical fitness, intelligence performance, and school achievement. This was not an intervention or experiment, but rather was a statistical analysis of a huge sample of data (from 1,221,727 people), from every man born from 1950 through 1976 who were enlisted for military service at age 18.

Analysis of this data set revealed a positive association between cardiovascular fitness and performance in intelligence tests at age 18, and changes in physical fitness measures between 15 years and 18 years predicted cognitive performance at 18 years. In addition, it was found that cardiovascular fitness during early adulthood predicted socioeconomic status and educational attainment later in life. So the contribution of increased fitness on cognitive functioning seems to trigger a ripple effect that can ‘nudge’ towards improved performance in related domains, such as examination success and later employment.

While there is a growing consensus regarding the cognitive virtues of physical fitness among researchers, there remains some debate about the underlying neurological mechanisms. As will be seen in subsequent Smart Moves posts, many researchers discuss the ""executive function hypothesis,"" which frames discussions of fitness in terms of its influence on the cognitive processes required to select, organize, and properly initiate goal-directed actions. The authors of the Swedish study interpreted their findings in terms of two other hypotheses: ""the brain plasticity hypothesis,"" according to which fitness supports the brain’s ability to adapt to external conditions and challenges; and the ‘'cardiovascular fitness hypothesis,"" in which cardiovascular or aerobic fitness acts as a mediator of changes to cognitive functioning.

Experimental studies offer support for these findings. Specifically, intervention studies using vigorous aerobic-based exercise in children reported improved performance in a range of cognitive tasks. Interestingly, the effect seems to be restricted to cardiovascular fitness and does not include muscular strength, which suggests that it is greater cardiovascular efficiency that facilitates cognitive functioning. In other words, fitter people’s brains work more effectively.

From the point of view of education, the effects reported here make an compelling case, since they go to the heart of learning and achievement in school. The improvements to mood and concentration enhance what could be called the mindset of learning, because fitter children tend to approach academic tasks with a more positive attitude and greater attention than their unfit peers. At the same time, the changes to the efficient functioning of the brain relate to the mechanisms of learning. In other words, the evidence from these tests suggest that physical activity can improve students' mental state while learning, and the efficiency with which they learn.

If a pharmaceutical drug was available that had been demonstrated to have such positive effects on children’s performance at school, I suspect that even the most cautious of parents would be lining the streets outside pharmacies. Physical activity is not a wonder drug, it has no harmful side effects, and it is free!

ATR selects ACSS ADS-B Out transponder for ATR 42/72-600 aircraft - Military & Aerospace Electronics,"Mon, 14 Jul 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5taWxpdGFyeWFlcm9zcGFjZS5jb20vY29tbWVyY2lhbC1hZXJvc3BhY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS8xNDIyNzgwNi9hdHItc2VsZWN0cy1hY3NzLWFkcy1iLW91dC10cmFuc3BvbmRlci1mb3ItYXRyLTQyLTcyLTYwMC1haXJjcmFmdNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The NXT-600 is DO-260B- and DO-181E-compliant to meet EUROCONTROL’s 2015 mandate and the 2020 FAA NextGen mandate for ADS-B Out capability. The NXT-600 complements other cockpit surveillance equipment on the 600 Series, including the ACSS T2CAS.

“ATR and ACSS have maintained a strong relationship for many years,” says Terry Flaishans, president of ACSS. “ATR certified our T2CAS for the ATR-500 and -600, which integrates seamlessly with our NXT-600 next-generation transponder. We are excited to continue our partnership with ATR and help them be one of the first to market with a DO-260B-compliant transponder.”

As the cornerstone technology of the FAA’s NextGen and EUROCONTROL’s Single European Sky Air Traffic Management Research (SESAR) airspace initiatives, ADS-B increases capacity and throughput for air transportation, providing more precise position information of own-ship and other airplane traffic to the cockpit.

Optimized for flight in the NextGen air traffic environment, the NXT-600 and NXT-800 (4 MCU) transponders transmit own-ship flight parameters to other aircraft and air traffic control (ATC). The higher level of ADS-B Out (DO-260B) transmission includes precise flight data, including position, speed, and intent of the aircraft.

In the NextGen air traffic environment, ADS-B Out information can be used in the cockpit for ADS-B In, which delivers even more capabilities through products, such as ACSS’s SafeRoute. Applications include SafeRoute-Interval Management (IM), In-Trail Procedures (ITP), CDTI Assisted Visual Separation (CAVS) and Surface Area Movement Management (SAMM). These optional capabilities are certified and operating today on A330, B757 and B767 aircraft. Deliveries of the NXT-600 for the production ATRs are expected to begin by the end of 2014 and will provide aftermarket opportunities for ATR retrofits.

ATR is well known in the regional aviation market; ATR turboprop aircraft are among the most eco-friendly regional airplanes and are known for efficiency, reliability, and economics on short-haul routes. More than 180 operators fly ATRs in more than 90 countries worldwide. ATR is an equal partnership between two major European aeronautics players, the Airbus Group and Alenia Aermacchi (a Finmeccanica Group company).","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9990805387496948}",positive,0.9990805387496948,1

The contract award was announced today at the Farnborough International Air Show by Philip Dunne MP, Minister for Defence Equipment, Support and Technology.

The two missiles are the MBDA FASGW(Heavy)/ANL (Future Anti Surface Guided Weapon (Heavy)/ Anti Navire Léger) and the Thales Light Multirole Missile (LMM) (FASGW (Light)). Both will be integrated onto the AW159 Wildcat to give it the ability to attack a wide range of surface targets ranging from small high speed surface craft up to large surface vessels such as corvettes, as well as coastal and land targets.

Finmeccanica – AgustaWestland, said “We are delighted to have secured this contract to equip the Wildcat with these two new technology missiles which will give the Royal Navy an exceptional and flexible anti-surface warfare capability.”

The AW159 Wildcat will be able to carry up to four launchers, two per weapon carrier, each with up to five LMM missiles, or up to four FASGW(H)/ANL missiles with two on each weapon carrier. It will also be able to carry a mixed load of LMM launchers and FASGW(H)/ANL missiles for maximum mission flexibility.

The MBDA FASGW(Heavy)/ANL features a high speed, two-way data-link that communicates the images “seen” by the missile’s seeker to the operator, who, in addition to initiating an autonomous engagement, can alternatively remain in control of the missile throughout the full duration of its flight. This optional, man in the loop monitor and control facility enables new capabilities such as: in-flight re-targeting; final aim point correction and refinement; and safe abort.

Ultimately, the missile will be able to engage targets situated out of direct line of sight when the launch platform is able to benefit from third party target designation or laser illumination.

The Thales LMM is a lightweight, precision strike, missile that has been designed to provide a rapid reaction to a wide range of surface naval threats from small ships and fast inshore attack craft as well as on-land surface threats.

The work on this contract will be mainly completed at AgustaWestland’s facility in Yeovil which employs over 3,300 people to undertake the design, development and manufacture of helicopters and the integration of their systems, and provide through life training and support services.

L&T's engg services arm set for next step - Business Standard,"Thu, 24 Jul 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzLXN0YW5kYXJkLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2NvbXBhbmllcy9sLXQtcy1lbmdnLXNlcnZpY2VzLWFybS1zZXQtZm9yLW5leHQtc3RlcC0xMTQwNzIyMDExNTBfMS5odG1s0gF1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3Mtc3RhbmRhcmQuY29tL2FtcC9hcnRpY2xlL2NvbXBhbmllcy9sLXQtcy1lbmdnLXNlcnZpY2VzLWFybS1zZXQtZm9yLW5leHQtc3RlcC0xMTQwNzIyMDExNTBfMS5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"After establishing itself as an independent company earlier this year, L&T Technology Services, a fully-owned subsidiary of Larsen & Toubro (L&T), is set to explore inorganic growth.



Late last month, the Mumbai-headquartered company took a controlling stake in Thales Software India , a Chennai-based captive software arm of Thales, the French defence major. It has now set its sights on acquisitions in client countries. The company is looking at strengthening its presence abroad by acquiring companies with niche engineering skills, aiming to establish a local face.



“Hopefully, we are going to have one more M&A (merger and acquisition) soon, though this time it would be a complete buy-out. It will be a multi-geography acquisition, which can give us not only experienced engineering talents but also local interface, since we have to show local faces in places where we are doing business,” Keshab Panda, chief executive, told Business Standard. ""If everything goes well, we can do it quite quickly.""



While the acquisition of Thales Software India is expected to strengthen the company’s avionics business, the new joint venture will now be able to participate in offset opportunities with L&T as the Indian partner. Under the offset clause, defence suppliers are required to re-invest a certain percentage of overall procurement costs in India.



L&T Technology Services owes its origin to parent L&T, which in 2010 transferred its integrated engineering services business to the former. This was followed by transfer of the telecom and high-tech product engineering services business from L&T Infotech, in January this year, as a part of which around 1,800 engineers were transferred. The company now has 9,500 people, with a compound annual growth rate of 37 per cent during the past four years. The annual revenue is presently estimated at $400 million (Rs 2,400 crore).



Panda said they'd look at acquiring companies which will be easy to integrate. “I strongly believe that 75 per cent of M&A fails because of integration issues. So, we won’t acquire anything which would be difficult to integrate. I also believe any M&A we do should not be more than $50 mn in valuation,” he added.



In a media interview in June, L&T group executive chairman A M Naik had said the company was looking at listing its technologies subsidiaries, L&T Technology Services and L&T Infotech. The process would start from July 2016, he'd said.



Declining to comment on this plan for an Initial Public Offer, Panda said his objective was to make the company the leader in India's engineering services space.



“We are trying to create an organisation which is going to stand out, where people will be excited about what they do, and one which creates value for all stakeholders,” he said.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9536446928977966}",neutral,0.9536446928977966,0

Thales is the first big winner when it comes to traffic management, winning contracts worth nearly £30m to develop its technology at Cardiff and Romford. RTM spoke to the company’s programme lead David Taylor.

It has been nearly two years since Network Rail awarded the contracts to three companies to develop prototype traffic management systems – an “integral” part of the wider plans to consolidate the work done at hundreds of signal boxes into 12 all-singing, all-dancing rail operating centres (ROCs).

That plan has been well-documented in previous issues, but focuses on the need to allocate workload more evenly to improve productivity, from an average of 72 SEUs (signalling equivalent units) per workstation at £3,800 per SEU at end 2011/12 to 91 SEUs per workstation at £3,200 per SEU by the end of CP5.

Some signallers and commenters have suggested the strategy has a whiff of ‘eggs in one basket’, but Network Rail says the current wide variance in the methods and geography of railway control is a major problem, from VDU workstations with wide spans of control down to mechanical lever frame signal boxes. Consolidation also allows integration with electrical control and better joint working with TOCs.

Linked with those plans, a modern traffic management system automates some tasks and offers better real-time data to experienced operators for others, allowing – hopefully – prediction and resolution of real-time conflicts, just-in-time planning, and reconfigurable control areas to manage disruption.

Advance notice of problems

Following rigorous testing, Thales UK won contracts worth a combined £28.8m to deploy its version of the technology – ARAMIS – at two ROCs, Cardiff and Romford.

Thales’ programme lead David Taylor told us: “Fundamentally, it improves performance.

“Our solution does enable certain things to be done in an automated way, but it is more about helping the operator. Today’s systems often don’t see a potential problem until it is just about to occur.

“Operators, quite frankly, do an incredible job to mitigate the impact of those problems. But traffic management gives them ‘advance notice’ of issues and allows them to minimise the impact of those issues or completely eradicate them, before they become service-affecting and cause delays.

“The system identifies different types of conflicts, for example, and then the operator can either manually resolve those conflicts, they can take guidance from the system, or the system can be set to address them automatically.”

These benefits in tackling conflicts to prevent incidents having major repercussions are a key benefit of a traffic management system, but it can also improve day-to-day performance by, for example, improving flow through complex junctions.

“It enables the operators to focus more on ensuring the trains are arriving on time than today, when the manual elements mean they cannot focus so closely on that.

“There is quite a difference from today’s way of working with signallers and control room staff, to what we would regard as traffic managers or train service managers.”

Whatever you call them, they will have access to better-quality and real-time consolidated data compared to today, pulling in GPS radio tracking, train describer information, and so on. Disruption management and optimum pathing will be much easier, while the live data can also be passed straight to drivers via their DAS, to take account of potential conflicts.

Robin Gisby, Network Rail’s managing director of network operations, said: “As the number of people and businesses relying on rail continues to grow, it is vital we have the technology to make the best use of Britain’s rail infrastructure. The traffic management which will be deployed on the network uses tried and tested technology used on railways around the world to help deliver a leaner, more efficient and reliable network.”

Customisable architecture

Versions of Thales’s technology are in use in 11 countries, it says. It won’t be quite as simple as just dropping it onto the UK rail network and watching it go, but Taylor said its design allows it to be easily configurable to any country’s rail network.

It’s well-proven in busy mixed traffic environments such as Germany, he added.

There were three chosen prototype suppliers – Thales, Hitachi with its Tranista system and Signalling Solutions Ltd (SSL, the joint Alstom Transport Information Solutions UK and Balfour Beatty Rail business that has grown into a major player in recent years), which is using ICONIS. After two “very comprehensive” pre-qualification documents, supplier dialogue sessions and over 40 workshops, all three suppliers were set up in ‘model offices’.

Scenario testing

From summer 2013, 18 Network Rail and TOC evaluators spent a month in each model office, running different scenarios, using real data from the Leeds area (nearly 1,600 trains a day, 35 stations and 87 TIPLOCs).

Operators weren’t aware of the precise scenario until the beginning of each day, and observers oversaw how they were able to use each traffic management system to improve performance, and compare that with a typical day without such a decision support system.

Taylor said: “That ‘model office’ process was very comprehensive and rigorous, and has done a great deal to build everyone’s confidence. It is something that we in Thales are now recommending to our colleagues in other countries when we provide traffic management. It builds confidence and de-risks the implementation.”

Network Rail has taken an approach that ensures the system it chooses can be rolled out “virtually anywhere” without the need for major upgrades, integrating it with the existing signalling infrastructure.

Wider benefits

Traffic management systems can also improve the possession management process. It ensures decisions are taken based on the real current timetable, as opposed to the planned timetable, Taylor said. “There are other associated technologies available, related to traffic management, that can also improve communications at times of possession and that is something we know Network Rail are considering.""

Ultimately, an efficient and effective traffic management system would also provide and incorporate data that would help with rolling stock allocation and train crew rostering and deployment.

LINX

Thales was not the only winner announced in May. SSL won the smaller £3.4m contract for traffic management LINX development, delivery and support, with completion scheduled for December 2015. LINX, the Layered Information Network Exchange, provides the integration between the traffic management system, the background information systems (from timetable planning to the customer information via Project Darwin) and the physical aspects of signalling via the remote interlocking infrastructure.

The LINX development ensures there will be a standard way of interfacing between those systems and different traffic management systems – as although Thales has been chosen for Cardiff and Romford, Hitachi and SSL are still in the running for other contracts under the national roll-out of traffic management.

Although 63 companies expressed initial interest in providing Network Rail’s traffic management system, only those three are on the framework to provide it. The most controversial exclusion was DeltaRail (see the News section).

Different routes, different priorities

The roll-out of traffic management at the other ROCs will be subject to future competitions. Five of these ROCs are, like Cardiff, at existing locations – Derby (East Midlands), Didcot (Thames Valley), Edinburgh, Glasgow and Gillingham (North Kent) – while five, like Romford, are based at new buildings – Basingstoke, Manchester, Rugby, Three Bridges and York.

“Each route has slightly different priorities,” Taylor said “Clearly a lot can be learned from the first two that are implemented [at Cardiff and Romford], but I think it will be a decision taken on a route-by-route basis by Network Rail. We expect this to always be competitive.

“This really is about the focus on performance. “We all spend a lot of time on trains and we want the train to arrive on time and anything that can be done to improve that is worth doing. And of course it is not just about the passenger, it is about freight as well. Both the freight operating companies and the train operating companies have been really involved in this and that is good, because without their involvement going through the implementation, the system won’t deliver the potential that it can deliver.”

Victor Chavez, CEO of Thales UK, added: “Our selection for this first phase of the traffic management system programme is a huge step in our relationship with Network Rail, and we are hugely excited to bring our global traffic management system expertise to the UK. This is a great example of how we can leverage our significant domestic and global resources to help Network Rail achieve their goals and fulfil their future technology strategy requirements.”
