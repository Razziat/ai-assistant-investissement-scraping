Thales avionics systems fly on Boeing 787 Dreamliner - Military & Aerospace Electronics,"Sat, 23 Jan 2010 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pbGl0YXJ5YWVyb3NwYWNlLmNvbS9jb21tZXJjaWFsLWFlcm9zcGFjZS9hcnRpY2xlLzE0MjI0NjM2L3RoYWxlcy1hdmlvbmljcy1zeXN0ZW1zLWZseS1vbi1ib2VpbmctNzg3LWRyZWFtbGluZXLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"NEUILLY-SUR-SEINE, France, 23 Jan. 2010.Flight displays, an in-flight entertainment (IFE) system, and an electrical power conversion system from Thales are flying onboard the Boeing 787 Dreamliner.

The Thales Integrated Standby Flight Display (ISFD) displays the 787 navigation parameters in one unit ergonomically designed to reduce pilot workload. The ISFD features a liquid crystal display (LCD) that allows pilots to read the aircraft's pitch and roll attitude, airspeed, altitude, as well as heading and landing approach deviation data in a format similar to a standard primary flight display screen.

Thales and Boeing have been working together since 2004 to design and develop a new lightweight IFE system as part of the 787 program. This system is based on Thales's TopSeries family of IFE systems, which supports connectivity technology and personal electronic device usage. The system integrates broadband communications, on-demand entertainment (music and movies), and in-seat power to accommodate personal electronic devices. Thales designed the system as an onboard intranet with digital servers that store terabytes of data gigabit, Ethernet networks throughout the cabin, seat equipment that includes passenger monitor displays and entertainment control units to navigate through the menu options.

Boeing has designed the Dreamliner with a structure up to 50 percent derived from composite plastic materials, meaning the aircraft is relatively light. The offshoot of this lighter structure is a 20 percent reduction in fuel requirements compared to existing models in its category.

Thales has contributed to weight reductions achieved for the B787, by creating lightweight systems that together can reduce airlines' carbon footprints and operating costs..

Boeing has selected Thales's electrical power conversion technology to power the consumer systems onboard the 787 with the least environmental impact. These systems, both conventional and new, include Thales IFE, as well as electrical environmental control systems and the electrical brake system.

Thales's power conversion system contributes to the low weight requirements through its high-power density, Thales officials say. Lightweight electrical circuits now replace some hydraulic circuits, meaning a greater range of systems are now powered by electricity. The next-generation power conversion system includes a transformer and rectifier solution that supports the 787 high-voltage DC network. Boeing chose Thales's lithium-ion battery technology for the 787 low-voltage DC emergency back-up subsystem.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998087286949158}",neutral,0.9998087286949158,0
Bidding for Military Communication Network System in Mudslinging - 코리아타임스,"Wed, 06 Jan 2010 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtvcmVhdGltZXMuY28ua3Ivd3d3L25hdGlvbi8yMDI0LzA0LzExM181ODU4Ny5odG1s0gE-aHR0cHM6Ly9tLmtvcmVhdGltZXMuY28ua3IvcGFnZXMvYXJ0aWNsZS5hbXAuYXNwP25ld3NJZHg9NTg1ODc?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Jung Sung-kiStaff ReporterA 4-trillion-won project to equip the nation's armed forces with the most up-to-date military communication network system is in rough-and-tumble shape due to heated competition between bidders.The Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA) is conducting an in-house audit of the bidding for the program ― the development of the Tactical Information Communication Network (TICN) ― after two bidders filed complaints with the agency over alleged foul play by their competitor.As a result, the already long-delayed program, which was initiated in 2003, is expected to see a further delay.The TICN is a cutting-edge digital command-and-control and sensor-to-shooter battlefield system expected to replace the existing SPIDER communication systems run by the Army by 2020.It is designed to advance into a high-speed, large-capacity, long-distance wireless relay transmission system. SPIDER can only transmit still images and voice data, but TICN allows for the integrated transmission of video, image and voice data at more than 10 times the current speed.Last August, DAPA opened a bid for the full-scale development of TICN, following two years of exploratory development from 2007 to 2008. The agency said it would select final bidders by the end of October.Two precision electronics makers, Samsung Thales and LIG Nex1, responded to DAPA's request for proposal (RFP) for the program that includes six sub-categories, including a Network Management System (NMS), High Capacity Trunk Radio (HCTR) and Tactical Multi-band and Multi-role Radio (TMMR).During the exploratory development period, Samsung Thales was in charge of the NMS development and two other subsystems, while LIG Nex1 took charge of TMMR. Among the subsystems, the development of TMMR is considered the most lucrative one, worth about 1.5 trillion won.Samsung Thales has sought to take over the TMMR portion of the full-scale development.DAPA considered Samsung Thales' offer positively during the first evaluation in October, sources said, as the joint venture between Samsung and French defense firm Thales said it could reduce development time by a year and also cut costs by 300 billion won.LIG Nex1, however, raised the issue of whether or not Samsung Thales had received the required Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) certification level. The five-level CMMI is a process improvement framework that organizations use to improve their ability to build and maintain quality products and services.The U.S.-based Software Engineering Institute (SEI) awards the certification which is valid for three years.As for the TICN program, DAPA requested a bidder with a CMMI level 3 or more as part of its more than 200 evaluation criteria.LIG Nex1, which has the highest CMMI level of 5, argues Samsung Thales falsely stated in its RFP that it had a CMMI level of 4 despite the fact that the certification had already expired.Samsung officials rebutted the claim, saying the firm simply listed the records of its CMMI acquisition and didn't mean to cheat the agency. Samsung Thales has a level 3 certification, which was awarded in 2007, according to the officials.The firm last month successfully applied for level 5 and will receive certification by as early as late this month, they say.After accepting LIG's compliant, the agency decided to review bidders RFPs again in November, but Samsung Thales this time filed complaints over an alleged connection between LIG and DAPA members.Samsung claimed that one of the DAPA officials who participated in the second round of the selection committee provided an LIG official with the results of the committee meeting via text message.A DAPA spokesman said the in-house audit will be finished Friday and the selection process will be re-launched no later than March.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9990302324295044}",neutral,0.9990302324295044,0
Globalstar's 2nd-generation System Slated To Begin Launching This Fall - SpaceNews,"Fri, 29 Jan 2010 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9nbG9iYWxzdGFycy0ybmQtZ2VuZXJhdGlvbi1zeXN0ZW0tc2xhdGVkLWJlZ2luLWxhdW5jaGluZy1mYWxsL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"ROME — Mobile satellite services provider Globalstar expects its first six second-generation satellites to be launched aboard a Russian Soyuz rocket in September, with a second six-satellite launch to occur in December or early in 2011, officials from Globalstar and its satellite and rocket providers said here Jan. 27.

Milpitas, Calif.-based Globalstar, whose current 46-satellite constellation is suffering from suspected radiation-caused degradation to its two-way voice service, said two more six-satellite launches of Soyuz rockets from Russia’s Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan are scheduled for 2011.

These four launches will complete the set of 24 second-generation satellites for which Globalstar has secured financing. Officials said the company’s banking consortium will await initial revenue results from these spacecraft before agreeing to finance construction of the remaining 24 satellites.

Globalstar and its satellite prime contractor, Thales Alenia Space of France and Italy, have negotiated contract terms for the full 48-satellite constellation.

Addressing a press briefing here, Anthony J. Navarra, president of the company’s global operations, said the full suite of second-generation Globalstar features, including data-transmission speeds of up to 256 kilobits per second compared with the 9.6 kilobits available today, will await further upgrades to the network’s ground infrastructure in 2012.

The second-generation satellites are taking shape at Thales Alenia Space’s satellite-assembly facility here. The first batch of six satellites is scheduled to be shipped to the Baikonur launch site in July.

Once they are launched, Globalstar will take several weeks to test the spacecraft in orbit. Globalstar’s insurance underwriters are insisting on proof that the spacecraft — which represent a substantial design change from the first-generation satellites — function as planned before more are launched.

Navarra and Rene Serret, Thales Alenia Space’s Globalstar project manager, said the new satellites feature radiation-hardened components and a design that places sensitive gear well inside the satellite’s frame to help shield it from the radiation environment in Globalstar’s operating orbit of 1,414 kilometers.

“Almost all the satellites’ vital functions are redundant,” Serret said, meaning each satellite carries backup units of the critical components. He said that the company has designed the radiation-sensitive parts with sufficient safety margin to ensure they will function under exposure to radiation substantially higher than that expected in orbit.

These and other improvements have doubled the contracted service life of the second-generation satellites to 15 years compared with 7.5 years for the first generation. The improvements have also sharply increased the launch weight, from 550 kilograms for the first-generation satellites to 700 kilograms for the second generation.

Navarra said 20 of Globalstar’s satellites currently in orbit, including eight that were launched in 2007 — the rest were launched between 1998 and 2000 —continue to make use of their two-way communications capability.

By placing the first 24 second-generation satellites in areas needed to fill gaps in voice communications, Globalstar expects to be able to return to full two-way capability well before the second batch of 24 satellites is launched sometime after 2011.

Globalstar’s nominal 48-satellite constellation consists of six satellites in each of eight orbital planes.

Alex Mademba-Sy, Globalstar project manager at the Arianespace launch consortium of Evry, France — which, through its Starsem affiliate, commercializes Soyuz rockets from Baikonur — said a newly designed dispenser will carry the six second-generation Globalstar spacecraft into orbit under the payload fairing of the Soyuz-Fregat rocket.

The dispenser, built by Astrium Space Transportation of Les Mureaux, France, completed testing in December. A final flight-qualification review is scheduled for February, Mademba-Sy said. The Baikonur launch pad that will host the Globalstar launches rarely has been used in the past couple of years and will require maintenance work scheduled between April and June, he said.

Navarra said an upgrade of Globalstar’s seven gateway Earth stations that control the constellation is expected to be completed by June.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999873638153076}",neutral,0.9999873638153076,0
French Helios 2B Spy Sat Sends Back First Test Images - SpaceNews,"Mon, 04 Jan 2010 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS8zMjU1N2ZyZW5jaC1oZWxpb3MtMmItc3B5LXNhdC1zZW5kcy1iYWNrLWZpcnN0LXRlc3QtaW1hZ2VzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — The French-led Helios 2B optical and infrared reconnaissance satellite launched Dec. 18, 2009, aboard an Ariane 5 GS rocket has successfully passed initial in-orbit

checkout and delivered its first test images. Program managers expect the satellite will be put into full operations in March.

The 4,200-kilogram Helios 2B, an identical copy of the Helios 2A satellite launched in December 2004, will permit France and its junior partners in the program — Italy, Spain, Belgium and Greece, each with a 2.5 percent ownership stake—to double the amount and frequency of the imagery they take down from the Helios 2 system.

Italy and Germany have signed separate image-exchange agreements with France for access to Helios 2 in return for giving France access to the Italian COSMO-Skymed and German SAR-Lupe radar reconnaissance spacecraft. Three of the four COSMO-Skymed satellites are in orbit, with the fourth set for launch in 2010. All five SAR-Lupe

spacecraft are operational.

Helios 1A, launched in 1995with a less-precise optical imager, remains fully operational and will not be placed into a graveyard orbit before 2011 or 2012, according to Pascal Fintz, Helios 2 program manager at the French arms procurement directorate, DGA. Until

then, it will be used mainly for map-making functions. Helios 1B, launched in 1999, failed after five years in orbit.

Helios 2B will be placed about 180 degrees distant from Helios 2A in the 700-kilometer,near-polar low Earth orbit used by both satellites.

French defense authorities have classified the ground resolution of the Helios spacecraft, but Helios 1 is able to detect objects of about 1 meter in diameter, while Helios 2’s ground resolution is about 35 centimeters, according to officials knowledgeable about the program.

The two-satellite Helios 2 system cost about2billion euros ($2.9 billion) over 10 years, including the construction and launch of the two satellites and a dedicated ground segment with Helios 2 image-reception stations in France, Belgium and Greece, and a control center in France.

The Italian and Spanish Helios ground network was part of the budget of the Helios 1 program, in which the two nations own 14 percent and 7 percent, respectively, and is not included in the Helios 2 costs. Germany’s Helios 2 ground segment is also not included, but is part of the Helios 2-SAR Lupe exchange agreement.

French defense officials said Helios 2’s costs are broken down as follows: 48 percent for the satellites’ construction, 18 percent for system design, 15 percent for the two launches, 13 percent for the French, Belgian and Greek Helios 2 ground networks, 4 percent for Helios 2 satellite contract management at the French space agency, CNES, and 2 percent for the Helios 2 control center.

The Helios satellites are programmed daily during routine operations.

Orders are collected at the French Helios mission center in Creil, which receives encrypted orders from the Italian center in Pratica di Mare, near Rome; the

Spanish center in Torrejon; and the Belgian center in Brussels.

Germany’s Helios 2 programming capability, located in Getzdorf, is scheduled to enter operations in January. The Greek Helios tasking center, in Tanagra, near

Athens, is scheduled to be operational in mid-2010.

The Creil center collates the daily order and sends it to the Helios 2 control facility, located at CNES’s Toulouse site. CNES then converts the orders into uplink commands

that are delivered to the spacecraft via Earth stations at Aussaguel, at the Guiana Space Center in French Guiana, and at the Kerguelen Islands.

Once taken, the images are encrypted using each nation’s proprietary code, or using a common Helios code in cases where images are ordered on behalf of multiple Helios member nations.

Helios 2A was launched aboard the same GS version of Ariane 5, with a storable-propellant upper stage, which orbited Helios 2A in 2004. That launch carried with it six small satellites, including the four French Essaim electronics-intelligence spacecraft.

To avoid having to perform a fresh series of studies of launcher compatibility, Helios 2B program managers decided to mimic the mass of six minisatellites by adding dead weight under the Ariane5GS fairing. French officials said they were unable to find compatible copassengers for this launch despite the ample space and power available on the Ariane 5 vehicle. The Helios2Blaunch used the last model of the GS variant. Launch services provider Arianespace of Evry, France, has decided to focus on a single product line with the morepowerful ECA version. The Helios 2 satellites were built by Astrium Satellites, which also built the Helios 2 wide-field imager. Thales Alenia Space built the 1,124-kilogram high-resolution imager and also provided the infrared system. Both were working under contract to CNES, which was acting on behalf of DGA. CNES is also managing Helios 2B placement into final orbital position, and its planned five years of operations.

The Dec. 18 launch was the seventh Ariane 5 liftoff of the year for launch-services provider Arianespace, a record for a calendar year.

It was the 35th consecutive success for the Ariane 5 rocket.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999940395355225}",neutral,0.9999940395355225,0
