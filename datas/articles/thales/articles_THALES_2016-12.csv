ExoMars 2020: ”the show must go on”! Second part of ExoMars program gets green light! - Thales,"Tue, 06 Dec 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi93b3JsZHdpZGUvc3BhY2UvbmV3cy9leG9tYXJzLTIwMjAtc2hvdy1tdXN0LWdvLXNlY29uZC1wYXJ0LWV4b21hcnMtcHJvZ3JhbS1nZXRzLWdyZWVuLWxpZ2h00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The search for life on Mars continues!

ExoMars is looking up! The European Space Agency’s Ministerial Council has approved the funding needed to finance the 2020 mission, which will deliver a European rover and a Russian surface platform to Mars. ExoMars is a two-part mission, conducted jointly with Russian space agency Roscosmos to explore the possibility of life on the Red Planet.



The first part sent the Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) into orbit around Mars to detect any evidence of methane in its atmosphere; this gas could have implications for the existence of life on Mars. In the second phase, the golf-cart-size robotic rover will follow up by drilling below Mars' dusty surface to directly detect any living organisms. Both missions are led by Thales Alenia Space as prime contractor, and will hopefully enable us to answer David Bowie’s existential question: “Is there life on Mars”?



Although the TGO’s main objective is to search for evidence of methane and other trace gases in the atmosphere, it will also be used to relay communications from planned NASA surface rovers, and above all from ESA’s ExoMars rover, scheduled to start operating from the Martian surface in 2021.



TGO getting comfy in Mars orbit… and the view is amazing!

Built by Thales Alenia Space, the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter arrived at the Red Planet on October 19, 2016. Since then, it has been circling Mars, testing out an unprecedented array of instruments, and taking spectacularly sharp photographs of the landscape using its Colour and Stereo Surface Imaging System (CaSSIS).

TGO will now use an aerobraking maneuver for nine to twelve months to circularize its elliptical orbit, placing it into a circular orbit around Mars at an altitude of about 250 miles (400 km). Its primary science mission is scheduled to start towards the end of 2017, when it will begin studying gases in the Martian atmosphere, paving the way for ExoMars 2020. Stay tuned for the next Martian chronicles!

Brazilian satellite manufacturer seeks new business as it completes its first satellite - SpaceNews,"Fri, 30 Dec 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9icmF6aWxpYW4tc2F0ZWxsaXRlLW1hbnVmYWN0dXJlci1zZWVrcy1uZXctYnVzaW5lc3MtYXMtaXQtY29tcGxldGVzLWl0cy1maXJzdC1zYXRlbGxpdGUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"WASHINGTON — In the absence of a guaranteed order for a second geostationary satellite, Brazil’s emerging domestic satellite manufacturer Visiona Tecnologia Espacial is building up a remote sensing business and weighing a small satellite project in order to gain more experience.

Established in 2012, Visiona is a joint venture between Telebras Telecomunicações Brasileiras and Embraer Defense and Security tasked with cultivating a geostationary satellite manufacturing capability in Brazil. The company’s flagship project is the Geostationary Defense and Strategic Communications (SGDC) satellite, a Ka- and X-band spacecraft for Telebras and the Brazilian Ministry of Defense constructed in partnership with Thales Alenia Space of France.

SGDC is slated to launch in March, toward the end of a six-month window with launch provider Arianespace on an Ariane 5 rocket. Visiona awarded the SGDC contract to Thales Alenia Space in the fourth quarter of 2013, which included a technology absorption program organized by the Brazilian Space Agency that let more than 65 Brazilians work alongside Thales experts in France. Visiona received the finished satellite this month and is preparing to have it shipped to French Guiana in February.

Visiona worked as the interface for Telebras and the Ministry of Defense to help design the satellite and integrate the payloads into a Thales Alenia Space’ Spacebus 4000 platform. To prevent a loss of momentum, Visiona is considering a satellite project in low Earth orbit that would allow the company to showcase its manufacturing abilities until other avenues of business become clear, according to company President and Chief Executive Eduardo Bonini.

“Next year the next step for Visiona could be building a new small satellite for observation. This would bring more confidence from customers and that could bring more chances to build products and capabilities,” Bonini told SpaceNews.

Visiona’s background is in low Earth orbit satellites. Much of the company’s technical acumen came from INPE, Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research, which has built several remote sensing spacecraft and led Brazil’s half of the China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite (CBERS) series. The latest such satellite, CBERS-4, launched in December 2014 on a Chinese Long March 4B rocket.

“Visiona is not waiting only for a second satellite in geostationary. We are working in front of all the necessary government areas that could use not a geostationary satellite, but a new satellite for observation, data collecting, or other applications,” Bonini said.

SGDC is Visiona’s first geostationary satellite project. The company would not have been able to complete the project without the support of Thales Alenia Space, which helped build the satellite and its ground stations in Brasilia and Rio de Janeiro. A smaller satellite, however, is something Bonini believes it can complete on its own.

“We feel we have capacity to build a small satellite here in the weight of 100 kilograms that could meet the demands of several applications. Our idea is to use a Visiona platform that could fit into data collecting, remote sensing or strategic tactical communications and optical applications,” Bonini explained.

Earth imagery business

Visiona has also formed a new business unit called Observation Services that stitches together imagery from international satellite operators with coverage of Brazil. Bonini said his company has partnerships with Airbus, DigitalGlobe, Restec (Remote Sensing Technology Center) of Japan, South Korea’s SI Imaging Services and UrtheCast. That service has generated a few million dollars in revenue from about 12 to 15 customers.

Bonini said Visiona is investing in value added services for the imagery, such as creating models and simulations, rather than just being an intermediary supplier. Visiona’s imagery partners were represented in Brazil in the past, but Bonini said the volume of business was too little to justify having a large individual presence. With the combined resources of the five imagery providers, Bonini said the company has optical coverage of Brazil ranging from 0.3 to 25 meters, and radar from 0.25 to 50 meters, as well as access to UrtheCast video from the International Space Station.

Bonini said Visiona is marketing this service to Brazil’s Ministry of Defense, but could also build a dedicated satellite constellation if they preferred a proprietary system. Visiona is pursuing customers with this imagery business in addition to trying to find additional customers who might buy satellites.

Future satellite plans

The SGDC communications satellite is designed primarily for government services. Its 50 Ka-band transponders are meant to provide full coverage of Brazil mainly for digital inclusion programs to bring internet access to remote parts of the country. The seven X-band transponders are for military applications.

Bonini said the country’s new government needs more time to determine if it wants to invest in a second SGDC satellite. The president of Telebras also changed with the impeachment of former president Dilma Rousseff, Bonini said, and new leadership wants to ensure that continued investment in SGDC would be a profitable investment. He added that none of these changes have affected the first SGDC satellite.

Should Visiona obtain another geostationary satellite contract, be it an SGDC-2 or something else, Bonini said the company would seek to build more of the satellite with Brazilian parts and labor. “We have in mind that the integration of a second satellite should happen in Brazil,” he said.

This would likely involve using an assembly, integration and testing facility through INPE. Thanks to skills gained with SGDC, Bonini said Visiona would be able to build more composite materials, participate in building solar arrays and construct some of the power system for its next geostationary satellite project, whenever one starts."

"Thales confident in-flight entertainment systems set for takeoff - Headlines, features, photo and videos from ecns.cn ... - ecns","Thu, 08 Dec 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiM2h0dHA6Ly93d3cuZWNucy5jbi9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDE2LzEyLTA4LzIzNjg5Mi5zaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A girl watches a cartoon movie while on board an Airbus A380 of China Southern Airlines. (Photo/China Daily)

Thales Group, a leading French aerospace company that produces in-flight entertainment systems, said it is bullish on the growth potential of the China market, and plans to increase its research and development in the country.

""China provides us a lot of new ideas, talented engineers and innovated productions and is a seedbed for innovation. We have long-term plans to establish innovation teams in China to provide services for the country and other markets,"" said Laurent Guyot, chairman and CEO of Thales China.

Currently, Thales accounts for about 65 percent of the market share of in-flight entertainment systems for wide-bodied aircraft in China.

""The market for in-flight entertainment systems changes very fast. We will continue to make innovations and enrich the multimedia contents of the systems,"" Guyot said.

""Thales has been upgrading the real-time customer experiences based on our big data analysis. We can control and upgrade the in-flight entertainment systems content from our ground control center and supplement the content at any time.""

When it comes to virtual reality, or VR, Thales said this option in the in-flight entertainment systems still requires some time to be offered.

""It often requires a lot of previous verification work for those new technologies that will be applied to the aviation industry, including the VR technology. Besides, it requires the recognition of airlines before the specific implementations,"" he said.

By 2024, the market value of global in-flight entertainment and communication systems is expected to reach $9.82 billion, according to Grand View Research, a San Francisco-based market research and consulting agency.

The company said consumers will have increasingly higher demand for in-flight entertainment and communication systems, as it becomes easier for passengers to get more high-definition multimedia content on the planes.

In 2012, Thales and China Electronics Technology Group Corp formed a joint venture, and the China-based company will produce a set of in-flight entertainment and communication systems for the much-anticipated C919, a large homegrown passenger jet manufactured by Commercial Aircraft Corp of China Ltd.

COMAC earlier said that the first test flight of the C919 is expected to be conducted later this year or in early 2017. Thales said it is now closely cooperating with COMAC, and advancing the in-flight entertainment system project based on the timetable.

The project for the C919 will localize R&D for in-flight entertainment and communication systems for large civilian jets, and the joint venture will also provide services for airlines worldwide.

""We plan to develop more local strategic partnerships with Chinese companies and innovate with them. We are committed to cooperation with Aviation Industry Corp of China and COMAC, and will continue to provide state-of-the-art solutions to Chinese airlines,"" Guyot said."

Poor software design led to second £1m Army spy drone crash - The Register,"Thu, 15 Dec 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJlZ2lzdGVyLmNvbS8yMDE2LzEyLzE1L3dhdGNoa2VlcGVyX3drMDA2X2NyYXNoX3JlcG9ydF9wb29yX3NvZnR3YXJlX2xhc2VyX2FsdGltZXRlcnMv0gFpaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlcmVnaXN0ZXIuY29tL0FNUC8yMDE2LzEyLzE1L3dhdGNoa2VlcGVyX3drMDA2X2NyYXNoX3JlcG9ydF9wb29yX3NvZnR3YXJlX2xhc2VyX2FsdGltZXRlcnMv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"An Army Watchkeeper drone flown by the Royal Artillery crashed on landing after its crew selected the self-flying craft’s “master override” function, according to the official report into the accident.

Thales Watchkeeper drone WK006 flopped into the runway at Boscombe Down airfield in November 2015 when its two-man crew, operating it from a ground station at the airfield, engaged the override after the craft twice attempted and failed to make a safe landing.

The £1m unmanned aircraft had to be written off thanks to the damage it sustained after its onboard systems smashed it into the runway at a 35˚ nose-down angle.

A similar Watchkeeper, tail number WK031, crashed in very similar circumstances in 2014 after its crew engaged the override in an attempt to guarantee that the drone would land before a storm overtook it.

Whee, flop, oh bugger

After a successful takeoff WK006 was uneventfully flown over Salisbury Plain Training Area before its crew tried to land it back at Boscombe Down. The drone’s ground crew, who prepared the site for landing, noticed that the Automatic Take-off and Landing System (ATOLS) was unserviceable.

ATOLS consists of three components, two of which are ground-located beacon and radar units. With those out of use, the drone would instead use its onboard GPS/INS-based landing system.

On its first approach the crew selected the “altitude deviation” override, in accordance with the drone’s flight reference cards, because cloud cover had closed in to 100ft above ground level. While flying in low cloud the aircraft’s systems would falsely give ground proximity reports unless this override was engaged. Despite this, the drone automatically aborted its first landing attempt.

The second landing attempt resulted in another automatic landing abort. At this point the crew agreed, after discussion with the flight’s authorising officer, to engage the master override. This would prevent the drone from automatically aborting another landing.

On the third attempt the drone made its approach to the runway, descended to a height of 22 feet above it, and then nosed over until it struck the ground at a 35.29 degree nose down angle.

WK006 was being operated by a crew of three – a captain, a pilot and a payload operator – from 43 Battery, 47 Regiment Royal Artillery (RA). They were on an accelerated programme to train them as instructors for other crew learning to operate the drones. The captain was an experienced drone officer with several hundred hours’ experience on type who was one of the first to use Watchkeeper on its initial operational deployment to Afghanistan.

If you program it to do something silly, it’ll do it

The military-convened accident investigation panel from the Defence Safety Authority reviewed the Watchkeeper’s logs, including what decisions the drone’s onboard logic was making.

As WK006 made its final approach to the runway it opened its “ground touch” window, sensed that it had touched down and then recorded that it had bounced back into the air. Under normal circumstances, if this happened the drone would default from its “approach” state to “air jump” and, after a few seconds without any further ground contact, close the “ground touch” window, abort the landing, go around and try again.

As “master override” was engaged on the final landing attempt, however, the drone remained in its “approach” state. Its vertical acceleration reduced enough for the onboard logic to decide that it was now straight and level and therefore on the ground – despite being 325 feet above it – and commanded a nose down manoeuvre to put weight onto the steerable nosewheel.

The panel concluded, in its analysis, that WK006 incorrectly sensed its altitude because the two onboard laser altimeters both recorded altitudes of less than 1m above ground level thanks to reflections from the low cloud it was flying through.

It further stated, while pondering how the onboard logic could have decided it had touched down at 325ft AGL:

... it can be seen that Air Jump should end when dACCz [a function of acceleration] has a value of greater than 1 ms-2 for more than 0.1 seconds. Analysis of the VMSC [Vehicle Management System Computer] data showed that on the final approach Air Jump ended when these parameters were met, with a corresponding change in the WOW1 [Weight on Wheels] state to On-ground. Figure 5 shows that vertical acceleration (labelled as ACC Z) was greater than -9ms-2 at the first Ground Touch and that the ATOL State changed to Air Jump, only returning to Approach when dACCz reached a value of 1 ms-2 , at which point WOW1 latched to On-ground.

The Watchkeeper had initially pitched down, causing Ground Touch to be declared, because it was above the three degree approach glidescope for Boscombe’s runway.

In its determination of factors that caused the crash, the panel said:

The VMSC software had, therefore, declared the UA was on the ground and ultimately commanded post-landing actions whilst the UA was still airborne. The Panel concluded that flawed VMSC software logic was a Causal Factor.

The panel later noted that the VMSC “did not compare the laser altimeter readings when it first started using them at the CP with either barometric or GPS height information,” which contributed to the crash.

Weight on wheels? Yeah, software will sort that

No physical weight-on-wheels switch used for landing is fitted to Watchkeeper, which Thales explained to the panel was because of the military requirement that the drone be able to operate from unprepared landing strips: the company said landings on rough surfaces would be likely to break the switch, a problem it had noticed on its other drones. Instead a software algorithm determines, from altitude and acceleration data, whether the Watchkeeper has touched down or not. A switch is fitted to the nosewheel but only to prevent the high-powered laser and radar observation equipment from transmitting while on the ground.

Air Marshal Dick Garwood, head of the Defence Safety Authority, noted at the end of the report: “The Service Inquiry (SI) Panel believes the operation of WK with the flawed VMSC logic still carries an undefined safety risk, unless it can be shown that there are no other conditions that could lead to a false Ground Touch being sensed.”

The air marshal added that the user document set provided by Thales UK “states that WK [Watchkeeper] is an all-weather aircraft which is not true and has likely led to operators having expectations beyond its true capabilities... Although unrelated to the issues described surrounding the landing logic, Thales UK had limitations in place at West Wales Airport regarding cloud at the CP [landing commencement point] since 2013, although, surprisingly, this had not been communicated to the MOD Type Airworthiness Authority or the Army operators at Bascombe Down. This was a missed opportunity.”

“Clearly the VMSC software needs to be fixed before WK is able to provide a reliable and credible capability in a range of weather conditions. I have no doubt that this can be done and the technical issues will be fixed,” concluded Air Marshal Garwood. ®"
SquadNet ready for Delivery - Asian Military Review,"Fri, 02 Dec 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFzaWFubWlsaXRhcnlyZXZpZXcuY29tLzIwMTYvMTIvc3F1YWRuZXQtcmVhZHktZm9yLWRlbGl2ZXJ5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales has told asianmilitaryreview.com that it is ready to deliver its SquadNet radio to customers, following the commencement of production in the late summer of 2016.

Thales launched its Ultra High Frequency (UHF: 865-880 Megahertz) radio during the 2015 Defence Security Equipment International exhibition held in London in September of that year. Speaking to AMR in late-November 2016, Timothy Coley, the SquadNet product manager, told the publication that the firm was positioning the radio to compete with legacy squad-level radios such as Leonardo/Selex’s Personal Role Radio (PRR) family, and is aiming the SquadNet at customers: “who are looking at an entry level radio, that might be using commercial radios for squad communications, or which might use no radios at this tactical level at all.”

Primarily designed for dismounted voice communications, with the capability to also handle some data, such as still imagery at rates of “kilobits-per-second,” Mr. Coley adds, the radio typically has a point-to-point range of up to two kilometres (1.2 miles) across open ground, although this can be extended via the radio’s mobile ad hoc networking capability which allows it to transmit across up to three hops; all using a Thales proprietary waveform. Mr. Coley continues that the firm placed a significant emphasis on weight reduction, compared to legacy squad radios, during the design process, resulting in a transceiver (including the removable battery) tipping the scales at below 250 grams (0.6 pounds), while providing up to 28 hours of battery life. Although the firm has yet to secure any customers, as of late November 2016, Mr. Coley disclosed to asianmilitaryreview.com that the firm “had made a number of demonstrations to various customers.”

Other design features built into the radio include a Global Positioning System receiver which provides a read-out of position location information on the radio display. This location is automatically shared with peers, and can be transmitted via the radio’s built-in Bluetooth transmitter to an Android application to provide a Blue Force Tracking capability. Furthermore, the Android software application enables the radio to use the Android device’s connection to IP (Internet Protocol) networks such as 3G, LTE or Wi-Fi, to create a web-bridge between radio users."

The two satellites, Express-80 and Express-103, are being built by Russian satellite manufacturer ISS-Reshetnev and the Italian division of European satellite manufacturer Thales Alenia Space. ISS-Reshetnev is providing its medium-class Express-1000 satellite bus while Thales Alenia Space Italy is supplying multiband payloads for both spacecraft.

RSCC said it is using two Moscow-based banks to support the financing of Express-80 and Express-103. Sberbank is loaning the satellite operator funds to pay ISS-Reshetnev while Alfa-Bank is financing construction of the payloads.

The Express-80 and Express-103 contracts, first announced in June, mark the continuation of a lengthy collaboration between ISS-Reshetnev and Thales Alenia Space. The companies have used the combination of a Russian spacecraft bus and European payload for more than a dozen spacecraft, including a handful of customers outside of Russia.

RSCC expects both spacecraft to launch in 2019. Thales Alenia Space, in its June 10 announcement, said the payloads will be mated to their Russian platforms in 2018, followed by delivery to RSCC in 2019. RSCC has yet to disclose who will launch the satellites, though the company has historically favored Russia’s domestic Proton launcher.

Each satellite is being designed with electric propulsion as well as a payload power of 6.3 kilowatts. Express-80 will operate at 80 degrees east, covering Russia with 16 C-band and 20 Ku-band transponders, and international markets with two L-band transponders. Express-103, at 103 degrees east, will carry 16 C-band and 20 Ku-band transponders to cover Russia and Southeast Asia, along with a single L-band transponder for international markets.

RSCC, under the ownership of Russia’s Federal Communications Agency, Rossvyaz, sold roughly two thirds of its satellite capacity to domestic customers in 2015. The operator’s most recent satellite, Express-AM8, covers mainly international markets in Africa, Europe and the Americas, and was also a collaborative effort between ISS-Reshetnev and Thales Alenia Space. Express-AM8 launched in September 2015 on a Proton."

Global technology major Thales' European Train Control System (ETCS) Level 1 solution is known in India as TPWS.

In September 2014, Southern Railway had awarded this signalling contract to Thales.

As part of the contract, Thales supplied ETCS Level 1 solution and was also responsible for the design, supply, installation and commissioning of track-side equipment, the release added.

With the completion of this project, Thales brings to India the advanced signalling system that has been deployed in Europe.

Raviprakash Karcherla, Director in Charge of Ground Transportation for Thales in India, said: ""As passenger safety and train security are of utmost importance, we are proud to have brought the advanced and capable train protection system to India's railway networks through this project.

""We look forward to further supporting the Indian Railways in its ongoing modernisation plan and contribute to the development of railway infrastructure in the country.""

Karcherla was further quoted as saying: ""This project is intended at optimising train security and passenger safety while enabling trains to run faster, leading to shorter travel times and increased line capacity through the Automatic Train Protection (ATP) capability.""

Laing O'Rourke jv wins £350m Metrolink Trafford extension - Construction Enquirer,"Thu, 01 Dec 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbnN0cnVjdGlvbmVucXVpcmVyLmNvbS8yMDE2LzEyLzAxL2xhaW5nLW9yb3Vya2UtanYtd2lucy0zNTBtLW1ldHJvbGluay10cmFmZm9yZC1leHRlbnNpb24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The works follow on from the original phase 3 contract with the JV awarded back in June 2008

Transport for Greater Manchester is set to award the £350m next phase of the Metrolink expansion to Laing O’Rourke, VolkerRail and Thales UK.

Transport for Greater Manchester has been cleared to enter into contracts with the M-Pact Thales consortium and WSP Parsons Brinckerhoff for the delivery and management of the scheme.

The new 5.5km Metrolink Trafford Park line will go from Pomona to Trafford Park via the Imperial War Museum.

Laing O’Rourke and VolkerRail will be responsible for the design, construction and maintenance of the civil engineering and track, while Thales will deliver the tram operating systems.

Preliminary utility diversions by Electricity North West will start next week allowing the joint venture to start work in late January.

The Trafford Park line will call at six new tram stops – Wharfside, Imperial War Museum, Village, Parkway, EventCity and the Trafford Centre.

The line will leave the existing Metrolink network at the Pomona stop on the Eccles line and continue in a westerly direction, initially on an elevated structure, along the south side of the Manchester Ship Canal.

The route then continues on a segregated section on the existing highway network along Trafford Wharf Road, Warren Bruce Road and Village Way before joining Barton Dock Road, again as a segregated tramway, to the Trafford Centre.

The extension will increase the size of the Metrolink network to more than 106.5km (66 miles)."
