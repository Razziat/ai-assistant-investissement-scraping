"U.S., Thales at Odds Over Request for ITAR-free Satellite Design Information - SpaceNews","Fri, 06 Jan 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS91cy10aGFsZXMtb2Rkcy1vdmVyLXJlcXVlc3QtaXRhci1mcmVlLXNhdGVsbGl0ZS1kZXNpZ24taW5mb3JtYXRpb24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — A U.S. State Department investigation of whether European satellite manufacturer Thales Alenia Space has illegally included sensitive U.S.-built satellite parts in spacecraft launched aboard Chinese rockets has remained open for more than three years because of a dispute over what information Thales should be required to submit, according to a company official and State Department documents.

The probe began as an inquiry into whether satellite hardware covered by the U.S. International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) had been integrated into satellites the Franco-Italian manufacturer billed as free of such items and thus eligible for launch on China’s Long March rocket. U.S. government policy bars the shipment of ITAR-controlled technology for launch aboard Chinese rockets.

But after receiving documentation showing the disposition of the ITAR-controlled hardware that Thales had received — documentation Thales said proved it had not been sent to China — the State Department broadened the inquiry to include every component on the Thales satellites.

Thales has refused to provide these data on the grounds that doing so would violate French law and contravene contract agreements with its satellite customers.

The dispute has led some in the State Department to suspect Thales may somehow be violating U.S. law in its satellite sales to China. The company has sold half a dozen satellites labeled “ITAR-free” in the past six years that were launched by Chinese Long March rockets or are expected to be.

In 2011 the government of Turkmenistan ordered the latest ITAR-free satellite as part of a contract that includes a launch aboard the Chinese rocket. China has slated the launch of two more Thales-built ITAR-free satellites for 2012, both owned by APT Satellite Holdings of Hong Kong.

In 2010, the State Department accused Thales of refusing to cooperate with a department-ordered “Blue Lantern” inquiry, which began in 2008, to determine what components are on Thales’ ITAR-free satellites.

In a report issued in late 2010 summarizing its fiscal-year 2009 investigations of technology exports, the State Department’s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC), without specifically naming Thales, said the company declined to provide information to dispel concerns about “end product re-exported to China containing [U.S. Munitions List] components.”

The company “refused to provide information regarding the country-of-origin for many parts and components used in its ‘ITAR-free’ satellite sold to China,” the DDTC report said.

With the two sides apparently at an impasse, three prominent U.S. House lawmakers on Dec. 19 wrote U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton asking why Thales had not been punished given that “State Department personnel appear to have concluded that there is a high probability that [Thales] illegally exported ITAR-controlled technology to China.”

The letter was signed by Reps. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-Fla.), who chairs the House Foreign Affairs Committee; Frank R. Wolf (R-Va.), chairman of the House Appropriations commerce, justice, science and related agencies subcommittee; and Michael R. Turner (R-Ohio), chairman of the House Armed Services strategic forces subcommittee.

Asked to respond to the letter and to the DDTC evaluation, a senior official with Thales Group, the parent company of Thales Alenia Space, said he did not dispute the motivation of the letter’s authors, but concluded that they are misinformed about the state of play between his company and the State Department.

“I find it hard to believe that anyone [at the State Department] would believe that,” Edgar Buckley, Thales Group senior vice president for Europe and NATO relations, said. “The people in Congress who

wrote that letter are trying to protect U.S. interests and I have no problem with that. The question is: Have they been properly informed? I think not.”

Buckley, a British national, is a former NATO assistant secretary-general for defense planning and operations, and a former assistant secretary of state in the British Ministry of Defence. He is Thales Group’s principal representative, with Thales Alenia Space Chief Executive Reynald Seznec, in the discussions with DDTC.

In a Jan. 5 interview, Buckley confirmed what Wikileaks reports of State Department cables had already disclosed: Thales received a Blue Lantern inquiry in 2008 and since then has been in discussions with State Department personnel over what the company can and cannot provide by way of documentation.

The State Department inquiry, Buckley said, “asked for details about the disposition of everything we had received under 23 licenses [for ITAR-controlled components], plus the complete design of the Spacebus [satellite] platform and a list of all components.

“On the ITAR items, we had no problem. Thales has been building an ITAR-free satellite and we were aware that caused concerns in Congress. We immediately went back and said, ‘Here is a complete account of all the material given under these 23 licenses.’ None of it was used in an ITAR-free satellite. We said: We can give you the ITAR accounting so you can be reassured that we have accounted for the material.

“As for the satellite design, we said we cannot do that. We will give an outline of the design. And we cannot give you a complete list of components. We cannot do that under French law.”

Thales Group purchased the company now called Thales Alenia Space in 2007 and had performed a series of due-diligence audits of the space division as part of the acquisition. Thales said it would also provide the State Department with copies of the audits, conducted by internal and external auditors.

Buckley said the audits concluded that ITAR accounting at the company was satisfactory, but could be improved to prevent a Thales supplier from falsely or mistakenly claiming that a given satellite subsystem contained no ITAR-controlled parts when in fact it did.

“The audits recommended that we have a better ‘challenge’ procedure in our process,” Buckley said. “We then ordered another audit to show that we had done this.

“This was in early 2009. The response of the State Department was: ‘We would still like to have other information.’ Then we got another Blue Lantern letter.”

“We have sent hundreds of pages of documents. They continue to insist on a list of all U.S.-origin parts on the satellites — now not just the ITAR-controlled hardware, but all U.S. parts. We maintain we cannot do that. We fully understand this is a source of frustration at DDTC. But if you give people a list of all components, you give away design information. It is competitively sensitive.

“What the Department of State wanted was to find out everything about our satellites and check that against everything they know about ITAR. A subsequent request was for information on 30 licenses — some the same as before, so it brought the total to about 43 now. We provided this information. But they are frustrated they have not gotten all the information on non-ITAR components that they ask for.”

Buckley said Thales is now trying to find a way to deliver more information to DDTC using a procedure similar to the “data rooms” that companies set up to let prospective buyers review sensitive information in advance of a merger or acquisition. Those reviewing the material typically sign nondisclosure agreements.

“We have cooperated and we are still trying to cooperate fully with the inquiries,” Buckley said. “Believe me, we certainly do not like to receive Blue Lantern letters.

“The export of telecommunications products is regulated in France, just as it is in the U.S. We have a very strong, robust, extensive export control regime in place and we absolutely hate having a disagreement with State on this. We want to come to a compromise that reassures them without violating French law or commercial agreements with customers. The fact is, we haven’t found any instance of noncompliance.”"
Safran and Thales sign optronics partnership - Optics.org,"Mon, 09 Jan 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiHWh0dHBzOi8vb3B0aWNzLm9yZy9uZXdzLzMvMS850gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Business News

Safran and Thales sign optronics partnership

09 Jan 2012

France-based defense giants Thales and Safran have announced a joint venture to develop new types of optronics systems and equipment.

Thales and Safran have signed a Memorandum of Understanding to create an equally-owned joint venture for optronics systems and equipment. Thales is a global technology leader for the defense, security and aerospace and transport markets. Safran has three core businesses: aerospace (propulsion and equipment), defense and security.

An indication of the importance that the French Government attaches to the partnership is the fact that French defense minister Gérard Longuet attended the signing ceremony in December 2011. Through this joint venture Thales and Safran will combine their respective areas of expertise in optronics, and expand their range of products and services to cover emerging needs for new defense systems, including both modernization programs and original equipment.

New systems under consideration include the optronics pod for the modernized Atlantique 2 maritime patrol aircraft, the imaging system for the upcoming French-British MALE (medium altitude, long endurance) drone, modular optronics systems for army land vehicles, and optronics for future helicopter designs.

The Thales-Safran partnership will be in the form of a joint venture covering technical, commercial and program aspects, with the industrial assets remaining under the control of the two parent companies.

Through this partnership, the companies are aiming to strengthen the national technology base for infrared detectors, the cost-effectiveness of which is key to the competitiveness of optronics systems.

The two companies also intend to strengthen their jointly owned subsidiary Sofradir, in which each company has a 40% stake, to meet their own strategic needs, as well as to expand its presence in the open international market, which remains a priority for ensuring the economic viability of this technology.

Safran and Thales will eventually transfer to the newly announced partnership the infrared detector technologies that they are currently developing within their own units.

Thales Chairman and CEO Luc Vigneron paid tribute to ""a win-win partnership which will deliver best-in-class technologies to our customers, and bolster our position in international markets.""

Safran Chairman and CEO Jean-Paul Herteman added: ""I am delighted to sign this future-looking partnership, which enables us to avoid duplicating major funding, and also brings together the top skills in this field, fostering dynamic synergies between our teams.""

"Boeing, Thales tap EC135 for Australia helicopter training bid - Flightglobal","Fri, 27 Jan 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYm9laW5nLXRoYWxlcy10YXAtZWMxMzUtZm9yLWF1c3RyYWxpYS1oZWxpY29wdGVyLXRyYWluaW5nLWJpZC8xMDM4MTkuYXJ0aWNsZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Boeing and Thales have selected the Eurocopter EC135 as the preferred platform in their bid for the Australian Defence Force's (ADF) Air 9000 Phase 7 Helicopter Aircrew Training System (HATS) tender.

""Thorough flight and ground assessments of the EC135 [as well as] its suitability for ab initio training and as a lead-in trainer to more complex and larger helicopters made it clear the EC135 was the optimum platform to meet the ADF's requirements,"" said Kim Gillis, managing director of Boeing Defence Australia.

© Eurocopter The EC135 is already used as a training asset by operators including Japan's navy

Other teams bidding for the tender include BAE Systems/CAE/AgustaWestland, Bell Helicopter/Raytheon and Lockheed Martin/Bristow Helicopter. Eurocopter's Australian unit, Australian Aerospace, could also enter a bid.

Air 9000 Phase 7 aims to provide a comprehensive training package that includes both facilities and aircraft for the joint training of Royal Australian Navy and Australian Army helicopter pilots. It will see the replacement of the navy's Eurocopter AS350 Squirrels and the army's Bell OH-58 Kiowa helicopters with a single type.

A request for the tender of the requirement was issued last week.

Australia's Defence Materiel Organisation has not specified the number of helicopters to be operated, leaving it up to bidders to submit their suggestions. It estimates the cost of the programme to be between A$500 million ($530 million) and A$1 billion.

""HATS is intended to provide a rotary wing training capability for [the] navy and army to meet the future rotary wing training needs of the ADF,"" said Australia's Department of Defence.

""The project aims to deliver a system that encompasses elements of live, synthetic and classroom aviation instruction, to overcome the broadening gap between the current rotary training systems and the advanced operational helicopters in the current and planned future ADF inventories. There is a broad range of acquisition options under consideration,"" the DoD added.

"Eddie Kato, Chief Executive, Thales Alenia Space North America Inc. - SpaceNews","Mon, 23 Jan 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9lZGRpZS1rYXRvLWNoaWVmLWV4ZWN1dGl2ZS10aGFsZXMtYWxlbmlhLXNwYWNlLW5vcnRoLWFtZXJpY2EtaW5jL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales Alenia Space North America Inc. (TASNA), an arm of the Franco-Italian space hardware manufacturer Thales Alenia Space, is still a small operation focused on providing U.S.-based marketing and technical services, primarily on behalf of its parent company.

That services work includes support for Orbital Sciences Corp. of Dulles, Va., which is building a logistics system for the international space station under NASA’s Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program. The system utilizes a capsule supplied by Thales Alenia Space.

Orbital also is doing final assembly, integration and testing in Chandler, Ariz., of the Iridium Next constellation of communications satellites under subcontract to Thales Alenia Space. TASNA will support Orbital and other Iridium Next subcontractors with technical monitoring under a six-year contract awarded late last year and expects to more than double in size — from about 10 to 25 employees — over the next year or so as a result.

Eddie Kato says the Iridium Next contract will account for half of TASNA’s revenue in the coming years and is a key step toward rebalancing the company’s business in favor of technical services. He envisions TASNA staffing up to about 50 employees within the next 10 years and eventually becoming an independent Thales Alenia Space subsidiary with more of its own contracts with U.S. government and other North American customers.

Kato also supports Thales Alenia Space’s marketing efforts in Asia and the Pacific Rim, leveraging years of experience in that part of the world. He recuses himself, however, from controversial deals involving satellites deliberately devoid of restricted U.S. components that Thales Alenia Space has been able to export to China for launch on Long March rockets.

Kato spoke recently with Space News Editor Warren Ferster.

What sort of support will you be providing under the Iridium Next contract?

Technical monitoring. Out of the $2 billion Iridium contract we have sourced out maybe 35 percent of the volume to U.S. subcontractors, including Orbital Sciences for assembly, integration and test, Lockheed Martin for software, and many other U.S. and Canadian subcontractors for components and other work. So we need to monitor their progress and provide technical guidance.

Is monitoring compliance with U.S. export rules a part of that?

It does include that, yes. TASNA is hiring U.S. citizens to be stationed at or regularly visit those subcontractors’ premises. Within this year we anticipate that we will need to hire up to six or seven additional engineers to do this job. In the meantime we are bringing people from France and Italy, up to seven or eight people, to the United States to carry out this job on an expatriate basis. They will become our employees temporarily. We’ve received a Technical Assistance Agreement from the State Department because this involves dealing with Thales Alenia Space in France and Italy. We will have, for example, a U.S. person stationed at each subcontractor location together with one French person. Whatever technical data he or she learns through the job they must clearly identify what can be shared with the French side and the Italian side and what cannot be. So we actually have an export control function and two certified export control officers in TASNA.

What are some of the growth opportunities for TASNA?

We have lots of good opportunities not only in the commercial field but also in U.S. government-related businesses. But in many cases it’s probably right for us to ally with U.S. players leveraging our unique products and services. Every budget in every part of the world is now declining and international cooperation is becoming more important. We might not have a chance to directly sell the U.S. Defense Department a satellite by ourselves. I don’t think that’s the market we’re looking at. But there is the hosted payload market, and other kinds of unique projects. Last year we won a U.S. Navy project, Geosat Follow-On (GFO) 2, with our unique altimeter product. We probably are the only manufacturer in the world of altimeters like those being used for the U.S.-European Jason project. So we teamed with a U.S. supplier and succeeded in selling this product to the Navy. This kind of model features a U.S. prime and we would contribute with a unique product. Human spaceflight is another example. COTS is a very good example of how we worked with a U.S. company to sell to NASA, not as a generic subcontractor but in a strategic way, leveraging our unique product. We are proactively pursuing various hosted payload projects in the communications arena.

Is GFO-2 going forward?

The budget situation is preventing us from implementing this for now. It could be delayed, it could be funded through another way or in the very worst case the whole project may be gone. We don’t know yet. But it was a very good way to pursue this opportunity.

What about satellite platforms?

We are looking at the potential application of our low Earth orbit platform. We’re building the Globalstar, O3b and Iridium Next constellations so we need to think about what happens after we finish those projects. Is there any market in the U.S. government for this kind of platform? That’s what I am interested in looking at right now.

How might you sell that platform to U.S. government customers, who generally must buy from American companies?

We may need to partner with U.S. players, depending on the situation or the nature of the opportunity. What we’re doing with Iridium Next is a very good precursor for our strategy.

What applications are there for an Iridium Next-type platform?

It’s very precise in control. So nontelecom applications can be possible, like sensors. It’s also a low-cost platform so it’s good as a technology test bed or as a hosting solution for developing sensors. There might be other constellation type applications as well.

Are you talking about weather or space environment sensors?

Yes. Even space situational awareness types of applications.

Are you assisting efforts to find hosted payloads for Iridium Next?

We own the system design so we need to work like a partner to evaluate candidate hosted payloads and validate the designs and interfaces. So yes, we have some involvement. Also, mainly on the European side, we are trying to introduce opportunities as well because we have a very good access to customers who may be interested in hosted payloads.

What other unique capabilities do you offer?

We are developing UHF and Ka-band military satellite communications systems for France and Italy and we have always been the Syracuse system provider to the French Ministry of Defense. We have lots of technical capabilities through those projects. In fact we are pursuing an opportunity in Japan today — Japan is buying its first military satellite communications system and they may need a channelizer, which is the heart of the system. They are buying one military X-band satellite very shortly and then they will buy another one within the next year.

Has Japan signed a prime contract for this satellite system?

They have issued a request for proposals to two domestic companies, NEC and Melco, but I don’t think they have the capability to build the channelizer so that may be the market for us. They’re going to select the payload vendor first and then sign the bus vendor.

What are your revenue projections for next year?

It’s a little bit fuzzy but I would say around $5 million, including our work for Thales Alenia Space and some other customers.

How do you see that revenue growing in the next five years?

I would say 10 to 15 percent growth — that’s what we are looking at.

Do you envision opening up an office at NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia as your space station-related work winds down at Kennedy Space Center in Florida?

We have one person who is dividing time between Wallops and Orbital’s Dulles campus. There are some security related topics that we need to go through. I think by springtime we’ll have a conclusion as to what’s best but yes, we are looking at that possibility.

Thales Alenia Space has a capable remote sensing satellite platform. Do you see opportunities in the U.S. market for that?

The platform side is very limited. We just lost to Orbital in the competition to build the IceSat-2 satellite for NASA. Our platforms are registered in the Rapid Spacecraft catalog administered by NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center. For this opportunity we didn’t pursue teaming with a U.S. company; we just competed with them. In the future we need to probably evaluate what’s the best process."
Thales and Steyr Mannlicher sign deal - Australian Defence Magazine,"Fri, 27 Jan 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1c3RyYWxpYW5kZWZlbmNlLmNvbS5hdS9uZXdzL3RoYWxlcy1hbmQtc3RleXItbWFubmxpY2hlci1zaWduLWRlYWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales Australia and Steyr Mannlicher have signed an agreement to cooperate on global market opportunities.

Steyr Mannlicher is the original designer of the Australian Defence Force’s F88 assault rifle, which was manufactured and subsequently developed further by Thales Australia.

Under the agreement, the two companies will refresh their longstanding cooperation in military markets, with Thales Australia taking the formal lead in Australia and New Zealand.

This will benefit customers by sharing R&D to drive product improvements, working towards common supply chains where appropriate, and streamlining service delivery.

Chris Jenkins, Thales Australia’s CEO, said: “This agreement represents the continuing evolution of our Soldier Systems business.

""Steyr Mannlicher has a long history and a global market outlook which, combined with our expertise delivering and upgrading infantry weapons, will allow us to collectively build on our vast knowledge and networks to offer streamlined, cost-effective solutions to customers.”

“Both companies employ world-class weapon designers and experts, and our combined capabilities will make this a compelling team.

""We have invested significantly in weapon development in Australia, and are eager to offer Australian innovations through Steyr Mannlicher to the rest of the world.

""The current development of the next generation weapon under the LAND 125 3C program is the most recent example of the innovative work being done at Lithgow.”

Thales Australia and Steyr Mannlicher have been working together since 1986 to deliver assault rifles, and since then have continuously improved weapon performance and enabled the integration of a wide range of third-party accessories.

The SA2 currently in service demonstrates the continuing evolution of this capability."

The inauguration ceremony on 7 December 2011 at Windhoek was attended by His Excellency Dr. Hifikepunye Pohamba, President of the Republic of Namibia.

Under this contract, Thales supplied the latest version of its Eurocat system, which fuses data from comounted Thales primary and secondary radars at Windhoek Hosea Kutako International Airport as well as from WAM1 stations supplied by ERA. Eurocat also incorporates flight plan and ADS-C data into the display system. Thanks to Eurocat's advanced functionality, NDCA controllers are now able to guide aircraft anywhere within Namibia's flight information region with high levels of precision, safety

and security. This new configuration also enables Namibia to significantly reduce aircraft separation within its airspace while considerably enhancing flight safety at the same time.



The global leader in ATM systems and civil radar, Thales has commissioned more than 160 Eurocat centres around the world, equivalent to 2,000 controller positions."

The combination of 2087 and FLASH makes the Type 23 a formidable anti-submarine warfare (ASW) platform.

Sonar 2087 is a towed-array system that enables Type 23 frigates to hunt the latest submarines at considerable distances and locate them beyond the range from which they can launch an attack.



The system is a low-frequency active sonar, consisting of both active and passive sonar arrays. The system is manufactured at Thales’s sites in Cheadle Heath in Manchester and Templecombe in Somerset in the UK, and in Brest, France.



Training at sea will see Kent conduct many inspections, exercises and trials off the east coast of Scotland.

Speaking of the trials, the ship’s commanding officer, Commander Ben Ripley, says: “HMS Kent will emerge as one of the most capable anti-submarine warfare frigates in the world, and today is our first step in realising this goal.”



John Pollard, Capability Manager for Sonar Systems at the MoD’s Defence Equipment & Support facility, says: “Recent operational deployments using Sonar 2087 against actual ‘threat platforms’ continue to show this to be a very capable ASW system, giving these platforms a significant capability enhancement.”

“HMS Kent will soon enter service alongside the other six Sonar 2087-fitted platforms further extending the Royal Navy’s ASW capability.”"
