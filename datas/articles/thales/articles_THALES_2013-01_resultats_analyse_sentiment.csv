Supacat also delivered the first improved Special Operations Vehicles (SOV) developed under Project JP2097 Phase 1B. Defense-Update reports.

Thales Australia has handed over the first Hawkei protected mobility vehicle (PMV) and trailer prototypes to the Australian Army. Hawkei was the preferred platform for the Australian Defence A$1.5bn Project LAND 121 Phase 4 program.

In 2011 Thales was awarded A$38 million contract by the Australian Department of Defence (DoD) to develop and deliver six prototype Hawkei vehicles and one trailer, to the Australian Defence Forces (ADF) for testing, evaluation and user assessment trials.

The remaining five prototypes are scheduled for delivery by June 2013, after then the vehicles will undergo a comprehensive testing program, including communication system integration testing, reliability growth trials, survivability testing and user assessments throughout the year.

Under LAND 121 Phase 4 the Australian Defence is planning to buy up to 1,300 protected and unprotected light vehicles, beginning 2015, gradually replacing the Army’s existing Land Rover vehicle fleet.

Another program to enter prototype evaluation is Project JP2097 Phase 1B – the fielding of an improved Special Operations Vehicles (SOV). In April 2012 Supacat was selected to develop and deliver the prototype SOV. The vehicle can carry a range of weapons, communications and surveillance equipment meeting special operations specific and unique requirements. Following that win, the company has established a engineering design and analysis facility in Melbourne, manned by 18 engineers. It is the first facility Supacat has opened outside the UK. Supacat delivered the first prototype for testing in December 2012.

France's Thales joins Dreamliner battery probe - Yahoo Singapore News,"Wed, 23 Jan 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHA6Ly9zZy5uZXdzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9mcmFuY2VzLXRoYWxlcy1qb2lucy1kcmVhbWxpbmVyLWJhdHRlcnktcHJvYmUtMTAwMzAxOTM4LS1maW5hbmNlLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"French electrical system giant Thales has joined a Japan-US probe into a battery fire which forced a Boeing 787 Dreamliner to make an emergency landing in Japan, officials said Wednesday. Two Thales engineers have been taking part in a CT scan of the aircraft's lithium-ion battery at a Japan space agency facility in Tokyo since Tuesday, said a Japan Transport Safety Board (JTSB) spokeswoman. ""They are participating as advisers to the BEA (the French civil aviation authority),"" she said. Thales designed the Dreamliner's electrical system and commissioned Japanese firm GS Yuasa to produce the next-generation aircraft's batteries. A fire risk from overheating powerpacks emerged as a major concern after pilots were forced to land a domestic All Nippon Airways flight in western Japan on January 16 due to smoke apparently linked to the plane's battery. Investigators on Friday released a picture showing the blackened remains of the battery in the ANA plane. JTSB and the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) were expected to wrap up the scan of the burned battery late Wednesday, the spokeswoman said. Engineers from GS Yuasa were also taking part in the probe. The battery was expected to be dismantled and examined later. Boeing's fuel-efficient planes suffered a series of problems earlier this month, prompting a global alert from the US Federal Aviation Administration that has seen all 50 operational Dreamliners grounded since last week. Thales and GS Yuasa were also taking part in a separate investigation, led by the NTSB, into the cause of a fire on a Japan Airlines 787 Dreamliner in Boston on January 7. US investigators probing that incident ruled out overheating as the cause, but the NTSB was still testing the charger and components linked to the battery. Meanwhile, an official from Japan's transport ministry was in Britain to probe the cause of a fuel spill which forced another JAL 787 to be grounded in Boston, one day after the battery-fire incident. ""The official will observe a study of the British-made valve system later Wednesday to determine the cause of the fuel leak,"" the ministry's civil aviation bureau said.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.6667153239250183}",negative,0.6667153239250183,-1

A 2006 battery fire destroyed Boeing 787 supplier's facility - Nextgov/FCW,"Tue, 22 Jan 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5leHRnb3YuY29tL2VtZXJnaW5nLXRlY2gvMjAxMy8wMS8yMDA2LWJhdHRlcnktZmlyZS1kZXN0cm95ZWQtYm9laW5nLTc4Ny1zdXBwbGllcnMtZmFjaWxpdHkvNjA4MDkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"An explosion in a lithium battery under development for use in the Boeing 787 Dreamliner resulted in a fire that destroyed the Tucson, Ariz., facility of manufacturer Securaplane in 2006.

Following that incident, an employee filed a whistleblower lawsuit with the Labor Department alleging the company had produced an unsafe battery. Labor dismissed the suit on procedural grounds.

Internal documents from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Administration show that Securaplane tested a battery from one manufacturer for use in the 787 but substituted another for use in production systems based on assertions that the new batteries were identical to those tested.

Securaplane manufactures the lithium ion auxiliary power unit and a battery charger unit for the 787. The Federal Aviation Administration grounded Boeing’s entire fleet of 787s after battery fires earlier this month.

Securaplane, a unit of global engineering firm Meggit PLC, based in the United Kingdom, manufactures the systems for Boeing under a subcontract with Thales, headquartered in a Paris suburb. Thales has a contract for the 787’s electrical power conversion system, with GS Yuasa of Kyoto supplying the batteries.

Michael Leon, a Securaplane engineering technician, was working on the 787 battery charger unit when it exploded in 2006. He complained in January 2007 that the units did not conform to design schematics, according to a final decision and order Labor issued July 15, 2011.

According to that 56-page document, Securaplane won a contract for the 787 battery charger unit in 2004. In November 2006, while Leon was running tests, the battery exploded, resulting in “a devastating fire that destroyed [Securaplane’s] labs and production building.”

Despite his concerns, Leon said he was “pressured [by Securaplane] to sign off on Acceptance Test Procedures (ATPs) for noncompliant units and ship them to customers. He says he gave in to pressure to run the ATPs, knowing they would be re-run after he fixed the units, but balked at actually shipping noncompliant units,” according to the document.

On March 1, 2007, Leon left work without shipping what he thought were noncompliant battery charger units. When he returned to work on March 5, 2007, he received a formal written disciplinary warning. Leon says he continued to raise the nonconformance issues and the discrepancy, but no one fixed it. Eventually he filed an FAA complaint.

Meanwhile, Leon charged, he was subject to disciplinary action, was later suspended, and eventually fired. “Leon believes the timing of his termination proves Securaplane was motivated by retaliatory animus toward Leon’s protected safety activities,” the Labor Department decision said.

Securaplane, along with Thales and GS Yuasa, conducted a two-year investigation and narrowed the cause of the fire to one of three possibilities: a defect in one corner of a battery cell; prior damage to the battery; and Leon’s failure to connect a harness that transmits signals between the battery and the charger unit during the test.

Boeing spokesman Marc Birtel said the 2006 fire resulted from “an improper test set up, not the design of the battery.” FAA spokeswoman Laura Brown said the agency “investigated Mr. Leon's complaints in 2008 and 2009. The investigation determined that the battery charging units in the complaints were prototypes, and none are installed in Boeing 787 aircraft. Our reviews also determined Securaplane's production of a particular printed circuit board complied with FAA requirements.”

Leon said Securapane dismissed him while he was engaged in “protected activity relating to air safety concerns that he brought to the attention of both Securaplane management and the FAA.” The company said that Leon, among other things, was a convicted felon who lied to fire investigators, falsified his employment history and violated company email and Internet policies.

Labor Department Administrative Law Judge William Dorsey ruled that Securaplane had legitimate reasons to fire Leon, including “his continued pattern of engaging in antagonistic, demeaning, rude, and intimidating conduct.”

On Jan. 31, 2011, sometime after it had started using batteries supplied by GS Yuasa in its battery charger unit (based on the Labor Department ruling), Securaplane told the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration that a battery pack for use in the 787 manufactured by Kokam of Korea had “passed all required FAA and Boeing environmental test requirements” in tests conducted by Mobile Power Solutions of Beaverton, Ore.

In an email to the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, Rod Iverson, a Securaplane program manager, said Rose Electronics of San Jose, Calif., manufactured the battery for those tests using Kokam battery cells.

He said the Rose Electronics battery used in the tests conducted by Mobile Power is “identical to the product to be manufactured by Securaplane,” for use in the 787. In a March 15, 2011, letter to Iverson, Ben Supko, acting chief of the standards development branch in the standards and rulemaking division of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, said, “Provided the lithium ion batteries you intend to manufacture are identical to a previously detected design type, additional testing is not required.”

Daniel Doughty, president of Battery Safety Consulting Inc., in Albuquerque, N.M., told Nextgov that “there is no way” one lithium ion battery can be described as identical to another. Doughty, who managed the Advanced Power Sources Research and Development Department at Sandia National Laboratories for 14 years, said it is “a bad assumption” to accept such batteries are identical due to different cell chemistries and cathodes used.

Boeing’s Birtel said the batteries referenced in the correspondence between Securaplane and the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration are not “the specific battery type currently under NTSB investigation or subject of the FAA emergency airworthiness directive.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.7334179878234863}",neutral,0.7334179878234863,0
TfGM and Thales in court over £42m Metrolink dispute - Rail Technology Magazine,"Fri, 04 Jan 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJhaWx0ZWNobm9sb2d5bWFnYXppbmUuY29tL1JhaWwtTmV3cy90ZmdtLWFuZC10aGFsZXMtaW4tY291cnQtb3Zlci00Mm0tbWV0cm9saW5rLWRpc3B1dGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"TfGM and Thales in court over £42m Metrolink dispute

Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM) has taken contractor Thales to the High Court over their claim for an extra £42m on a signalling project for Metrolink.

The Manchester Evening News (MEN) reports that the case involves the dispute over costly delays to the tram network extension, with both parties blaming the other for the problems.

Thales was awarded a £22m contract to install a Tram Management System (TMS) for Metrolink in 2008, as part of the £1bn network expansion.

Openings of the new lines out to Oldham and Chorlton experienced significant delays – although services are now running on both – and extensions to Rochdale and Droyslden are now months behind schedule. Four years into the contract, Thales has only been paid £7.8m, the MEN reports.

TfGM has taken the case to court over Thale’s “fundamental failure” to meet its contractual requirements. Thales says the extra money is needed to cover extra costs incurred due to late instructions and a lack of cooperation.

A TfGM report in late 2011 said that “technical complexities” were delaying the roll-out of TMS across the expanding network.

Mr Justice Akenhead said: “The project appears not to have gone well, although the responsibility therefore has not yet been finally established.

“This project has been subjected to very substantial delays. In terms of milestones, no more than about one third are said to have been completed.”

"1,600 Indian T-72s Slated for Night Vision Upgrades - Defense Update","Thu, 10 Jan 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vZGVmZW5zZS11cGRhdGUuY29tLzIwMTMwMTEwX25pZ2h0X3Zpc2lvbl9mb3JfMTYwMF9pbmRpYW5fdDcycy5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Indian Army, having long suffered from deficiencies in night fighting capability, is taking steps to correct this gap in equipping combat vehicles with advanced EO systems. Army chief Gen Deepak Kapoor, was quoted by Frontier India saying: “Indian Army’s tanks have a night vision capability of 20 percent while Pakistani’s have 80 percent and China has 100 percent”. Following massive procurement of night vision devices for combat troops, the army is now set to equip its second line tanks with similar capabilities. The armed forces will review their doctrine, capabilities and shortcomings and also identify latest trends and technologies at a two-day seminar “Night Vision India 2013” scheduled next week.

The Army’s objective is to equip over 1,600 T-72 tanks that form the backbone of the country’s armored forces, with advanced night fighting capabilities. The Army’s case for acquiring 700 TISAS (thermal imaging stand alone systems) and 418 TIFACS (thermal fire control systems) for its T-72 fleet at a cost of around $230 million is in various stages of the procurement process. 300 Israeli TISAS were installed as part of several T-72 upgrade phases, followed by 3,860 image intensifier-based night-vision devices. A huge requirement persists. 310 Russian produced T-90S Main Battle Tanks were also fitted with French Catherine TI cameras.

The requirements for the Indian infantry formations are equally stunning. According to Major General RK Arora, editor of Indian Military Review magazine, the Army requires hand held thermal imaging (HHTI) sights integrated with laser range finders, for infantry, armored, air-defense, artillery and engineer regiments. The infantry is also looking for TI sights for medium machine guns and sniper rifles. RFIs for night sights for AK-47 assault rifles and other small arms have also been floated. On the horizon is the Indian Soldier System (INSAS) program,

Bharat Electronics Ltd (BEL) is the biggest supplier of night vision equipment to the armed forces. In 2007 the company has signed a memoranda of understanding (MoUs) with Elbit Systems Electro Optics ELOP Ltd, for the local production and support of thermal imaging systems. BEL recently supplied 30,600 passive night sights for rifles, rocket launchers and light machine guns, passive night vision binoculars and passive night vision goggles to the Army but the forces remain woefully short and are looking for the latest 3rd generation technology to reduce weight and extend the life of NVDs.

Another Israeli company to benefit from the Indian demand is SDS; the company received significant orders for its new lines of I2 weapon sights.

For the future, the procurement of new assault rifles and carbines for the Indian Army, replacing the INSAS currently used, will obviously require hundreds of thousands of sights, night vision sights and clip-on viewers, creating a signifiant drive for foreign companies to establish production in the country. The new rifles will also become part of the future infantry weapon system to be fielded by the Indian military and special forces.

The Indian military is also embarking on the replacement on the Indian 7.62mm Self Loading Rifle (INSAS), with a modern carbine currently in final evaluation. Through the initial screening process the military has narrowed five suppliers from 40 that approached the Request for Information (RFI) in 2010. Currently in the final phase are the US company Colt, Italian Beretta, Czech weapon manufacturer CZ, Israel’s IWI and Austrian SIG Sauer. The Indian military plans to buy at least 65,000 weapons directly from the winning manufacturer and follow on with local production of about 115,000 additional rifles to be produced by the Ordnance Factory Board (OFB). Eventually, additional procurement of 120,000 units could be added, with the planned procurement of Close Quarter (CQB) Carbines for military and paramilitary use. The total budget to be allocated for the program is nearly US$1.9 billion, spanned over several years. The new rifle will weigh 3.5 kg, and use two calibers, 5.56×45 and 7.62×39 cal and will come with a range of accessories, including under barrel grenade launchers, night vision scopes, optical or reflex sights and more.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999939203262329}",neutral,0.9999939203262329,0
