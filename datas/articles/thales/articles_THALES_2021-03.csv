Thales presents its first ever digital event dedicated to rail transport, the “Smart Mobilty Experience” which will take place on March 24th. This event will be the occasion for clients and partners of the rail ecosystem, to discover new products and major innovations, as well as to exchange about the digitalization and the future of rail.

Rail transport operators are looking to innovative digital solutions and services for improved service performance and energy efficiency, and to boost the attractiveness for users. Thales helps transporting passengers safely, and with best possible experience, supervises operations with accurate situation awareness, and optimizes transport service efficiency. Using digital technologies such as IoT, 5G, cloud and web IT, data analytics and AI, Thales designs innovative solutions such as digital signalling, train autonomy, mobile ticketing, passenger flow analytics, data driven operation control, smart maintenance, which will drastically impact the way we all travel.

Facilitate new technology insertion in long lifespan metro systems

With the digital architecture of Thales’ latest metro signalling system SelTrac™ G8, software functionalities are permanently upgradable with no traffic disruption, a modular and resilient equipment platform approach allows for future technology insertion such as train autonomy, and health monitoring facilitates data driven operations and maintenance. SelTrac™ G8 helps operators reduce installation and maintenance costs while upgrading system functionalities to meet passenger demand, preserving safety and service reliability.

Provide real-time passenger density insights to public transport operators

Important innovation is are the AI and data analytics driven applications that Thales introduces for either task automation or decision support. Distributed Intelligent Video Analytics – DIVA - is the new Thales solution to monitor social distancing, and to guide passengers in the station and on the platform. The solution helps alleviate crowding by reducing busy times, and consequently enhances overall passenger safety, comfort, and travel experience.

Based on Artificial Intelligence video analytics, DIVA leverages the existing CCTV (closed circuit TV) network on stations and on-board trains to provide real-time information on passenger density. The targeted performances of density accuracy are above 90%.

Contribute to a more sustainable mobility

Sustainable mobility is another driving force that pushes Thales to innovate. Thanks to the capability of a number of complex algorithms, Thales’ driver advisory system, GreenSpeed, can optimize the speed for energy saving. This will reduce emissions for up to 15% that is the equivalent to the consumption of a city of some 2 000 inhabitants per year.

For metros, Thales latest signalling system SelTracTM G8 will enable to reduce traction energy consumption by 15% when compared to traditional CBTC by loading efficient speed profiles into the train’s on-board system.

Develop innovative collaborations

Co-innovation is also essential as it bridges the gap between a new concept or technology in the lab and an actual working solution solving a real operational problem. This accelerates market entry for new solutions, and is a sign of trust between customers and Thales. For instance Thales works with New York Metro and France National Railways for autonomous metros and trains, German national Railways for advanced signaling concepts, or Singapore Metro for passenger guidance systems and hands-free ticketing.

""In a competitive market, it is absolutely vital that industrials find ways to make railway more attractive. And this is where innovation helps. One of the biggest challenges today is that you can’t just close down a railway network while you upgrade them. People still need to go to work and to travel. That’s why we’re putting so much effort into the solutions that can be deployed whilst having minimal disruption."" – Millar Crawford, Executive Vice President - Thales’s Ground Transportation Systems"

Thales completes HMS Dauntless S1850M Long Range Radar overhaul - Naval News,"Fri, 19 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdmFsbmV3cy5jb20vbmF2YWwtbmV3cy8yMDIxLzAzL3RoYWxlcy1jb21wbGV0ZXMtaG1zLWRhdW50bGVzcy1zMTg1MG0tbG9uZy1yYW5nZS1yYWRhci1vdmVyaGF1bC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales completes HMS Dauntless S1850M Long Range Radar overhaul The Royal Navy HMS Dauntless Type 45 destroyer's S1850M Long Range Radar has been officially completely revised since last week. The overhaul was part of the ship's ""Upkeep 2020"" program and included a digital ""factory acceptance test"" (FAT), Thales said in a March 17 release.

“Such an overhaul involves the replacement and refurbishment of so many components that it has in fact become a new system that must be re-inspected at the end of the process. We confirm that everything meets the customer’s requirements with a so-called Factory Acceptance Test. Normally we perform these tests in front of the customer, but the COVID-19 restrictions made that practically impossible. We have therefore agreed with the customer to perform the FAT using our new Video Capture process,” Test and Support manager Bernard Haanappel said.

David Reid, the team’s video expert, explains: “It’s quite complex, but the bottom line is that we share all documents and tests with the client through video and a secure data connection. We have developed the Video Capture process in our XR Innovations Lab over the past year into a simple and efficient tool.“

Basically we create small video clips for each step in the FAT which we then link to the corresponding text on a mini website. This makes navigation easy for the customer, and it’s much better than watching a full 4 hour video. David Reid

“We do see a growing trend in which product teams and projects require video content creation more often. Because it’s effective, captures knowledge in a way that other content creation can’t, and it’s efficient. There is a lot of interest from other product teams who want to film their product and provide additional services such as Video Assisted Documentation (VAD). More teams have already asked for time and resources for the coming months. This is good news for Thales and will significantly improve our knowledge retention.

“Thanks to the team, the reconditioned S1850M passed all tests. There are of course some minor issues to be addressed, but we are happy with the test result. This was the first of the S1850Ms onboard the Type 45 ships and I hope the others will be just as successful,” Haanappel added.

Thales notes the goal of the partnership is to build a platform that will ultimately enable deployments in urban, regional and mainline rail networks globally.

“We are excited to be solving the difficulties associated with autonomous rail systems and harsh winter conditions, an interesting challenge that we can all relate to. The data collected from the GO train has allowed us to gain unique insights into how to address the complex needs of transport operators globally,” said Invision AI CEO Karim Ali.

The partners prototyped and installed a system on a Metrolinx GO train that operates on multiple lines in Toronto, Ontario. The system is equipped on the front of the train and includes radars, cameras and lidar, for multi-spectral sensing ahead of the train, along with a cyber secured 4G/LTE connected data collection and processing system. These technologies actively collect important data which can then be used to train the system to recognize obstacles and other dangers. The data gathering activities will continue for an additional six months in different weather and environmental conditions.

“No matter what the weather is, safety within Ontario’s transit networks remains our top priority. This partnership between Metrolinx, Thales and Invision AI shows the potential benefit emerging technologies could have on the future of transit in our province,” said Ontario Minister of Transportation Caroline Mulroney.

Additionally, the technology equipped on the train is providing real-time information and data – such as next generation positioning, train telemetry and diagnostics information – to ensure the system is running smoothly.

“Thales is proud to partner with Metrolinx and the Ontario Center of Innovation to create a solution that will improve transit systems for both operators and passengers. Partnering with Invision AI has been a fantastic experience and showcases the power of collaboration to reach a common goal; bringing world-class transit solutions to Ontario,” said Thales Canada President and CEO Mark Halinaty.

Delayed Indonesian broadband satellite SATRIA fully funded - SpaceNews,"Wed, 03 Mar 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9kZWxheWVkLWluZG9uZXNpYW4tYnJvYWRiYW5kLXNhdGVsbGl0ZS1zYXRyaWEtZnVsbHktZnVuZGVkL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"TAMPA, Fla. — Indonesia’s government has secured financing to continue manufacturing the SATRIA broadband satellite, although its intended orbital slot remains up in the air.

Thales Alenia Space started developing the Ka-band spacecraft in September after receiving partial financing, which spokesperson Sandrine Bielecki told SpaceNews covered work up until this point.

Bielecki said the program can continue uninterrupted now the project has secured about $545 million in funding, partly backed by France’s Bpifrance export-credit agency. It has been operating in “full swing” since September “with already many design milestones achieved,” a company official added.

About $431 million of SATRIA’s funding package is debt, with the rest financed through equity.

Domestic satellite operator Pasifik Satelit Nusantara (PSN), which is providing the equity element through a public-private partnership, said earlier that Bpifrance is guaranteeing loans provided by Banco Santander, HSBC and Korea Development Bank (KDB).

South Korea’s state-run KDB said it committed $126 million to the project. Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) has committed $150 million.

The financing documents were completed during a virtual ceremony held Feb. 26 in the Presidential Palace of Indonesia, attended by the country’s President Joko Widodo.

Beaming more than 150 gigabits per second over the entire Indonesian territory, SATRIA aims to narrow the digital divide by connecting around 90,000 schools and 40,000 hospitals and public buildings. It will also link regional government sites that are currently outside of satellite and terrestrial networks.

Thales Alenia Space announced in July 2019 that it had been selected as prime contractor for SATRIA but delays in financing the project meant a preliminary work agreement came more than a year later on Sep. 3, 2020.

The delay reportedly helped put SATRIA on course to miss a regulatory deadline to start services from its 146°E orbital slot by March 2022.

Indonesia’s government has asked the International Telecommunication Union, which regulates orbital slots, for a deadline extension, citing COVID-19 disruption, reported The Jakarta Post in November.

The country’s government is also considering plans to keep the slot by moving another spacecraft to 146°E in the meantime, or use another orbital filing entirely, the newspaper added, citing a government press briefing. At the time, the newspaper said the government was forecasting a delay to launch SATRIA from March 2023 to the fourth quarter of that year.

SpaceX has been lined up for SATRIA’s launch, which Thales Alenia Space told SpaceNews “is planned for the first semester of 2023”.

The plastic, which is mainly sourced from refrigerators, is transformed at Veolia's recycling plant in Froissy, in the Picardy region. Using recycled granules, Thales engineers, in collaboration with Veolia experts, have developed a new manufacturing process for SIM cards that meets industrial requirements. These eco-SIM cards, which include both the SIM card itself and its bank card format support, will avoid the production of 5,000 metric tons of virgin plastic and the emission of 15,000 metric tons of CO 2 . And at the end of life, the plastic used to make the cards can be recycled and used again.







A comprehensive commitment to the environment

This initiative is part of a broader Thales strategy to reduce the carbon footprint of all its products and services. With these eco-SIM cards, Thales is going even further by offsetting all the CO 2 emissions associated with their manufacture and with the chip's non-recyclable electronic components through its global offset program.

With a neutral carbon footprint and a recycled-plastic design, this new product helps mobile operators in their ecological transformation and responds much more closely to their subscribers' environmental concerns.

All of our everyday objects could soon be made from recycled materials thanks to visionary, responsible companies like Thales. The example of the SIM card offers a glimpse into the vast field of possibilities opened up by eco-design. Our industrial ecology services, as this circular economy loop, enable us to support our clients’ ecological transformation, said Anne le Guennec, Director of Veolia’s Waste activities in France.

This innovation project with Veolia will support our telecom customers in their ecological transition by transforming waste into environmentally responsible SIM cards, said Emmanuel Unguran, Vice President, Mobile Connectivity Solutions at Thales.

This long-term commitment is an integral part of the Group's ambitious policy of sustainable development and social responsibility, and offers mobile phone operators a new opportunity to enhance their value proposition to consumers in terms of sustainability."

Although each one of them weighs a mere 4 grams, the 4.5 billion SIM cards manufactured each year nonetheless add up to some 20,000 tons of plastic – the equivalent of two Eiffel Towers. To meet the growing awareness of the ecological impact, Thales and Veolia have developed an alternative solution that is both innovative and original: the “eco-SIM card”, made of plastic recycled from old refrigerators!

The older among you will remember that it was back on 13 March 1984 that the first mobile phone – a Motorola Dyna-Tac 8000X – went on sale to the public. Its size (25cm in height, without its aerial) and weight (800g, compared with the 100-200g of today’s models) earned it such unenviable nicknames as “the brick” and, most notably, “the fridge”.

Today, in a strange twist of fate, real fridges have now become a valuable and unexpected resource for one of the key components of our smartphones: the SIM card.

It all began with an intriguing suggestion made by a team of researchers at Thales to Veolia, the world leader in optimised resource management: every year, SIM cards use almost 20,000 tons of PVC and other polymers – why not work together to find a more environmentally friendly manufacturing process?

After nearly three years of joint development Thales has launched the first SIM card in the world made from plastic that is 100% recycled from polystyrene salvaged from old refrigerators.

Furthermore, Thales has also committed to offsetting the carbon footprint of the other, non-recyclable components of the solution (such as the electronic elements), in order to have a controlled impact on the environment. This will be done thanks to a carbon-offset programme set up by Thales and certified by a specialised agency: Natural Capital Partners, creators of the CarbonNeutral® Protocol.

""This innovation project with Veolia will support our telecom customers in their ecological transition, by transforming waste into environmentally responsible SIM cards,"" says Emmanuel Unguran, Vice-President, Mobile Connectivity Solutions at Thales.

Yves Joannic, Vice-President Main Line Signalling, describes how digitalisation is transforming competitiveness.

Green issues are a big driver for our customers – particularly given the policy focus at EU level. Our customers want to capitalise on their eco-credentials. They need ways to run more trains, reduce costs and improve competitiveness. All of this can be achieved with digital technology.

We support our customers in two ways. First, we focus on life cycle costs. This means providing customers with solutions that they can acquire, operate and maintain at a reasonable cost. Customer satisfaction is the engine of our strategy: always deliver, deliver, deliver – no matter how complex the project.

Innovation is our second priority. Thales is an innovation company and we stay in front by putting new concepts on the table. The key trend here is digitalisation – using hardware and software to get more out of the infrastructure that’s already there. And always improving the customer experience.



Standardisation is important. It’s about enabling a plug-and-play railway, with standard hardware to support the different software applications and digital services we are developing. In future, our customers will upgrade their signalling just by uploading new software.

The work we are doing in Stuttgart for Deutsche Bahn underlines the scope of what we do. This is a comprehensive digitalisation programme, which includes the latest version of ETCS Level 2 digital signalling and Automatic Train Operation. This will help to increase the capacity of the existing rail infrastructure by 20%. All of this is being achieved without laying a single kilometre of new track – everything is driven by data.

This project is significant in another way as well, because it highlights our expertise in brownfield resignalling. This is technically demanding, because work must be carried out with minimum disruption. It underlines the trust that our customer has put in us.

The future for rail is bright. The technologies we are developing will make it brighter still. For example, we are leading a consortium working on autonomous passenger trains for SNCF and bringing in satellite positioning and obstacle detection so trains can make their own decisions.

Underpinning all of this is cybersecurity. This is mandatory – at product level, at system level and at global architecture level. All our solutions are Cybersecured by Design and this includes constant adaptation to evolving threats. Safety is at the heart of everything we do."

Thales presents SelTracTM G8, the 8th generation, Communications Based Train Control (CBTC) system. SelTracTM G8 incorporates the latest technology and innovative features to support operators to reach their ambitions and transforming passenger’s journeys in and around cities.

Rail operators have to transport passengers safely and efficiently, and if a traffic disruption occurs they must keep traffic moving and restore normal service as quickly as possible. The global pandemic has emphasized the need of strong and reliable public transport to support front line workers and the public on their journeys. Most cities are also counting on public transport to restart their economy in a green and efficient way. Therefore metro networks need to be able to boost capacity, meeting growing demand without interrupting day-to-day operations.

Rail operators face many challenges including keeping pace with rapidly evolving technology: while a signalling system may have a lifespan of 30 years or more, the hardware and software on it, can become obsolete much more quickly. They also need ways to manage the lifecycle of their systems.

Thales’ SelTrac™ G8 is designed to alleviate these issues. It includes a set of advanced features that allow public transport operators to manage network growth, extensions, and fleet expansions as well as prepare for the future and control operations.

SelTrac™ G8 has a new digital architecture with flexible options designed to minimize the amount of trackside equipment required. Transport operators who will deploy SelTrac™ G8 can benefit from lifelong system improvements, by simply upgrading the software. The G8 platform can also provide an upgrade to existing SelTrac™ systems. G8 provides investment protection by enabling seamless future technology insertion for performance upgrades or obsolescence management.

SelTrac™ G8 brings enhanced services, to support operators to achieve 100% availability and on time service. Services capabilities including: health monitoring features for leaner maintenance teams and faster response capability, increased resiliency to failure with greater visibility of seamless hardware and software enhancements to extend the system life with no interruption to operations.

Among other improvements, the SelTrac™ G8 platform is autonomy ready. One of the autonomous capabilities is designed to make both greenfield and brownfield CBTC deployments faster and easier than ever, with rapid train conversion and minimal trackside equipment.

""Since its introduction on the urban rail market, SelTracTM has become a global benchmark. With this new generation of the SelTracTM system, Thales is supporting the digital transformation of urban rail operators by delivering an innovative solution that includes the latest technologies and paves the way for the autonomous train operations of the next 30 years and beyond."" – Alcino de Sousa, VP, Managing Director, Thales’s Urban Rail Signalling"

Offer a dual capability to defeat simultaneously all types of targets, in any combination of types.

Counter emerging and future threats as diverse as manoeuvring ballistic missiles, re-entry vehicle ballistic missiles, high-speed tactical missiles, UAVs and highly manoeuvring aircraft, in a saturation attack scenario and a challenging cyber environment.

Deploy quickly with a limited number of personnel and integrate easily in an air-defense network.

With these enhanced features, SAMP/T NG will provide to France, Italy and any other customer, the capability to guarantee their airspace sovereignty, to protect their territory and population and to protect their troops in operations.

Note to readers:

eurosam was established in June 1989 as a joint venture of MBDA and Thales, European leaders in missiles, systems and radars, endowing it with major expertise in terms of solutions for air defense. eurosam is the industrial prime contractor and system design authority for the development, production, marketing, sales and in service support of a range of medium and long range naval and ground-launched air-defense missile systems also known as Future Surface-to-Air Family of ASTER missile systems. These systems were developed under contract from the French and Italian Governments, who in the late 1980s had come to similar conclusions as to their air-defense operational requirements. This cooperation, enlarged to the UK in 1996, has experienced export successes, both in naval and land configurations."

Distributed Intelligent Video Analytics – DIVA - is the new Thales solution to monitor social distancing, and to guide passenger when it is crowded. The solution helps alleviate crowding by reducing dwell times, and consequently enhances overall passenger safety, comfort, and travel experience.

Based on Artificial Intelligence video analytics, DIVA leverages the existing CCTV network on stations and on-board trains to provide real-time information on passenger density.

The targeted performances of density accuracy are above 90%.

This new service is in the top 4 of “what passengers really want”[1].

Thales brings its strengths in video analytics, AI and cybersecurity to the rail domain, with this new digital solution that enables effective crowd management at train stations and on-board trains. Nobody likes crowded trains and platforms. For passengers, crowding is one of the main causes of dissatisfaction. For operators, crowding is a concern because it adds to delays and can affect safety.

This challenge is amplified by growing passenger demand. On the eve of the Covid-19 crisis, annual metro ridership globally was more than 62 billion – up 40% in just seven years – and rising at a rate of more than 5% a year.

Covid-19 has reversed this trend, at least temporarily. At the same time, it has brought the dangers of crowding into sharp focus for everyone. The immediate need is to enable social distancing and to do everything possible to prevent crowds from developing.

But crowding is difficult to manage. First, railways are complex and there are hundreds of locations to be monitored, including trains. Secondly, if transport operators can detect crowding, they still need a way to guide passengers to less busy parts of platforms and trains.

Thales’ DIVA uses existing CCTV cameras – on platforms and trains – to measure crowd density. No additional sensors are required. Passenger density is calculated in real time using video analytics and passenger guidance can be provided via platform displays that show which carriages of an approaching train are busy and which are not with 3 levels of density - red, yellow and green color coding is used to indicate density.

Meanwhile, heat maps of stations and trains can be used in the Operations Control Centre (OCC) to monitor passenger movements across the entire system.

Video analytics can also be used for many other transportation use cases, among them the detection of unattended luggage and trespassing on platforms, and whether there are still passengers onboard when the train reaches the end of the line.

""Rail operators are facing new challenges about passengers’ safety. Passengers need to be able to move freely on stations and platforms, to embark and disembark from trains safely and quickly. These are fundamental requirements for the smooth running of a railway network. Crowding makes all of this more difficult. I’m very pleased to present our new video analytics solution for passenger density monitoring and guidance. This solution provides operators with tools to manage crowding on stations and trains and allows them to tackle the root causes of congestion."" – Benoît Couture, VP, Managing Director, Thales’s Integrated Communication and Supervision Systems

This new system has already been implemented as a pilot in Singapore with SBS Transit in 2020.

Alcino De Sousa, Vice-President Urban Rail Signalling, reveals how new autonomous capabilities could soon transform your metro journey.

The future-proof metro has arrived

Urbanisation is the main driver in our market. Despite Covid-19, cities continue to grow rapidly in many parts of the world. In parallel with this, there is a big push by city authorities to reduce car dependency. All of this boosts demand for public transport, particularly metros and light rail.

We support our customers by providing high-capacity Communications-Based Train Control (CBTC) signalling. Our CBTC solution – SelTrac™ – is the market leader. As well as allowing operators to run more trains, it increases resilience, improves energy efficiency and reduces life cycle costs.

SelTrac™ does a lot of other things that our customers find useful as well. In unattended systems, trains can couple and uncouple automatically to increase capacity. They can also drive themselves to the carriage washing plant – a key consideration in pandemic times.

An important point about SelTrac™ is that it is natively driverless. This gives our customers tremendous flexibility. Operators can bring extra trains into service at the click of a mouse. The Covid-19 crisis underlines just how valuable this capability can be, particularly as new travel patterns evolve.

The market for CBTC is buoyant, despite the pandemic. The greenfield (new lines) sector is growing rapidly, particularly in Asia. We continue to see strong growth in the brownfield (resignalling) sector as well. SelTrac™ is now used on more than 100 metro lines worldwide.

Customer needs are evolving. First, there is a need for easy upgrades to take advantage of future technological evolutions. Second, there is a need for quicker deployment of new signalling. This is a key requirement for brownfield systems because downtime is less and less of an option. Third, our customers want 100% availability to make the most of their infrastructure and efficiently utilise their networks.

Our brand new SelTrac™ G8 solution is designed to satisfy all of these needs. G8 is incredibly easy to upgrade. For example, with our new platform, customers will be able to access new cybersecurity services or make the switch from Wi-Fi to 5G in the future just by upgrading the software. We call this technology insertion.

SelTrac™ G8 is also easy to deploy. It’s our first autonomy-ready solution for metros, and one of the early stage capabilities is autonomous positioning. This uses inertial navigation, radar and radio ranging to provide accurate train positioning. It requires very little trackside equipment. Train equipment can be installed in a few days – a huge time saving.

Finally, SelTrac™ G8 helps operators to maximise the availability of their networks thanks to greater visibility of assets.

To sum up, SelTrac™ G8 helps our customers to get the most out of their metros. And because it reduces disruption and boosts reliability, it improves the passenger experience as well.

Could you briefly describe your job?

I’m the Engineering Manager for Digital Products, in the Digital and Detection Product Line at Thales Alenia Space in Spain. I lead a team of 20 people with very diverse skills, from microelectronics designers and hardware designers, to digital signal processing experts and IVVQ (Integration Verification Validation Qualification) managers. We’re all focused on the same goal: to design and develop the best processing units for our customers. We also develop all the application-specific and programmable integrated circuits for all of our products.

We cover the lifecycle, from drawing up proposals to delivering flight units. At the same time, we carry out extensive R&D, along with the product line manager, to develop new products and explore new technologies.

I started my career in 1997, right after earning my degree. I have been working at Thales Alenia Space ever since, starting at the testing department for three years and then the RF product line for ten more years, as technical manager in charge of different projects. In 2010 I moved to the Digital and Detection Product Line to lead bid preparation for Meteosat Third Generation (MTG) video units (Imager and Sounder satellites). Thales Alenia Space in Spain won these contracts, which were very important because it allowed us to expand our expertise in spaceborne video technology. I worked on these two projects until 2016, when I started my current job.

When I look back to the beginning, I’m surprised how time flies! It has been an amazing journey and I feel like my colleagues in Madrid are part of my family.

What part of your job are you most proud of?

It may sound like a cliché, but I’m proudest of the extraordinary spirit of cooperation that we have developed, not only in my team, but throughout the facility. We face every kind of situations with an exemplary team spirit. I really feel that this is the energy that we all need at company level to face the current environment, which has been dubbed VUCA – Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, and Ambiguity – because of changing market conditions, new technologies, new actors, new ways of working, the digital transformation and much more.

Attracting and keeping talent is essential, but if there’s no team spirit, you’re sure to fail; nobody is capable of delivering a product alone. On the contrary, people with good soft skills can receive technical training and contribute to the team’s success. The key to success is motivation and cooperation …and we have a lot of that at Thales Alenia Space in Spain!

Does any event in your career to date stand out?

When we won the two MTG Video Unit contracts it was an explosion of happiness, because the whole team worked very hard for a long time. I was not really aware then of how important these projects were going to be for me, professionally and personally. I’m really proud of working for a company that has been at the forefront of spaceborne meteorology since the late 70s, from the first to the second and now the third generation of Meteosat (MTG).

When I was appointed to my current position, I did not expect it at all and it was a combination of excitement, responsibility and challenge: I was leading two large projects but I was not anybody’s line manager. My team comprises some brilliant engineers, and I felt like I was given a Ferrari and I had to learn how to drive it to the pole position without skidding off-course. That was a very motivating challenge, to say the least!

Today my team is in charge of some key products and we are leading many innovative projects. For example, we are leading the technical development of two units for the Spainsat NG program: the HILINK and the UHF processor (which is the core of the UHF payload). Since the Spainsat NG program marks a turning point in Thales Alenia Space’s place in the value chain of the Spanish space industry, I am very proud to take an active role in this program.

In three words, what are the qualities required in your profession?

What I have learned is that a good leader must LISTEN (to her team, environment, peers and managers).

A good leader should support and EMPOWER the team: if we hire them it’s because we trust their abilities.

The third word is TALK: honest and direct communication is fundamental to avoid misunderstandings and to improve our joint efficiency.

Sara Bernardini, Professor of AI

If you want to know what the real future holds for artificial intelligence (AI) and the world of autonomous robots and platforms, you would do well to listen to Professor Sara Bernardini.

A former NASA space mission operations research scientist, Sara is Professor of Artificial Intelligence in the Department of Computer Science at Royal Holloway, University of London and is a frequent voice in both the media and academic channels on the topical subject of AI.

Prof Bernardini’s specialist area of expertise is the development of AI and robotics in extreme environments and is currently co-principal investigator for three Innovate UK projects that are taking these concepts into reality.

Thales is currently working with Sara on two of the projects and we asked her to take time out to reflect on her remarkable career to date.

The first project is MIMRee (Multi-Platform Inspection, Maintenance & Repair in Extreme Environments) which is building the world’s first fully autonomous multi-robotic platform for offshore windfarm inspection and repair.

The second is Prometheus which is focussing on building an intelligent, reconfigurable drone for the exploration of confined spaces such as underground mines or tunnels.

Speaking of her involvement, Sara said: “One of the things that I’ve tried to stay close to in my career so far is applying my ideas to real-life problems.

Courtesy of BladeBUG Ltd

“In all these projects, I am responsible for the design and implementation of the robots' autonomy architecture, which makes them capable of undertaking sophisticated tasks without close human supervision.

“Extreme environments interest me because by their very nature they are so challenging, it’s not a calm, benign space. You are asking a robotic platform to be risk aware, to do its job in a difficult scenario.

“For example, with MIMRee, the Thales autonomous boat is taking out a team of robot bugs and drones to sea to a place where humans operate in dangerous conditions. The drones have to airlift the robot bugs onto the blades so they can crawl around – all three have to co-operate to be successful and to land.

“There are strong similarities with space where NASA has to put humans and sensitive technology in demanding conditions a long way from home and safety.”

Sara’s road to NASA is a story in itself. After gaining a BSc and MSc in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Rome, she received her PhD in AI from the University of Trento.

She said: “At high school in Rome, I initially took classical studies – ancient Greek and Latin etc, but I was lucky to be selected for a high achievers school in Rome. I was more and more drawn to thinking about how does the mind work and what is intelligence?

“At university – where I’ll admit I didn’t exactly enjoy every subject – it was my third year that I really began to study AI. It was also a time where I developed a love of astronomy and thinking what life or intelligence was out there beyond Earth?

“So I applied for an internship at NASA. Looking back, I don’t think foreign students were even eligible. But I got it and it led to a contract as a research scientist and it was one of the most amazing periods in my life. These were the days of the Mars Spirit and Opportunity missions.

“Everyone was so friendly and yet so committed. Here were people that could easily earn fortunes working for the big internet giants but had a sense of mission – to explore space for the benefit of humanity. It was inspiring and humbling at the same time.

Courtesy of BladeBUG Ltd

“Now, my research focuses on designing and engineering intelligent and autonomous systems for complex, real-world applications that sit at the crossing points of AI, advanced robotics and mathematical optimisation.

“That’s why these projects are so interesting and bring together academia and industry.

“My ultimate goal is to create machines that can seamlessly support humans in undertaking sophisticated tasks that – going beyond perception and pattern matching – require deliberation at the reasoning level.

“It’s been an interesting journey from Rome to my current role, but one that I’ve enjoyed. Royal Holloway suits me on a number of levels. Firstly, I love the intellectual stimulation of teaching both undergraduates and those studying for their masters. It is also such a peaceful place and is one of the most beautiful campuses in the UK.

Aerospace company Thales has launched a digital secondary surveillance radar named RSM NG for use in air traffic management (ATM).

The radar can track up to 2,000 flights and disseminate 64 simultaneous data outputs to different air traffic control centres (ATCC).

RSM NG is equipped with a two-in-one meta-sensor and combines automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) and radar (Mode S) data to provide ‘quicker’ detection and tracking initialisation.

Thales stated that the meta-sensor will enable air traffic controllers to ensure 3nm (5,500m) separation between the aircrafts in the terminal area airspace.

With two electronic cabinets instead of three, the design weight and volume of the RSM NG radar are 30% less than other radars.

In addition to reducing radio frequency pollution, the new radar is based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) international framework and can also be upgraded in the future.

"Thales, MHI join forces on innovative mine warfare sonar technology - Naval News","Tue, 30 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdmFsbmV3cy5jb20vbmF2YWwtbmV3cy8yMDIxLzAzL3RoYWxlcy1taGktam9pbi1mb3JjZXMtb24taW5ub3ZhdGl2ZS1taW5lLXdhcmZhcmUtc29uYXItdGVjaG5vbG9neS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales, MHI join forces on innovative mine warfare sonar technology Following the signature by the French Defence procurement agency (DGA) and its Japanese counterpart, the Acquisition, Technology & Logistics Agency (ATLA), of a Defence cooperation agreement, Thales and MHI are joining forces to develop a Dual Frequency sonar demonstrator to be evaluated at sea both in Japanese and French waters.

Thales press release

Within the framework of the French-Japanese bilateral Defence agreement, France and Japan have signed a Project Arrangement for the second phase of the cooperation project consisting of the development by Thales and MHI of a dual frequency sonar demonstrator for mine countermeasures aboard an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV).

While mines or even the possibility of mines potentially threaten everyone at sea, dealing with them effectively is vital in keeping key trade corridors open and guaranteeing maritime access and force projection—this is especially important for countries with highly valuable assets or ports that have a high volume of commercial traffic. In response to the growing threat posed by bottom laid, semi or fully buried mines in coastal areas, DGA and ATLA have decided to cooperate in order to study the performances of innovative dual frequency sonar technology.

« Au Japon, Thales s’attache à mettre en œuvre des partenariats durables et à long terme avec les acteurs et industriels clés du pays. Ce partenariat étendu avec MHI atteste de notre engagement auprès du Japon et de notre volonté de renforcer les liens bilatéraux entre les deux nations. Je suis certain que nos technologies et notre étroite collaboration permettront d’offrir des solutions uniques et innovantes qui renforceront les capacités de la force maritime d’auto-défense japonaise, en jetant les bases d’une expertise locale pour l’avenir. » Cyrille Dupont, Président et CEO, Thales au Japon

To achieve this, both countries have chosen to trust MHI and Thales, who share technological excellence and complement each other, strengthening through this agreement their continuous and successful collaboration. As a world leader in mine countermeasures with over 300 mine-hunting systems in service worldwide, Thales will provide its recognized expertise in sonar processing as well as its latest generation High Frequency synthetic aperture sonar, SAMDIS, with multi-aspect capability. MHI on its side will provide its Low Frequency synthetic aperture sonar and the OZZ-5 AUV.

Thales rendering

The smart integration of the High Frequency & Low Frequency sonars, coupled with a combined automatic detection and classification function, will not only provide capability and performance enhancement into a single solution but will also mutually benefit each sonar’s processing and imaging. This will result in a unique autonomous mine countermeasure system capable of detecting, classifying and localizing all types of mines (from fully buried mines to ground mines).

« Thales est très fier de contribuer à ce premier projet de coopération franco-japonaise dans le domaine de la Défense, aux côtés de notre partenaire MHI. Nous sommes impatients de pouvoir mettre en œuvre notre expertise, largement démontrée en conditions opérationnelles, avec notre sonar à haute fréquence SAMDIS, dont bénéficieront les forces de défense française et japonaise grâce à cette coopération unique pour des mers plus sûres. » Alexis Morel, vice-président Underwater Systems, Thales

This agreement kicks off a 5-year project for design, development and integration of the dual frequency synthetic aperture sonar processing, and at sea experiments (in Japan & in France). Testing will be conducted in Japan through 2024, followed by trials in France.

This is the materialization of years of long cooperative efforts between the DGA, ATLA, Thales and MHI to jointly build a project that satisfies both French Navy and Japanese Maritime Self-Defence Force requirements and allows France and Japan to stay at the forefront of innovation on unmanned mine countermeasure systems."

Could you briefly describe your job?

I’m a project manager, which means I oversee several projects, from the original proposal phase to delivery to the customer. I work with a team of course, and I make sure we comply with specifications, including costs, deadlines, quality and technical characteristics.

What part of your job are you most proud of?

Being able to work with people from all horizons, with different cultures and professional experiences, and teaming up to build state-of-the-art instruments to be sent into space. These instruments are capable of gathering and transmitting vital data that will be analyzed by scientists for decades to come, and I find that extremely gratifying. We feel that we’re doing our bit to advance science and knowledge in general, which is very stimulating from an intellectual viewpoint.

Do any events in your career stand out?

I was delighted to work on the technologies for the cameras on the ExoMars rover.

As you know, ExoMars is a joint program between ESA and the Russian space agency Roscosmos, with Thales Alenia Space as prime. In October 2016, the Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) entered the Martian atmosphere after a long interplanetary voyage lasting nearly seven months and covering some 500 million kilometers. TGO entered its orbit for scientific observations in April 2018. Its mission is to “sniff” the Martian atmosphere for traces of gas, in particular methane, an essential compound of life, and determine if it’s of biological or geological origin.

TGO also serves as a communications relay between Mars and Earth. Quite recently, the whole world was watching as NASA’s Perseverance rover set down on the Red Planet. We are eagerly awaiting the arrival of ESA’s own rover on Mars, where it will drill into the surface to a depth of two meters. The samples collected will then be analyzed in the rover’s own lab, to look for traces of bacteria, and this data will then be transmitted via the orbital module, used as a relay for communications to Earth from NASA’s rovers and ESA’s upcoming rover – which should begin operations on Mars in 2023.

I’m very proud to be working for a company that’s leading a mission to look for traces of past life on Mars. Over and above the fascinating science, we’re now venturing into unknown territory: Is there life on other planets? Are we alone in the Universe?

At our plant in Zurich, we’re developing several cameras for the ExoMars rover: two wide angle cameras (WAC) and one called CLUPI (Close-UP Imager). The two WACs will be directly integrated in PanCam, a panoramic camera supplied by European labs and universities, part of the payload on the rover, operating in both the visible and near infrared bandwidths. I was delighted to work on CLUPI, a camera mounted on the arm that holds the drill. It will provide close-up images of Martian terrain, including rocks, soil and cliffs.

Among our many contributions to European space missions, Thales Alenia Space in Switzerland worked with Swiss universities to develop the telescope for the CaSSIS instrument on ExoMars, the receiver in the laser altimeter (BELA) on BepiColombo, and the electronics for the forward-facing inertial sensor on LISA Pathfinder.

In the Earth observation sector, I was the project head for the A/B1 phase of a subassembly to be carried on the European mission CO2M. These two EO satellites will play a key role in environmental monitoring, by measuring the carbon dioxide content in the atmosphere generated by human activity. Thales Alenia Space is in charge of developing the two payloads for this mission, with OHB as prime. I’m delighted to be working for a company that applies its expertise to environmental monitoring from space. Thales Alenia Space has been selected for five of Europe’s six Copernicus Expansion missions, including three as prime contractor (CHIME, CIMR et ROSE-L) and two as payload supplier (CRISTAL and CO2M).

What are the qualities required in your profession?

In my opinion, it’s essential to know how to manage stress, to work in a team – that’s really important – to listen to internal and external stakeholders, and above all to really understand and address customer expectations.

In addition, you have to be flexible and know how to adapt to rapidly changing situations, which also remaining pragmatic at all times.

I work in the space exploration and science field at Thales Alenia Space in Italy, based in Turin. As the name suggests, we design, develop, manufacture, integrate, test and operate space systems for scientific applications, human and robotic exploration, and space transportation.

Chances are you’ve heard of us if you have read about the ExoMars mission, for which we are prime contractor. Or maybe you have seen pictures of the Cupola and other modules on the International Space Station, for which we provided approximately half of the ISS pressurized volume. And if you know about Europe’s contribution to the American Artemis program, then perhaps you already know that we will provide several major elements for the Lunar Gateway space station, including IHAB and ESPRIT for ESA and the pressurized module for NASA’s HALO, for Northrop Grumman.

I joined Thales Alenia Space in 2006, when I was still an undergraduate student in aerospace engineering, and since then I have taken a pretty diversified path. I started out as an R&D engineer, then became a thermal and environmental control engineer, and more recently transitioned to project management and business development.

I am currently the deputy program manager for a team that is designing the next-generation pressurized space modules; we’re developing and testing a number of key technological building blocks for a habitat designed to work in the lunar environment and keep astronauts safe.

At the same time, I oversee new human spaceflight initiatives, which basically means figuring out where tomorrow’s business opportunities lie and trying to make them a reality by drawing on a combination of our heritage, innovation and fruitful relationships with partners and customers.

What part of your job are you most proud of?

© Dynetics

Even when I’m doing something routine, if I take a step back I remember that I’m working in a fascinating field with amazing people. I am proud that all our efforts culminate in products that push the boundaries of what is technically and scientifically feasible. Also, that what we achieve is never banal, easy or taken for granted, and that we’re striving to do something bigger for our customers and society at large.

I am proud to work for a company that is a major partner on cutting edge missions across the Solar System. On the scientific side, we will contribute to bringing Martian samples back to Earth thanks through Mars Sample Return mission. When it comes to space logistics, we supply the pressurized cargo modules to Northrop Grumman for Cygnus resupply vessels. In Low Earth Orbit, we have been chosen by Axiom Space to provide two pressurized modules for their future commercial space station, featuring Philippe Starck’s interior designs.

And speaking of space exploration, we are involved in Orion, NASA's deep space human transportation vehicle and in a number of new programs, including the Dynetics-led consortium to help develop the Human Landing System for Artemis.

Does any event in your career to date stand out?

It’s not a specific event so much as my commitment to helping students with their career orientation.

I have always welcomed every opportunity to communicate about my job. I enjoy giving lectures, speeches, workshops… everything that may transfer a little bit of my enthusiasm to other people, let them understand how beautiful and diverse the space field is, and encourage them to delve deeper.

Attracting young talent to the space sector means investing in the future. I love to think that what we do here is not something we are creating for ourselves, it’s not something that begins and ends in the span of one career. It’s our duty to look after this legacy until it’s time to pass the torch to those that will come after us.

In 3 words, what are the qualities required in your profession?

Devotion: to care deeply and be passionate about your work, to bring the love for your job into everything you do, embracing the fact that your personal and professional lives may become blurred, and to show grit and dedication in all your endeavors.

Self-motivation: to be aware of your own goals and purpose, and use them as a reason to come back to your work every day with renewed energy, even (especially!) when things get tough.

Humility: to recognize that what we do in space is difficult, that you cannot accomplish great things alone, that you better learn as much as you can from those around you and never be ashamed to ask questions or seek help.

Thales unveils its TSA 6000 IFF active E-Scan interrogator - EDR Magazine,"Fri, 12 Mar 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVkcm1hZ2F6aW5lLmV1L3RoYWxlcy11bnZlaWxzLWl0cy10c2EtNjAwMC1hZXNhLWZsYXQtcGFuZWwtaWZm0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Luca Peruzzi and Paolo Valpolini

To answer the latest needs in terms of naval air defence identification Thales has unveiled its new TSA 6000 IFF, based on four flat panel AESA antennas operating simultaneously, each providing a coverage of around 100°, that can be easily integrated in any ship structure in order to provide full 360° coverage, the declared range being 360 km .

“This new system will allow to take more accurate and faster decisions,” Marie-Pierre Guilbert, Thales IFF Product Line Manager said, underlining that the first application of this new system will be on French Navy FDI (Frégate de Défense et d’Intervention), which is being equipped with Thales 3D SeaFire multi-function radar, the delivery of the first-of-class being forecasted for 2024.

The latest evolution of Thales’ BlueGate IFF family, the TSA 6000 panels are 1,464 mm long, 430 mm high, and have a depth of 314 mm, the flat panel containing an undisclosed number of transmitting-receiving modules, which ensure a graceful degradation capability, and a processing module to coordinate all TRMs, cooling being ensured by natural convection. According to Mrs. Guilbert, “the TSA 6000 can track well over 1,000 targets at a time.”

Each flat panel antenna, which weighs 55 kg, is then digitally linked to a COTS computer fitted into a 19” rack, that manages the coordination between the antennas. The system covers all commercial, A, C and S, and military IFF standards, 1, 2, 3/A, 4 and 5 (Level 1 and 2), and is fully compliant with Mode 5 Stanag 4193 edition 3 (equivalent to US DoD AIMS 03-1000B), this standard having become mandatory for units engaged in NATO operations since July 1st 2020, and Mode S level 2.

“The adoption of AESA flat panel antennas provide considerable advantages in terms of quick response compared to rotating IFFs,” Mrs. Guilbert added, “but also provide improved availability and unmatched reliability.” Giving away all mechanical parts considerably reduces the chances for failures, hence MTBCF is much higher, over 5,000 hours; not only, HUMS (Health and Usage Monitoring Systems) have been inserted, allowing predictive maintenance, thus further increasing availability. All this also allows to reduce cost of ownership. Flat panel antennas, which can be installed in a totally independent way compared to the on board radar, even if the latter is based on AESA flat panel antennas, also contribute to reduce as much as possible the ship radar signature, while their overall weight, around 220 kg, is much lesser than the average available IFF system of that same class, according to Thales.

In early 2021 the company has delivered a first test system with two panel antennas to the French Navy and Naval Group, to be integrated into the FDI onshore test bed at DGA’s Air Defense Systems Experimentation Site (SESDA) in Saint Mandrier. The delivery of a full four-panel system is planned before year-end. This might well be installed on the first-of-class FDI frigate for completing the integration process ashore before starting trials at sea.

Designed hand in hand with the French Navy, the TSA 6000 looks also to the export market, numerous potential customers having been identified and talks being already undergoing, EDR On-Line understood, which of course remain confidential. “The geometry of the system allows it to be easily integrated both on new ships as well as on existing ones,” Marie-Pierre Guilbert says, explaining that not only the TSA 6000 can be installed to replace older IFF systems, but it can also be added i.e. to cover blind sectors. Asked about competitors, the Thales IFF Product Line Manager said that legacy rotating radars belong to a whole different category, while existing AESA solutions are bigger and heavier that the TSA 6000, which therefore has an edge over other IFF systems of its class. Entirely produced in France, the TSA 6000 is not subject to ITAR regulations and does not fall under the German export control rules.

According to Marie-Pierre Guilbert the new Thales IFF system is ready for production; it will be available on the market one year after the delivery of the first system to the Marine Nationale, which means late 2022, and a customer might expect a delivery time of 12-18 months from the order. The TSA 6000 is not limited to naval use and can also operate in conjunction with ground-based multi-function radar systems.

Thales, a global leader in high technology solutions, Invision AI, a Toronto-based technology start-up and Metrolinx, the regional transportation agency for the Province of Ontario, have joined forces to help shape the future of transit technology with support from the Ontario government, through AVIN’s WinterTech Development program, and led by the Ontario Centre of Innovation. WinterTech supports small and medium-sized enterprises and their partners by commercializing winter-ready innovative mobility solutions.

The Ontario government’s contribution to this project, through AVIN, of $483,600 leverages partners’ contributions of $992,760, for a total project value of $1,476,360.

Invision AI, Thales and Metrolinx are building unique sensing and computing capabilities that provide enhanced situational awareness to existing rail systems and are capable of operating in severe winter conditions. The goal of this partnership is to build a platform that will ultimately enable deployments in urban, regional and mainline rail networks globally.

Within a six-month period, the system was prototyped and installed on a Metrolinx GO train, operating on multiple lines in Toronto, Ontario. The system is equipped on the front of the train and includes; radars, cameras and lidar, for multi-spectral sensing ahead of the train, along with a cyber secured 4G/LTE connected data collection and processing system. These technologies actively collect important data which can then be used to train the system to recognize obstacles and other dangers. The data gathering activities will continue for an additional six months in different weather and environmental conditions.

Additionally, the technology equipped on the train is providing real-time information and data – such as next generation positioning, train telemetry, and diagnostics information – to ensure the system is running smoothly.

For operators, the benefits of this new solution include enhanced safety, rapid installation time due to the minimal equipment footprint, enhanced ‘look ahead’ sensing to detect and track potential obstacles, and accurate real-time data collection crucial for maintenance and operations teams. For passengers, this will contribute to fewer delays, improved safety and enhanced reliability of the network.

This project aligns with Metrolinx’s safety-first culture for staff, customers and community members by limiting the possibility of train incidents. In addition, the project positions Canada to be the first to introduce advance driver assistance and autonomous technologies that can function in all weather conditions.

“Metrolinx is proud to support this initiative with Invision and Thales. A focus on safety is central to delivering a world class transit system, and innovative solutions like this one are an important part of this work.” – Phil Verster, CEO, Metrolinx

“We are excited to be solving the difficulties associated with autonomous rail systems and harsh winter conditions, an interesting challenge that we can all relate to. The data collected from the GO train has allowed us to gain unique insights into how to address the complex needs of transport operators globally” – Karim Ali, CEO, Invision AI

“Thales is proud to partner with Metrolinx and the Ontario Centre of Innovation to create a solution that will improve transit systems for both operators and passengers. Partnering with Invision AI has been a fantastic experience and showcases the power of collaboration to reach a common goal; bringing world-class transit solutions to Ontario.” – Mark Halinaty, President and CEO, Thales Canada

“No matter what the weather is, safety within Ontario’s transit networks remains our top priority. This partnership between Metrolinx, Thales and Invision AI shows the potential benefit emerging technologies could have on the future of transit in our province. We remain committed to keeping transit operators and passengers moving safely and with fewer delays year-round.” – Caroline Mulroney, Ontario Minister of Transportation

“This project demonstrates the strengths of Ontario’s Autonomous Vehicle Innovation Network: bringing together ambitious technology start-ups and industry leaders to pioneer next-generation mobility technologies with global potential. This unique partnership between Invision AI, Thales and Metrolinx offers enhanced safety and efficiency for rail systems around the world, particularly those operating in harsh winter climates. It’s an endeavour we’re very proud to support.” – Vic Fedeli, Ontario Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade"
French Team Submits New Strategic Package Offer for the Hellenic Navy - Naval News,"Tue, 02 Mar 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdmFsbmV3cy5jb20vbmF2YWwtbmV3cy8yMDIxLzAzL2ZyZW5jaC10ZWFtLXN1Ym1pdHMtbmV3LXN0cmF0ZWdpYy1wYWNrYWdlLW9mZmVyLWZvci10aGUtaGVsbGVuaWMtbmF2eS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"French Team Submits New Strategic Package Offer for the Hellenic Navy A ""French Team"" consisting of three major defense companies (Naval Group, Thales, MBDA) recently submitted a new offer to Greece for the Hellenic Navy surface combatants requirement: It consists in FDI Frigates as part of a global strategic package.

Talking to Naval News, an industry source with direct knowledge of the negotiations said that the “Team France” offer is a comprehensive and robust strategic package designed to ensure Greece has the best capabilities in the shortest timeframe with optimized costs. Our source added:

This offers addresses all the needs of the Hellenic Navy and enables a fast track acquisition.

With this package, France will ensure that the Hellenic Navy capabilities are enhanced to meet immediate needs including:

MEKO modernization program

A stop-gap solution

4 FDI next generation frigates

For the record, France and Greece were involved in exclusive negotiations for a while, for two FDI type frigates. However, despite the signing of an LOI in October 2019, Greece decided to keep its options open and is now considering several designs. The designs being considered, in addition to the FDI, are:

Lockheed Martin with the MMSC

TKMS with the MEKO A200NG (or MEKO A300)

Damen with an unspecified design

Babcock with the Type 31

The procurement process doesn’t seem to be a “classic open tender” but rather government to government (G to G) discussions with each party.

MEKO modernization program

To meet Greece’s requirements, Naval Group have joined forces with Thales (the OEM of the Hydra-class combat management system) to offer “a risk-free solution for the upgrade of the MEKO”.

By combining their specific knowledge and expertise, Thales and Naval Group are ideally placed to offer an optimal cost-performance compromise, both for the mid-life upgrade program itself and to guarantee the operational availability of the ships.

The “Team France” proposal calls for the MEKO MLU to be carried out in a Greek shipyard, with the participation of Greek industry. In this respect, Thales can count on the presence of Thales Hellas S.A. and on the relations already established between Thales and Naval Group with existing industrial partners.

Regarding the level of commonality between the equipment of the FDI in “Hellenic Navy” configuration and the equipment aboard the upgraded MEKO, our source said work on the planned final configuration is still ongoing.

Stop-gap solution

Because of the urgent requirement of the Hellenic Navy, the French offer includes a “stop-gap solution” consisting in second hand frigates to be transferred as soon as possible to Greece, likely after an upgrade and modernization. Details on this stop-gap solution are scarce, if not non-existent: Our industry sources declined to comment. Contacted by Naval News, spokespersons at the DGA and French Navy declined to comment while the spokesman of the French Ministry of Armed Forces did not return calls requesting comment.

The number of vessels being offered as stop-gap is not known, nor is their type. However the only available units would be the two non-modernized La Fayette-class frigates and one (soon two) Cassard-class frigates. Because of the age of the Cassard-class, we believe the most viable option would be the transfer of La Fayette-class frigates Surcouf and Guépratte to Greece. In 2017, the DGA awarded the FLF renovation program contract calling for the upgrade of three of the five La Fayette-class stealth frigates (FLF) operated by the French Navy: Naval Group will renovate the Courbet, the Aconit and the Lafayette in Toulon.

FDI Hellenic Navy

“Team France” offers to Greece the FDI “Hellenic Navy”. It is a next generation surface combatant featuring the latest technologies from the European defense industries Thales, MBDA and Naval Group. She has been designed to deal with the latest threats, and her physical and digital infrastructures guarantee an evolutionary potential that will ensure that the Hellenic Navy will be able to deal with emerging and future threats over the life of the ship (UAVs, Cyber, anti-ship ballistic missiles, hypersonic missiles, stealth threats underwater or above water, etc.).

The FDI Hellenic Navy will be a power and sovereignty asset for Greece. She offers unrivalled capabilities for the permanent control of air and sea space and autonomy of action, in support of the political and military objectives set. As a result, the Hellenic Navy will necessarily be integrated into any planning of inter- allied naval air operations and will have a very high military resilience in combat.

According to our information, the “Team France” offers consist in four FDI “Hellenic Navy”. Construction of the first one would take place in France to ensure operation by Greece in the shortest timeframe, and to secure the transfer of technology to allow construction of three frigates in Greece.

The proposed industrial cooperation plan will make it possible to build a real Defense Industrial Base for the naval domain in Greece, capable of producing several frigates in the country, and above all to provide business for several dozen Greek companies and several hundred Greek citizens.

A defensive asset for air-sea control

The key strengths for the FDI for air-sea control are:

Thales Sea Fire radar , the first fully digital radar with four flat antennas based on AESA technology, provides access to a surveillance volume of several hundred kilometers and is capable of detecting stealth threats, from unmanned vehicles to hypersonic missiles. Its extended anti- aircraft capability enables it to provide protection, defense and intervention against the most effective airborne threats.

, the first fully digital radar with four flat antennas based on AESA technology, provides access to a surveillance volume of several hundred kilometers and is capable of detecting stealth threats, from unmanned vehicles to hypersonic missiles. Its extended anti- aircraft capability enables it to provide protection, defense and intervention against the most effective airborne threats. Integrated missile launch sequence with high reactivity and extreme precision. The FDI missiles, associated with the Sea Fire radar, are specifically designed to respond to all types of missile threats, in particular supersonic. They guarantee exceptional performance in the field of anti-missile defense, in particular thanks to its unique force piloting system. These performances have been confirmed by several firings by the French Navy against supersonic missiles, the only ones carried out by a European navy. The automatic processing provided by TEWA (Threat Evaluation and Weapon Assignment) enhance the performance of this launch sequence.

A multi-source and fully interoperable information system is essential in today’s complex environments. The FDI Hellenic Navy systems are integrated by the SETIS Combat Management System, providing the ship with a real multi-threat processing capacity thanks to the quality and precision of the tactical situation, made possible by the fusion of data from all the sensors on board.

FDI Hellenic Navy’s resilience is highly performant thanks to Naval Group’s know-how and great care in design. Ease of use thanks to ergonomic interfaces allows for reliable and efficient weapon deployment. This reliability benefits from the Navy’s operational feedback from the Horizon frigates for anti-air warfare capabilities and from the FREMM frigates for anti-submarine warfare capabilities. Self- protection is reinforced by the latest-generation electronic warfare system. The cyber threat is considered right from the ship’s design stage by a system that makes the ship highly resilient in this area, covering all the ship’s equipment and functional chains. Finally, the architectural choices make the frigate highly resistant to combat damage. The propulsion system, all the critical services on board, the data centers and the damage control system are totally redundant and the ship is divided into two zones separated by a double watertight bulkhead resistant to missile effects. The two onboard data centers are designed around a cloud-type distributed digital architecture and enable the ship’s systems to be immediately reconfigured in the event of damage in combat.

The Hellenic Navy will also benefit from the highest level of availability of its fleet for a reduced cost of ownership thanks to : Innovative technical solutions proposed in terms of maintainability The ability of manufacturers to provide proven and high-performance support solutions, Basing all Through-Life Support operations in Greece.



FDI is not only an excellent naval power asset, it is also a valuable anti-missile system capable of fighting both cruise missile and ballistic missile attacks. The joint use of the Sea Fire radar and her missiles already offers an excellent platform to protect a sensitive site with very little notice and without constraint, for example during an international summit or in the face of a specific threat, such as the Athens conurbation, from saturation attacks using cruise missiles, as well as ballistic missiles with a range of less than 600 km.

A defensive asset for air-sea control

Cyberattacks armed UAVs, swarms of UAVs, hypersonic missiles, ballistic anti-ship missiles are all new threats with constantly increasing performances that the FDI Hellenic Navy will be able to handle thanks to its outstanding upgradability, both in the physical and digital domain:

Numerous predispositions have been implemented: weigh volume, electrical & refrigeration reservations, hangar door dedicated to UAVs, etc. to allow the subsequent integration of new capabilities.

The frigate’s digital architecture offers a high level of adaptability to extremely rapid developments in ever-changing information technology. The digital infrastructure is derived from technology in the financial sector (banks, insurance, etc.) and enables large quantities of data to be processed, with reliability and security being critical.

The frigate’s distributed architecture is designed to allow rapid, simple and low-cost operational evolution of new systems or software, without profoundly impacting the ship’s availability.

Naval News understand the final configuration of the FDI “Hellenic Navy” variant will depend on the customer’s final choices.

Strategic industrial partnership with the Greek Industry

The French team is committed to implementing a very ambitious industrial cooperation plan that will benefit Greece, both in the context of the acquisition of FDI Hellenic Navy and, more broadly, in the long-term development of the Greek naval industry.

The proposed industrial cooperation plan will contribute to the revival of a profitable naval industry while significantly increasing Greece’s autonomy and sovereignty and will allow international recognition of the excellence of its naval industry.

Naval Group has a long history and successful track record of transfer of technology and production for both surface ships and submarines. Looking forward to working with the Greek industry to build and sustain the FDI Hellenic Navy in the country, Naval Group has already started conducting extensive industrial surveys to include Greek companies in its worldwide supply chain.

Nine companies are already registered as Naval Group suppliers, and about twenty more candidates have already been identified. In addition, partnerships with three Hellenic universities are established

Beyond the FDI program, the know-how that the French team will share with the Greek industry within the framework of a Technology Transfer will enable it to take part in increasingly complex projects with very high added value in order to create and then sustain hundreds of qualified jobs and generate long- term economic spin-offs in Greece.

The industrial cooperation plan includes the following components:"

While mines or even the possibility of mines potentially threaten everyone at sea, dealing with them effectively is vital in keeping key trade corridors open and guaranteeing maritime access and force projection—this is especially important for countries with highly valuable assets or ports that have a high volume of commercial traffic. In response to the growing threat posed by bottom laid, semi or fully buried mines in coastal areas, DGA and ATLA have decided to cooperate in order to study the performances of innovative dual frequency sonar technology.

To achieve this, both countries have chosen to trust MHI and Thales, who share technological excellence and complement each other, strengthening through this agreement their continuous and successful collaboration. As a world leader in mine countermeasures with over 300 mine-hunting systems in service worldwide, Thales will provide its recognised expertise in sonar processing as well as its latest generation High Frequency synthetic aperture sonar, SAMDIS, with multi-aspect capability. MHI on its side will provide its Low Frequency synthetic aperture sonar and the OZZ-5 AUV.

The smart integration of the High Frequency & Low Frequency sonars, coupled with a combined automatic detection and classification function, will not only provide capability and performance enhancement into a single solution but will also mutually benefit each sonar’s processing and imaging. This will result in a unique autonomous mine countermeasure system capable of detecting, classifying and localising all types of mines from fully buried mines to ground mines.

This agreement kicks off a 5-year project for design, development and integration of the dual frequency synthetic aperture sonar processing, and at sea experiments (in Japan & in France). This is the materialisation of years of long cooperative efforts between the DGA, ATLA, Thales and MHI to jointly build a project that satisfies both French Navy and Japanese Maritime Self-Defence Force requirements and allows France and Japan to stay at the forefront of innovation on unmanned mine countermeasure systems.

“Thales is very proud to be part, together with our partner MHI, of the very first Franco-Japanese Defence Cooperation project. We are really enthusiastic to bring our field proven expertise with our SAMDIS High Frequency sonar for the benefit of France and Japan national and foreign Defense forces through this successful unique cooperation for safer seas.” Alexis Morel, Vice-President Underwater Systems, Thales.

“In Japan, Thales is focused on building long-term sustainable partnerships with our key stakeholders. This extended partnership with MHI affirms our commitment to the country and to deepening bilateral ties between France and Japan. I am confident that our technologies and close collaboration can deliver unique and innovative solutions that will strengthen the capabilities of the Japanese Maritime Self-Defence Force as they build local expertise for the future,” Cyrille Dupont, President and CEO, Thales Japan.

New centres create cyber campus for autonomous vehicles and electricity infrastructure

Thales and the Welsh Government have announced the next stage of development to create a living laboratory campus for cyber trust at the former steelworks site in Ebbw Vale.

The development will add two new centres alongside the National Digital Exploitation Centre (NDEC) to create ResilientWorks, a campus including research laboratories and a test track and model street complex. Organisations from startups to major international companies and governments will use ResilientWorks to test and develop trust in operational technology and key infrastructure for growth sectors in the economy and critical public services.

The project is part of the Welsh Government’s wider plans to build a new tech cluster in Blaenau Gwent. The £7m initiative will be jointly funded by Thales and the Welsh Government’s Tech Valleys programme, with a research contribution from Cardiff University, to create:

Autonomous Trust Centre – a facility giving Wales a distinctive edge in the crucial resiliency of the cyber networks needed for autonomous vehicles to work safely and reliably, including a test track and model street complex;

Trydan Centre – a facility that explores cyber security in the generation, transmission, and storage of electricity.

The National Digital Exploitation Centre (NDEC), the anchor facility for ResilientWorks on the former steelworks site, is now two years into operation and is thriving despite the economic disruption of Coronavirus. An innovative partnership between Thales, Welsh Government, and the University of South Wales, NDEC has already won work for Wales from Innovate UK and the UK Government, and is working with companies from Europe and overseas, including GE Steam Power and TT Electronics, as well as Welsh companies such as Protecht and Awen Collective. The Centre has also become the key global operational technology cyber centre for Thales globally. NDEC has supported 5 PhDs, engaged with 75 schools, works with UK universities and local FE colleges, and has 85 local suppliers and over 90% of its staff from South Wales.

Gareth Williams, VP, Secure Communications and Information Systems (SIX), Thales, said:

When we partnered with Welsh Government and USW to create NDEC, we made a commitment that we would keep working to grow the importance of Ebbw Vale as a technology industry hub, with all of the benefits that could bring for future generations and the current Foundational Economy. Not many companies are making major multi-million-proud investments at the moment. But our view that this bold initiative will give the valleys a critical mass in cyber for critical infrastructure, benefiting the smaller companies of the South Wales cyber cluster, bringing in new work and investment from outside Wales, and giving Wales a distinct identity in the international technology markets.

Deputy Minister for Economy, Lee Waters said:

“Embracing digital innovation is vital if we are to succeed in a world where technology is advancing rapidly and playing a crucial role in the way we live our lives and how we work.

“Our commitment to ResillientWorks underpins this evolution and is part of our plan to build a new tech cluster in Ebbw Vale that will drive the economy of Blaenau Gwent and beyond, and give Wales a distinctive edge.

“I am delighted that the Welsh Government has been able to support this crucial project which, along with a Blaenau Gwent based pilot for 5G technology and innovative new business accommodation, will be key as we rebuild the local economy so that it is more prosperous, green and fairer than ever before.”

NDEC currently employs 13 people and includes an education programme, cyber range, and a range of support and services for technology businesses. The ResilientWorks expansion will, within three years, more than double the Thales presence on the Ebbw Vale site in South Wales."
Catching Ever-Stealthier Submarines: French Navy to get New Sonobuoy Technology - Naval News,"Thu, 18 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdmFsbmV3cy5jb20vbmF2YWwtbmV3cy8yMDIxLzAzL2NhdGNoaW5nLWV2ZXItc3RlYWx0aGllci1zdWJtYXJpbmVzLWZyZW5jaC1uYXZ5LXRvLWdldC1uZXctc29ub2J1b3ktdGVjaG5vbG9neS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Catching Ever-Stealthier Submarines: French Navy to get New Sonobuoy Technology France is moving forward with a new active-passive Sonobuoy system. The SonoFlash, developed by Thales, could be the game-changer that the French Navy (Marine Nationale) is looking for. It also brings sovereignty in the strategic field of anti-submarine warfare (ASW).

Thales won in January a DGA contract for the development, qualification and mass production of the new SonoFlash sonobuoy. This game changing active-passive sonobuoy is a strategic tool to complement the ASW systems currently deployed by the French Navy, providing France with a sovereign solution for high-performance acoustic buoys.

The threat posed by submarines is evolving rapidly. While 30 years ago only superpowers had true submarine capabilities, today many nations are deploying modern fleets and the old certainties of deep water are giving way to much more complex littoral settings for sonar systems. In response to this threat, Thales is developing the SonoFlash, a new generation sonobuoy leveraging decades of sonar and acoustic sensor expertise.

The SonoFlash will be fully produced in France and based on a subcontracting network involving several French SMEs such as Telerad, Selha and Realmeca. This follows the French authorities commitment to strategic industrial independence.

France stopped producing its own sonobuoys in the nineties because of a decreasing need for the product. The French Navy then started using American sonobuoys (Ultra and Sparton). A new need for French-made buoys surfaced again about fifteen years later. SonoFlash is the offspring of this new (sovereign) need.

Talking to Naval News during an exclusive phone interview, Alexis Morel, Vice President – General manager, Underwater Systems business line at Thales said:

“We looked at the market, not just in France but globally, and noted a real need for performance as well as a need for more competition. With just two main players on the market, there is very little competition. This is when Thales came up with the SonoFlash project. It brings back a sovereign production line in France, but at the same time it addresses the duopoly situation”.

SonoFlash will be available for export to France’s allies, for all current and future air platforms: WPAs, ASW helicopters and unmanned platforms (unmanned surface vessels, rotary wing UAVs and fixed wing UAVs).



SonoFlash is already being showcased at international defense tradeshows (Naval News saw the above full scale model during MADEX 2019 in South Korea).

Morel expects existing users of the popular FLASH dipping sonar (over 10 navies worldwide) will be natural prospects for the SonoFlash. Pricing is expected to be very competitive which is likely to make Thales’ sonobuoy the new market reference. The company plans to demonstrate the SonoFlash technology to the U.S. Navy, via Advanced Acoustic Concepts (AAC), its joint venture with DRS in charge of marketing proven Thales technologies on the U.S. market. Such demonstration is expect to take place around 2023. Another likely market for the SonoFlash is the Royal Australian Navy because of the Thales sonar center of excellence located there, “this is a great asset for the project […] Australia will be among the first potential customers with whom we will initiate talks, when they are ready. We consider Australia as a domestic market at Thales…”. However Morel insisted that for now the priority is the launch customer: The French Navy.

Regarding the global market need in sonobuoys, Morel explained that:

“We identified the need in the tens of thousands… our objective at Thales is to produce several thousands. Sizing our initial production line to deliver tens of thousands of buoys would make no sense for Thales. The investment would be disproportionate relative to our natural market which is the French Navy first, followed by NATO allies, existing users of the FLASH.”

SonoFlash: The first passive/active sonobuoy

The SonoFlash runs a low frequency between 3 and 4 kHz, providing the end user with great detection ranges. Thales image.

According to Thales, the SonoFlash’s innovative design and advanced technology incorporate several key features that deliver unmatched performance. Today’s buoys are either passive or active, but the SonoFlash combines the two modes in a single sonobuoy: an optimal, powerful low-frequency transmitter and a passive receiver with a high directivity gain. The combination of these two capabilities with high endurance makes the SonoFlash buoy very versatile.

The test campaign, including several at-sea tests from aircraft and helicopter, already took place over the past two years. The French Navy will be the first to be equipped with the SonoFlash, which will be deployed aboard the upgraded ATL2 maritime patrol aircraft (MPA) and the NH90 NFH maritime helicopter. The first prototypes will be delivered to the navy in 2022 for operational testing. The production line will be up and running in 2023. Pre-series production will start in 2024. Mass production as well as initial deliveries are set to start in 2025."

Following the signature of the MOU, the partners have formed team ICELUS led by Airbus that will bring together a trusted collective of MOD strategic partners who have a unique breadth of expertise of defence communications networks. ICELUS will offer pioneering change through a coherent systems integration approach to ultimately deliver operational effectiveness and information advantage to the end user, whilst sustaining a UK centric, defence industrial base. The three partners will be able to jointly explore how their respective unique expertise and solutions can be combined in order to put forward the best-possible proposals with regard to capabilities and competitiveness for this major programme.

ICELUS will focus on the upcoming LE TacCIS System Integrator (SI) opportunity to lead on the design and integration of the products & services for applications, infrastructures and networks. The LE TacCIS System Integrator is expected to be contracted by 2023/2024.

The LE TacCIS programme consists of multiple sub-programmes and projects with the aim to deliver the next generation of tactical military communications in the land environment, providing the means to make informed and timely decisions enabled by agile Communication Information Systems (CIS).

LE TacCIS is designed to be resilient, working securely in a congested and contested cyber battlespace. It will degrade gracefully and recover when attacked, continuing to provide essential Command and Control (C2) services and capabilities. It will integrate with other systems to allow the quick and easy sharing of information between platforms and weapon systems, delivering full-spectrum, multi-domain effects.

"From Thales, Three New Technologies - RailwayAge Magazine","Tue, 23 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJhaWx3YXlhZ2UuY29tL2NzL2Zyb20tdGhhbGVzLXRocmVlLW5ldy10ZWNobm9sb2dpZXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales has launched new CBTC (communications-based train control) and real-time passenger density systems, and partnered with Invision AI and Metrolinx to develop technology that allows trains to track potential obstacles.

Thales will showcase SelTrac™ G8, its eighth-generation CBTC system, and Distributed Intelligent Video Analytics (DIVA), which monitors passenger density in trains and on platforms, among other technologies, at its “first-ever digital event dedicated to rail transport, the Smart Mobility Experience,” to be held March 24.

Communications-Based Train Control

The SelTrac™ G8 from Thales helps rail operators “manage network growth, extensions, and fleet expansions as well as prepare for the future and control operations,” according to Thales. Its new digital architecture “is based on common hardware platforms and is designed to be upgraded easily,” allowing operators to “keep pace with rapidly evolving technology.” Additionally, SelTrac™ G8 offers health-monitoring “to extend the system life with no interruption to operations.”

“Since its introduction on the urban rail market, SelTrac™ has become a global benchmark,” said Alcino de Sousa, VP, Managing Director of Thales’ Urban Rail Signaling. “With this new generation of the SelTrac™ system, Thales is supporting the digital transformation of urban rail operators by delivering an innovative solution that includes the latest technologies and paves the way for the autonomous train operations of the next 30 years and beyond.”

Real-Time Passenger Density

The new DIVA system helps rail operators alleviate crowding by reducing dwell times. Based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) video analytics, DIVA leverages the existing CCTV network at stations and on-board trains to provide real-time information on passenger density, according to Thales, which tested DIVA last year in Singapore with SBS Transit. In addition, platform video displays can show riders which cars of an approaching train are full or not through red, yellow and green color-coding (pictured above). The video analytics can also be used to detect unattended luggage and trespassing, according to the manufacturer.

“This solution provides operators with tools to manage crowding on stations and trains and allows them to tackle the root causes of congestion,” said Benoît Couture, VP, Managing Director of Thales’ Integrated Communication and Supervision Systems.

Autonomous Rail Pilot

Thales, Invision AI and Metrolinx have teamed to develop “advanced autonomous technology” for rail through the WinterTech Development program, which is run by the Ontario government’s Autonomous Vehicle Innovation Network (AVIN). On the front of a GO Transit train, they have added multi-spectral sensing technology, including radar, cameras and lidar, along with a cyber-secured 4G/LTE-connected data collection and processing system. The aim: to use the collected data to “train the system to recognize obstacles and other dangers.” The system also provides real-time information, such as positioning, train telemetry and diagnostics, according to the partners. It has been tested for six months across multiple GO Transit lines in Toronto, and will continue for another six months in different weather and environmental conditions. The C$1.47 million project is supported by the partners, which have contributed a total of C$992,760, and AVIN, which provided C$483,600.

The partners explain that the benefits for rail operators are “enhanced safety, rapid installation time due to the minimal equipment footprint, enhanced ‘look ahead’ sensing to detect and track potential obstacles, and accurate real-time data collection crucial for maintenance and operations teams. For passengers, this will contribute to fewer delays, improved safety and enhanced reliability of the network.”

“Metrolinx is proud to support this initiative with Invision and Thales,” Metrolinx CEO Phil Verster said. “A focus on safety is central to delivering a world-class transit system, and innovative solutions like this one are an important part of this work.”

“In a competitive market, it is absolutely vital that industrials find ways to make [the] railway more attractive,” said Millar Crawford, Executive Vice President of Thales’ Ground Transportation Systems. “And this is where innovation helps. One of the biggest challenges today is that you can’t just close down a railway network while you upgrade [it]. People still need to go to work and to travel. That’s why we’re putting so much effort into the solutions that can be deployed whilst having minimal disruption.”"

Thales to lead European project on virtualised network programming technologies for future tactical deployments - EDR Magazine,"Thu, 11 Mar 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lZHJtYWdhemluZS5ldS90aGFsZXMtdG8tbGVhZC1ldXJvcGVhbi1wcm9qZWN0LW9uLXZpcnR1YWxpc2VkLW5ldHdvcmstcHJvZ3JhbW1pbmctdGVjaG5vbG9naWVzLWZvci1mdXR1cmUtdGFjdGljYWwtZGVwbG95bWVudHPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Paris, 11 March 2021 – Thales has been selected by the European Defence Agency to lead the large-scale Softanet (Ad Hoc B) project on network programming and orchestration technologies. Softanet will provide closer insights into the use of the latest virtualisation technologies for communication networks. It is a major step in preparing forces for developments in deployable and tactical networks and the adoption of programmable network technologies, software-defined networking (SDN) models and 5G.

Softanet is the first project at European level to focus on network programming and orchestration technologies for defence applications. It is a collaborative project by France, Germany, the Netherlands and Poland. Led by Thales, the project brings together major European defence players, including Airbus, Radmor and Rohde & Schwarz, as well as SMEs and research institutes, and aims to strengthen defence industry cooperation between European nations.

Softanet will assess the contribution of network programmability based on virtualisation technologies and quantify the operational benefits in terms of ease of deployment, network infrastructure responsiveness and efficient use of resources. Networks incorporating virtualisation technologies can be reconfigured more quickly as operations unfold, and the ability to deploy a programmable, dynamic, resilient and secure IT and network infrastructure is a necessary prerequisite for achieving information superiority in the theatre.

As project lead, Thales is providing an experimental infrastructure with programmable network technologies in configurations that reflect real-life operational contexts. The objective is to facilitate the deployment of communication systems into the theatre, particularly on coalition operations, by making them simpler and more intuitive to configure and reconfigure. The solution will also automate the operation of communication services, enabling them to adapt dynamically to new node locations, resource availability and operational communication needs.

The three-year project will be conducted in three stages. In the first six months, the project partners will define a deployable network architecture based on virtualised network technologies. The following 18 months will include technical studies of resilience, security and orchestration. The final year will be dedicated to the validation and testing of the system as part of a Coalition Warrior Interoperability Exercise (CWIX).

French Navy strengthens anti-submarine warfare capabilities with SonoFlash sonobuoy from Thales - Business Wire,"Thu, 18 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc3dpcmUuY29tL25ld3MvaG9tZS8yMDIxMDMxODAwNTQ4NC9lbi9GcmVuY2gtTmF2eS1zdHJlbmd0aGVucy1hbnRpLXN1Ym1hcmluZS13YXJmYXJlLWNhcGFiaWxpdGllcy13aXRoLVNvbm9GbGFzaC1zb25vYnVveS1mcm9tLVRoYWxlc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The French Navy has selected the SonoFlash new-generation sonobuoy from Thales. Unveiled at the Euronaval show in October 2018, SonoFlash will enable France to reach its strategic capability goal for acoustic sensors.

The threat posed by submarines is evolving rapidly. Three decades ago, only the superpowers had a true undersea warfare capability, but numerous countries now deploy modern submarine fleets. At the same time, forces increasingly operate in littoral waters, which are much more complex for sonar systems, rather than in the relative certainty of open-ocean environments.

Responding to this evolving threat environment, Thales developed the SonoFlash buoy, a new-generation sonobuoy with an unequalled performance-to-mass ratio that builds on decades of expertise in sonars and acoustic sensors to offer an ambitious new solution.

Its innovative design and advanced technology include a number of key features to deliver unrivalled performance. Today's sonobuoys are either passive or active. By contrast, the SonoFlash buoy offers the best of both modes, combining a powerful, optimised low-frequency transmitter with a high-directivity passive receiver. With the combination of these two capabilities, and the added advantage of long endurance, the SonoFlash buoy is suitable for a wide array of deployment scenarios.

Fully compatible with the other families of Thales sonars, the SonoFlash buoy offers high tactical flexibility and opens up promising new opportunities for multistatic operation. Coupled with the FLASH dipping sonar, for example, the SonoFlash buoy enables an aircraft to expand its coverage area and respond with greater agility to evasive manoeuvres by a submarine. Thanks to its digitised signal and optimal communication range, the SonoFlash buoy data can be readily exploited by any piloted or remotely piloted aircraft, naval vessel or shore centre equipped with a sonobuoy processing system.

The French Navy will be the first operational user of the SonoFlash buoy, which will be deployed by the modernised Atlantique 2 maritime patrol aircraft and NH90 Caiman tactical transport helicopters. It will be delivered to the Navy from 2025 and could be available in export markets to equip all modern maritime patrol aircraft and helicopters as well as all types of unmanned platforms, including autonomous surface vehicles and rotary-wing (VTOL) and fixed-wing UAVs equipped with a suitable multi-sonobuoy dispenser.

Manufactured in France with a network of SMEs such as TELERAD, SelhaGroup and Realmeca, the SonoFlash buoy relies on Thales’s expertise in acoustic sensor technology to contribute to France’s desire for independence in strategic industries.

“Thales has packed 10 years of innovation in hardware and digital technologies into a tube measuring 91.4 cm long and 12.3 cm in diameter. SonoFlash extends the range of a naval force's anti-submarine warfare operations, outclassing all other sonobuoys in the market today and offering a versatile and easy-to-deploy solution for tracking submarines from any piloted or remotely piloted aircraft, frigate or unmanned surface vehicle. We are grateful to the DGA and the Navy for the trust they have placed in us and delighted to be working with French partner SMEs to bring this project to a successful conclusion and restore France's sovereign capabilities in sonobuoys.” Alexis Morel, VP Underwater Systems, Thales.

Credit: Thales Group.

France-based aerospace company Thales has introduced its new Distributed Intelligent Video Analytics (DIVA) solution for facilitating crowd management at railway stations and on-board trains.

Besides minimising dwell times, the solution will monitor social distancing and help prevent crowding.

Thales’ solution requires no additional sensors as it utilises the existing CCTV network on stations and on-board trains for measuring passenger density via video analytics in real-time.

DIVA uses three-colour codes, namely red; yellow; and green, to indicate crowd density and guide passengers to avoid crowded places via platform displays.

Furthermore, video analytics can be utilised for detecting unattended luggage, onboard passengers at the end of the line and trespassing on platforms.

The Operations Control Centre (OCC) can also use heat maps of stations and trains for overseeing passenger movements across the complete system.

Thales integrated communication and supervision systems vice president and managing director Benoît Couture said: “Rail operators are facing new challenges about passengers’ safety. Passengers need to be able to move freely on stations and platforms, to embark and disembark from trains safely and quickly.

“These are fundamental requirements for the smooth running of a railway network. Crowding makes all of this more difficult. I’m very pleased to present our new video analytics solution for passenger density monitoring and guidance. This solution provides operators with tools to manage crowding on stations and trains and allows them to tackle the root causes of congestion.”

As a pilot, the new solution has been deployed in Singapore with SBS Transit last year."

LinkedIn

Could you briefly describe your job?

The HR Partner plays an active role in implementing corporate strategy from a “human capital” perspective. Our function embodies a commitment to supporting the company’s business at both individual and team levels through tailored, innovative HR policies. Working closely with the rest of the department, HR Partners initiate and manage transformation projects aimed at improving organizational effectiveness and strengthening employee engagement.

What part of your job are you most proud of?

We seek to meet all local HR needs on a day-to-day basis by calling on the expertise of our colleagues specializing in selection and recruitment, training, professional development, payroll administration, extra-legal benefits, insurance, and so on. Our role is to keep the system running smoothly. And everything we do is designed to balance the company’s needs and employee fulfillment.

I’m a strong believer in people being responsible for their own success. The way I see it, we all need to take ownership of the changes we wish to see in our lives. When I can help someone expand their horizons, develop their skills, become more self-reliant and get greater job satisfaction, that’s when I know my work is meaningful and I can be proud of what I do. And it’s all the more important given the challenges ahead. We’ve kicked off our New Space digital transformation initiative and we’re involved in several prestigious programs like Copernicus, Space Inspire and ExoMars. We’re especially proud to have recently delivered the last components for Ariane 5, drawing on more than 40 years of expertise on European launchers. We’re now moving on to the next stage in this adventure with the development of new products for Ariane 6.

Does any event in your career to date stand out?

In my previous job, I was in charge of international recruitment. This entailed engaging with people from all backgrounds and dealing directly with decision-makers at every level of the organization. It also helped me obtain a “helicopter view” of corporate strategy and core values, and more generally the company’s specific way of working.

Today, I’m building on that experience here at Thales Alenia Space in Belgium. Our focus at the moment is creating a harmonious, agile and stimulating workplace that enables everyone to grow in their job. The goal is to foster enthusiasm for learning, innovating and working together for both our company’s success and that of our customers. This is part of our Space for Life corporate purpose and it’s what inspires me most!

In a few words, what are the qualities required in your profession?

You need to be flexible, enjoy working closely with people, be a positive thinker and care about others. As the HR interface with managers, teams and individual employees, we must ensure everyone is treated equally. Workplace wellbeing is another top priority, as well as ensuring that HR processes are consistent and in keeping with business goals. Regarding legal matters, we have to take account of specific local legal requirements and cultures to ensure everything is aligned. I see us as the “custodian” of legislation and procedures! We must constantly bear in mind that going even slightly off course could have dramatic consequences both for employees and the company as a whole: reliability and integrity are essential qualities of a good HR Partner.

Thales selectedto help secure French borders - Regional Gateway,"Mon, 22 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlZ2lvbmFsZ2F0ZXdheS5uZXQvdGhhbGVzLXNlbGVjdGVkLXRvLXByZXBhcmUtZnJhbmNlLWZvci1uZXctZW50cnktZXhpdC1zeXN0ZW0v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In an effort to secure borders in France ahead of the new Schengen Area Entry/ Exit System,which will come into effect from February 2022 to register non-European citizens crossing an EU external border, the French Government has selected Thales to install several hundred biometric entry and exit registration systems at various border crossings including airports situated throughout the country.

“This new European entry and exit system represents a major challenge for Member States,” said the French Ministry of the Interior. “On the one hand, they are required to be ready and compliant with the regulations by 2022; on the other hand, they are faced with the operational reality and the fact that millions of people have to be processed each year, for whom we want to offer the smoothest possible experience,” stated the French Ministry of the Interior.”

In line with the directive approved by the European Union, those countries that are part of the Schengen Area will be required to deploy pre-registration kiosks or similar equipment in order to allow non-schengen visitors to register their identity quickly and securely, including their biometric data (fingerprint and facial biometrics).

“Thales’ expertise in identity and border management provides us with technological reliability, without having to make a choice between security and ease of use,” added the French Ministry of the Interior.

The Thales Gemalto Border Kiosks will incorporate various document verification and biometric technologies, offering rapid registration for travellers, as well as highly accurate identity verification, data management protection and advanced operational fluidity at border crossings.

“The pre-registration kiosks are equipped with our state-of-the-art technologies for identity creation and verification,” explained Youzec Kurp – SVP Identity and Biometric Solutions at Thales. “They are based on software optimised for ultra-rapid checks of a document’s authenticity and intelligent detection of any attempted identity fraud. We have therefore been able to develop high-performance tools to support operations, without compromising the safety and protection of travellers’ data.”"
Q&A: London Underground's connection refresh with Thales - Railway Technology,"Thu, 25 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJhaWx3YXktdGVjaG5vbG9neS5jb20vZmVhdHVyZXMvcWEtbG9uZG9uLXVuZGVyZ3JvdW5kcy1jb25uZWN0aW9uLXJlZnJlc2gtd2l0aC10aGFsZXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales has recently completed a major renovation on core elements of London Underground’s radio communications system, Connect. Credit: David Mark.

Communication across the 250 miles of London Underground’s track is essential to those working in the rail sector to ensure safety and lack of disruption for passengers, and to run safety protocols.

Every train driver, every train and every station within London Underground is connected by the communications network, Connect, to always enable communication between employees. If this connection is broken or facing issues, trains are unable to leave platforms on time, stations close and the safety of passengers and staff is at risk.

Thales has recently completed an upgrade of the Connect system, which sees the system running the most up-to-date technology available to the industry.

Thales staff have been working on replacing this technology for the past two years, removing the old legacy equipment and installing the new technology. The upgrade took place while London Underground continued to operate which presented challenges for the team. Thales programme director Peter Gaylor explained these challenges and how the system works.

Frankie Youd (FY): Why was the refresh of London Underground’s communications network needed?

Peter Gaylor (PG): Thales started the relationship with Transport for London on this project back in 1999, and that was always going to be a 20-year period for us to design, build and operate the network with the London Underground. You can imagine what’s gone on in computing and technology in general over the last 20 years; for some of this kit to have been around in those locations, it’s coming to the end of its life.

London Underground are quite keen to make sure that what they’re installing now has a lifespan that’s taking them into the foreseeable future. When the contract was awarded to us in 2019, we agreed that as part of that contract we’d upgrade the network. It’s [now] upgraded to the latest terrestrial trunked radio (TETRA) technologies.

The technology that we’re talking about now, the basic technology hasn’t changed, it’s still TETRA and what was installed is the latest hardware or software to support that. So, for our customers, it’s less about the bells and whistles that you see with the 4G and 5G.

This technology is available and reliable, it works when you need it the most. That’s what’s really key to our supply, so it’s not the most glamorous technology in the world, but you know if you press the button to talk to somebody is going to work, we guarantee.

FY: How often is this technology scheduled to be replaced?

PG: The technology has a roadmap in terms of hardware; this is it really for the next 10 years, we won’t be changing any hardware. There will be continued reviews as we get with all technology and software, it’s continually being reviewed.

We’re continually introducing new features, new functionality, [and] they tend to come out once or twice a year. So those will be going on in the background overnight for the next 10 years or so, that’s just the business how we manage on a day-to-day basis.

FY: How does Connect work within London Underground?

PG: Connect is the umbrella term for the contract that we have. Connect isn’t just about the radio technology, it’s about the transmission network that we have for London Underground, the video network that we have in place and the radio technology.

The most visible element of Connect is when you go to an underground station and the station staff have a radio on their jackets, that is Connect is the most visible form. The station staff are using Connect every single day every single shift. Stations will not open if Connect is not working because stations can’t communicate between their staff to trains.

The next step is the train communications, the ability for station staff to potentially talk to drivers, the drivers to be able to talk to dispatchers so that if a station is closed for an hour for example because of a fire alarm or person on the track then the communication between the dispatcher, train, the operators, and the station staff can all take place.

FY: What challenges presented themselves during the installation?

PG: There’s been many, many challenges, it’s taken us two and a half years to get to the position where we are today. We haven’t had the luxury of switching off the old network. If you were doing this for any other business, you would switch off the old network and rip it out, you’ll clean everything up, put the new kit in, you’ll commission it and then you’d hand it over.

We’ve had to integrate the two networks at the same time so that means physically installing new infrastructure. Stations aren’t the easiest thing to install the racks and cabinets, and there’s not many goods lifts in these locations. So, transporting and installing a lot of this kit has really been a challenge.

Then you throw in the pandemic as well and try to limit the amount of time that we have people working in the same locations, having to wear masks, all the testing. There’s been a lot of challenges just from physically installing the technology, parallel running it, commissioning it, and the people element as well.

FY: Thales has been awarded a contract to continue upgrades until 2023, what will this involve?

PG: We’ve just finished the core radio element and that’s the servers behind the network, the brains of the network. We’re currently upgrading the dispatchers, so that was also awarded at the same time. So, all the dispatcher locations around the network are being upgraded at the moment with the latest technology.

We’ve just commenced the upgrading of the base stations, so that’s the radio infrastructure. We’ve got 300 of those that we will be upgrading between now and 2023, that’s the next thing we will be celebrating.

FY: Is there anything else you would like our readers to know?

PG: I would ask readers to do their research around Thales. Thales is a global organisation that is very, very widespread and has an impact on everybody’s lives in ways that people probably don’t really appreciate.

Thales has a huge presence, and I would advise people to do their own investigations, Thales reaches and innovates in a number of spaces that people probably aren’t even aware of."
Thales unveils Diva passenger congestion monitoring system - International Railway Journal,"Sun, 28 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJhaWxqb3VybmFsLmNvbS90ZWNobm9sb2d5L3RoYWxlcy11bnZlaWxzLWRpdmEtcGFzc2VuZ2VyLWNvbmdlc3Rpb24tbW9uaXRvcmluZy1zeXN0ZW0v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"THALES has unveiled a new Distributed Intelligent Video Analytics (Diva) system to monitor passenger density and support social distancing in stations and onboard trains.

Thales says the solution helps to alleviate crowding by reducing dwell times. Diva uses existing CCTV cameras on platforms and trains combined with video analytics to measure crowd density in real- time.

Platform displays can then be used to guide passengers to less crowded coaches on approaching trains, with red, yellow and green colour coding used to indicate density.

Video analytics can also be employed for other uses, including detecting unattended luggage and trespassers, as well as alerting controllers if passengers are still onboard when the train reaches the terminus of the line.

The system was implemented as a pilot with SBS Transit in Singapore in 2020.

“Rail operators are facing new challenges about passengers’ safety,” says Mr Benoît Couture, vice-president, managing director, Thales’s Integrated Communication and Supervision Systems. “Passengers need to be able to move freely on stations and platforms, to embark and disembark from trains safely and quickly. Crowding makes all of this more difficult. This solution provides operators with tools to manage crowding on stations and trains and allows them to tackle the root causes of congestion.”"

Thales UK has started 2021 with an emphatic win for our Belfast team. After twelve years of successful partnering between Thales and the British Army on the ADAPT programme the UK MoD have announced the contract award for Part B of the Future Air Defence Availability Project (Future ADAPT), worth nearly £100 million.

Alex Cresswell, CEO and Chairman of Thales UK said:

“This is fantastic news for both Thales in the UK and, in particular, our Belfast site. We are extremely proud of our strong relationship with both the British Army and the Royal Marines.

“This contract demonstrates the real value created by this type of support model between UK armed forces and industry; we look forward to continuing our long-standing partnership with the MoD, helping deliver good value for the tax payer and retaining this key capability.”

The contract will provide availability and support to the UK’s STARStreak and the new Lightweight Multi-role Missile Short Range Air Defence (SHORAD) Ground Based Air Defence (GBAD) systems, as well as support to live firing training activities at the Royal Artillery Range out to 2026.

Future ADAPT Part B will allow the British Army and Royal Marines to continue to deploy an enhanced SHORAD capability, at readiness, with absolute confidence in their equipment support and performance.

John Cunningham, Head Weapons, Evaluation and Capability Assurance (WECA) said:

“We are delighted with the award of this innovative £98.4M contract between the UK MOD and Thales. It guarantees the British Army and Royal Marines can remain at high readiness to respond to crises around the world, enabled by working directly alongside Defence Industry partners maintaining the availability of these world-leading Short Range Air Defence (SHORAD) capabilities. Such a significant investment reinforces our confidence in these systems and demonstrates MOD support to Thales’ ongoing export initiatives.”

Meeting peacetime training needs and the ability to transition rapidly to deployed operations, ADAPT balances pragmatism and innovation to evolve the SHORAD capability to meet Defence’s changing needs. The contract will ensure that both the existing and new SHORAD capability variants continue to achieve the highest levels of availability and industry-delivered support, both in barracks and during training on the firing range.

The Thales STARStreak SHORAD system entered service with the British Army and Royal Marines in 1997 and has three platform variants; Self-Propelled on the Stormer Vehicle (SP), Lightweight Multiple Launcher (LML) and Shoulder-Launched (SL).

The Thales ADAPT SHORAD capability supports the UK Military’s 7th Air Defence Group and its capability users, 12th Regiment Royal Artillery, 106th Regiment Royal Artillery and the Air Defence Troop, Royal Marines. Thales has a permanent presence alongside 12th Regiment at their home in Thorney Island which has allowed the Thales ADAPT team, working in close partnership with Defence colleagues, to deliver a widely acclaimed high quality service; ensuring that all SHORAD capability variants receive the equipment care and support they require to meet demanding User requirements for both training and operations.

Throughout the life of the contract, as a result of multiple efficiencies and innovative approaches, the MoD has saved circa £170M and the programme has supported Thales in Belfast to become a centre of excellence for air defence solutions. Future ADAPT Part B will secure more than 100 jobs over the next six years across Thales UK and the wider supplier chain - with half of those jobs in Belfast."

Presently, Fuerteventura Airport (FUE) is undergoing installation and will have as many as 36 ABC gates.

The automatic controls offer security and suitability, improving the process of biometric identity checks inside the police databases.

While being in complete control of the operations, the officers can also proceed with additional security controls if required.

Inetum Iberia and Latam deputy general manager Juan Carlos Crespo said: “This technology eases passenger management at borders by verifying the traveller’s identity and travel documents, including biometric checks. The new system ultimately speeds up the identification process.”

Thales Spain director and CEO Jesús Sánchez Bargos said: “We are proud to support the work of the National Police and AENA by creating a safe and agile airport environment without compromising the traveller experience.”

Last week, Thales launched a digital secondary surveillance radar (SSR) named RSM NG for use in air traffic management (ATM).

The radar can track up to 2,000 flights and disseminate 64 simultaneous data outputs to different air traffic control centres (ATCC).

RSM NG is equipped with a two-in-one meta-sensor and combines automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) and radar (Mode S) data to provide ‘quicker’ detection and tracking initialisation."

William Murray

A Thales submarine engineer from Glasgow has just retired after an impressive 52 year career that has remarkably mirrored the Royal Navy’s longest running continuous operation.

In April 1969, the navy began Operation Relentless, which has meant a UK ballistic missile submarine has patrolled every single day for the past 50 years – providing the nation’s deterrent and helping keep the UK safe.

The same month and year, a 16-year-old Willie Murray joined Barr & Stroud (later to become Thales) to start a four year apprenticeship.

Fifty-two years on, his amazing career can boast that he has worked on every periscope for every boat and class that have served under the Op Relentless banner, including the introduction of some technology world firsts.

Thales has been the sole provider of submarine periscope and optronic mast capabilities to the Royal Navy since 1917. What is often not told under that fact is the contribution of the Glasgow employees and their close working relationship with the Submarine Service.

Willie said: “Looking back, I’ve been very lucky to work with such interesting people, both here in Thales and in the Royal Navy.

I left school at 15 and I always knew I wanted to build something. So I started a pre-apprentice course and was then given a list of names that were taking people on. Barr & Stroud jumped out at me as an iconic name for engineering in Glasgow.

“A big motivating factor was that the four-year apprenticeship offered a route to a job where I would be known as a Scientific Instrument Maker!

“So I joined in April 1969 and in those days Barr & Stroud was based at Anniesland. It was a huge facility, with its own foundry, facilities for polishing lenses and all sorts of works and I ended up in periscopes which really suited me. I later moved to the current Thales site at Linthouse in 1992.

“It was definitely a badge of pride to say you worked for Barr & Stroud. My first boss, Duncan Scott, was a really good influence. He knew how to handle people and more importantly, taught you how to conduct yourself.

Trafalgar Class Telescope

“It’s worth remembering that this period was still very much the Cold War. There was a lot of secrecy, a lot of codes used for the periscopes. There was a tremendous amount of individual and collective pride among employees. Every periscope was hand-made and it took between a year and 18 months to produce one.

“Everyone sees the iconic attack periscopes breaking the surface in the movies, but we’ve delivered so many world firsts here, including the world’s first thermal imaging sensor and the world’s first laser rangefinder periscope.

“I’ve been very lucky and been on a number of boats and met a lot of submariners, including the Trafalgar, Vanguard, Upholder, Swiftsure and Astute Classes. They’ve always been a great bunch, very impressed with our technology and there’s a lot of mutual respect.”

Both Willie and fellow employee Derek McCaffery were awarded Submarine Oscars in 2019 for their industry service to the navy’s submariners and Willie’s achievement was also mentioned in the Scottish Government.

Willie added: “It’s always been about the relationship with the customer – both with the Royal Navy and our many exports.

“I suppose the game-changer was our introduction of the first optronic mast in the late 1990s – it was non-hull penetrating and images could be fed into the control room.

“It was always in the back of our minds – life and limb depended on you and your workmates. You couldn’t afford any mistakes in the manufacturing – water ingress through the hull was just an unthinkable option for the crew.

“I suppose it’s fitting in a way that my career is coming to end just as Thales has been given the contract to supply the new combat system mast for the next generation Dreadnought class submarine.

“I’ve been training a group of employees in my current role in quality inspection so I am hoping they will be working on the Dreadnought in the years to come.

“It’s been a huge honour to play a part in the Glasgow story.”

Thales and Inetum provide joint expertise to deliver greater security and convenience at the airports of Valencia and Bilbao, and before long at Fuerteventura. Smart accesses improve the border control process with a higher agility and security. New system facilitates operations for the officers of the National Police.

Thales, leader in digital security, and Inetum, European leader in digital services and solutions, provide the airports of Valencia and Bilbao with more than 45 Automatic Border Control gates (ABC Gates) leveraging facial recognition and automatic document verification. Thales is responsible for the identity verification and smart access control, while Inetum implements manual verifiers and the real-time monitoring system. Both companies collaborated on the integration and installation in the airports.

These new smart access points have already been in operation since July at Valencia and Bilbao Airports, in which passengeres have already been able to verify greater agility. The system is key for National Police officers since it simplifies their operations. Fuerteventura airport is also currently in the deployment phase and will have 36 ABC Gates.

Automatic controls improve performance by providing agility, security and convenience when performing biometric identity checks inside the police databases. The officers remain in full control of operations and can proceed with extra security controls if necessary.

""This technology eases passenger management at borders by verifying the traveler’s identity and travel documents, including biometric checks. The new system ultimately speeds up the identification process"" explains Juan Carlos Crespo, Inetum's Deputy General Manager for Iberia & Latam areas.

“We are proud to support the work of the National Police and AENA, by creating a safe and agile airport environment, without compromising the traveler experience”, says Jesús Sánchez Bargos, Country Director and CEO of Thales Spain.

Thales has strong international experience in smart border management at airports. Our references span 20 countries including France and Switzerland. The company is also responsible for comprehensive border control systems, including airports, ports and border crossings for multiple countries.

The development from Thales will take place alongside AERALIS’ contract with the RAF’s Rapid Capabilities Office to deliver research & development of an Advanced Modular Aircraft system.

AERALIS is redefining the possibilities for light military jet aircraft across various roles in the defence market including training, aggressor and light combat, focusing on a UK-based development and production programme of an agile, modular, and commercially driven aircraft system aimed at increasing capability whilst significantly reducing through-life costs for customers. As they move to develop and certify a broad range of future aircraft systems to support the Royal Air Force’s ambition to rationalise its future fleet, they will be working in parallel with Thales in the UK to ensure that the training systems required to teach pilots to fly AERALIS will be ready in conjunction with the modular aircraft system.

AERALIS plans for its aircraft system to be offered as part of innovative training solutions to customers across all aspects of both flying and operational training, and next-generation synthetic training devices and simulators will be a vital part of this process. With a well-established Training and Simulation division that designs and operates synthetic flight training simulators, such as those used at the RAF’s Voyager and Atlas training facilities at RAF Brize Norton, Thales in the UK will bring to bear many of its latest training solutions to complement the AERALIS system to ensure ground-breaking solutions for customers.

“Thales has been a long-term supporter of the AERALIS ambition to deliver innovative and cost-effective solutions for our armed forces. We are therefore delighted to enter this further Teaming Agreement to realise our joint aspirations, which further support the Royal Air Force goals for thier Project ASTRA journey towards a Next Generation Air Force” quoted Darryn (Daz) Rawlins OBE, Managing Director of Thales Training & Simulation, UK Domain.

With both parties working with the RAF’s Rapid Capabilities Office, Thales world-class Synthetic Training Equipment and aircrew training systems will complement AERALIS’ development of its all-British modular aircraft system. Support for AERALIS from both the RAF and Thales in the UK demonstrates the great confidence placed in British innovation and ingenuity for a project which has the potential to reinvigorate British aircraft manufacturing using the wealth of infrastructure and expertise that already exists in the UK.

Thales has secured a contract from the French defence procurement agency (DGA) to develop the SonoFlash air-droppable sonobuoy.

The contract will also see the company qualify and produce the system.

SonoFlash was unveiled at the Euronaval show in October 2018. It will enable the French Navy to boost its anti-submarine warfare operations.

The new-generation sonobuoy features an optimised low-frequency transmitter with a high-directivity passive receiver and comes with an advantage of ‘long endurance’.

It is claimed to have an ‘unequalled performance-to-mass ratio’ and suitable for a wide range of deployment scenarios.

The system is manufactured in France with a network of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), including TELERAD, SelhaGroup and Realmeca.

Thales Underwater Systems vice-president Alexis Morel said: “Thales has packed ten years of innovation in hardware and digital technologies into a tube measuring 91.4cm long and 12.3cm in diameter.

“SonoFlash extends the range of a naval force’s anti-submarine warfare operations, outclassing all other sonobuoys in the market today and offering a versatile and easy-to-deploy solution for tracking submarines from any piloted or remotely piloted aircraft, frigate or unmanned surface vehicle.

“We are grateful to the DGA and the navy for the trust they have placed in us and delighted to be working with French partner SMEs to bring this project to a successful conclusion and restore France’s sovereign capabilities in sonobuoys.”

SonoFlash buoy will be deployed on the French Navy’s Atlantique 2 maritime patrol aircraft and NH90 Caiman tactical transport helicopters.

The installation will make French Navy the first operational user of the buoy."
Thales to provide Sonoflash sonobuoy for the French Navy - Naval Post,"Fri, 19 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vbmF2YWxwb3N0LmNvbS90aGFsZXMtdG8tcHJvdmlkZS1zb25vZmxhc2gtc29ub2J1b3ktZm9yLXRoZS1mcmVuY2gtbmF2eS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The French Navy has selected the SonoFlash new-generation sonobuoy from Thales. Unveiled at the Euronaval show in October 2018, SonoFlash will enable France to reach its strategic capability goal for acoustic sensors, Thales announced with a press release.

The threat posed by submarines is evolving rapidly. Three decades ago, only the superpowers had a true undersea warfare capability, but numerous countries now deploy modern submarine fleets. At the same time, forces increasingly operate in littoral waters, which are much more complex for sonar systems, rather than in the relative certainty of open-ocean environments.

Responding to this evolving threat environment, Thales developed the SonoFlash buoy, a new-generation sonobuoy with an unequaled performance-to-mass ratio that builds on decades of expertise in sonars and acoustic sensors to offer an ambitious new solution.

Its innovative design and advanced technology include several key features to deliver unrivaled performance. Today’s sonobuoys are either passive or active. By contrast, the SonoFlash buoy offers the best of both modes, combining a robust, optimized low-frequency transmitter with a high-directivity passive receiver. With the combination of these two capabilities and the added advantage of long endurance, the SonoFlash buoy is suitable for a wide array of deployment scenarios.

Sonoflash:

Fully compatible with the other families of Thales sonars, the SonoFlash buoy offers high tactical flexibility and opens up promising new opportunities for multi-static operation. Coupled with the FLASH dipping sonar, the SonoFlash buoy enables an aircraft to expand its coverage area and respond with greater agility to evasive maneuvers by a submarine. Thanks to its digitized signal and optimal communication range, the SonoFlash buoy data can be readily exploited by any piloted or remotely piloted aircraft, naval vessel, or shore center equipped with a sonobuoy processing system.

The French Navy will be the first operational user of the SonoFlash buoy, which will be deployed by the modernized Atlantique 2 maritime patrol aircraft and NH90 Caiman tactical transport helicopters. It will be delivered to the Navy from 2025. It could be available in export markets to equip all modern maritime patrol aircraft and helicopters and all types of unmanned platforms, including autonomous surface vehicles and rotary-wing (VTOL) and fixed-wing UAVs equipped with a suitable multi-sonobuoy dispenser.

“Thales has packed ten years of innovation in hardware and digital technologies into a tube measuring 91.4 cm long and 12.3 cm in diameter. SonoFlash extends the range of a naval force’s anti-submarine warfare operations, outclassing all other sonobuoys in the market today and offering a versatile and easy-to-deploy solution for tracking submarines from any piloted or remotely piloted aircraft, frigate, or unmanned surface vehicle. We are grateful to the DGA and the Navy for the trust they have placed in us and delighted to be working with French partner SMEs to bring this project to a successful conclusion and restore France’s sovereign capabilities in sonobuoys.” said Alexis Morel, VP Underwater Systems, Thales.

Manufactured in France with a network of SMEs such as TELERAD, SelhaGroup, and Realmeca, the SonoFlash buoy relies on Thales’s acoustic sensor technology expertise to contribute to France’s desire for independence in strategic industries."
SelTrac™ G8: Next-Generation CBTC - RailwayAge Magazine,"Wed, 24 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJhaWx3YXlhZ2UuY29tL25ld3Mvc2VsdHJhYy1nOC1uZXh0LWdlbmVyYXRpb24tY2J0Yy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Currently deployed around the world on some five-dozen rail transit lines, Thales’ Urban Rail Signaling solution SelTrac™ CBTC (Communications-Based Train Control) technology is now in its eighth generation.

Thales SelTrac™ G8 is the latest iteration of a technology which has evolved from a wayside/central-office-based inductive loop platform to an onboard (vehicle)-centric RF (radio frequency) platform offering a level of flexibility and configuration options.

“CBTC has been a global rail signalling solution for decades,” says SelTrac™ Senior Product Line Manager Rob Vandervecht. “There has been an evolution of the different technologies, or building blocks, within our system, over time. Basically, what we’re seeing is a lot more need for evolution. There’s a faster rate of technology change, and the needs that are driving that change are accelerating.”

Among those needs is what Thales calls “obsolescence management.” There are two forms: “technical obsolescence” and “functional obsolescence.”

A component, product or service is described as being technically obsolescent when it is superseded by something that may not be backwards-compatible. With CBTC, it is primarily computer hardware and software, and communications. For example, obsolescence of a microprocessor has the potential to render its LLRU (Lowest Level Replaceable Unit), typically a board, obsolete. Unless a board with the same FFF (Form, Fit and Function) can be sourced, the entire subsystem is at risk of obsolescence.

Functional obsolescence occurs when a CBTC system cannot be adapted to meet evolving needs. For example, with CBTC systems that are currently “attended automated” (GoA2 and GoA3), operators may want an option to upgrade to fully automated unattended driverless operation (GoA4). They may want to upgrade train-to-wayside communications from inductive loop to RF: 802.11 or LTE (Long-Term Evolution). Enabling this requires a forward-compatible overall system architecture capable of supporting progressive upgrades.

This is exactly what SelTrac™ G8 has been designed to do. “Its foundation is what we’re calling our new digital architecture,” says Vandervecht. “Thales based it on common hardware platforms with the ability to abstract different layers of software. Simplistically, what that means is we can deploy proven hardware in a number of different configurations and upgrade it by software at a later time. As a base example, you could install the hardware today, configure it as a standalone interlocking, and at a future point, upgrade it to a CBTC Zone Controller, using the same hardware. Scalability, or flexibility, is a key feature. Evolution is going to be important as technology changes. With systems like CBTC that have lifespans of 20 or 30 years, operators will want the ability to add the latest technologies that provide new features and functionalities. You don’t want to obsolete a whole system because one element of it has gone obsolete. This is key for our customers, as far as reducing life cycle costs. It’s the base-level theme for next-generation G8. Put another way, it’s a number of different applications of the same hardware platform and architecture in which the application software changes for new deployments.”

Radio-Agnostic

“The key thing we’re looking at for SelTrac™ G8 are brownfield systems,” Vandervecht notes. “Everyone’s focus is to reduce costs, and something we’ve always been focusing on is reducing the amount of equipment on the track bed or wayside. “We’ve already done that by removing the need for a secondary form of vehicle detection. In this new architecture, we’ve implemented a new wayside object controller for devices like turnouts, emergency stop buttons and platform screen doors. The package is small, and very configurable and deployable. We can create the right amount of hardware to be deployed in different wayside situations. There’s a lot of flexibility.”

Another important feature of SelTrac™ G8 is its “radio-agnostic” approach. “Radio technology has taken off in the past few years, and we’re well past that point of a one-size-fits-all radio solution for a CBTC system,” says Vandervecht. “We’ve adopted different radio technologies in the past, and what we’re doing here is modularizing the radio communication aspect of our solution—something we’re calling a modular communications gateway. That gives us a great deal of flexibility supporting LTE, public or private, and a number of unlicensed-spectrum radios. We can evolve to 5G if we want, and we can even combine the radio technologies for a geographic system expansion, for example, LTE in the outer environs and unlicensed high-speed radios in the core of the network. We can now choose the radio technology that best fits the application, again to lower costs and reduce deployment time.”

For example, on a given line, there may be a combination of terrain that creates radio propagation variability—above-ground tangent track where line-of-sight communications aren’t an issue. Tunnels. Curves going through deep cuts. SelTrac™ G8’s radio-agnostic feature enables it to be fitted with what works best in a particular environment. “In a tunnel environment where you’re not going to get propagation from a public LTE radio network, you’re going to be installing your own infrastructure,” Vandervecht points out. “You can now choose the 2.4 GHz unlicensed band, or 5.9 GHz, the licensed frequency band that has been allocated by the European Commission for urban rail. It remains to be seen how popular this kind of mixed technology is going to be, but it’s definitely a possibility, especially for operators who may have an existing radio technology and want to expand with a different type. We’re seeing a lot more interest in private LTE networks.”

Cybersecurity

The vast amounts of data communications required for everything from train control to customer information systems means that cybersecurity is a growing concern for operators. “Cybersecurity aspects must be designed into a system from the beginning,” Vandervecht says. “Obviously, when you’re adopting different wireless technologies, you still have to consider the cybersecurity implications of, say, a public LTE cloud or a private implementation. That’s one of the communications gateway features of SelTrac™ G8. For wayside architecture, as we’re starting to deploy a more object controllers or remote I/Os, we have to consider communications cybersecurity aspects. As we start to get away from dedicated fiber-optic lines between locations, embracing new technologies like software-defined networking and different methods of connecting everything, we must rely on ‘zero-trust security’ approaches. This will always be a big focus, because you need it with an advanced, upgradable digital architecture like this.”

Beyond Train Control

While the basic function of CBTC is safety-critical train control, there are many other functions that can be incorporated, everything from passenger information systems to onboard vehicle health monitoring and diagnostics, in real time. For a transit system, it’s all based upon providing reliable service—trains show up when they’re supposed to and get customers to their destinations safely and on time. As such, Data management has become critical.

“A big part of SelTrac™ G8 architecture are the underlying protocols and software and data services that tie everything together,” explains Vandervecht. “These have been enhanced not only for cybersecurity but for a lot of diagnostics and data management services that will allow us to monitor and troubleshoot and perform predictive maintenance. They enable so many other important underlying functions. CBTC data is, naturally, our top priority. We make sure it has a quality of service and a latency so that there are no safety implications. Then, we have different levels of service or different types of data streams that will support data diagnostics, troubleshooting or passenger information. When it’s architected properly, you have a lot of flexibility and functions.”

Next-Generation Positioning System

Another key aspect of SelTrac™ G8 is its compatibility with Thales’ NGPS (Next-Generation Positioning System), an autonomous train position system that underwent a proof-of-concept with MTA New York City Transit. Instead of conventional odometers and tags, NGPS uses inertial navigation, radar and radio ranging sensors or GPS. These features are combined with a 3D reference map to determine precise train position. In the future, LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) and high-definition video cameras will provide additional data to enable capabilities such as obstacle detection.

“Cost-effective and easy to deploy, autonomous positioning is more reliable than conventional systems,” Vandervecht says. “It’s a level of technology that’s going to provide a lot of benefits and functionality for our CBTC system. It’s going to allow us to deploy faster, lower costs and improve performance. By architecting it properly and setting it up, SelTrac™G8 is ready to receive NGPS. It’s autonomy-ready, and we designed the product to be able to take advantage of those benefits.”

For brownfield CBTC systems, installation, testing and life cycle costs are critical considerations. “As you’re migrating to CBTC, you don’t have a lot of track access, and that will drive your deployment schedule,” Vandervecht points out. “NGPS is based upon sensors that are no longer mounted underneath a vehicle, so that makes it easier to implement and install. However, we’re also trying to get to the point where the benefits as realized by an onboard autonomy or positioning system are recognized a lot sooner. You don’t have to wait until a detailed wayside implementation is installed before you start seeing its benefits of it. If you move more of technology onboard, as trains are deployed, you start seeing some of the benefits immediately. NYCT is a driving force for the NGPS platform, and for the adoption of UWB, which we demonstrated in early 2020.”

Post-Pandemic Considerations

“We’re living through interesting times now with COVID-19 and probably not fully realizing the impact that it has on urban transportation systems,” Vandervecht says. “One of the most important benefits of SelTrac™ G8 architecture and its flexibility is that it can adapt a lot quicker to a fast-changing environment. If new communications technology or anything else comes along, it helps us, as a company be much more flexible. Some operators believe that making the jump to CBTC is a big step, but the evolutionary nature of our architecture means it’s less of a Big Bang approach. We believe that aspect of our system demonstrates the benefits of taking the first steps. That’s a good thing.”"

The trials of the SYNAPS software-defined radios (SDR) and Line-of-Sight solutions showed full compatibility and new capabilities brought to the command and control and communications systems deployed and in use, such as BMS (Battlefield Management System) and PR4G radios, or will be in the near future by the Army.

These trials took place as part of the Spanish Army’s Force 2035 Experimentation Plan, giving simultaneous support to multimedia services in video, voice and other data. They were conducted under the leadership, coordination and supervision of the Spanish Army’s Information and Telecommunications Systems Technical Assistance (JCISAT), and with the attendance as observers of personnel from the Army’s Academy of Engineers (ACING), the National Cryptologic Centre (CCN) and the Directorate-General for Weaponry and Material (DGAM).

To conduct this, Thales’ Spanish teams used various communications solutions and systems to meet the present and future needs of command capability. The technology presented during the experimentation encompassed different military radio communications solutions: SDR (Software Defined Radio) SYNAPS dual-channel/dual-band radio (VHF/UHF) and the TN4110 unit, offering Line-of-sight capability and demonstrating our capability to operate in wide bandwidth on the move.

The trials demonstrated the capabilities of SYNAPS radios with the current VHF GEOMUX waveform deployed on the PR4G, as well as with the ESSOR European-Secured SOftware Radio HDR WF (High Data Rate Waveform), a UHF waveform brought by the ESSOR Programme to which Spain participates, now funded by 6 European countries. The trials confirmed the high data capacity of ESSOR HDR WF and its full adaptability to Spanish operational requirements, while bringing full interoperability with the six European countries that have developed it. The ESSOR waveform will be soon further financed by the ESSOR Countries and European Defense Funds for the upcoming phase of the Programme, with new capacities at reach.

Interoperability with PR4G radios deployed in the Army has also been demonstrated, as the new voice group capabilities that produce significant savings in both numbers of radios in vehicles and in frequencies. The SYNAPS radios offer far more efficient management of the electromagnetic spectrum, allowing high densification of the networks, and optimal capacity/attainment ratio with very robust ECCM (Electronic counter-countermeasures) measures."

Thales has unveiled a new high-fidelity cab mock-up, marking a key milestone for the company in an ongoing project to retrofit three first-in-class (FiC) Class 43 power-cars.

The solution is set to modernise the on-board systems of the Class 43 power-cars, which are owned by Porterbrook, and is an important step in Network Rail’s plans to introduce European Train Control System (ETCS) technology across Britain’s rail network.

Train operators and owners had the chance to experience the latest on-board train control system by Thales for themselves. The mock-up cab, located at Thales’ Birmingham site, gives drivers from train operating companies (TOCs) hands-on experience of how the system will look and feel, providing the opportunity for valuable user feedback to be fed into the Thales project team.

“We’ve received extremely positive feedback from the customers so far,” said Thales‘ Senior Project Manager, Lokesh Anand. “Our stakeholders are able to experience the final solution and they are happy that we have taken on board their comments and feedback from the previous stage and that we are actively listening to them. We have a state-of-the-art product, with proven, user-friendly technology, and our solution provides the end user with continuous speed supervision and real-time information about the state of the railway ahead.”

The positive response from end-users enables Thales to take a big step forward towards closing out the final design phase and proceeding towards commencing the fitting of the system to Porterbrook’s Class 43 power-cars, which are operated by a number of Britain’s TOCs, as well as Network Rail. Installation of the systems is due to be completed and ready for integration testing during summer 2021.

ETCS is the signalling and train control component of the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS), which is being adopted throughout Europe and beyond. Thales’ ETCS-compliant system makes use of standard trackside equipment and wireless controlling equipment in the train to receive line-side information, removing the reliance on the driver to watch track-side signals.

The ETCS technology lets TOCs operate more trains on the same line safely. The implementation will aim to increase railways operators’ operational performance through enhanced capacity and speed and improved track utilisation.

In Germany, Thales has developed the on-board systems combining established ETCS technology with additional technological features, including enhanced automation, cyber-security and engineering assurance. In the UK, Thales is responsible for integrating the equipment into the Class 43 rolling stock with project partners Ricardo Rail, with installation by Thales’ project partner, Yellow Rail."
ESA astronauts Alexander Gerst and Luca Parmitano use their avatars to check out future habitation accommodation ... - Thales,"Thu, 11 Mar 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGFsZXNncm91cC5jb20vZW4vd29ybGR3aWRlL3NwYWNlL25ld3MvZXNhLWFzdHJvbmF1dHMtYWxleGFuZGVyLWdlcnN0LWFuZC1sdWNhLXBhcm1pdGFuby11c2UtdGhlaXItYXZhdGFycy1jaGVjay1vdXTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In preparation of the upcoming Preliminary Design Review (PDR) for the International Habitat (IHAB) module for the Lunar Gateway space station, Thales Alenia Space teamed up with the European Space Agency’s European Astronaut Center (EAC) last week to virtually review the IHAB’s functional volumes and related crew accommodations. All teams involved in this virtual session, including astronauts, are preparing for life around Moon orbit by focusing on habitability requirements to enable the crew to sleep, eat, manage stowage and conduct science experiments.

ESA astronauts Alexander Gerst and Luca Parmitano are working in real time from the European Astronaut Center in Cologne with Thales Alenia Space engineers in the Virtual Reality Lab in Turin. Using digital twin avatars, they experience the same immersive environment representing the interior of the International Habitat, as if they were physically present on the Lunar Gateway in orbit around the Moon.

The IHAB program is counting on this advanced digital technology to move forward by allowing teams to collaborate at a distance while complying with stringent health measures.

The crew’s involvement at the outset of the module design process allows engineers to capitalize on the astronauts’ unrivaled experience aboard the International Space Station. This feedback will guide upcoming design phases, to support a user-centered design approach.

This was made possible by a new application developed by Thales Alenia Space, dubbed GATEWAY4U, which provides a collaborative virtual environment that lets engineers and astronauts experience the Habitat’s environment during the design phase, with an accurate depiction of the module’s architecture, layout and functions.

The GATEWAY4U application has undergone constant improvement since being developed. In July 2019, EAC worked with astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti in Cologne and Thales Alenia Space’s teams in Turin and Cannes to conduct a collaborative session that reviewed preliminary IHAB and ESPRIT designs, as always based on a combination of virtual reality (VR) and user experience (UX).

ESA and Thales Alenia Space will continue to combine their VR and UX technologies to develop new products and services that will support the next step of IHAB (and ESPRIT) development. Looking ahead, these tools will also be evolved in the intent to help train crews in the tasks to be carried out once they’re in orbit.

At the end of the session, Marcella Salussolia, Program Manager for IHAB in Thales Alenia Space, commented: “We have always believed in the potential of the application of “Virtual Reality and UX” in manned missions. The session held with ESA and our industrial partner Liquifier Space Systems, has given us a positive return. It has been of great interest to witness the astronauts and Thales Alenia Space’s engineers combined operations inside IHAB digital environment. While Astronauts explored the module guided by our team, questions and suggestions popped up in a natural way, resulting in valuable feed-backs, extremely useful for us in the evolutions of its design. The words of appreciation from Alexander Gerst and Luca Parmitano at the end of the session made the entire team very proud, as it’s our primary scope to encounter and match astronauts needs. In the upcoming future, our goal is to use the Gateway4U tool as a base for concurrent engineering sessions with Agencies and partners involved in the International Habitat and in the overall Gateway projects, to sustain the mission design and development phase and for crew training support”.

As they continue this cross-border collaboration, you might even say, “so far, yet so near”!

About IHAB

I-HAB (International - Habitat), a pressurized module that will provide crew living quarters, resources utilization for pressurized and unpressurized scientific experiments plus docking ports to supply interfaces and resources to vehicles in transit. Drawing on Thales Alenia Space’s long-standing expertise in the development of pressurized modules for the ISS, along with new technologies and processes, I-HAB will mark the transition from the ISS to a new generation of space infrastructures for deep space exploration. It will meet evolving requirements and performances for lighter structures and optimized micrometeorites protection system, evolved docking systems and hatches, enhanced functional and avionic architectures, more efficient thermal control system with deployable radiators to ensure full autonomous capability of heat rejection, innovative conditioning systems. The I-HAB will experience for the first time long exposure in the deep space environment, offering the opportunity to test and prove potential design solutions for protection against cosmic radiations. Being unmanned for most of its time on orbit, it will also require dedicated solutions for the robotic operations, either on board and externally. One of the key evolving step with respect to the ISS will be focused on designing, with the support of virtual reality technique, more comfortable internal accommodations, with exploitation of modular and reconfigurable solutions to optimize room and comfort for the crew. The module will be provided by Europe with contributions from the other space Agencies like environmental and life support system from JAXA, avionics and software parts from NASA and robotic components from CSA; the integration of all these elements in I-HAB will leverage on the large experience already acquired by Thales Alenia Space during the ISS Nodes 2 and 3 activities already developed in cooperation. I-HAB is slated for launch in 2026.Thales Alenia Space in Italy is program prime contractor, with responsibility for overall program management, product assurance and safety, system engineering, functional design, all components concerning human factors, thermal and mechanical systems, the primary structure and production of hatches, and the assembly, integration and testing (AIT) phase. Thales Alenia Space in France is in charge of software and avionics subsystems.

About Artemis

Moving forward to the Moon in 2024! The Artemis program will proceed in three phases: Artemis 1, a non-crewed flight to test the launch system and the Orion spacecraft together; Artemis 2, a first crewed flight of Orion; and Artemis 3, to land astronauts on the Moon as from 2024. The program will set up sustainable structures on the Moon and in lunar orbit to carry out further human exploration of the surface and various scientific investigations. The Gateway will be a key to this program: it will be used as an outpost for astronauts on their way to the Moon, and as a laboratory to carry out scientific research, and thus support the development of sustained Moon exploration by the end of the decade. As from 2024, astronauts will have two options: lift off from the Earth and land directly on the Moon; or dock their Orion space capsule to the station, then rocket down to the Moon."

Congratulations to our SME construction contractor DEMEX who recently won “Best New Entrant” at the World Demolition Awards.

DEMEX was recently engaged by Thales’ Australian Munitions Business to demolish 43 redundant buildings at the Commonwealth owned Mulwala facility for major capital works – the Demolition and Decontamination Tranche 1 project.

The ‘Best New Entrant’ award recognises the safe demolition by DEMEX of high- risk buildings at Mulwala which is one of Australia’s largest and most complex Major Hazard Facilities.

DEMEX were able to complete the demolition on time in spite of limitations imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Over 8,800 tons of concrete and brick, and 1,360 tons of steel recovered during the project was recycled, and 990 tons of asbestos waste was disposed of at an approved landfill using EPA-

licensed trucks adhering to waste tracking requirements.

High-reach excavators were fitted with water suppression sprays by DEMEX to enable targeted wetting of areas immediately prior to demolition. To ensure efficient utilization of truck capacity, a custom-fabricated blade attachment was created by DEMEX and used to process the numerous steel tanks.

Safety is #1 priority and DEMEX were able to ensure the Mulwala facility kept operating safety during this very complex demolition and decontamination process.

DEMEX, located in Jacobs Well, QLD, employs approximately 85 Australians and supports subcontracted work to over 40 other Australian construction SMEs annually.

Congratulations DEMEX – this is a great achievement by a great Australian SME."

The technologies will be tested on the train for six months in different weather and environmental conditions including extreme weather.

The front of the train is equipped with radar, lidar and cameras, as well as a cyber-secured 4G/LTE-connected data collection and processing system. These systems collect data which can then be used to train the system to recognise obstacles and other dangers.

The prototype is equipped to provide real-time information and data, such as next-generation positioning, train telemetry, and diagnostics information.

The system was developed by the partners over six months through a $C 1.48m ($US 1.17m) project, as part of the Ontario provincial government’s Autonomous Vehicle Innovation Network (Avin) initiative.

The project is primarily being funded through a $C 992,760 contribution from the partners. The remaining cost is being covered through a $C 483,600 contribution from the Avin WinterTech Development programme, which supports small and medium-sized enterprises and their partners to commercialise winter-ready mobility solutions.

The system is designed to offer enhanced situational awareness for train operation, with the goal of ultimately building a commercial platform capable of deployment in urban, regional and mainline rail networks worldwide. The technology is expected to offer operators greater safety, reliability and efficiency, quick installations and accurate real-time data collection for maintenance and operations teams.

“For operators, the benefits of this new solution include enhanced safety, rapid installation time due to the minimal equipment footprint, enhanced ‘look ahead’ sensing to detect and track potential obstacles, and accurate real-time data collection crucial for maintenance and operations teams,” say the partners. “For passengers, this will contribute to fewer delays, improved safety and enhanced reliability of the network.”

“This project demonstrates the strengths of Ontario’s Autonomous Vehicle Innovation Network, bringing together ambitious technology start-ups and industry leaders to pioneer next-generation mobility technologies with global potential,” says Mr Vic Fedeli, Ontario’s minister of economic development, job creation and trade. “This unique partnership between Invision AI, Thales and Metrolinx offers enhanced safety and efficiency for rail systems around the world, particularly those operating in harsh winter climates. It’s an endeavour we’re very proud to support.”"

~

Press Release, Madrid, 10 March 2021: Thales has successfully conducted different trials, which have demonstrated the integration capability of its radio communication solutions with the Army’s command and control systems for use cases of a command network, both at brigade and lower echelons levels. The trials of the SYNAPS software-defined radios (SDR) and Line-of-Sight solutions showed full compatibility and new capabilities brought to the command and control and communications systems deployed and in use, such as BMS (Battlefield Management System) and PR4G radios, or will be in the near future by the Army.

These trials took place as part of the Spanish Army’s FORCE 2035 [FUERZA 2035] Experimentation Plan, giving simultaneous support to multimedia services in video, voice and other data. They were conducted under the leadership, coordination and supervision of the Spanish Army’s Information and Telecommunications Systems Technical Assistance (JCISAT), and with the attendance as observers of personnel from the Army’s Academy of Engineers (ACING), the National Cryptologic Centre (CCN) and the Directorate-General for Weaponry and Material (DGAM).

To conduct this, Thales’ Spanish teams used various communications solutions and systems to meet the present and future needs of command capability. The technology presented during the experimentation encompassed different military radio communications solutions: SDR (Software Defined Radio) SYNAPS dual-channel/dual-band radio (VHF/UHF) and the TN4110 unit, offering Line-of-sight capability and demonstrating our capability to operate in wide bandwidth on the move.

The trials demonstrated the capabilities of SYNAPS radios with the current VHF GEOMUX waveform deployed on the PR4G, as well as with the ESSOR European-Secured SOftware Radio HDR WF (High Data Rate Waveform), a UHF waveform brought by the ESSOR Programme to which Spain participates, now funded by 6 European countries. The trials confirmed the high data capacity of ESSOR HDR WF and its full adaptability to Spanish operational requirements, while bringing the full interoperability with the 6 European countries that have developed it. The ESSOR waveform will be soon further financed by the ESSOR Countries and European Defense Funds for the upcoming phase of the Programme, with new capacities at reach.

Interoperability with PR4G radios deployed in the Army has also been demonstrated, as the new voice group capabilities that produce significant savings in both numbers of radios in vehicles and in frequencies. The SYNAPS radios offer a far more efficient management of the electromagnetic spectrum, allowing high densification of the networks, and optimal capacity/attainment ratio with very robust ECCM (Electronic counter-countermeasures) measures."
Edmonton’s Metro Line LRT no longer running on Thales signalling system - Global News,"Mon, 01 Mar 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vZ2xvYmFsbmV3cy5jYS9uZXdzLzc2NzA1NzcvZWRtb250b24tbWV0cm8tbHJ0LWFsc3RvbS1zaWduYWxsaW5nLXN5c3RlbS_SAVNodHRwczovL2dsb2JhbG5ld3MuY2EvbmV3cy83NjcwNTc3L2VkbW9udG9uLW1ldHJvLWxydC1hbHN0b20tc2lnbmFsbGluZy1zeXN0ZW0vYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Send this page to someone via email

The City of Edmonton says the Metro Line LRT is no longer running on the Thales signalling system.

The city spent four days testing the Metro Line’s alternative signalling system last week, which included a complete closure of the LRT system over the weekend.

In a statement Monday, the city said testing and commissioning work over the weekend was successful. The Metro Line started operating on the new Alstom signalling system first thing Monday morning.

“The Metro Line is now officially operating on the new Alstom signalling system. The city is no longer using the Thales system,” communications advisor Katie Stewart said in an email Monday afternoon.

Bruce Ferguson, branch manager of LRT expansion and renewal with the City of Edmonton, said Tuesday the new system is ready to go and is safe.

“We have a fully functioning signalling system on the Metro Line and it really gives us the ability to provide the level of service that we want to provide.”

“It’s a very positive step, it’s been a long time coming,” Ward 2 councillor Bev Esslinger said.

“We’re looking to have an efficient, safe, reliable system from now into the future.” Tweet This Click to share quote on Twitter: ""We're looking to have an efficient, safe, reliable system from now into the future.""

Ferguson said the final testing over the weekend was a culmination of testing that had been performed throughout the process of bringing the new system online.

“The Alstom system is a combination of software and hardware — or equipment that’s installed along the trackway,” he explained.

Ferguson said the hardware was tested in the factory, then again when it was installed in Edmonton. The software develops parallel to that, he explained.

“Then the system is put together and tested and there’s a whole series of what’s called integration tests that are done when you’re pulling the system together. There has been testing all along,” he explained.

“There’s been some trials, typically at night in off-peak hours so people don’t really notice them. And then we’ve also been running the Alstom system in parallel to the Thales system for probably the last month or two and that’s just to identify issues that may come up and then what we do is on the last weekend, there’s a series of integration tests — it’s actually a huge series of checklists and tests that they’ve been going through over the weekend.”

Ferguson said stressing of the system was performed over the weekend, as well as a final set of tests.

Breaking news from Canada and around the world sent to your email, as it happens.

“They load up the system and then they create scenarios and they see how the system responds to that, they work through all of their checklists and then at the end, Alstom has to certify that the system is safe,” he said.

“As the signal provider and as the corporation that we’ve hired to do this, they need to certify to us on behalf of their company that the system is safe, it’s stable and it can be put into revenue service. Once they do that, then we also work with our installation people in Edmonton Transit and our consultants do the same sort of thing.

“When both of those come together, which it did very late Sunday night, then we made the decision to go live on Monday morning.”

The Metro Line experienced several issues after opening to riders in September 2015, including crossing arms coming down on green lights and trains heading in opposite directions on the same set of tracks.

“Edmontonians have, for five years, put up with long delays and system failures and gates that are coming up and down without trains being there. I think they’ve been incredibly patient and we thank everyone for that,” Ferguson said.

In November 2019, the city announced a brand new signalling system would be installed on the Metro Line.

The announcement of the new system came after years of issues and back-and-forth with the original signalling contractor Thales, which ultimately ended in the city terminating its contract with Thales Canada in April 2019.

The city is in the process of trying to recoup costs from Thales. The signalling contract with Thales is worth $55 million. The city had already paid $33 million and said in 2018 it will withhold the remaining $22 million after deadlines were not met.

“Unfortunately, I am not in a position to comment more on that. But we are going through that process with the expectation that we’re going to recover our costs.”

Esslinger said the city learned lessons about project procurement from the experience with Thales, but also admits the city has to regain people’s trust in the LRT.

“Hopefully we’re at a point where we’re building that back and this is a step in that direction.” Tweet This Click to share quote on Twitter: ""Hopefully we're at a point where we're building that back and this is a step in that direction.""

The city hired French company Alstom to install the new signalling system. The company planned to use a fixed-block system, which has been used on the Capital Line since it opened.

The city said this type of system controls trains based on sections of track called “blocks.” Each block is protected by signals that prevent a train from entering an occupied block.

Ferguson said the city is very pleased with the way the system is performing so far, but added more tweaks will be made in the coming weeks.

“The system is operating, it’s stable. We’re still going to be doing some tweaks to it over the next few weeks, especially when it comes to messaging and things like that — some of the digital messaging — you can’t really test that until you’ve got trains running with passengers.”

Work will also get underway to make operational improvements, such as intersection performance. Ferguson said one example is improving wait times at the intersection of Princess Elizabeth and 111 Avenue.

“Even when we first opened the Thales system, I think some of the wait times were around five minutes. We did tweak it to the extent that we could over the last few years — it was down to about one to two minutes — and we’re hoping that we can make improvements on that as well,” he said.

“From a driver’s perspective, less time waiting with gates down and waiting for the LRT to cross. Tweet This Click to share quote on Twitter: ""From a driver's perspective, less time waiting with gates down and waiting for the LRT to cross.

“From a passenger’s perspective, what this will allow us to do is also ultimately get back to our original plan, which is trains every five minutes on Capital Line, with trains every 15 minutes on the Metro Line. And that portion of the track where they overlap, which is every two and a half minutes, we’re going to be able to get to that as well.”

The posting shows an image of a blue-covered UK passport, with the following description: “Made by a Franco-Dutch company in Poland using Italian software to print Spanish ink on to Finnish paper in a tender that beat the company in Durham which is now facing bankruptcy.”

Contract tender

In March 2017, the UK Government put out to tender a contract to print UK passports, under existing UK law, EU law, and World Trade Organisation rules at the time. The contract was awarded to Franco-Dutch firm, Gemalto.

In 2019, Gemalto became part of the multi-national Thales Group and is now part of the DIS section of the company.

During 2020/21, UK passport production transitioned away from De La Rue who made UK passports at its Gateshead factory and did not win the new contract.

UK passport manufacture

We contacted Thales to learn more about where UK passports will be produced. Thales replied that all such queries are being handled by the UK Home Office.

A Home Office spokesperson replied:

“All British passports will continue to be personalised with the holder’s personal details and photograph in the United Kingdom, so that no personal data will leave the UK.

“HM Passport Office works with all of its suppliers to ensure that services are delivered in line with its robust contractual demands and strict governance regime. There are multiple sites for both manufacture and personalisation of passports to ensure an uninterrupted service to meet the expectations of our approximately seven million customers each year.”

Neither Thales nor the Home Office confirmed the exact country in which the new blank passports are manufactured.

The fate of De La Rue

The claim said that De La Rue (“the company in Durham”) was “facing bankruptcy” as a consequence of losing its bid for the passport contract.

Reports of 170 skilled printing job losses (June 2019) were followed by another 80 (June 2020) when passport production ceased at its factory in Gateshead. In January 2021, De La Rue announced it had won a 65% share of the total volume of polymer substrate material used in £5, £10, and £50 notes, in the three years from July 2021. It had a sevenfold increase in first-half adjusted operating profits for 2020.

Summary

The UK Government put the contract for the manufacture of UK passports out to tender under existing laws at the time. The contract was awarded to a Franco-Dutch firm that is now part of the Thales Group, based in France.

Aspects of the physical manufacture of the UK passports were not confirmed to FactCheckNI, but the UK Home Office stated that the passports will be personalised in the UK.

The previous producer, De La Rue, closed most of its factory in Gateshead, by December 2020, but in the new year it won a majority share of a contract to supply polymer for UK current notes and has reported that it is operating profitably."
Master-A Multi-Function Control Radar (MFCR) - Global Security,"Fri, 26 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb2JhbHNlY3VyaXR5Lm9yZy93bWQvd29ybGQvaW5kaWEvbWFzdGVyLWEuaHRt0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Master-A Multi-Function Control Radar (MFCR)

The THALES Raytheon-supplied S-band Master-A Multi-Function Control Radar (MFCR) was developed as part of the Indian ABM program in cooperation with Thales of France. The MFCR is an AESA radar and complements the Swordfish L-band radar Long Range Tracking Radar (LRTR) for intercepting ballistic missiles. The MFCR will also serve as the FCR for the AAD second tier missile system of the ABM program. The MFCRs will also act as the nodes of an Air Defence Ground Environment system.

The indigenous Advanced Air Defence (AAD) interceptor missile was fired from Wheeler Island off the coast near Dhamra in Bhadrak district on 23 November 2012. The interceptor was fired a few minutes after the target missile was fired from the Integrated Test Range at Chandipur-on-sea in Balasore district, about 70 km from Wheeler Island. The interceptor missile successfully destroyed the target missile at an altitude of 15 km. The interception took place at 12.52 pm.

Long range radar and multifunction fire control radar located far away could detect the missile from take-off and track it through its entire path. The total trajectory of the incoming missile was continuously estimated by the guidance computer and subsequently the AAD missile was launched at an appropriate time to counter and kill the ballistic missile.

Once in range, the Master-A MFCRcapable of detecting airborne targets with a RCS of 0.3 square metres at 350km rangewould take over. The command line-of-sight guidance computation will take another 15 seconds, following which the exo-atmospheric interceptor missile will be fired. The missiles on-board strap-down inertial navigation system (SDINS)  comprising a ring laser gyro-based inertial navigation sensor  provide mid-course correction updates for trajectory shaping until the on-board terminal guidance sensor finally takes over.

ThalesRaytheon Systems (TRS) is number 1 worldwide in the area of battlefield radar and leader, with 70% of the world market, in ""weapon locating radar"" whose range, altitude coverage and accuracy are in continuous improvement. Major powers are preparing to cope with the global military capabilities that will be prevalent in the coming years: the likely spread of ballistic missiles and sophisticated air breathing weapons such as high- maneuvering aircraft, UAVs or cruise missiles. Conventional Air Command & Control Systems fit with conventional threat. With its unique features, MASTER-A is specifically designed to enhance existing systems and make them effective against all these emerging threats.

Master A is operating in S-Band 3D, multi-function long-range radar. It is suitable for unmanned operation either autonomously or in a network. Master-A uses a phased array antenna, that electronically scan in both azimuth and elevation while either rotating in azimuth, or scanning in a sector. The radar is designed to provide surveillance and tracking against advanced airborne threats and ballistic missiles. The whole system can be easily deployed by C-130 sized aircraft using three 20-foot ISO containers at 10 t trucks and one 20-foot ISO platform at a 20 t trailer. The assembly or disassembly takes place with a crew of 8 people within 90 minutes.

The threat posed by submarines is evolving rapidly. Three decades ago, only the superpowers had a true undersea warfare capability, but numerous countries now deploy modern submarine fleets. At the same time, forces increasingly operate in littoral waters, which are much more complex for sonar systems, rather than in the relative certainty of open-ocean environments.

Responding to this evolving threat environment, Thales developed the SonoFlash buoy, a new-generation sonobuoy with an unequalled performance-to-mass ratio that builds on decades of expertise in sonars and acoustic sensors to offer an ambitious new solution.

Its innovative design and advanced technology include a number of key features to deliver unrivalled performance. Today's sonobuoys are either passive or active. By contrast, the SonoFlash buoyoffersthe best of both modes, combining a powerful, optimised low-frequency transmitter with a high-directivity passive receiver. With the combination of these two capabilities, and the added advantage of long endurance, the SonoFlash buoy is suitable for a wide array of deployment scenarios.

Fully compatible with the other families of Thales sonars, the SonoFlash buoyoffers high tactical flexibility and opens up promising new opportunities for multistatic operation. Coupled with the FLASH dipping sonar, for example, the SonoFlash buoyenables an aircraft to expand its coverage area and respond with greater agility to evasive manoeuvres by a submarine. Thanks to its digitised signal and optimal communication range, the SonoFlash buoydata can be readily exploited by any piloted or remotely piloted aircraft, naval vessel or shore centre equipped with a sonobuoy processing system.

The French Navy will be the first operational user of the SonoFlash buoy, which will be deployed by the modernised Atlantique 2 maritime patrol aircraft and NH90 Caiman tactical transport helicopters. It will be delivered to the Navy from 2025 and could be available in export markets to equip all modern maritime patrol aircraft and helicopters as well as all types of unmanned platforms, including autonomous surface vehicles and rotary-wing (VTOL) and fixed-wing UAVs equipped with a suitable multi-sonobuoy dispenser.

Manufactured in France with a network of SMEs such as TELERAD, SelhaGroup and Realmeca, the SonoFlash buoy relies on Thales’s expertise in acoustic sensor technology to contribute to France’s desire for independence in strategic industries.

“Thales has packed 10 years of innovation in hardware and digital technologies into a tube measuring 91.4 cm long and 12.3 cm in diameter. SonoFlash extends the range of a naval force's anti-submarine warfare operations, outclassing all other sonobuoys in the market today and offering a versatile and easy-to-deploy solution for tracking submarines from any piloted or remotely piloted aircraft, frigate or unmanned surface vehicle. We are grateful to the DGA and the Navy for the trust they have placed in us and delighted to be working with French partner SMEs to bring this project to a successful conclusion and restore France's sovereign capabilities in sonobuoys.” Alexis Morel, VP Underwater Systems, Thales.

Thales launches eighth generation SelTrac digital signalling solution for metro rail - Urban Transport News,"Thu, 25 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vdXJiYW50cmFuc3BvcnRuZXdzLmNvbS9pbnRlcnZpZXcvdGhhbGVzLWxhdW5jaGVzLWVpZ2h0aC1nZW5lcmF0aW9uLXNlbHRyYWMtZGlnaXRhbC1zaWduYWxsaW5nLXNvbHV0aW9uLWZvci1tZXRyby1yYWls0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"French multinational firm Thales Transport has unveiled its eighth generation SelTrac CBTC system, which includes a set of advanced features to allow operators to manage network growth, extensions, and fleet expansions as well as quickly respond to and manage disruption on metro networks.

On the occasion of launching the SelTrac G8 digital signalling solution, Alcino De Sousa, Vice-president Urban Rail Signalling at Thales Transport said the latest generation of our world-leading driverless train control solution opens up new possibilities for metro operators.

First of all, what is SelTrac™?

Thales’ SelTrac™ is a digital signalling solution that helps metro operators to run more trains on their networks. The technology behind this is called Communications Based Train Control, or CBTC. SelTrac is natively driverless, but it can still be used with an attendant or driver.

What’s new in SelTrac™ G8?

There are three important new features in SelTrac™ G8. The first is a new digital architecture. This is based on common hardware platforms and is designed to be upgraded easily, including our new object controller or Remote IO to reduce the amount of wayside equipment required. Secondly, we have our suite of enhanced services, to support operators to achieve maximum availability. Thirdly, and last but not least, SelTrac™G8 is autonomy ready.

How will customers benefit?

The beauty of SelTrac™ G8 is that it is permanently upgradeable. New functions can be added easily just by upgrading the software. We call this innovation insertion. SelTrac™ G8 also features advanced diagnostic and health monitoring tools, easing maintenance and boosting reliability. In addition to this, our customers benefit from a significant reduction in wayside equipment, so installation and maintenance costs are lower.

What about the Zone Controller?

Our upgraded Zone Controller provides a number of different deployment and redundancy options. It is based upon the same proven hardware platform that may also be deployed as a standalone interlocking or as a sub-system in a legacy SelTrac system, depending on the installed software.

Can I take advantage of new communications, like LTE and 5G?

Yes. SelTrac™ G8 can support almost any type of radio communications, including LTE. Thanks to our new onboard communications gateway, you can switch between multiple radio technologies, so your train always stays connected. This new modular communication approach also supports a clear migration path to 5G.

What does “autonomy ready” mean?

We’ve developed a brand new autonomous positioning system in parallel with SelTrac™ G8. This uses inertial navigation, radar and radio ranging – the same technology stack that will be used in the fully-autonomous operation. It’s remarkably easy to deploy. In fact, the onboard equipment can be installed in a few days. We have already piloted this on the New York City Subway.

How is cybersecurity managed?

Like all our solutions, SelTrac™ G8 is Cybersecured by Design. Innovation insertion makes security upgrades easier than ever. As we start to take advantage of new communications technologies, such as 5G, the focus on cybersecurity will become even more important.

Who can benefit from SelTrac™ G8?

We’ve designed SelTrac™ G8 to meet the needs of all our customers. It can be used on urban rail, metro, light rail and people movers. And it can be deployed in both brownfield (resignaling lines) and greenfield (newlines) projects. Finally, customers with earlier versions of SelTrac™ can also benefit, because the G8 platform can be provided as an upgrade to their existing SelTrac™ systems."

The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) has granted a dual Flight Simulator Level B/Flight Training Device Level 3 qualification for one of the Australian Defence Force’s Thales Reality H EC-135 flight simulators.

The qualification enables the NSW Police EC-135 pilots to use the simulator to ensure its fleet remains operational, given current restrictions on overseas training amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

============== ==============

The qualification was granted following collaboration between the NSW Police, ADF, CASA, Thales Australia and Boeing Defence Australia.

NSW Police’s Aviation Commander, Superintendent Matt Appleton, said the simulation training was vital for the force’s pilots.

“Despite the current pandemic, state and federal law enforcement agencies are working together to ensure that our officers receive the necessary training and qualifications, we’re very grateful that we can utilise this simulation training so we can continue to provide excellent service to the people of NSW,” Superintendent Appleton said.

Thales Australia’s director of training and simulation, Michael Otero, added, “This collaboration has seen that together the ADF, law enforcement agencies and emergency rescue services deliver and enhance their aviation training needs.”

This marks the first time a rotary wing flight simulator has achieved dual military and civilian qualifications in Australia.

The 723SQN simulator, located at HMAS Albatross, was assessed in 2020 in the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.

US DoD visit Mulwala and Benalla - CONTACT magazine,"Tue, 02 Mar 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbnRhY3RhaXJsYW5kYW5kc2VhLmNvbS8yMDIxLzAzLzAyL3VzLWRvZC12aXNpdC1tdWx3YWxhLWFuZC1iZW5hbGxhL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Representatives from the United States Department of Defense last week visited the Australian-owned munitions production factories in Mulwala, NSW, and Benalla, Victoria.

Head Land Systems Major General Andrew Bottrell said senior Defence representatives from the Australian Army and the Capability Acquisition and Sustainment Group hosted representatives from the US Embassy’s Office of Defense Co-operation at the two government-owned munitions factories over two days.

“This visit builds on the outcomes we agreed at the Australia-United States Ministerial (AUSMIN) consultations last year, to pursue options to encourage bilateral defence trade and to advance initiatives that diversify and harness our industry cooperation,” Major General Bottrell said.

“The sites at Mulwala and Benalla have been supplying the ADF and our partners with munitions for decades, and Defence is committed to expanding their capability and that of the broader Australian industrial base to strengthen our supply chain resilience for explosive ordnance and guided weapons.”

Director General Explosive Materiel Brigadier Haydn Kohl said during the visit the US Embassy team was able to see the trial filling of a number of 155mm US artillery projectiles with high explosive manufactured at Mulwala.

“The United States government is assisting with the transfer of this technology to Australia and once testing is complete, these rounds will be fully US certified and available for supply to US Indo-Pacific Command units as needed,” Brigadier Kohl said.

“In addition to showing our US colleagues the world-class work being undertaken by just some of the 650 workers employed at these Defence-owned munitions factories, the visit was also an opportunity for us to discuss future steps to deepen industrial collaboration and strengthen supply chain resilience for the benefit of both countries.”

Office of Defense Cooperation Chief at the US Embassy Colonel Chris Ingleton said the sites were expansive and offered a broad range of products, which the United States was interested in.

“US cooperation with Australia on production of 155mm projectiles is a key first step as we look to expand to other ammunition and achieve mutually beneficial results that contribute to and complement each of our industrial bases and operational readiness,” Colonel Ingleton said.

More than 100 jobs have been secured at a Belfast plant with a new Ministry of Defence (MoD) contract to maintain an air defence system.

Thales won the £98.4 million contract, supporting 119 jobs, to maintain short-range air defence (Shorad) for the British Army and Royal Marines.

Shorad is made up of high velocity and lightweight multi-role missile systems that can intercept air threats including fast jets, attack helicopters and unmanned air systems in a matter of seconds.

Philip McBride, general manager at Thales Belfast, said it followed previous contracts and extends to 2026.

“Thales has supplied weapons systems to the UK MoD for 60 years,” he told the PA news agency.

“This equipment includes shoulder launchers, tripod launchers, vehicle boost launchers and the management of the firing camps that the MoD run.”

Mr McBride said the plant had learned a lot about the equipment, how it is utilised and its maintenance which he said puts the firm in a “great position” for what happens beyond 2026.

“This isn’t just about the sustaining of the workforce on this contract, it’s about preparing the way for what happens after this contract,” he said.

Thales employs more than 550 people at its Belfast plant and also has a “sizeable” workforce in the south-west of England.

Mr McBride said the Thales operation in Belfast had “grown substantially” in recent years, “primarily down to investing in the business at the right time”.

“Thales UK has come close to trebling our revenue in the last six to seven years,” he said.

“Our workforce has grown from around 400 to 550 in Belfast alone.”

Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis welcomed the announcement.

“During these uncertain times, I am delighted that the investment of over £98 million will protect over 100 skilled jobs in Belfast. I would like to congratulate all those involved who have secured this vital investment,” he said.

Defence minister procurement Jeremy Quin described the contract as ensuring that vital air defence capabilities, capable of dealing with a multitude of threats, are maintained and readily available to deploy.

“The £98.4m investment is the second major contract awarded to Northern Ireland’s defence industry in less than three months, highlighting Northern Ireland’s important contribution to the delivery of our critical defence capabilities,” he said.

In January, Spirit AeroSystems in Belfast won a £30 million contract for the UK’s first uncrewed fighter aircraft, supporting over 100 local jobs."
DE&S Air Defence contract secures skilled jobs in Belfast - Defence Equipment & Support,"Wed, 03 Mar 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vZGVzLm1vZC51ay9haXItZGVmZW5jZS1jb250cmFjdC1zZWN1cmVzLWJlbGZhc3Qtam9icy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"DE&S have placed a £98.4-million contract to maintain the British Army and Royal Marines’ very Short-Range Air Defence (SHORAD) capability.

This SHORAD system, which entered service with the British Army and Royal Marines in 1997, is designed to intercept a wide range of air threats such as fast jets, attack helicopters and unmanned air systems.

The contract award secures 119 jobs at THALES UK’s Belfast site, as well as more roles in the wider Northern Ireland supply chain and ensures the UK Armed Forces retain absolute confidence in the support and performance of this potent defensive capability until December 31, 2026.

DE&S CEO Sir Simon Bollom said: “Our dedicated team at DE&S has worked closely with industry colleagues to ensure this crucial air defence capability remains primed and ready to support the Armed Forces until the end of 2026.”

Thales UK won the initial contract in 2018, helping to modernise and develop the missile systems as part of the Future Air Defence Availability Project (F-ADAPT). The latest announcement confirms a five-year extension.

The contract was secured by the SHORAD project team at DE&S and ensures this critical capability is maintained during peacetime training, but can also be rapidly deployed for operations well into the 2020s."
