Image courtesy of Thales.

Lightweight Multi-role Missile (LMM) is a surface-to-surface, surface-to-air precision strike missile developed by Thales for the British Armed Forces.

The low-cost missile provides quick response capabilities against surface threats, naval threats, and threats from aerial platforms.

The precision weapon system is expected to be inducted into service with the British Armed Forces by the end of 2020 and achieve full operational capability in 2024.

Known as ‘Martlet’ in the British Royal Navy, the LMM underwent its first successful firings from a AW159 Wildcat helicopter during a series of trials between April and May 2020, demonstrating its integration onto the Wildcat.

The missile can be launched in support of missions such as coastal and border protection, and safeguarding critical assets.

Lightweight Multi-role Missile design and features

The land variant of the Lightweight Multi-role Missile weighs 13kg and can be launched from air, land or sea from wheeled or tracked vehicles and other tactical military platforms such as fixed or rotary-winged unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and fast in-shore attack craft (FIAC).

LMM measures 1.3m long and has a diameter of 76mm. It can be used for multi-role purposes for light and heavy platforms with a fast launch and fire-on-the-move capabilities.

The missile can target both traditional and asymmetric threats with high levels of precision and accuracy. The range of threats that can be engaged includes armoured personnel carriers (APC), tracked and wheeled vehicles.

The land-based weapon system is sealed in a canister and is capable of providing protection against surface threats from fixed installations or towed artillery.

The missile features a modular design and offers a minimum shelf life of 15 years with potential for re-use. The family includes anti-armour and warhead variants.

LMM can be integrated onto different gun systems and remote weapon stations (RWS), enabling greater protection of light 4×4 vehicles and armoured fighting vehicles (AFV). Subsystems of the missile include laser proximity sensor, tail fins and laser receiver modules.

Guidance features of LMM

The missile system includes guidance electronics, control actuator system, and dual-mode fuse (impact and proximity modes). The guidance mechanism comprises the optical tracker system, which is fixed on the launch platform.

The guidance unit of the Lightweight Multi-role Missile is installed within an optically stabilised mount which includes equipment such as thermal cameras, charged coupled device (CCD), automatic target tracker (ATT) and the missile laser guidance unit.

Once the target is indicated, the missile operator directs the LMM onto the target and brings the ATT into play, which fixes the gaze on the target. The system is then turned on and the missile is fired to attack the threat. The weapon system includes a manual guidance mode, which allows the operator to interrupt the ATT at any stage of engagement and take manual control over the operation.

The control and actuation system (CAS) and control surfaces allow the munition to perform high lateral acceleration (LATAX) manoeuvres for the engagement of mobile targets.

The key features of the guidance processing unit (GPU) include autopilot software and processing hardware to provide commands to the CAS for precision guidance.

Warhead details

The missile is fitted with a pre-fragmented blast warhead along with shaped charge penetrator and matching laser proximity fuse. The warhead facilitates the engagement of the target with minimum collateral damage and high lethality. The low collateral damage capability makes the missile ideal for urban environments.

LMM can be used to provide blast fragmentation effect, shaped charge effect, and combined target effect. The safe arm unit (SAU) enables the munition to complete the required sequence of events in a time-bound manner to arm the warhead and activate a detonation.

Propulsion and performance

The Lightweight Multi-role Missile is propelled by a two-stage rocket motor and solid fuel propellant.

The first stage motor allows the missile to emerge from the launch tube without recoil. Once the missile leaves the canister, it travels to a safe distance before it is accelerated by the second stage motor to its maximum velocity.

Travelling at a speed of more than Mach 1.5, the weapon can attain a minimum range of up of 400m and a maximum operational range of more than 6km.

Launchers used for LMM

The weapon system can be launched from Lightweight Multiple Launcher – Next Generation (LML-NG), which is designed for installation on a vehicle or tripod for rapid launch of the missiles. LML-NG is capable of carrying two ready-to-launch missiles, enabling successive engagement of multiple threats to provide armed forces with quick response capabilities against a range of targets.

Thales RAPIDRanger multi-missile launcher can also be used to launch the high-precision missile. RAPIDRanger is a vehicle-mounted platform that can tackle cruise missiles, UAVs, and ground-attack aircraft."

Thales unveils Sophie Optima Long Range targeting binocular - EDR Magazine,"Wed, 24 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVkcm1hZ2F6aW5lLmV1L3RoYWxlcy11bnZlaWxzLXNvcGhpZS1vcHRpbWEtbG9uZy1yYW5nZS10YXJnZXRpbmctYmlub2N1bGFy0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Paolo Valpolini

It would have been one of the stars at the Thales chalet at Eurosatory, but considering the cancellation of the Villepinte exhibition the company decided launching it a couple of weeks later. On 23 June a series of webinars dedicated to customers and media were thus organised to introduce the new Optima handheld targeting system, the latest addition to the well known Sophie family of which over 16,000 systems were provided to 55 countries. Ergonomy, SWAP and performances were the main drivers leading to the new members of the Thales targeting binoculars portfolio.

At the core of this innovation we find users, the company having put in the development loop some of its key customers, Pascal Secrétin, head of imagers and sensors for optronics systems at Thales explained.

The Optima concept was already unveiled at Eurosatory 2018, when the star was its cooled counterpart, known as Ultima, a binocular target acquisition system dedicated to specialist personnel, such as JTACs (Joint Terminal Attack Controllers) and artillery observers. This product falls in what Thales defines the eXtended Range segment, XR in short, with a Thermal Imaging (TI) tank recognition range in excess of 6 km. The new Optima is part of the LR (Long Range) segment, and is dedicated to personnel such as platoon leaders, who need roughly half the range, but might be confronted to more sudden threats; affordability and short switch on time are both typical of uncooled sensors compared to cooled ones, the Sophie Optima featuring a 1280×1024 microbolometer operating in the 8-12 µm band. This latest generation sensor provides a huge number of pixels, 1.3 Mp, but features a reduced size thanks to the latest technologies that allowed reducing the pitch to 12 µm from the previous 17 µm. “This is the highest number of pixels currently on the market,” Pierre-Yves Guinet, the Sophie Optima Product Manager explains, “allowing a more efficient image processing.” The high definition IR channel gives a maximum Field of View (FoV) of 22° while previous products usually featured a maximum FoV of 13°, “the wider the maximum FoV, the easier it is to detect a target when carrying our surveillance,” the Optima PM says. The IR channel has a dual FoV, 22° and 10°, an electronic zoom allowing to increase magnification, the minimum FoV being 3°, at which declared performances against a tank are 6 km detection range, 3 km recognition and 1.5 km identification ranges; against a human target these data are respectively 4, 1.5 and 1 km. The close connection to the Ultima comes when examining the day channel: here Thales adopted what is still considered the best option for detecting a target in daytime, a Direct View Optic (DVO), that of the Optima having the same characteristics of the one adopted on the Ultima, the glass day channel being based on a 7×35 optic with a 6° FoV, which can see a tank at 7 km distance compared to the 2 km distance obtained with a TV sensor. This of course comes to a price in terms of weight and volume, however the company considered that here performance was higher value than SWAP. According to data provided by Thales, against tanks D/R/I ranges are respectively 10, 7 and 4 km, and against human targets 7, 4 and 2 km. The Sophie Optima also includes a TV colour channel, allowing the recording and transmission of daytime images. Provided with image stabilisation, autofocus and super-resolution, the Optima is fitted with multimode image fusion mode, and images can be safely stored on a µSD memory card.

Considering the range, the Laser Rangefinder reaches a target at 5 km distance (that of the Ultima has an 8 km range), the Optima being also fitted with a Digital Magnetic Compass and with an embedded C/A GPS, an external NMEA connection being also available, the Optima being GPS P/Y friendly thus capable to be interfaced with GPSDAGR/PLGR. As add-on options Thales proposes a near-IR Laser Pointer as well as Seespot and Seepointer.

The users interface has been kept pretty similar to that of the Ultima, the human-machine interface having been designed together with the users. Two years ago Thales announced that the Optima should have been available in early 2020: “We had to redesign it,” Pascal Secrétin explains, “as the users asked us to reduce its dimensions, and it took us one year to come to the current size which is 20% less than the original volume.”

The new product is inherently designed to be used in collaborative combat, which is the mantra of the French Army Scorpion programme, the Optima adopting an Ethernet 1000 STANAG 4609 NATO digital motion imagery standard and being ready for augmented reality insertions, while it is also fitted with USB2, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, the RS232 port being used for maintenance purposes. Its networking capabilities make it however a potential victim of cyber attacks. To this end Thales adopted four different protection systems. The first is an access code, allowing only the user to operate the system. The second feature is based on the authentication of shared data; i.e. if one receives an image that has been captured by the enemy and modified to trick the friendly operator, the system will detect the manipulation and send a warning. Third, a user “safe” is embedded in the Optima, making it impossible to steel pictures or coordinates. Finally, each time the system is turned on, an integrity check is run making sure that nobody tried to modify the software.

Thales declares an 8 hours battery life with full functions, according to the users’ profile, the Optima using Bren-Tronics CES rechargeable (Cylindrical Energy Source) Li-Ion batteries.

All what was described earlier comes at a total weight of less than 2.5 kg including batteries, the Sophie Optima providing increased performances in terms of daylight range, wide FoV and cyber protection compared to the systems of the same category which weight falls between 2 and 4 kg.

Company tests should be concluded by year-end, first deliveries being expected in early 2021. Beside the product itself, Thales also briefed the media on after-sales service: Rémi de Besombes, the Services Marketing Manager, explained the company offer, that includes various options, from on-demand case-by-case solutions to multi-year schemes, the latter based i.e. on repair time. He also highlighted the availability of mobile test benches that can be deployed in theatres of operation, allowing on-site maintenance.

"Eduardo Bellido, CEO of Thales Alenia Space Spain - The CEO Magazine","Mon, 22 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWNlb21hZ2F6aW5lLmNvbS9leGVjdXRpdmUtaW50ZXJ2aWV3cy9tYWNoaW5lcnkvZWR1YXJkby1iZWxsaWRvL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"When he is not building satellites, Thales Alenia Space Spain CEO Eduardo Bellido spends much of his time reading astrophysics journals and pondering the mysteries of the universe: How does the sun work? Has there ever been life on Mars?

These are the curiosities that once pumped billions of euros into public funds toward space exploration and fuelled the passions of thousands of people who work in the once-thriving industry. Over the past decade, however, all this has changed.

Funding has slowed to a trickle, and increasing competition over a dwindling number of commercial satellite contracts has skyrocketed. “The space business today is no longer what it used to be,” Eduardo says.

“Telecommunication contracts worldwide shrunk to a minimum in 2018 and, as a result, the entire value chain suffered. The market has become extremely competitive and, to confront this challenge, I decided that we needed to adapt quickly.”

In order to equip Thales Alenia Space Spain to meet the changing needs of its clients and win contracts in a tightening market, Eduardo has had to shift the company’s priorities and give it a new vision.

One aspect of this shift has been a refocusing – away from the ethereal aspects of space and its mysteries, and toward developing low-cost products and services, diversifying offerings, and ultimately, winning as many bids as possible.

“The objective was to be more agile, dynamic, innovative and competitive – reinforcing at every level the business and customer orientation. So we analysed the whole company, removing processes that didn’t bring any value to the final product.

We assessed the way in which we have been working for many years, working to favour disruptive ideas and developing low-cost products,” Eduardo says.

“Change is always very difficult, and it requires a huge effort and lots of communication, convincing people to see the change as fundamental. That’s why, instead of bringing in consultants, I gave more responsibility to our employees. Who knows better what we have to do than our own people?”

Every technology we develop needs to have a clear value to our clients.

Fortunately, Eduardo’s team embraced this responsibility and came up with many ideas that have all been successfully implemented, as well as finding ways to adjust the company’s products to suit the needs of its clients. “Today, we are winning proposals we could never even have imagined a few years ago,” he says.

State-of-the-art solutions

The changes Eduardo implemented have transformed Thales Alenia Space Spain from being purely an equipment producer to being a European leader in communication subsystems. In the past year, the company has risen even further up the value chain to become a payload prime.

Among the company’s recent achievements has been its construction of a new satellite integration facility in Madrid, and its winning of the payload of the National Spanish Satellites, SPAINSAT-NG.

“This has been a huge success because Thales Alenia Space could offer our clients the optimum, most advanced, state-of-the-art solutions in digital payloads,” Eduardo says.

Thales Alenia Space was also the first company in Spain to develop and integrate communication satellite panels for multi-mission satellites in South Korea – a project that won the company the Supplier Excellence Award from the Korean Aerospace Research Institute in 2017.

The company’s pursuit of diversification and new clients has also led to the development of new technologies, not to mention efficiency standards that continue to pay dividends down the line. “As the industry changes, old technologies disappear, and it falls to us to innovate new ones,” Eduardo says.

“For example, we are seeing a lot of advancement in software, in new processors, and in telecommunications, we are moving away from classical payloads to more compact, more dynamically configurable payloads in orbit.

Every technology we develop needs to have a clear value to our clients.” The fact that 98% of Thales Alenia Space Spain’s sales are exported is a testament to the success of Eduardo’s reforms.

“This means that we are very competitive, as we are always competing with local companies from every country around the world,” he says.

Future preparation

In his five years at the helm of Thales Alenia Space Spain, Eduardo has drawn on the lessons he learned from decades in the space industry, watching other companies fail to adapt to changes in the market.

“This is my fifth company and I have seen my fair share of mistakes and failures, but also great managers with a clear vision and drive. One of the things I have always tried to do is to learn from people in positions of leadership and I’m fortunate that I have had the chance to see strong managers with the skills to drive companies to extraordinarily high levels of achievement,” he says.

By making his company futureproof, Eduardo has even managed to reopen the door on exploration – the side of the business that enticed him in the first place. Thales Alenia Space Spain was recently commissioned to develop the hardware and software responsible for moving the solar panels, the camera mast and the locomotion system on the robotic Mars rover Rosalind Franklin, set to launch in 2022.

“It’s probably the most complex equipment that we have developed so far because it is outside of the rover, and beside the difficulty of the technology, the equipment has to survive the variations in temperature on the surface of Mars, which are huge,” Eduardo says.

“Once it lands on Mars, we will see within two metres of depth if there is anything that has lived or is living on our neighbouring planet.” The fact that missions like this are still being funded signals to Eduardo that space will continue to play a major role in human life.

“Without satellites, we would not have communication or navigation technologies, we would not understand the dynamics of our planet and we would miss out on important advancements in areas such as medicine and tooling machinery,” Eduardo says.

“I wish more people understood that space is absolutely fundamental to our quality of life. Space is a good investment.”

THALES ALENIA SPACE WILL PROVIDE TWO KEY PRESSURIZED ELEMENTS FOR AXIOM COMMERCIAL SPACE ... - SpaceWatch.Global,"Wed, 24 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3NwYWNld2F0Y2guZ2xvYmFsLzIwMjAvMDYvdGhhbGVzLWFsZW5pYS1zcGFjZS13aWxsLXByb3ZpZGUtdHdvLWtleS1wcmVzc3VyaXplZC1lbGVtZW50cy1mb3ItYXhpb20tY29tbWVyY2lhbC1zcGFjZS1zdGF0aW9uL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales Alenia Space, Joint Venture between Thales (67 %) and Leonardo (33 %) announced the signature of an ATP (Authorization To Proceed) with Axiom Space of Houston, Texas to initiate the development of two key pressurized elements dedicated to the world’s first commercial space station.

In January, NASA selected Axiom’s proposal to attach its space station modules to the International Space Station (ISS) starting from the second half of 2024, ultimately creating a new ‘Axiom Segment’ which will expand the usable and habitable volume of the ISS. When the ISS reaches its retirement date, the Axiom complex will detach and operate as a free-flying commercial space station. The Axiom Segment will be attached to the ISS Node 2 built by Thales Alenia Space.

Axiom is offering professional and private astronaut flights to the ISS at a rate of up to two per year, with the first set to launch in October 2021, while it develops the new station elements.

Based on its past successful experience building modules for the International Space Station, Thales Alenia Space will be responsible for the design, development, assembly and test of the primary structure and the Micrometeoroid & Debris Protection System for the Axiom Node One (AxN1) and Habitation Module (AxH), the first two Axiom station elements to fly. Axiom will receive these elements at their facility in Houston for integration and outfitting of core systems and certification of flight prior to shipping to the launch facility.

Walter Cugno, Thales Alenia Space Vice President, Science and Exploration commented: “With its unrivaled expertise for pressurized modules, Thales Alenia Space is an essential partner for all human and deep space exploration missions. I am confident this partnership with Axiom will open new horizons by revolutionizing the human presence in low-Earth orbit.”

Massimo Comparini, Thales Alenia Space Senior Executive Vice President Observation Exploration & Navigation business line stated: ”This mission is an important step toward enabling the development of independent commercial destinations, and fostering the growth of a strong and competitive low-Earth orbit economy. The synergy with the entire space ecosystem, from Governmental institutions and international Agencies, to private companies, positions Thales Alenia Space at the very core of the industry, and together with our partner Axiom we are happy to partake in this new enterprise of building the new sustainable low-Earth Orbit market based on commercial space destinations.”

“The legacy of the International Space Station structure is one of safety and reliability despite huge technical complexity,” said Axiom Space CEO Michael Suffredini, formerly NASA’s ISS Program Manager from 2005 to 2015. “We are thrilled to combine Axiom’s human spaceflight expertise with Thales Alenia Space’s experience to build the next stage of human settlement in Low Earth Orbit from a foundation that is tried and tested. The first two modules of the Axiom Commercial Space Station will serve as the wellspring of a thriving commercial future in space.”

Thales Alenia Space has supplied a significant part of the pressurized elements of the International Space Station, including state-of-the-art components such as Node 2, Node 3, Columbus (pressurized part) – European Laboratory, Multi-Purpose Logistics Module (MPLM), the Permanent Logistic Module (PPM) and Cupola, as well as the ATV and Cygnus cargo modules.

Leonardo test fires Thales Martlet missile on Wildcat helicopter for first time - Aerospace Testing International,"Tue, 02 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hZXJvc3BhY2V0ZXN0aW5naW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC5jb20vbmV3cy9kZWZlbnNlL2xlb25hcmRvLXRlc3QtZmlyZXMtdGhhbGVzLW1hcnRsZXQtbWlzc2lsZS1vbi13aWRsY2F0LWhlbGljb3B0ZXItZm9yLWZpcnN0LXRpbWUuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Leonardo and Thales have successfully fired for the first time the Thales Martlet Lightweight Multirole Missile from Leonardo’s AW159 Wildcat helicopter. The Wildcat, which first flew in 2009, is operated by the British Army and Royal Navy and is the successor to the Lynx helicopter.

The firings were conducted as part of the UK Ministry of Defence’s (MoD) Future Anti-Surface Guided Weapon (FASGW) program and demonstrated the integration of the Martlet onto the AW159 platform. The successful test represents a major milestone and enables the missile to enter service with the Royal Navy later this year.

The firing trials were conducted from April 27 to May 21 and. All of the teams involved had to adopt strict distancing procedures to prevent the spread of Covid-19.

Nick Whitney, managing director of Leonardo Helicopters (UK) said, “This major milestone demonstrates that the combination of the AW159 Wildcat and Martlet missile will be a flexible and effective tool for the Royal Navy. “Next year the Wildcat fleet will embark on Carrier Strike Group missions with HMS Queen Elizabeth on its maiden operational deployment.”

Philip McBride, general manager integrated airspace-protection systems at Thales UK said. “The successful live firings of the Thales LMM Martlet from the AW159 Wildcat is a key milestone in the program, delivering a significant step-change in capability for the platform.

“Martlet will ensure that the Wildcat has the best-in-class offensive capability to protect HMS Queen Elizabeth and her task group during her maiden operational deployment next year. With each platform capable of carrying up to 20 Martlet, the Wildcats deployed with the task group will be a significant deterrent to anyone wishing to interfere with UK interests.”

Leonardo have been working to integrate, test and install the MBDA Sea Venom (heavy) and Thales Martlet Lightweight Multirole Missile (LMM) missile systems onto Royal Navy AW159 Wildcat helicopters since July 2014 under the Future Anti Surface Guided Weapon (FASGW) program.

The FASGW (light) part of the program has now seen the LMM, with its associated launcher and airborne laser guidance unit, successfully integrated into the Leonardo AW159 Wildcat sensor, displays and avionics systems. The LMM will help the Royal Navy engage smaller, fast-moving, asymmetric threats which have high mobility, small thermal and radar signatures and the severe background clutter encountered said Leonardo, as well as air targets such as UAVs and other maritime helicopters.

The launchers are mounted to the AW159 using the Leonardo Weapon Wing, developed at the company’s design and manufacturing facility in Yeovil, UK and first trialled last year. Each weapon wing will be able to carry either ten Martlet or two Sea Venom missiles and generates additional lift for the helicopter in forward flight, reducing demands on the main rotor."
Jamaica Orders Additional Thales Bushmaster MRAPs - Overt Defense - Overt Defense -,"Wed, 17 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm92ZXJ0ZGVmZW5zZS5jb20vMjAyMC8wNi8xNy9qYW1haWNhLW9yZGVycy1hZGRpdGlvbmFsLXRoYWxlcy1idXNobWFzdGVyLW1yYXBzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Pin 0 Shares

Jamaica Defense Force (JDF) has ordered an additional six Bushmaster Protected Vehicles from French multi-national defense and aerospace company Thales Group. The additional vehicles, divided into three troop carriers and three ambulance versions, bring the total number of Bushmaster vehicles operated by the JDF to 18. The JDF is hoping this 50% increase will bolster its crime-fighting capabilities, while Thales hailed the order as an endorsement of the Bushmaster’s performance after five years in service with the JDF.

The 4×4, 11 tonnes, anti-blast and anti-ballistic armored mobility vehicle capable of carrying 4 tonnes of payload, failed to be selected for the U.S. Military’s Phase MRAP (Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected) program, but found global success nonetheless, serving in the militaries of 8 different countries. It first served in Afghanistan with Dutch and Australia’s forces. Jamaica, however, deploys the vehicles primarily for crime-fighting purposes.

The Bushmaster is designed to protect and transport up to ten people in extreme environments and hostile territory, both on and off-road. In addition, the new units ordered by the JDF are equipped with fully integrated Auxiliary Power Units (APUs). This allows for functions such as supplementary air conditioning to run when the engine is off, enabling static vehicles to remain at a comfortable temperature in Jamaica’s hot climate. The ambulance variant of the vehicle is designed to enable soldiers to quickly evacuate and treat injured members of law enforcement in the safety of the Bushmaster instead of sending a regular vehicle lacking in armor to dangerous locations.

“Thales’ Bushmaster protected vehicle will lead to enhanced safety and security for Jamaican citizens, helping crime fighters in their crucial mission.” Ruben Lazo, Vice President, Thales in Latin America.

The original 12 Bushmaster vehicles were ordered back in 2013 and delivery to Jamaica began in 2015. This is not the first time the MRAP was utilized in civilian settings, and since 2013 a fleet of fifteen have been utilized by the South Australian Forestry Corporation in firefighting roles."

In the area dedicated to optronics at Eurosatory 2020 “a new era Night Vision Goggle”, as it has been defined by Pascal Secrétin, the company head of imagers and sensors for optronics systems, would have been on exhibition. Details of the new system dedicated to soldiers on foot, known as Nellie, were unveiled a few days after the dates in which the Villepinte event would have taken place. The new product is a binocular NVG, thus providing a stereoscopic vision that allows a better feeling of the relief and of depth.

“Our users can be considered part of our design team, as they have really been those who dictated the solutions,” Secrétin explains, “as we found out talking to them that our existing systems did not had the right ergonomy, therefore we decided to redesign our NVGs producing six different solutions and allowing them to test them and provide us their feedback.” This is the procedure that gave birth to Nellie.

“Ergonomy is a key factor in order to allow the soldier to operate the system in the easiest possible way when he is under the stress induced by combat,” Secrétin says, “thus we adopted an interface system derived from that used on the Minie, with a single push and turn button that allows to access all functions,” the button shape and positioning having however been revised following customers’ feedback. The Nellie features a lateral flip-up with indexed position, allowing the operator to quickly put it back in place, the cut-off function ensuring to put the system on stand-by when it is moved laterally.

A key element in NVGs, which are worn on the front part of the helmet, is weight: the distance from the neck multiplied by the weight gives the moment, which is what generates fatigue, hence reducing both factors is beneficial in terms of comfort for soldiers who wear NVGs on a long night mission. Compared to the binocular NVG available in Thales portfolio, the Bonie LW (Light Weight) the Nellie brings a reduction of nearly 200 grams, which is over 20 per cent. The Nellie weighs less than 460 grams with the single AA 1.5 V or 3.6 V battery, which lasts over 24 hours at 20°C, eye relief being 20 to 25 mm, the NVG being thus closer to the soldiers’ eyes, all factors reducing fatigue.

According to Thales, another advantage over its predecessor, and over previous generation systems available on the market is the wider Field of View (FoV): the Nellie has a 47° FoV compared to the 40° of the Bonie, the observed scene coverage being augmented by 43 per cent, allowing the soldier to see threats and react in shorter time, without the need of turning his head. “We maintain a resolution identical to that of our previous NVGs on axis as well as on the edge, at two thirds of the Field of View,” Pascal Secrétin points out, resolution data provided being 1,33 cy/mrd, Thales declaring a detection range of 940 meters and a recognition range of 330 meters, a data that will of course depend from the type of tube and night conditions.

The Nellie can be fitted with 18 mm Image Intensifying tubes from Gen. II to Gen. IV, both with white and green phosphorus, depending on customer’s choice. The Thales next-gen NVG should complete trials before year-end and be made available in early 2021.

Thales: Strategic defence partnership to secure hundreds of Australian jobs - EDR Magazine,"Mon, 29 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVkcm1hZ2F6aW5lLmV1L3RoYWxlcy1zdHJhdGVnaWMtZGVmZW5jZS1wYXJ0bmVyc2hpcC10by1zZWN1cmUtaHVuZHJlZHMtb2YtYXVzdHJhbGlhbi1qb2Jz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales and the Australian Government have signed a decade long contract worth more than AUD 1 billion1 that guarantees the Australian manufacture and supply of strategic munitions to the Australian Defence Force.

This contract demonstrates that Australia’s sovereign defence industry is vital to delivering a capability advantage to the Australian Defence Force (ADF).

The continued long-term partnership between Thales and Defence reinforces the Government’s commitment to maintaining a world leading, competitive and safe domestic munitions manufacturing capability in Australia.

Thales continues to build long-term relationships with hundreds of Australian suppliers, building Australia’s self-reliance and the capability of the broader Australian manufacturing sector.

Thales’s recent supply chain study with AlphaBeta Advisers proved that there is a strong correlation between Sovereign Industry Capability and benefits flowing to Australian suppliers.

France's navy trailblazes the technologies for tomorrow's ISR - Thales,"Tue, 02 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi93b3JsZHdpZGUvZGVmZW5jZS1hbmQtc2VjdXJpdHkvbWFnYXppbmUvZnJhbmNlcy1uYXZ5LXRyYWlsYmxhemVzLXRlY2hub2xvZ2llcy10b21vcnJvd3MtaXNy0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"How the French Navy’s ATL2 modernisation programme combines Thales’s cutting-edge SEARCHMASTER® radar and latest-generation data processing to demonstrate better performance – even in tougher environments

Maritime patrol and surveillance aircraft (MPAs and MSAs) – the naval workhorses that escort nuclear submarines, fly Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions, and sometimes pinpoint terrorists on land, are designed for long service lives. 50 years ago, their focus was deep-sea submarine deterrence – but in the 2020s, the picture is much more diverse: new superpowers are building stealth ships and submarines; political instability demands military interventions; and pirates benefit from the latest fast boats and drones. If MPAs were important in the cold war, they’re now critical: the loss of a high-value asset, or a successful terrorist strike, can compromise sovereign supremacy – not to mention the human and financial costs.

It’s a picture that has been exercising the world’s navies for some years. France’s defence procurement agency (the DGA) is leading the way through an ambitious programme of upgrades to its ageing ATL2 fleet. Clear that the keys are better and longer-range detection, and the rapid and decisive use of data, the DGA has turned to Thales. The company has been working intensely to mature and adapt a range of technologies in response to the evolving threat. The lynchpin is the cutting-edge SEARCHMASTER® — a lightweight, modular version of Thales’s Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) antenna, whose open architecture anticipates the frequent upgrades of a software-based world. By combining this with other Thales innovations, such as its latest-generation digital acoustic processing subsystem, the company can offer a potent solution to tackle the new realities.

SEARCHMASTER® promises a step change in capability: multiple radar modes that offer superior tactical picture monitoring in high sea states and noise-dense coastal zones – as well as detecting smaller and faster-moving objects; the automation of tasks to address an increasing maelstrom of data faced by operators; and the ability to map large areas, accurately and quickly.

This promise has been realised in the transformative results seen by France’s naval evaluation unit during testing: the precision imagery delivered has delighted the client – fully meeting operator expectations and enhancing data reliability, ease of use, and maintainability. The net result? Greater mission scope, operational effectiveness and fleet availability.

As well as meeting today’s needs, the radar is also designed to ‘futureproof’ navies’ MPA fleets, enabling them to take full advantage of the ‘smart functions’ coming from rapidly developing fields like Big Data and AI. The French Navy and Thales are already using data from the ATL2 programme to further optimise these radar modes – and developing new ones for threats now appearing on the horizon. The first upgraded ATL2s are expected to enter service in 2021, with a rapid programme of refits to be complete by 2024."

Second-generation maximizes COSMO-SkyMed system capabilities

COSMO-SkyMed Second Generation (CSG) is the first synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite system in the world able to acquire two images simultaneously. Launched on December 18, 2019, the satellite is now completing in-orbit tests to ensure joint operability with the four COSMO-SkyMed First Generation satellites, thus increasing the system’s overall capabilities.

Earth observation from space is crucial, since it helps define and implement responsible environmental policies at local, national, regional and international levels. Thales Alenia Space is a center of excellence in spaceborne environmental monitoring. Since the first launch in 2007, the COSMO-SkyMed dual (civil/defense) radar observation system built by Thales Alenia Space on behalf of the Italian space agency ASI and the Italian Ministry of Defense, has continuously monitored the Earth’s surface. It meets government requirements, while helping us deal with natural disasters, optimize the use of our natural resources, protect populations at risk and much more. Most recently, COSMO-SkyMed took impressive shots of the rebuilt bridge in Genoa, Italy, two years after it collapsed in August 2018.

On February 5, 2020, the first second-generation COSMO-SkyMed satellite acquired this image of the Hofsjökull glacier in Iceland. A radar image provides a better perception than optical imagery of the complexity of the glacier and the morphology of the surrounding snow-covered area.

From intuition to reality

The SAR sensor’s versatility and electronic agility enabled the development of a new operating mode, DI2S-MS, or ""DIscrete Stepped Strip Multi-Swath"", which allows the simultaneous acquisition of two targets on the earth's surface that are hundreds of kilometers apart. Overcoming the constraints of the conventional SAR spotlight mode, the DI2S-MS mode allows capturing two spotlight images simultaneously, using dual polarization. The DI2S-MS project began in 2014, inspired by an intuition of Diego Calabrese, Thales Alenia Space Italy technical manager for the development of CSG. He realized that he could use the agility offered by the electronics and SAR antenna on COSMO-SkyMed Second Generation, which he had designed and patented as a ""DIscrete Stepped Strip"" (DI2S). Along with innovative solutions for the Earth segment, this made it possible to overcome some of the traditional restrictions of SAR devices and improve their quality and serviceability, for example by addressing user access requests for geographically separate areas.

The figure below shows two very-high-resolution (sub-metric) SAR spotlight images taken simultaneously in DI2S-MS mode by the first COSMO-SkyMed Second Generation satellite on April 25, 2020 in the Rome and Altamura regions, processed by Telespazio at the Matera Space Center."

As a member of the Global Compact, Thales makes a concrete contribution to the transformation of the world through its core business and strategy. This is demonstrated in particular in its increased contribution to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals which are now fully taken into account by the Group.

Climate change and the scarcity of resources are major challenges, bearing physical as well as social risks. In line with its values and purpose of building a future we can all trust, for a long time now Thales has been committed to protecting the environment. In 2019, the Group increased its commitment to a low-carbon future, thus reaffirming the declarations made in the Business Proposals for COP21 in 2015, then in the French Business Climate Pledge in 2017 and 2019.

Satellites ""see the sea"" in unrivaled ways

The theme for World Oceans Day 2020 is ""Innovation for a Sustainable Ocean,"" with a specific focus on sustainability as a reminder to consider the critical benefits of space for Earth. Space-based systems have observed the Earth and the oceans that cover more than 70 percent of our planet’s surface for more than 50 years. At the same time, the space sector has driven innovative solutions that benefit everybody down on Earth.

A unique vantage point

Circling the Earth in various orbits, satellites deliver information than would be impossible to gather from the surface.

Scientists and governments need reliable data to understand how our planet is changing and tackle the climate change challenge. Since shortly after the beginning of the space era, Earth observation satellites have gathered critical data to help us meet global challenges.

The Covid-19 pandemic has provided compelling proof of how closely our fate is linked with the health of the natural world – and satellites are operating 24-7 to support people around the world.

While the stunning images from satellites reveal Earth in all its beauty, they also highlight how global warming and other changes are affecting our world.

Satellites have recently tracked rapidly melting ice in Greenland and Antarctica, acquired images of the Hofsjökull glacier in Iceland, mapped wildfires and monitored damage caused by cyclones.

A world leader in altimetry

Thales Alenia Space is a world leader in space altimetry, a technique that lets us study sea surface height, sea ice thickness and river and lake levels, as well as land, ice sheet and seabed topography.

Our company has provided a whole host of instruments for oceanography, like the Poseidon altimeters on the Topex-Poseidon and Jason 1, 2 and 3 missions for the French space agency CNES. We also built the AltiKa Ka-band altimeter for the French-Indian SARAL oceanography satellite, and the SIRAL 2 very-high-resolution SAR (synthetic aperture radar) altimeter on ESA’s Cryosat-2 satellite, capable of measuring variations in sea ice thickness and continental ice mass balance with unparalleled accuracy. In addition, we supply the SRAL SAR altimeters for Sentinel-3. Other examples include the MERIS multispectral optical “water color” spectrometer on the Envisat satellite and the OLCI instrument on Sentinel-3, the SWIM altimeter on the CFOSat satellite for CNES, which measures wave spectra, and the SADKO altimeters on Russia’s GEO-IK satellites.

Built by Thales Alenia Space on behalf of ESA within the scope of the European Union’s Copernicus program, Sentinel-3 satellites are dedicated to a wide range of applications. They will be useful in monitoring maritime transport, for example by detecting icebergs, and measuring the height and movement of waves. This is vital data, enabling us to improve maritime safety. Sea and ocean color data are also crucial to measure sea and land surface temperatures and to identify areas with algae and phytoplankton – information that will prove invaluable to the fishing industry and support the detection of algal bloom pollution.

At the same time, services based on Sentinel-3 data will greatly benefit agriculture. Having accurate and up-to-date information is an ideal way to help farmers monitor any changes in their crops and land use.

Thales has a worldwide reputation for developing and applying the latest synthetic training methods and equipment to prepare military aircrew for the most demanding of working environments.

The COVID-19 lockdown has added new challenges to every workplace, particularly for key workers involved in the fight against Coronavirus. Thales Training and Simulation teams are stepping up to the plate to ensure that military aircrew can continue to operate safely.

At the same time, they are now supporting engineers manufacturing critical ventilator equipment and training frontline NHS staff in using it.

Maintaining the UK’s Defence

Business must continue as normal for Thales’s remote site teams working on RAF bases across the country. When it comes to delivering training services to support the UK Military’s non-discretionary tasking, everyone is a key worker; Thales’s people are working alongside military colleagues to deliver training and maintain a range of complex synthetic training equipment despite the challenges of COVID-19.

Maintaining operations has not always been easy, especially ensuring the availability of key personnel and supplies required for continued training. Keeping our people and our customers safe has been the priority throughout this difficult period, necessitating additional cleaning of training equipment; modifying training equipment and procedures to adhere to social distancing requirements and, where necessary, providing PPE for specific critical tasks. These changes have proved challenging to implement. However, the Thales Training Services team, working alongside military personnel, Health and Safety and Facilities Management teams, has demonstrated the strength of the RAF’s “Whole Force” approach in keeping sites running safely.

The Thales team based at RAF Brize Norton continues to provide synthetic training for RAF crews flying Voyager Air to Air Refuelling missions for the Typhoon Force and to the Air Tanker crews maintaining the South Atlantic Air Bridge to the Falkland Islands and repatriating UK citizens from abroad.

In more normal times, pilot instructors would be in the cockpit along with the pilots for synthetic training sorties of up to four hours. However, the Thales engineering teams designed and made some rapid, low cost modifications to existing, but previously unused, equipment.

These upgrades included reconfigurations of the touch screen displays, the creation of repeats of the avionics and Mission System Operator (MSO) panels and modifications to the communications set-up which included designing and 3-D printing a junction box to allow the use of personal noise-cancelling headsets. Working collaboratively in just a couple of days, the Thales Engineering Teams completed these modifications and improved functionality of the off board Instructor Operating Station (IOS) from where the pilot instructors were able to train more effectively. This greatly reduced the infection risk to both the instructors and the aircrew without impacting on training.

The Thales team in the High G training facility at RAF College Cranwell is continuing to provide centrifuge training to ensure the safety of operational and trainee fast jet pilots. Thales’s site engineering team, working closely with the centrifuge design authority AMST, has carried out additional maintenance activities on the device because of the restrictions on AMST personnel travelling from Austria. This has enabled safety critical training to continue for Typhoon and F35 crews.

The Thales teams supporting the BAES Typhoon Training Facility (TTF) at RAF Coningsby and RAF Lossiemouth are enabling the crews of our Typhoon aircraft to continue to fly safely, keeping our fighter pilots in the sky. BAES commended the efforts of the TTF teams at both sites, including the support provided by colleagues from Thales. The RAF Typhoon Force Commander, Air Cdre Mark Flewin, also praised the continuation of essential Typhoon training during the Covid-19 pandemic:

“It has been very pleasing to see the TTF Whole Force rapidly adapt in these challenging times – continuing to deliver critical conversion, Front-Line and Operational training – where our synthetic solution remains an important and essential element in support of Typhoon Force Operational output.""

Ventilator Challenge UK: Supporting the NHS

Thales has also joined industry partners to make more medical ventilators available for the National Health Service (NHS). As part of the Ventilator Challenge UK consortium, Thales Training and Simulation teams are developing and delivering essential virtual training methods to engineers manufacturing ventilators.

Thales has worked with Smiths Medical which supplies the NHS with portable paraPAC plus™ ventilator, which is used in ambulances and for moving patients within NHS hospitals.

While health workers are experienced in using medical equipment, many have volunteered to return from retirement and need training in the specific operational and technical challenges of using modern ventilator systems.

Usually, healthcare professionals who come into contact with new equipment will use a demo model to build familiarity in a very hands-on process, but this is no longer a viable option. Knowing how the equipment works, however, is a vital part of the puzzle which leads to saving lives.

In just three weeks, Thales personnel have produced operator training modules for NHS workers, using an eLearning platform which maintains distancing measures.

Thales is also providing specialist training for companies setting up new assembly lines to manufacture ventilators, which require a range of new tools and skills.

At the start of the project, skill levels on assembly lines were assessed, and skill gaps identified, to produce training modules to upskill more than 100 engineers across the UK.

For example, when dealing with electronic components, static electricity is an important factor. Assemblers can unintentionally pass on static electricity which can damage components. In response to feedback from manufacturing operators, Thales offers a new module for workers to learn about electrostatic discharge.

One Team, One Thales

With support from the Thales Crawley team, frontline trainers, engineers and administrators at sites across the nation have demonstrated the company’s “One Team, One Thales” ethos.

In agile and innovative ways, they continue to deliver for the customer during difficult circumstances, wherever their frontline happens to be."

Another 10 systems are slated for the delivery by the end of the year, while a total of 35 will be in the French Army’s inventory by 2021, it was further stated.

The systems were delivered under a contract for up to 210 UAVs awarded to Thales in late 2016. Each Spyranger system consists of three mini-UAVs, a ground station and associated technical support.

According to DGA, the Spyranger is replacing the Drac system which was fielded in 2008.

Twice as powerful as its predecessor, this new mini-drone system will allow the army to strengthen its intelligence capacity as close as possible to the contact zone. The Spyranger will be used to provide support to a combined arms tactical group, support the neutralization of strong points and contribute to firing maneuvers by providing a “remote airborne eye” able to adjust shooting rounds on a target.

The system is transportable in a backpack, and can perform observation missions over a period of 2 hours and 30 minutes, covering a range of 30 km. It features a gyrostabilized multi-sensor optronic payload, tactical data link, and command and control software."
To the Moon and beyond: the 21st century space race - Thales,"Wed, 10 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi9ncm91cC9qb3VybmFsaXN0L21hZ2F6aW5lL21vb24tYW5kLWJleW9uZC0yMXN0LWNlbnR1cnktc3BhY2UtcmFjZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Half a century after the first landing on the Moon, humans are preparing to retrace their footprints on the dusty surface of Earth’s satellite.

Since the Apollo 17 mission in 1972, which concluded manned visits to the Moon, space missions have focused on low Earth orbit flights and experiments in the International Space Station.

Today, a global race is under way to return humans to the lunar surface – a goal that the US, China, Europe and Russia have announced they plan to achieve between 2024 and 2030.

There are several reasons for this renewed space rush.

The unexpected discovery of water on the Moon in 2008 boosted its strategic importance as a platform for space exploration towards Mars and beyond.

Oxygen and hydrogen could be sourced from lunar ice to make rocket propellants, while other Moon resources like helium-3, an energy-producing isotope, could power future fusion rockets for the next step in the space race: sending people to Mars.

Permanent lunar colonies would also support the long-term observation of the Earth’s land surface, biosphere and atmosphere, improving scientists’ ability to predict climate, weather and natural hazards.

Named after Apollo's sister in Greek mythology, NASA’s Artemis programme aims to return crewed missions to the Moon in 2024 in partnership with private-sector companies.

The international consortium led by US tech specialist Dynetics is one of the teams that are competing in the initial design and development phase of Artemis’s Human Landing System.

The landing vehicle will enable astronauts to travel to the lunar surface, live and operate on the ground for up to one week and then return to the Moon’s orbit.

As the only European partner in the Dynetics consortium, Thales Alenia Space is in charge of designing the crew module, drawing from its extensive experience as one of the largest industrial suppliers to the International Space Station.

The crew module plays a key role in the project, since it will house and protect astronauts from the hazards of space flight such as radiation and micrometeorites – cosmic dust that travels 50 times faster than a rifle bullet.

As part of this one-of-a-kind programme, Thales Alenia Space has leveraged its long-standing expertise regarding orbital infrastructures and space exploration systems. The company has provided half of the International Space Station’s pressurised volume, and manufactures the pressurised cargo modules of the Cygnus cargo vessels that are dedicated to delivering essential supplies to the astronauts.

The company will apply its extensive know-how to designing comfortable living and working quarters that will lessen the stress of space travel on crews’ wellbeing.

Providing a comfortable, easy-to-operate environment

Thales Alenia Space’s technology will be able to accommodate many functionalities in a small volume while providing a comfortable, easy-to-operate environment for the crew. The design of the module will benefit from the ongoing partnership with Politecnico and the University of Turin, as well as the unique supply chain available in the territory, which have provided insights into the impact of space on different aspects of human health, including mental resilience.

While astronauts are accustomed to dealing with physical and mental discomfort for a few months, living in cramped conditions during multi-year missions to the Moon and beyond will require cutting-edge solutions.

“We are bringing our huge knowledge to help humans operate in space,” said Walter Cugno, Thales Alenia Space Vice President, Science and Exploration.

“The aim is to go to the Moon, develop the technology and finally send people to Mars. The main interest is humankind’s motivation to explore the unknown and acquire new knowledge, but also the economic interest of new technologies that can be used on Earth,” said Walter Cugno, Thales Alenia Space Vice President, Science and Exploration.

The Artemis missions are just one of the projects under way at Thales Alenia Space, which develops satellite-based systems, orbital infrastructures and re-entry vehicles that enable communications and help observe our planet and optimise its resources, as well as those of our solar system.

Harnessing the potential of artificial intelligence and big data, the technologies under development will support the pioneering aim of space exploration.

This is just the beginning of the journey. Venus, Mars, Saturn, Mercury, asteroids and comets…and now the Moon: Thales Alenia Space has always been part of the most iconic international space exploration missions across the solar system."

Delivered to the French Army, these first SMDRs will significantly strengthen its detection, recognition and identification capabilities as close as possible to the contact zone. In accordance with the Military Planning Law (LPM) 2019-2025, 10 other systems of mini-reconnaissance drones must be delivered by the end of 2020.

Following verification operations carried out on Thales’ Elancourt site and on DGA Techniques terretres’site, the DGA has just authorized the delivery by Thales to the French Army of the first three reconnaissance mini-drones designated SMDR (systèmes de mini-drones de reconnaissance). Intended to ensure detection, recognition and identification missions, they succeed the DRAC system (contact intelligence drone) in service since 2008. Delivered to the Technical Section of the French Army (STAT) to be tested by operational personnel, they will be deployable in operation by the end of 2020. They will be operated by the mini-drone sections of the acquisition and surveillance batteries of artillery regiments and by the 61st Regiment of artillery (61st RA). Twice as powerful as its predecessor, this new mini-drone system will allow the French Army to strengthen its intelligence capacity as close as possible to the contact zone.

SMDR consists of three identical Spy’Ranger drones and a ground station. Equipped with a high definition optronics ball, working day and night, it will offer increased detection, recognition and identification performance. With a wingspan of almost 4 meters and a weight of 15 kg, the drone has an autonomy of around 2:30.

The system is deployed in 12 minutes by a team of two people (installation of the launch pad, assembly of the drone, initialization of the ground station and carrying out tests before takeoff). Thanks to its data link from the ELSA * upstream study, the drone can transmit high-definition video streams in real time, reliably and securely up to 30 km from the ground station.

The 2019-2025 LPM provides for the delivery of 10 other reconnaissance mini-drone systems before the end of 2020. The army will have a fleet of 35 systems by 2021. These systems will receive support in terms of training, logistics and maintenance for 10 years.

"For The Royal Australian Navy, Technological Leap - MarineLink","Thu, 25 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmluZWxpbmsuY29tL25ld3Mvcm95YWwtYXVzdHJhbGlhbi1uYXZ5LXRlY2hub2xvZ2ljYWwtbGVhcC00Nzk2NzLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Driven by the need to organically protect maritime Task Groups from the threat of sea mines, the Royal Australian Navy is introducing a deployable Mine Counter-Measures (MCM) capability under the first phase of Project SEA 1778.



The Royal Australian Navy’s (RAN) SEA 1778 deployable Mine Counter-Measures (MCM) capability is both a small step forward in the spiral development process and a “technological leap” into autonomy.”

The RAN is looking to replace its four legacy Huon-class minehunter coastal ships (MHCs) with a new deployable MCM capability. The lead ship in the class, HMAS Huon (M 82) will be 21 years old this May. The MHCs are slow and are not always available where and when they are needed. Furthermore, they need to enter mined areas to find the mines.

Captain Bryan Parker, the RAN’s Commander Mine Warfare, Clearance Diving, Hydrographic, Meteorological, Oceanographic and Patrol Force (COMMHP), said the Task Group MCM capability aimed to provide a tactical capability essential to reducing the hazard of mines in the littoral maritime domain for Navy’s deployed Fleet, while also minimizing direct exposure of its personnel to dangerous sea mines.

“By its very nature, MCM operations are a time-consuming task and conventional minehunters have a relatively slow speed of advance compared to our other warships. We are aiming to provide an MCM capability in-stride with, or in some cases ahead of, deploying maritime task groups to effectively speed up the time taken on this important function and enabling maritime maneuver,” Parker said.

“We need an organic MCM capability that’s designed to burst out of the back of the Landing Helicopter Dock (LHD) and clear a lane to the beach so the landing force can go ashore,” said Cmdr. Mick Parker, the operational requirements sponsor for mine warfare at the Navy Strategic Command. “SEA 1778 provides an initial interim MCM effect for a single task group.”

The SEA 1778 package is relatively small. The entire system can be containerized, shipped to a task group such as the RAN’s amphibious ships, the new Arafura-class OPV or the Hunter-class future frigate. It can then be dispatched to another location if necessary.

It uses manned and unmanned surface vessels and autonomous underwater vehicles that can search an area from a safe distance.

The procurement is also relatively modest, so the RAN can take gradual steps towards using autonomous systems.

“It’s a small buy so we can test the water, form our concepts, understand our rate of effort, the workforce requirement, conduct the integration, and springboard into the strategy,” Parker said. “It’s a toe-in-the-water of autonomy.”

Thales Australia is the prime contractor for SEA 1778 PH I, and has assembled a world-class team, starting with the five 38-foot support boats made by Steber International of Taree, New South Wales.

The Rotinor Black Shadow diver delivery system can be used to place detonating charges near mines. (Rotinor image)







The boats are the same, all though two of them will also have be equipped with a control system from ECA of La Garde, France so they can be operated remotely. “The unmanned boats (USVs) can tow the Australian Minesweeping System (AMAS) sweep, made by Thales, which is a towed magnetic and acoustic multi-influence sweep for detonating influence mines. If you know there’s a mine out there, you can send out one of the unmanned boats and trigger the mine using the AMAS,” said Troy Stephen who is the Director of the Underwater Systems Business for Thales Australia. “The AMAS is a proven capability used by many navies around the world.”

General Dynamics Mission Systems Bluefin Robotics General Dynamics Mission Systems Bluefin Robotics of Quincy, Massachusetts, has delivered both 9-inch and 12-inch diameter Bluefin unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) for the program

According to Stephen, both the Bluefin-9 and Bluefin-12 vehicles have good endurance, Stephen said, and yet are small enough to handle with relative ease. The Bluefin-9 is 2-man portable, and can be placed into the water from the boats and retrieved over the transom. The larger AUV uses a stern launch and recovery system on the Steber support boat that has been developed by Thales. Both UUVs are fully autonomous, and feature Sonardyne Solstice high-resolution Multi-Aperture Sonar (MAS); the same Removable Data Storage Module (RDSM); and the same 1.9 kWh Li-ion batteries (the Bluefin-9 has one; the Bluefin-12 has four, so the Bluefin-12 can conduct missions of up to 24 hours or longer).

The Bluefin vehicles have the ability to be configured with automatic target recognition using software from SeeByte of Edinburgh, Scotland, so they can identify mine-like objects onboard the vehicle to create an image of the target, and can return with the data for post processing right on the surface boat.

“We can start looking at the data straight away,” Stephen said. “When we get the vehicle alongside, we can take the hot-swappable hard disk and the battery out, put a new one in, and launch it again to search a new area,” said Stephen. “Not too many other vehicles that can do that. That’s one of the key differentiators of the Bluefin vehicle, and why we chose it.”

Both the Bluefin-9 and Bluefin-12 use commercial off-the-shelf sensors to collect bathymetric and environmental data, including data on water currents, temperature, salinity and turbidity; the Nortek Doppler Velocity Log (DVLs) for current measurements; and the Sonardyne Solstice Multi-Aperture Sonar (MAS) for high-resolution imagery even in murky littoral waters.

“Solstice uses multiple elements to generate an image, and in doing that, we improve the signal to noise ratio, and in doing that we extend the range,” said Ioseba Tena, the global business manager for defence and robotics at Yateley, UK-based Sonardyne International Ltd. “We’re extending the range by virtue of doing a better job of how we process and dynamically focus the data, to ensure the best performance in real-time.”

Tena said the Solstice and Bluefin vehicles can “fly” at speeds up to 6 knots, although most UUVs don’t operate that fast. “The beauty with a synthetic aperture sonar is that you get a constant area coverage rate. If you go faster, the range comes down, just by virtue of how the system processes the data. And if you go slower, the range goes up.”

“It’s all about the data,” said Andy Rogers, vice president of undersea systems at General Dynamics Mission Systems. “The Bluefin-9 and Bluefin-12 are able to collect high-resolution data, process that data on-board the vehicle, and deliver actionable information to vehicle operators and decision-makers both during and immediately after a mission.”

Rogers said the vehicles – by design – can be adapted to new missions as they are identified.

The Bluefin-9’s tightly integrated commercial off-the-shelf sensors deliver best-in-class imagery and collect bathymetric and environmental data, including data on water currents, temperature, salinity and turbidity. Designed for detailed hydrographic surveys, the Bluefin-9 is outfitted with Sonardyne Solstice Multi-Aperture Sonar (MAS) that provides high-resolution imagery even in littoral waters. The Bluefin-9 is also equipped with Nortek Doppler Velocity Logs (DVLs) that collect information on water currents up to 30 meters. General Dynamics Mission Systems Bluefin-12.

Stephen said the Bluefin UUVs can also do underwater surveys for harbor clearance or to map out a lane for an amphibious force beach landing. “We’ve tested the Bluefin vehicle with the RAN up in Pittwater, an area to the north of Sydney on the Hawkesbury River, and we’ve had tremendous success. We used the Bluefin to map the bottom, and we found wrecks that nobody knew about. We’re doing experimentation with that data to develop 3D models of the bottom of the ocean. The system also allows for change detection. If we found two objects on the bottom every week for a month, and then a third object shows up, maybe we need to check that out,” said Stephen.

When mines are found and are to be destroyed, the SEA 1778 kit includes the Atlas Elektronik SeaFox (Bremen, Germany) expendable mine neutralization system, as well as the Rotinor (Stuttgart, Germany) Black Shadow diver delivery vehicle to transport divers to place detonation charges near mines, depending on the environment and tactical situation. The MAS Zengrange (Wellington, New Zealand) Command Initiated Detonation Systems (CIDS) is used to initiate the detonation.

In the first phase, the unmanned boats won’t be able to self-deploy the underwater vehicles, but in future phases it is anticipated that the USVs will be enhanced to become fully autonomous and capable of deploying and recovering the UUVs, Stephen said.

As part of the first phase of SEA 1778, the RAN stood up Mine Warfare Team 16 (MWT 16) to operate the four Bluefin-9 UUVs, three Bluefin-12 UUVs, two USVs, three manned MCM Support Boats, and the Seafox Expendable Mine Neutralization System. The team is training on select elements of the system now. MWT 16 will receive the all of its gear later this year. The initial roll-out of the equipment will be the man-portable ‘Bluefin-9’ AUV, for which MWT 16 is undergoing pilot training at Sydney’s Pittwater area. Stephen said the Bluefin-12 has now also completed acceptance trials at Pittwater.

Lt. Cmdr. John Sutherland, who command s MWT 16, said RAN’s joint commitment to training with Defence Science and Technology Group (DSTG) and industry partners such as the Australian Maritime College, is bolstering the team’s capacity to hit the Initial Operating Capability milestone.

“We’ve been working with partners to upskill our people in the operation of AUV technology and provide them with invaluable underpinning AUV knowledge required to execute activities,” Sutherland said.

According to Sutherland, the new autonomous and unmanned technologies will allow the RAN to search for, classify, identify and dispose of sea mines more safely and efficiently and limit the danger factor presented when personnel are directly involving in mine removal and destruction. “There’s a lot of training, testing and trialing involved, but we’re all aware of the significance of this new generation of technology, the team are making an important contribution to Navy’s leading-edge capability and mission to fight and win at sea.”

“We’ve conducted several rounds of training in operations and maintenance for Thales and RAN operators,” said Rogers. “Our modular systems allow operators to replace components themselves which increases operational availability.”

Advantages for naval applications of autonomous platforms and systems are many. But deciding which systems to use, and how to share the capabilities between men and machines, can be daunting. This is especially true in the area of naval mine warfare. The more machines can do, while keeping Sailors safely out of a minefield, the better. But the technology is still evolving. For the RAN, the move towards autonomous MCM is being conducted with a modest and incremental low-risk approach.

Cmdr. Parker, the SEA 1778 PH I program manager, said Phase I will be a learning experience. “It’s a small buy so we can test the water, form our concepts, understand our rate of effort the workforce requirement, conduct the integration, and springboard into the strategy.”

“In the modern warfare space, the speed and multiplicity of what will be occurring, such as swarms and counter swarms, means it’s going to be a busy place. And that busy place may rise to what is beyond human capability in many of these terms,” said Cmdr. Paul Hornsby, the Navy lead for Autonomous Warfare Systems, which includes the platforms, payloads, people and doctrine for the RAN.

“Technology is changing so quickly, and we don’t want to commit to a great deal of investment and buy enough systems to last us 30 years when the technology will be obsolete in three years,” said Hornsby.

“That’s why we want to buy small, and buy often,” Hornsby said.





Scouting with the Bluefin-12

Testing conducted for the Royal Australian Navy’s SEA 1778 Phase I deployable mine warfare system has been very revealing.

Cmdr. Paul Hornsby is the RAN lead for Autonomous Warfare Systems and is responsible for SEA 1778 PH I, the RAN’s new deployable mine warfare system. Hornsby said Australia has harsh conditions – strong currents and dynamic sea floor conditions—which is especially challenging in mine warfare. “We need systems optimized for our requirement,”

SEA 1778 PH I uses the General Dynamics Mission Systems Bluefin Robotics Bluefin-9 and Bluefin-12 unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) with Sonardyne Solstice multi-aperture sonar to find mines. “We’ve tested the Bluefin vehicle with the RAN up in Pittwater, an area to the north of Sydney on the Hawkesbury River, and we’ve had tremendous success,” said Troy Stephen, the director of the Underwater Systems Business for Thales Australia, which is the prime contractor for SEA 1778 PH i. “We used the Bluefin to map the bottom, and we found wrecks that nobody knew about.”

Additional testing was conducted in November 2019 by General Dynamics Mission Systems Bluefin Robotics conducting sea trials of a Bluefin-12 UUV near their facility in Quincy, Massachusetts, captured detailed images of a Navy ship, USS YF-415, lost during World War II. The 132’-foot YF-415 with a crew of 31 was carrying explosives from the Naval Ammunition Depot in Hingham, Mass., on May 10, 1944, when an accidental ignition occurred. The ship was lost with 17 of her crew killed or missing.

“In addition to the shipwrecks our Bluefin UUVs found in Australia, our Bluefin-12 UUV captured detailed images of the USS YF-415 shipwreck during sea trials off the coast near Boston,” said Andy Rogers, vice president of undersea systems at General Dynamics Mission Systems. “Technology advancements for both autonomous underwater vehicles and sensors are allowing new and more detailed surveying of the sea floor in challenging environments. We are better able to locate and image sunken ships, and provide details that can solve mysteries about what happened to them.”

The industrial revolution is also impacting the space sector. Today's investments in innovation will generate wealth in the future, as a driver of R&D and new production processes. Just as cyberspace transformed the world at the beginning of the third millennium, space is destined to change the future.

Beginning with Space 1.0 and people’s timeless curiosity about the Sun, Moon and stars, we then moved to Space 2.0 and actual rocket technology, culminating in the race to the Moon in the 1960s. Space 3.0 emerged in the 1990s as we established a permanent presence in space, with the International Space Station bringing together the United States, Europe, Russia, Canada and Japan.

Today, we are looking at Space 4.0, based on new space applications that could unveil hitherto unknown businesses that will disrupt our economy and drive global growth.

The current situation, with many businesses worldwide virtually shut down for several months, is unique. While most countries are slowly ramping-up their activities (and some never stopped), there is no doubt that the impact of the shutdown on business and behavior will be deep and long-lasting.

How is industry, and more specifically the space industry, coping with this unprecedented crisis?

The crucial role of additive manufacturing and robotization

There has been a host of innovations in recent years, including additive manufacturing, augmented and virtual reality, connected objects, and the introduction of robots and cobots (collaborative robots, working with humans). Because of the well-know advantages of cobots, they’re spreading like wildfire: according to Market Data Forecast, for example, the global market for these devices is set to grow from $981 million in 2019 to $7.161 billion in 2025 – giving a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over 40%.

Thales Alenia Space is at the forefront of these trends, with Factory 4.0 solutions such as the SAPHIR robotic assembly system in Cannes (France), CRATOS (Collaborative Robot Addressed To Operative Solutions) in L’Aquila (Italy) and the center of excellence for automated production in Belgium. At Thales Alenia Space, innovation is an integral part of our DNA.

To see how Thales Alenia Space managed to ensure operational continuity on certain programs during the #Covid19 crisis, check out the SOLAR robotic system video.

A Space 4.0 trailblazer

Up to a few short years ago, space was synonymous with government spending: the high costs and risks involved made the sector generally inaccessible to private players. Today, major technology advances and a new entrepreneurial spirit are rapidly shaping a new space economy. We are seeing the emergence of private companies that discern unrivaled commercial opportunities in space exploration and exploitation thanks to disruptive technologies and the data revolution.

At Thales Alenia Space, additive manufacturing, virtual and augmented reality, cloud, big data, artificial intelligence, robotics, cobotics, TWIN-X, SOLAR, COLROBOT and digital twins are part of our comprehensive strategic approach, leveraging innovation and digital technology to shape the factory of the future. Reflecting the company's digital transformation, this Factory 4.0 approach is designed to make the latest technologies an integral part of our production processes."

Western Sydney based SME, Baker & Provan has partnered with Thales to manufacture Modular Cylindrical Array (MCA) frames, ready for use on Royal Australian Navy Collins Class submarines.

Located in St Mary’s, approximately 40 kilometres west of Sydney’s CBD, Baker & Provan was established in 1946 by two returning WWII veterans, Arthur Baker and Don Provan. The friends purchased an optical profile grinder and started business as proficient toolmakers.

By 1975 the business had shifted its focus from toolmaking to Computer Numerical Control (CNC) and conventional machining, fabrication, project work and machine building, increasing their client list substantially in the process. Looking to future proof the business, Baker and Provan continued to achieve quality accreditation and International Organisation for Standardisation certification, ensuring it could work on ever more complex and diverse projects.

In 1989 Baker & Provan, which was now fully owned by the Baker family after Don Provan moved into farming, began its first of many contracts with Defence, and the defence industry, with a heavy focus on Navy. Less than a decade later in 1998 it partnered up with Thales to provide non-magnetic cranes for the Huon class minehunter coastal (MHC) ships and then branched out further to support projects on both the ANZAC and FFG vessels. It then cemented itself as a quality manufacturer within the maritime space by producing the control surface and hydroplane shafts for the Collins Class submarines.

“While we serve a range of sectors from rail to mining, we’re no strangers to Defence and Defence Projects account for a large part of our business,” says Business Development Manager at Baker & Provan Malcolm Cazier. “And we’re definitely no stranger to Thales. It’s fantastic to be working on such an important project together again.”

Director Regional Procurement Centre at Thales, Michelle Richard, said that when Thales went looking for potential suppliers as part of the SEA1439 upgrades to Collins Class, there was a perception that Australian suppliers didn’t have the capability to produce the MCA frames.

“Baker & Provan proved that theory wrong,” Michelle says. “They were put through a robust vetting process and not only came out more cost effective than overseas suppliers, their product was also in many ways superior. They are also helping contribute sovereign industrial capability on a key Underwater Systems program.”

Cazier says that the core values at the heart of Baker & Provan is what keeps the business moving forwards and has it succeeding on projects like the MCA frames for Thales.

“We value teamwork, passion, honesty, accountability and of course, safety here,” he notes. “And we are committed to providing quality training to our apprentices and tradespeople. We’ve got sixty-five staff and we value each and every one of them.”

To date, over seventy apprentices have gained their trades at Baker & Provan since it opened its doors, and it even has a dedicated area set for its apprentices to train in.

“We take training very seriously,” he says. “It’s beneficial to everyone to keep these trades alive, and with more projects like this one with Thales, it all helps to build that strong, diverse workforce of the future.”

Troy Stephen, Director Underwater Systems at Thales said it was important to select a supplier that Thales could trust.

“The Collins Project is an extremely important project for Thales and we wanted a partner we could rely on for the manufacture of this highly complex component.”

With the first of the frames successfully passing final dimensional checking, manufacture of the following sets is now underway.

Gareth Williams, on why it’s time to hurry up and slow down

We’re well on the way to Industry 4.0, and digital transformation is coming whether you’re ready or not. The bad news is you’re going to have to make some of it up along the way.

Digital transformation is not just another IT project. You can’t just throw money at it. This is less about technology and more about a step change in enterprise culture. So the first thing to do if you’re racing towards Industry 4.0, is slow down and do a sanity check.

Digital transformation requires the acquisition of relatively new technology to enable things like artificial intelligence, machine learning, and robotic process automation. And then you’ll have to connect it all up and take people out of the loop. Because if you don’t, you'll be stuck with the same interfaces and human-based processes that you have today.

Security first, last and always

Let’s be clear about this: you will be attacked many times on many levels. We know that large enterprises already experience literally thousands of security events every month. Most can be defeated. A few have the potential to develop into something more. That’s today. Whenever you connect more kit you connect more risk.

One of the first and most important steps on your journey to digital transformation, then, is to think about how you're going to defend thousands of new interfaces and data points. That could be a challenge. Perhaps the simplest way to protect your organisation in this strange new world is to engage the services of a security provider which (if you can find one) is familiar with the vagaries of your particular industry.

You also need resilience. If a successful attack or some other catastrophe happens, you need to be able to continue with minimum disruption. Detect, isolate, repair, recover and, above all, carry on without interrupting the business of the day. That, too, will probably need third party expertise.

Talks, testimonials and testing

Although there is no shortage of potential digital transformation partners out there, none have the expertise (or tech) in every sector to make it happen. Sure, some of the technology can migrate and adapt but the bottom line is that you know your business and they know theirs. It’s not exactly the blind leading the blind, but there could be gaps which you ignore at your peril.

There are many high-quality seminars and conferences on digital transformation at the moment. You need to attend some. Start networking with your peers in other companies, even (perhaps, especially) if they are competitors. Find out which suppliers are most respected in your industry sector. Start conversations. Keep an open mind.

When you’ve whittled down the list of potentials to one which has the resources, skills and sector-specific experience you need, consider running a proof of concept. Choose a small project. Agree the limits and outcomes, match their spend with yours, and work to see what can be achieved. Accenture, Tata, Williams, and other famous names have all benefited from such collaborative experiments.

Not only is this a comparatively inexpensive entrance but it lets you see if each other’s teams and cultures are compatible. They talk the talk, but can they walk the walk? Discovering this at an early stage will save you lots of sleepless nights.

Bottom line? Start now, but be thorough and go slowly. There is no doubt that Industry 4.0 is on the way. And it’s coming whether you’re ready or not.

Recycled Germanium a 'Gold Mine' for Local Charities - Thales,"Fri, 05 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi91bml0ZWQta2luZ2RvbS9uZXdzL3JlY3ljbGVkLWdlcm1hbml1bS1nb2xkLW1pbmUtbG9jYWwtY2hhcml0aWVz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Recycled Germanium a ‘Gold Mine’ for Local Charities Covid-19 3d printing ventilator challenge Share this article



LinkedIn

During the COVID 19 pandemic people across Thales and the UK are doing what they can to help those most affected. However, because of the keen eye and knowledge of one Thales employee in Glasgow a few local charities are getting a little extra boost and it is all down to recycling.

Kyle Gardner, Integration and Testing Manager

Kyle Gardner, a Thales Integration and Testing Manager, found himself looking at a pile of no-longer-required optical equipment and realised that he may be sat on a ‘gold mine’, or rather a germanium mine.

“Having worked in the optical test department at Thales for ten years I know the cost of ‘buying-in’ Germanium lenses”, said Kyle. “Knowing this, I came across a small amount of the material while cleaning out a lab cupboard”, he continues, “and wondered if we could sell this material back to suppliers to raise money for charity, as we currently do for our common metal scrap”. After some internet searching and a few dead ends Kyle found a buyer of germanium based in England.

Germanium is the material used in making lenses for thermal imaging cameras, night vision, and hot-spot detection cameras because it is transparent in the infrared wavelengths. Germanium has been used in this way for over 40 years during which time Thales have been at the forefront of optical technology. As long ago as the 1970’s the Thales Glasgow sight was putting Thermal Imaging cameras into the CVRT for the British Army, followed quickly in 1983 by the TOGS 1 TI sight on the Challenger 1 main battle tank.

So while others across Thales were doing everything from contributing to the Ventilator Challenge UK Consortium, 3D printing PPE visors for the NHS, providing cyber security to the NHS in Wales, as well as finding ways to continue to deliver to the UK MoD and our customers whilst observing new, strict rules and regulations, Kyle Gardner was starting the process of recycling a pile of old germanium lenses.

“It is a story of ultimate recycling”, observes Steve Lockley, Manager of the Optics business in Glasgow, “optical sights sometimes come back to Glasgow for repair, and on occasion they are unfortunately irreparable”.

Kyle closed the deal with a company who could use the germanium in the Solar Panel Market and got to work packaging up the scrap. “They bought the lenses, removed the coatings, and then re-smelted the material to sell on”, explains Kyle, “this resulted in our ‘scrap’ being completely transformed”. The resulting germanium was valued at an incredible £12,500.

Ready for recycling

Straight away £2,500 was given to Ronald McDonald House which is situated just at the end of Linthouse Road, the location of the Thales Glasgow site. For the remaining £10,000, Thales consulted its local constituency MP, Chris Stephens, and on his advice it was given to ‘Feeding Britain’, a Citizen Supermarket, also based in Govan, Glasgow. Andrew Forsey of Feeding Britain said: “We are incredibly grateful for [Thales’s] generous support which will go a long way towards the development of our next Citizens' Supermarket, in Glasgow South West”.

“It’s fantastic to see this money being spent locally”, says Kyle, “giving something back to the community where we work. Ronald McDonald house is directly opposite the factory and most of us drive past it every day”, he continues, smiling, “it’s great to be able to drive past now and know we have helped them a little, supporting the amazing work they do for the families of sick children”.

Steve Lockley concludes; “I am just so proud that the forward thinking of one person in our organisation could result in such a fantastic charitable donation”, and all thanks to some scrap germanium and the inquisitive mind of one Thales employee.

As the Covid-19 pandemic continues to spread, Thales employees are fully mobilised in the battle to overcome the virus and deal with its consequences.

The AU$1.1 billion agreement provides surety of supply of key munitions and components for the Australian Defence Force (ADF).

Australian defense minister Linda Reynolds said the announcement means the manufacturing sector can retain local skills and expertise.

“This agreement with Thales Australia will continue to maintain a safe and compliant operation, and increase our domestic capacity to manufacture key munitions in support of ADF operations,” Reynolds said.

“Mulwala and its sister facility in Benalla are the home of munitions manufacturing in Australia, generating vital job opportunities in regional New South Wales and Victoria.

“We’ve developed and implemented a plan to grow munitions and small arms capability in Australia, as one of our sovereign industrial capability priorities,” Australian defense industry minister Price said.

“It’s about identifying critical capabilities for the ADF, strengthening our defence industry, and creating new opportunities.”

The new agreement underpins the renewed strategy of multi-tenancy at the Benalla and Mulwala factories and ensures access and support to other companies, particularly small to medium enterprises for munitions manufacturing.

Thales added that this contract would enable it to secure more than AUD 450 million in export and non-ADF orders over the coming 10 years."

Damen is the main contractor for this complex project which it is undertaking, together with partners Blohm+Voss and Thales, in Germany.

The combination of companies was previously declared the winner of a European tender; the largest in the history of the German Navy. On June 17, the necessary financial resources were released by the German Bundestag budget committee. The contract marks the start of the design and construction phase.

The four frigates are scheduled to be delivered between 2027 and 2031 for an amount of approximately 4.6 billion euros. There is also an option to supply two additional frigates after 2032.

Approximately 80% of the project investment remains in Germany. The vessels will be built at Blohm+Voss in Hamburg, but partly also at other shipyard locations in Germany, including Bremen, Kiel and Wolgast. Besides this, approximately 100 small- and medium-sized companies from the maritime industry, mechanical engineering and plant construction sectors from almost all German states will be involved in the implementation.

Hein van Ameijden, Managing Director Damen Schelde Naval Shipbuilding, said, “I am convinced that with the MKS-180 project, we are building a high-quality frigate that meets all the wishes of the German Navy. It is a German-Dutch project. We are already working well with our partners in Germany; Luerssen, Blohm+Voss, and Thales. The project also offers prospects for further European cooperation. The many years of cooperation between Damen and Thales as part of the Dutch golden ecosystem is an important factor in this success. If the Netherlands continues to invest in innovative projects for its own navy, we can further expand our role within European naval construction. That’s good for the Netherlands’ strategic role, which fits in with the Defense Industry Strategy.”

The German added value and knowledge development also apply to Thales’s mission systems acquired within the project. Approximately 70% is supplied by Thales’s German branches in Kiel and Wilhelmshaven in cooperation with numerous subcontractors.

Gerben Edelijn, CEO of Thales Netherlands, said, “This historic contract for both the German Navy and Thales is a significant milestone in more than 50 years of cooperation, and confirms our worldwide leading position in the field of high-end naval mission systems. The women and men on board of these innovative frigates can rely on the latest technologies in the field of cyber defense, radar and fire control. The AWWS system, developed for the Netherlands and Belgian Navies, will soon also enable the German Navy to withstand threats of today and the coming decades.”"

Pascal Di Girolamo, Marketing Director at Thales DIS (Digital Identity and Security), Mobile, spoke to Mobile World Live (MWL) about how the solution is set to drive the market’s wider evolution.

Thales is the world’s number one provider of eSIM subscription management solutions, with more than 200 platforms deployed. Thales offers a complete portfolio of field proven solutions, from hardware eSIMs, adapted to each type of device, to servers.

MWL: Can you explain the benefits of using the eSIM Generic Voucher for Mobile Network Operators (MNOs)?

Pascal Di Girolamo (PDG): For eSIM, we identified many different enrolment methods. This could be through digital or physical vouchers, in addition to GSMA Discovery Services and mobile carrier application for instance.

We were aware that, for the time being, the main enrolment method for MNOs was the QR code. The QR code is already successful. So, we decided to design a new concept that could furthermore ease deployment of such solutions and identify a new way to reach the customer.

MNOs are still keen on traditional methods, such as a QR code, but here we are finding different ways to create and publish it. Today, when there is a QR code, MNOs may have to manage the process. Indeed, a QR code is traditionally associated to one eSIM subscription. In this case MNOs have to pre-provision the code, provision the platform and produce a certain number of QR codes that correspond to different subscriptions.

With a generic QR code, they can associate one QR code to a pool of eSIM subscriptions. This is a way for the MNOs to manage the logistics of the process, while promoting and pushing it to their customers much more easily and massively. For example, you could be in the street with no intention of going to a MNO’s kiosk or an agency to buy a subscription for a QR code to use on an eSIM capable device. However, you could see a promotion on a poster, or any other support like a newspaper or a digital screen, scan the QR code and get an eSIM subscription instantly.

Thales Generic Voucher suite of solutions offer our customers (MNOs) the flexibility to create generic QR codes for their segments and manage marketing campaign lifecycles.

With the eSIM Generic Voucher, MNOs are able to increase their customer reach, as they can onboard and enroll more easily than before.

Our solution is also adapted for seamless cross-selling activities. Indeed, with the publication of QR codes, it offers MNOs new business opportunities with third party partners. For example, hotel companies, travel companies and so on, who would advertise the MNO’s service, would also be able to push the generic QR Code.

Our solution streamlines customer acquisition costs with a more cost-effective and efficient method of reaching new customers and managing their subscriptions.

MWL: Why would consumers use solutions like this over traditional methods when roaming?

PDG: The ease of using such a solution when travelling is a huge selling point. Our customers, the MNOs, see a major advantage in promoting the generic QR code at airports, for instance, with inbound travellers looking for roaming options. When a customer arrives in a country, instead of going to a kiosk to buy a local pre-paid SIM, they could simply use a poster. A poster from a local MNO could contain a QR code which could immediately be scanned to download an eSIM subscription that meets your needs. Other options would be the purchase of prepaid subscriptions from home. Indeed, rather than purchasing prepaid eSIM subscriptions when abroad, customers can instead buy prepaid eSIM subscriptions in their home country, scanning a QR code from the MNO’s web portal.

In any cases the solution is based on a local subscription in the destination country, thereby avoiding premium charges. Compared to traditional methods, this innovative eSIM offer provides a smarter and more convenient way to stay connected while traveling.

MWL: How can enterprises tap into this type of solution? What are the benefits for global companies?

PDG: For enterprises, the major use case lies with addressing their employee’s needs, offering a common subscription across their workforce. Today, many organisations have to manage a large stock of subscriptions, which means heavy logistics and higher costs.

We know this solution is much more cost-effective. For employers that supply eSIM capable devices, they can serve their employees with a single QR code – very easy to create and generate. Of course, employers can then add security controls such as a confirmation code

We know there is interest in the generic QR code. Analysts forecast high ramp-up of eSIM capable devices within 2 years, therefore many employers will equip their employees, as part of their renewal policy, with eSIM capable devices. Some customers are already preparing for this, and we are engaging with them.

MWL: How does the family bundle work and why was this an important addition to the service?

PDG: As with enterprises, when you define a certain QR code, you associate a profile type to that code. This approach is similar for a family bundle. We already know that MNOs offer a bundle for family subscriptions, and this concept is very similar.

Our customers want a tool, integrated with the Thales Generic Voucher tool, to create a bundle of subscriptions for a family. This family bundle associates one QR code with multiple subscriptions. For the time being, all subscriptions are identical and they have to provision the code with the right profile packages, that correspond to a set of bundles. This is the initial phase. Once the processes are ready and we have the generic QR code for that bundle, it can be pushed out via the MNO web portal or even via email, leaving the consumers to log in. They can then scan the QR code on compatible devices.

MWL: How can the eSIM Generic Voucher solution provide a boost for the eSIM market as a whole?

PDG: We think that eSIM Generic Voucher is one enrolment method that can contribute to boosting the eSIM market, if MNOs take the decision to promote it. With our Generic Voucher suite of solutions, we can give them all the tools, through partnerships and introducing third party partners.

We think the Generic Voucher is an easy way to reach the end user who wants to get an eSIM subscription. It’s also easy to use and can contribute to a good conversion rate, acquire new customers and maintain a customer base. This includes providing multiple subscriptions on a handset, a new source of revenue, new acquisitions of customers and service revenue.

In addition, initial digital enrolment can be completed with Thales Trusted Digital ID Service Platform, comprising Digital ID verification, including biometrics, in line with relevant ID verification regulations.

MWL: How do you believe the eSIM market will evolve as uptake increases?

PDG: All industry players must collaborate to its evolution. We know it will be a success. The question is when, and at what rate, will the penetration of eSIM increase? The Generic Voucher solution is a good example of boosting the usage of eSIM.

We also have to consider the strategy of OEMs and MNO players. For sure, we expect device manufacturers like Apple, Samsung, Google, Motorola, Huawei and the other Chinese players to position themselves with eSIM capable devices.

This will democratise and increase the volume of eSIM usage. We also need to continue to inform our customers that these solutions and promotions are available. MNOs need to be visible with eSIM promotions without any fear of churn, but on the contrary, to acquire new customers and offer new services.

With digitisation and new processes, we are also looking at growth through the IoT market, further supported by the growth of 5G networks. IoT has multiple segments, which all can use eSIM technology and this could dramatically increase volume.

We are looking at a billion eSIM deployments in the market within three to four years.

Delivering critical medical supplies in the Scottish Highlands - Thales,"Tue, 23 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi91bml0ZWQta2luZ2RvbS9uZXdzL2RlbGl2ZXJpbmctY3JpdGljYWwtbWVkaWNhbC1zdXBwbGllcy1zY290dGlzaC1oaWdobGFuZHPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Delivering critical medical supplies in the Scottish Highlands Covid-19 Soarizon Drones Share this article



LinkedIn

In May 2020, with the world in the grips of the global COVID 19 pandemic, the SOARIZON by Thales team was working in partnership with drone deliveries provider Skyports, on a ground-breaking, first of a kind, medical drone delivery trial.

Based in the Scottish Highlands, at Oban & Islands General Hospital, the trial’s main aim was to prove the feasibility of a drone delivery service transporting critical medical cargo (in this case, COVID-19 test kits and PPE) between the hospital and a remote community hospital on the Isle of Mull.

The 17km journey between the two medical facilities, which usually takes place by road transport and ferry, can take up to six hours and is undertaken two or three times per week. We proved that, by drone, the journey takes just 15 minutes and could be flown multiple times per day, with an on-demand service.

A service like this could be hugely beneficial for NHS patients in more isolated areas, for whom the drastic cut in delivery speed could improve waiting times and lead to quicker diagnosis or treatment. Drones would also provide huge benefits to NHS medical staff, who could rely on supplies and samples arriving far more quickly.

What’s next for drone deliveries in the UK?

While there’s been much media enthusiasm about drone deliveries in recent months and years, with large retailers like Amazon still taking aim at the market, the real acceleration is likely to be in the medical delivery space first.

With its rural communities scattered across a large geographical area, the west coast of Scotland is the ideal proving ground for drone delivery services, but this technology has potential to help on a far larger scale.

""This technology can have huge benefits, not only in the west coast of Scotland, but many places around Europe and the world, in those under-served places where transportation is hard. Where there's friction moving goods, because of geography or topography, (…) speed of delivery can have really life-saving consequences""

Duncan Walker, CEO, Skyports

With a number of UK medical drone delivery trials accelerated during the COVID 19 pandemic, both in the Scottish Highlands and the Isle of Wight, it will now be up to industry and regulators to work together to define a safe and scalable framework for this type of activity.

The Civil Aviation Authority’s regulatory sandbox is likely to play a large part in this, empowering industry partners to come together to collaborate, innovate and test projects, including Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLoS) operations, before working to commercialise on a larger scale.

“Drones are having significant strategic impacts globally, and the NHS and other Government organisations supporting nations can benefit greatly from this emerging technology.""

""This trial has proven tangible, real-world, value to the NHS, during its most challenging time in living memory. We have proven that by working collaboratively with the Government and Regulator that BVLOS drone services can be conducted in a safe and secure method and applied to time-critical use-cases across a number of sectors. We are looking forward to continuing to develop the service and capability to define future service.”

Karim Cosslett, Head of Growth, SOARIZON by Thales

Now that the inital trial has been successfully completed, the team will continue to work closely with the CAA and the NHS to make services available in Scotland and across the UK to provide access to this innovative technology to a wide range of organisations, in particular a number of other NHS Boards and Trusts.

Feel free to reach out to us if you would like to know more or find out how we can support your organisation in similar ways."

The Martlet missile – the Wildcat helicopter gets its claws - Navy Lookout,"Mon, 15 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdnlsb29rb3V0LmNvbS90aGUtbWFydGxldC1taXNzaWxlLXdpbGRjYXQtaGVsaWNvcHRlci1nZXRzLWl0cy1jbGF3cy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In May 2020 the first successful firings of the Martlet (Lightweight Multi-role Missile) were made from a Wildcat helicopter. Are we look at the development of this weapon and the new airborne anti-surface capability this will give the Royal Navy.



Background

In response to the growing threat from manned and unmanned small craft swarms, especially in the Arabian Gulf, the RN issued a requirement for the Future Anti Surface Guided Weapon(Light) (FASGW(L)) in 2008. This was part of the programme to replace the Sea Skua light anti-ship missile in service with the Lynx helicopter (1982-2017). The FASGW(H) (Heavy) requirement is being met by the Anglo-French Sea Venom missile manufactured by MBDA (which we will examine in a future article).

Thales first made their Lightweight Multi-role Missile concept public in 2007 and was well placed when it was selected to meet the FASGW(L) requirement. The LMM is based on the airframe of the Starburst MANPAD missile, formerly used by the British Army. Startreak has subsequently replaced Starbust in Army service and much of the technology of the newer missile has also been incorporated.

In April 2011 Thales was awarded an initial production contract by the MoD to develop a laser beam-riding version of the LMM. The initial test-firing demonstration took place in 2014 and a second £48 million contract was placed for the manufacture of 1,000 missiles. Thales’ Belfast plant produces the weapon which has sustained at least 60 jobs. Doubtless, many people have worked hard on the project but it will have taken over 10 years to get this relatively simple and already-developed weapon to the front line.

Despite its purchase primarily for airborne use, Martlet was first tested at sea by the RN mounted on a modified 30mm canon. In June 2019 a successful trial was carried out on board HMS Sutherland but to date, there has been no official confirmation about whether the shipboard mounts will go into operational service.



The first live firing of the Martlet was conducted at the Manorbier Range in Pembrokeshire during ground trials in March 2019. Six telemetry rounds, fully integrated with the L3 Wescam laser guidance turret were fired, hitting simulated small boat targets at about 4.5Km.

Between 27th April and 21st May 2020, the first airborne trials were made at the MoD’s Aberporth Range off the Welsh coast. The DE&S’ Lightweight and Medium Attack Systems (LMAS) Team and Wildcat Delivery Team were able to conduct the trials despite being subject to COVID-19 restrictions. The firing was recorded by high-resolution cameras mounted on the Wildcat and chase aircraft for later analysis.

Martlet is fired from a hermetically sealed pannier which can be stored for up to 15 years without maintenance. Being so light, it can be loaded by hand onto the Wildcat without specialist handling equipment. There is no launch recoil and the slim and aerodynamic body allows rapid acceleration to Mach 1.5 to reach small targets up to 8km away. The warhead consists of a dual-effect shaped charge and pre-fragmented blast warhead. One of three different fusing modes can be selected, depending on the target, either on impact, at a specific height or delayed action.

Martlet is guided using a semi-active control line of sight (SACLOS) laser beam riding. Before an engagement, the observer in the Wildcat places a laser pointer on the target using stabilised the EO camera and automatic target tracker (ATT). An Active Laser Generation Unit (ALGU) transmits a coded low-power beam from the Wescam MX-15Di turret on the nose of the Wildcat. Once launched, two receivers mounted on the missile’s tail detect the laser energy and maintain lock on the target. The system would appear to be only able to engage a single target at a time but each missile should eliminate a target within at seconds. Laser guidance is virtually immune from jamming and countermeasures. Martlet is a modular missile and could be fitted with an infrared seeker head module which would give a ‘fire and forget’ capability and increase the rate of firing. It is also possible swap out the warhead module for different kind of blast effects.

Theoretically, Martlet also has an air-air capability although avoid, rather than engage is usually the best policy for helicopters confronted with hostile aircraft. It can also potentially be used overland for ground suppression missions or to attack soft-skinned vehicles.

The weapon wing

Leonardo was awarded a £90M contract in 2014 to develop a weapon wing and then test and integrate both FASGW Light and Heavy missiles onto the Wildcat helicopter (which entered service in 2015). All 28 of the RN’s aircraft will be fitted with wiring and mounts, although the weapon wings can easily be removed when not required. It is unclear how many sets of wings will be supplied in total.

Leonardo published the first images of a basic non-aerodynamic weapon carrier design in early 2018 although it has subsequently been refined and considerably. The new aluminium and carbon-fibre composite wings generate up to 360kg of aerodynamic lift on each side of the helicopter in forward flight which helps reduce the additional drag and fuel requirement when carrying the weapons. Flight trials began on 2 July 2019 from Yeovil, initially in clean configuration and different speeds and altitude to determine effects on the aircraft’s performance.

The wing is considerably more aerodynamic than the ‘common weapon carrier’ fitted on the Lynx and has 4 hardpoints. This enables the Wildcat to carry either 20 Martlet (in four five-round panniers), 10 Martlets (in two five-round panniers) with 2 Sea Venom missiles or just 4 Sea Venoms. It remains to be seen whether the mixed armament will be carried operationally or ever be a justified tactical requirement. The attack profiles and intended targets for the weapons being very different. (The Lynx could carry a mix of Sea Skuas and Sting Ray torpedoes but this was never an operational requirement).

The Martlet lives up to its LMM name at just 13kg and a full set of 20 would be a load of around 260kg. The 120Kg Sea Venoms are a much heavier and would add 480Kg of weight if four are mounted. At high speed, the lift generated by the wing will more than offset the weight of the stores, reducing fuel use and stress on the rotor head. Inevitably the drag of external weapons will affect manoeuvrability, speed and range to some extent but Wildcat was designed from the outset with modern power-dense engines with margin for extra loads and ‘hot and high’ operating.

Tactical conundrums

When Martlet Initial Operating Capability is declared in 2021 there will still be much work to do. Sea Venom is due to enter service in early 2022 but Full Operating Capability for both elements of FASGW will not be until 2024. Development of standard operating procedures, tactical doctrine and full air and ground crew training with the new weapons will take another 3 years.

Martlet will give the RN much better capability, particularly against swarm attacks but as a new type of weapon in service, there are many questions to resolve. In high threat areas, a Martlet-armed Wildcat may be held at readiness on deck to respond to situations that could develop rapidly. For the frigates and destroyers, the embarked helicopter has a multitude of other tasks including surveillance, anti-submarine warfare and general transport duties. When the weapon wing is fitted there is no space for the pintle mount for the .50Cal M3M heavy machine gun which may be a more flexible and appropriate weapon in some circumstances. The Type 45 destroyers and Type 26 frigates will have hangar space for two Wildcats and it may make sense to have one Marlet/Sea Venom-equipped Wildcat ready for anti-surface duties backed by a second aircraft for other tasks. When operating with the Carrier Strike Group it will be interesting to see if Wildcats operate directly from the carriers or are carried by the escorts that form the defensive cordon around the carrier.

A fleet of small boats could behave apparently quite innocently, only switching to a mass attack at the last moment before a helicopter has time to get airborne. Iranian boats frequently harass or sail very close to coalition warships in the Gulf and despite being easy meat for Martlet or 30mm cannon, commanders are always working hard not to escalate this ‘grey zone’ conflict into a shooting war. While the helicopter has the advantage of speed, manoeuvrability, a good view and the ability to engage enemies at a much safer distance from the ship, the ship-mounted Martlet makes good sense as another layer of close defence. As a weapon primarily designed to counter asymmetric threats, the most challenging issue for the Martlet-armed Wildcat crew may be rules of engagement and the split-second decisions about whether to release weapons or not."
Defence signs new munitions contracts with Thales and NIOA - Australian Defence Magazine,"Tue, 30 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1c3RyYWxpYW5kZWZlbmNlLmNvbS5hdS9kZWZlbmNlL2xhbmQvZGVmZW5jZS1zaWducy1uZXctbXVuaXRpb25zLWNvbnRyYWN0cy13aXRoLXRoYWxlcy1hbmQtbmlvYdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Defence has signed a new $1.1 billion, 10-year agreement with Thales Australia for the continued management and operation of Australia’s munition factories in Benalla (Victoria) and Mulwala (NSW), and a separate 10-year contract with NIOA Munitions for a tenancy at Benalla.

According to Defence, the new agreements underpin the renewed strategy of multi-tenancy at the Benalla and Mulwala factories and ensure access and support to other companies.

Minister for Defence Linda Reynolds said that the contracts will allow both companies to work together on supplying munitions to the ADF.

“This contract will establish NIOA as a tenant alongside Thales Australia, where together they will provide opportunities for domestic manufacturing while enhancing supplies of key munitions for Defence,"" Minister Reynolds said. “It’s vital that we continue to enhance the readiness of the ADF and ensure we have the necessary sovereign depth for sustaining key capability and materiel such as the surety of supply of munitions.

“Mulwala and its sister facility in Benalla are the home of munitions manufacturing in Australia.""

Thales says the contract will allow it to secure more than $450 million in export and non-ADF orders over the coming decade.

Minister for Defence Industry Melissa Price said the Government had identified munitions and small arms as a critical capability for a sovereign defence industry.



“We’ve developed and implemented a plan to grow munitions and small arms capability in Australia, as one of our Sovereign Industrial Capability Priorities,” Minister Price said. “It’s about identifying critical capabilities for the ADF, strengthening our defence industry, and creating new opportunities.



“Thales Australia has an excellent track record of working with local small businesses and I have no doubt they’ll continue to utilise the skills and ingenuity of small businesses right around Australia.”

Minister Price also highlighted NIOA's forthcoming manufacturing facility in Maryborough, built with joint venture partner Rheinmetall Waffe Munitions.

In-depth coverage of this story will be available on Thursday in the next edition of Defence Week."

The company, which came under fire in an auditor-general’s report which said armoured vehicles similar to its Hawkei vehicle could be bought more cheaply overseas, commissioned economic analysts AlphaBeta Advisers to study payments by Thales Australia to its Australian suppliers over a three-year period.

AlphaBeta lead researcher Dr Andrew Charlton said greater understanding of the value and impact of Defence spending in the Australian economy was critical as the Government ramped up major acquisition programmes.

Charlton said: “Prime Defence contractors such as Thales are key to translating spend into effective supply chain and investment programmes because they provide a link between the Department of Defence’s investment and the many other Australian businesses in the supply chain, many of which may not be defence specialists.”

Minister for Defence Industry, the Hon Melissa Price said: “This analysis by Thales demonstrates how our investments are creating local jobs, and also building the critical defence capability we need to deliver a capable, agile Defence Force.

“We have been upfront with the prime contractors about their obligations to partner with Australian businesses, and Thales is leading by example.”

Thales has been in dispute with auditor general, Grant Hehir whose report, partially blacked out on the orders of the government, was critical of the cost of local purchases.

Thales applied for a Federal Court injunction against the national audit office over the report.

Thales Australia CEO Chris Jenkins said there was a substantial jobs and economic activity benefit from spending more of the defence dollar in Australia. It delivers thousands of jobs spread through hundreds of business across the nation.

“For more than 30 years we’ve been building a whole industrial ecosystem in Australia to support the ADF and exports, and it shows in this data in the broad range of industry sectors that are part of our Australian supply chain – from metal fabrication and engineering to professional and scientific services.

“This analysis provides strong evidence in support of the Government’s policy of requiring high levels of Australian Industry Capability (AIC) in its acquisition and sustainment programmes.

“In our case, the areas where we deliver Sovereign Industry Capability – notably Munitions and Small Arms, Protected Vehicles and Maritime support – are where the greatest benefit accrues to our Australian supply chain.”

Baker & Provan was established in 1946 by two returning Second World War veterans, Arthur Baker and Don Provan – the friends purchased an optical profile grinder and started business as proficient toolmakers.

In 1989 Baker & Provan, which was now fully owned by the Baker family after Provan moved into farming, began its first of many contracts with Defence, and the defence industry, with a heavy focus on Navy.

============== ==============

Less than a decade later in 1998 it partnered up with Thales to provide non-magnetic cranes for the Huon Class minehunter coastal (MHC) ships and then branched out further to support projects on both the Anzac and FFG vessels.

The company then cemented itself as a quality manufacturer within the maritime space by producing the control surface and hydroplane shafts for the Collins Class submarines.

1

Business development manager at Baker & Provan Malcolm Cazier explained, ""While we serve a range of sectors from rail to mining, we’re no strangers to Defence and Defence projects account for a large part of our business.""

Director regional procurement centre at Thales, Michelle Richard, said that when Thales went looking for potential suppliers as part of the SEA 1439 upgrades to Collins Class, there was a perception that Australian suppliers didn’t have the capability to produce the MCA frames.

""Baker & Provan proved that theory wrong. They were put through a robust vetting process and not only came out more cost effective than overseas suppliers, their product was also in many ways superior. They are also helping contribute sovereign industrial capability on a key underwater systems program,"" Richard explained.

Expanding on this, Crazier added that the core values at the heart of Baker & Provan is what keeps the business moving forwards and has it succeeding on projects like the MCA frames for Thales.

""We value teamwork, passion, honesty, accountability and, of course, safety here. We are committed to providing quality training to our apprentices and tradespeople. We’ve got 65 staff and we value each and every one of them,"" Crazier said.

Troy Stephen, director underwater systems at Thales, said it was important to select a supplier that Thales could trust, saying, ""The Collins Project is an extremely important project for Thales and we wanted a partner we could rely on for the manufacture of this highly complex component.""

With the first of the frames successfully passing final dimensional checking, manufacture of the following sets is now underway.

Scheduled upgrades, in particular to the combat, weapon, sonar and communications systems, maintain Collins' capability edge. Combat and weapon system upgrades were completed and the project closed in February 2019. Project SEA 1439 Phases 5B1 and 5B2 deliver communications upgrades, while SEA 1439 Phase 6 will deliver sonar upgrades.

Key industry partners for the Collins Class include:

ASC;

Raytheon Australia;

Thales;

BAE Systems;

Pacific Marine Batteries; and

James Fisher Australia (escape and rescue).

SEA 1439 Phase 6 will deliver a sonar capability assurance program for the Collins Class submarines. Tranche 1 will deliver high priority upgrades to sonar sensors, including the bow mounted cylindrical array and flank arrays, and related signal processing and display electronics.

Tranche 2 will deliver further sonar capability upgrades and an ongoing sonar capability assurance (OSCA) program."

Why do we Still Believe Myths around Solar Eclipses? - NewsClick,"Mon, 22 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3NjbGljay5pbi9TdGlsbC1CZWxpZXZlLU15dGhzLWFyb3VuZC1Tb2xhci1FY2xpcHNlc9IBRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3NjbGljay5pbi9TdGlsbC1CZWxpZXZlLU15dGhzLWFyb3VuZC1Tb2xhci1FY2xpcHNlcz9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Days and nights, full moons and new moons, summers and winters—everything we witness pertains to the movement of the Earth, the Moon and other celestial bodies. Solar and Lunar Eclipses also arise out of the same celestial phenomenon, with humans not having any control over it.

Even before history was penned down, humans witnessed eclipses and had obsolete ideas about them. Unfortunately, many of them are still pervasive, even when detailed explanations arising out of the scientific understanding of the physical world are readily available.

‘Battle of Eclipse’ and Busting of the Myth:

The first ever recorded prediction of a Solar Eclipse can be traced back to the sixth century, when Thales of Miletus, the pre-Socratic Greek mathematician and philosopher, predicted a solar eclipse. The eclipse became the reason for the end of a 15-year long war which eventually came to be known as the “Battle of the Eclipse”. On May 28, 585 BC, the battle fought between the Medes of Central Asia and the Lydians, on the bank of the river Halys, now in Central Turkey, was abruptly brought to an end when day suddenly turned into night. It was thought that Gods had grown angry due to their fight. The two sides stopped fighting and peace was thus restored in the troubled area.

Greek historian Herodotus wrote about the incident and claimed that Thales could have predicted the solar eclipse. Unfortunately, the method that Thales of Miletus used for his calculations is not known till date. However, the Greeks celebrate it as one of their scientific and mathematical advancements of ancient times.

What is important is that Thales broke obsolete mythological ideas associated with eclipses. Thales’s calculation and predictions are now thought to have heralded a new beginning, the beginning of a belief that nature can be unpacked by human intellect.

Edmund Halley, the astronomer who predicted the periodicity of the comet Halley, which was then named after him, used Newton’s laws of gravity for the precise prediction of the return of the comet in 1758. He could not live to see it again. Halley predicted a solar eclipse in 1715, using the same laws.

Einstein’s theory of gravity – in which he stated that gravity is not merely the pulling of the objects by the sun, as theorised in Newtonian philosophy, but that the sun bends the curvature of space in the same fashion that a heavy object does a trampoline. Going by his theory, light emerging from other stars that passes by the sun would bend twice as much as the Newtonian theory had earlier predicted. The testing of Einstein’s theory also took the help of a total solar eclipse in the year 1919. Astronomer Edmund Ellington and his team assessed data obtained from the solar eclipse and the results were published in The New York Times. Einstein’s general theory of relativity got primary validation, and was followed by worldwide fame.

Still-Pervasive Myths and their Realities:

Even school text books taught us how a solar eclipse occurs. A quick recollection of those texts will help us remember that a solar eclipse happens, when, in their course of continuous motion, the moon comes in between the Sun and Earth.

One of fervent beliefs is that a total solar eclipse brings harmful rays with it. The sun emits light due to the nuclear fusion in it. At the time of a solar eclipse, the moon comes in between the sun and the earth, thus obstructing light from the sun. Neither the moon nor the Earth undergoes any fundamental change as a result. According to NASA—“During a total solar eclipse when the disk of the moon fully covers the sun, the brilliant corona emits only electromagnetic radiation, though sometimes with a greenish hue. Scientists have studied this radiation for centuries. Being a million times fainter than the light from the sun itself, there is nothing in the coronal light that could cross 150 million kilometers of space, penetrate our dense atmosphere, and cause blindness. However, if you watched the sun before totality, you will catch a glimpse of the brilliant solar surface and this can cause retinal damage, though the typical human instinctual response is to quickly look away before any severe damage has actually occurred.”

Similarly, the idea that a solar eclipse will poison food and cause harm to a pregnant woman and her fetus are also widespread myths without scientific basis of any kind.

Since time immemorial, humans have attributed a natural phenomenon to either be deadly, or linked it to a mythical ghost story. There were attempts made in ancient times to bust these myths and thus lay a solid foundation for the future. Many had to pay dearly in their quest for rationality. We need to choose between claims made by obsolete mythical beliefs or the path of rationality."
UK selects ELIX-IR threat warning system for E-7 Wedgetail aircraft - UK Defence Journal,"Wed, 10 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vdWtkZWZlbmNlam91cm5hbC5vcmcudWsvdWstc2VsZWN0cy1lbGl4LWlyLXRocmVhdC13YXJuaW5nLXN5c3RlbS1mb3ItZS03LXdlZGdldGFpbC1haXJjcmFmdC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Boeing has selected Leonardo and Thales to deliver a UK sovereign Defensive Aids System (DAS) for the UK’s new fleet of five 737-based Boeing E-7 Wedgetail Airborne Early Warning aircraft.

Boeing say that their selection builds on last year’s announcement that Thales’ Elix-IR Threat Warner and Leonardo’s Defensive Aids System controller and Miysis Directed Infra-Red Counter Measure (DIRCM) had been selected to equip the RAF’s fleet of Shadow Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance aircraft.

“Air platforms are fundamental in the support of war fighting, peace-keeping, peace-enforcement, and humanitarian operations worldwide. These varied missions often present hostile and threatening conditions to the safety of the crew and passengers. In all operations, air platforms remain high value assets that present a prime target for conventional and unconventional adversaries alike.

Elix-IR is an advanced multi-function passive Threat Warning System (TWS), offering the core functionalities of a simultaneous Missile Approach Warner (MAW) and Hostile Fire Indication (HFI) solution to counter existing and future missile threats. It is suitable for use on a wide range of rotary and fixed wing platforms such as helicopters, transport aircraft, UAVs, and VIP aircraft.”

For the RAF’s Boeing Wedgetail, Thales UK, under a subcontract from Leonardo, is providing the Elix-IR Threat Warning System and Vicon XF intelligent Countermeasures Dispensing System into Leonardo’s Modular Advanced Platform Protection System (MAPPS).

The integrated Defensive Aids System is fully designed, developed, manufactured, and supported in the UK, say the firm."

The $1.1 billion agreement provides surety of supply of key munitions and components for the Australian Defence Force, and demonstrates the Morrison government’s ongoing commitment to maintaining a domestic munitions manufacturing capability.

This contract demonstrates that Australia’s sovereign defence industry is vital to delivering a capability advantage to the ADF. The continued long-term partnership between Thales and Defence reinforces the government’s commitment to maintaining a world leading, competitive and safe domestic munitions manufacturing capability in Australia.

============== ==============

Thales continues to build long-term relationships with hundreds of Australian suppliers, building Australia’s self-reliance and the capability of the broader Australian manufacturing sector.

Defence Minister Linda Reynolds said, ""It’s vital that we continue to enhance the readiness of the ADF and ensure we have the necessary sovereign depth for sustaining key capability and materiel such as the surety of supply of munitions. This agreement with Thales Australia will continue to maintain a safe and compliant operation, and increase our domestic capacity to manufacture key munitions in support of ADF operations.""

Thales’s recent supply chain study with AlphaBeta Advisers proved that there is a strong correlation between sovereign industry capability and benefits flowing to Australian suppliers.

""Mulwala and its sister facility in Benalla are the home of munitions manufacturing in Australia, generating vital job opportunities in regional New South Wales and Victoria,"" Minister Reynolds explained.

In 2019, Thales spent $113 million with its Australian suppliers for munitions and small arms, supporting 414 direct jobs in the supply chain.

Minister Reynolds added, ""This contract will establish NIOA as a tenant alongside Thales Australia, where together they will provide opportunities for domestic manufacturing while enhancing supplies of key munitions for Defence.""

Defence Industry Minister Melissa Price added, ""We’ve developed and implemented a plan to grow munitions and small arms capability in Australia, as one of our Sovereign Industrial Capability Priorities. It’s about identifying critical capabilities for the ADF, strengthening our defence industry, and creating new opportunities.""

This contract will enable Thales to secure more than $450 million in export and non-ADF orders over the coming 10 years, demonstrating Australia’s world leading munitions manufacturing capability.

""Thales Australia has an excellent track record of working with local small businesses and I have no doubt they’ll continue to utilise the skills and ingenuity of small businesses right around Australia,"" Minister Price added.

Chris Jenkins, chief executive of Thales Australia, added, ""We have worked closely with Defence to manufacture munitions for more than 20 years, using our deep technical expertise to provide urgently required munitions to the Australian Defence Force whilst on operations.""

The group has invested more than $20 million in research and development and $25 million in capital infrastructure over the last 10 years at the Benalla and Mulwala facilities and will invest further to develop new and world leading products for the Australian Defence Force.

""Everything is about trust. Especially when it comes to Defence. This historic contract with the Australian government builds on our trusted partnership with Defence for the long term supply of essential equipment,"" added Christophe Salomon, executive vice president, Thales Land and Air System.

Thales employs approximately 650 highly skilled staff between its two Australian government owned facilities in Benalla and Mulwala. It exports products to 17 countries globally.

The new agreement underpins the renewed strategy of multi-tenancy at the Benalla and Mulwala factories and ensures access and support to other companies, particularly small to medium enterprises for munitions manufacturing.

It will also support key federal government initiatives including export opportunities as part of the Defence Sovereign Industry Capability Priorities."
Ammo-box contract extended for Victorian company - CONTACT magazine,"Wed, 10 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbnRhY3RhaXJsYW5kYW5kc2VhLmNvbS8yMDIwLzA2LzEwL2FtbW8tYm94LWNvbnRyYWN0LWV4dGVuZGVkLWZvci12aWN0b3JpYW4tY29tcGFueS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A regional Victorian company that has incorporated new technologies to reuse ammunition containers has signed a $15 million contract with Defence.

Pentarch Industrial, based in Wangaratta, has been awarded a six-year contract to continue to supply, refurbish and recycle ammunition containers, which will save the Australian Defence Force from having to import new containers from overseas.

Minister for Defence Industry Melissa Price said Pentarch was a fine example of Australian ingenuity in manufacturing.

“Defence has had a long and successful relationship with Pentarch Industrial and this new contract will continue to directly support Defence capability and sustain 13 jobs in regional Victoria,” Minister Price said.

“Currently, there are over 800,000 containers in circulation used by Defence to store and transport small-arms ammunition and pyrotechnics, such as flares and countermeasures.

“The quality and condition of the ammunition containers is critical as they protect the explosive ordnance and munitions from the environment, and ensure the safety of Australian Defence Force personnel.

“Pentarch’s system enables containers to be reused, rather than Defence having to resort to importing new containers from overseas.

“The partnership with Pentarch Industrial was borne(sic) out of the Sovereign Industrial Capability Priority Industry Plan for Munitions and Small Arms Research, Design, Development and Manufacture.

“Sovereign Industrial Capability Priorities are capabilities that are critical to Defence and must be developed or supported by Australian industry.”
