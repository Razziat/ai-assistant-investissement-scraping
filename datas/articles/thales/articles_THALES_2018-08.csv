APEX Insight: Thales is celebrating the first time its AVANT in-flight entertainment system has been deployed on an Airbus A350-XWB operating in China after Sichuan Airlines took delivery of an A350-900 on August 8.

The new Airbus A350-900 delivered to Chengdu-based Sichuan Airlines on August 8 is the first aircraft of the type in China to be installed with Thales’ AVANT in-flight entertainment system.

“We support Sichuan Airlines’ ambitions to drive the highest level of passenger satisfaction as we work together to shape new opportunities to provide a truly unique experience to all travelers,” said Philippe Carette, the newly-appointed CEO of Thales InFlyt Experience.

AVANT will initially provide Sichuan Airlines passengers flying on domestic routes such as Chengdu-Beijing with a range of entertainment including recent feature films, television series, music and games. In the future, the carrier also plans to use the aircraft on international routes.

One of eight pandas featured on the aircraft’s livery is a visual representation of YouYou, a baby panda adopted by Sichuan Airlines from the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding. YouYou is the official ambassador of its Panda Route international flight development program launched by Sichuan Airlines in 2016 with the aim of enriching its domestic and international route network.

Furthermore, Sichuan Airlines has plans to carry out panda-themed flights, integrating more panda elements into its aircraft cabins and meal service to provide passengers from around the world with a cultural experience.

Equipped with the Airspace by Airbus cabin, the new A350-XWB is configured with 331 seats in total – 28 seats in business and 303 seats in economy class – and is one of three Sichuan Airlines has acquired on a long-term operating lease from AerCap. At this year’s Farnborough International Airshow, the carrier ordered a further 10 of the type directly from Airbus.

Thales is already Sichuan Airlines’ preferred business partner in avionics, providing the carrier with Flight Management Systems as well as customer support and innovative services for its A320 and A330 fleets."
"With Thales buy, Keysight becomes Australia's largest calibration and support company - RCR Wireless News","Tue, 14 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yY3J3aXJlbGVzcy5jb20vMjAxODA4MTQvdGVzdC1hbmQtbWVhc3VyZW1lbnQvd2l0aC10aGFsZXMtYnV5LWtleXNpZ2h0LWJlY29tZXMtYXVzdHJhbGlhcy1sYXJnZXN0LWNhbGlicmF0aW9uLWFuZC1zdXBwb3J0LWNvbXBhbnnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Keysight acquires Thales Calibration Services

Keysight Technologies has purchased Melbourne-based Thales Calibration Services and says the buy means that Keysight is now the largest calibration and support services organization in Australia.

Keysight said that the Thales commercial calibration facility is “the largest commercial non-electronic metrology lab in Australia servicing the defense, commercial, medical, petro-chemical, and pharmaceutical industries.” The acquisition positions Keysight to expand its local support for the Australian defense industry.

Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, but the purchase was effective July 2, the company said. The Thales purchase continues a string of services-related acquisitions that Keysight has made globally in the last few years. Keysight’s service-related acquisitions have included Primary Standards North America, U.K.-based Electroservices in 2015 and Liberty Calibration in 2017.

At Keysight’s investor day earlier this year, company executives said that it would continue to pursue “tuck-in” acquisitions that meet its standards for returns. Keysight has four primary business segments: communications solutions; electronic industrial solutions; Ixia solutions; and services solutions. Its commercial communications business is its largest source of revenue.

Keysight indicated during its investor day that it is focusing on expanding its test-related services by offering calibration services for brands other than its own, introducing Test Asset Optimization Services and stepping up its refurbished equipment sales. The company also said that it is moving from a free customer support model to one with tiered charging.

“This acquisition complements our existing electrical portfolio, creating new opportunities for Keysight to support the defense sector in Australia,” said Bor-Chun Gooi, general manager for Keysight’s Managed Services Division East, in a statement. “Now, Keysight is the largest calibration provider in Australia, offering customers a one-stop services solution provider.”"
Royal Navy receives Thales UK 2093 Wideband sonar variant - Naval Technology,"Tue, 21 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdmFsLXRlY2hub2xvZ3kuY29tL25ld3Mvcm95YWwtbmF2eS10aGFsZXMtMjA5My13aWRlYmFuZC1zb25hci_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales sonar integrated on board navy vessel. Credit: Thales Group.

The Royal Navy has accepted the delivery of Thales UK’s new and advanced 2093 Wideband variant of mine countermeasures (MCM) sonar following successful completion of intensive sea trials.

Integrated on to the UK Navy’s Sandown-class minehunters, the 2093 variable depth sonar system is the primary component of the service’s MCM capability.

Thales UK developed the upgraded 2093 Wideband variant under the 2093 Capability Sustainment Programme (CSP) for the Royal Navy.

Royal Navy Headquarters, Portsmouth mine warfare specialist lieutenant commander Kev Giles said: “The picture the sonar provides the operator is much clearer, the detection range is much greater and it should only detect physical objects, rocks, debris, mines, and not be tricked by noise.”

“The 2093 Wideband variant is a multi-frequency variable depth sonar system that has been designed to counter the threats posed by modern mines in both deep and shallow water.”

The improved variant of the sonar technology offered a significant enhancement in threat recognition capability and range of the system.

Over the past few months, the new sonar system underwent a 12-week long sea acceptance trial on the Royal Navy’s Sandown-class vessel HMS Grimsby in the BUTEC test ranges off the coast of Scotland.

Thales UK 2093 CSP project manager Nathan Noall said: “Getting the sea acceptance trials done on this ‘first of class’ ship is a huge plus.

“The trials weren’t without challenge but we’ve ultimately come up with a system that’s been accepted by the Royal Navy and 2093 CSP delivers on all they’ve asked for.”

The 2093 Wideband variant is a multi-frequency variable depth sonar system that has been designed to counter the threats posed by modern mines in both deep and shallow water.

Since it was built in the 1980s, the 2093 variable depth sonar has been used in operational service with different naval forces across the world.

The other six Sandown-class vessels are slated to be equipped with the 2093 Wideband sonar at the Royal Navy dockyard in Rosyth."
Jason Bray: from the British Army to Thales - Thales,"Tue, 07 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi91bml0ZWQta2luZ2RvbS9uZXdzL2phc29uLWJyYXktYnJpdGlzaC1hcm15LXRoYWxlc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Jason Bray, Project Manager, GTS

Jason is a Project Manager in the Ground Transportation Systems (GTS) business at Thales UK. But he wasn’t always passionate about infrastructure and London’s Underground network. Four years ago, he was a Class 2 Armourer and Physical Training Instructor in the British Army.

Leaving the army was by no means an easy decision for Jason, who says that he was “almost as nervous” on his final day serving as a member of Her Majesty’s corps of Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers as he was on day one. “The demise of my military career was out of my hands, primarily as a result of decreasing opportunities for promotion”, during a period of dramatic cuts for the UK’s armed forces.

So it was the range of career opportunities and the call to fulfil his potential outside of the forces that pulled Jason into civilian life in 2014. He joined Thales fresh out of the army, commencing a six month fixed-term contract as a Field Services Support Manager within GTS. He says that for him this “was sink or swim time” and he faced a “very steep learning curve” during the transition phase back into civilian life. This was a challenge that Jason reveled in, seeing it as an opportunity to demonstrate his potential in the Thales team. He was certainly successful, and took up a permanent position as an Assistant Project Manager at the end of his six month contract.

Jason recognises that much of his success at Thales is down to the experiences and training the British Army gave him, which has enabled him to “strive for bigger and better things.” He says he “set his sights from day one” on a project delivery role in GTS, and has built a portfolio of projects and experience that spans across the entire London Underground network.

Despite coming from a background with very little project management experience, Jason threw himself into the role and has undertook some intensive extracurricular training over the last four years. After attending a five-day ‘Passport to Bid and Project Management’ course, his mind was set on completing the Association for Project Management’s Project Management Qualification, a feat he completed successfully in November 2016.

In a four-year period, Jason has transitioned successfully from a member of the British Army to be a registered member of the International Project Management Association and Project Manager within Thales, working on a number of significant programmes with important customers like Transport for London and Network Rail. Looking back, Jason says he could never have dreamed of such a positive outcome when making the agonizing decision to ‘sign off’ from the British Army.

Jason and Thales are keeping London safe, secure and on the move."
"With Spaceflight's help, LeoStella moves ahead with Seattle-area satellite factory - GeekWire","Tue, 21 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdlZWt3aXJlLmNvbS8yMDE4L3NwYWNlZmxpZ2h0cy1oZWxwLWxlb3N0ZWxsYS1tb3Zlcy1haGVhZC1zYXRlbGxpdGUtZmFjdG9yeS1zb3V0aC1zZWF0dGxlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"TUKWILA, Wash. — Today it’s an empty office building in a business park south of Seattle, not far from a Mexican restaurant and an organic nursery. But within just a few months, the place will be turning out two to three satellites per month for a U.S.-European joint venture called LeoStella.

“We’ll have a nice cafeteria, too,” LeoStella CEO Chris Chautard joked.

LeoStella is a 50-50 joint venture owned by Seattle-based Spaceflight Industries and Thales Alenia Space, a French-Italian heavyweight of the aerospace industry. The hookup is part of a $150 million deal announced in March.

To make the arrangements even more tangled, LeoStella’s first customer is BlackSky, a Spaceflight Industries subsidiary that’s planning to put a constellation of 60 Earth-observing satellites into orbit.

BlackSky already built the Global constellation’s first four satellites in-house, for launch on rockets such as India’s PSLV, SpaceX’s Falcon 9 and Rocket Lab’s Electron. LeoStella is tasked with building 20 more of the 120-pound (55-kilogram) satellites over the next year or two.

In addition to the cafeteria, LeoStella’s new 20,000-square-foot facility in Tukwila will have everything you’d expect at a satellite factory, including test labs, a clean room and offices for the engineers and executives. Chautard told GeekWire that production is due to begin in October or November, which means the building’s empty space will have to be filled up quickly.

By the end of this year, LeoStella’s headquarters should house about 40 employees, including some who have come over from BlackSky and Spaceflight, said Nicholas Merski, vice president of space operations at Spaceflight Industries.

BlackSky’s first 24 satellites are designed to provide visual and multispectral Earth imagery at resolutions as fine as 1 meter per pixel, at a rapid orbital revisit rate. The goal is to make on-demand pictures available within 90 minutes of an overflight, at a cost of $90 per image.

Such images could be used to track what’s happening during a natural disaster or humanitarian crisis, monitor shipping in near-real time, or provide detailed data for crop forecasts or urban planning. The imagery also will be fed into BlackSky’s Spectra geospatial data platform, along with views from other satellites and on-the-ground data sources.

By the time LeoStella finishes work on its first 20 satellites, its engineers are due to draw up the design for BlackSky’s next-generation Block 3 satellites — which will have improved spatial resolution, additional frequency bands for remote sensing and other upgrades.

And that’s just the start. “We have designed our production line to be able to produce more satellites than just for the BlackSky constellation,” Chautard said. “That is, long-term, our ambition. Now we are sizing the team just for the BlackSky constellation, but we have a production tool that is able to do much, much more. So we are actively looking for customers, new contracts.”

LeoStella’s head count will grow in parallel with the business, Chautard said.

BlackSky and LeoStella aren’t the first ventures to get into the satellite data race: Other companies, such as DigitalGlobe, Planet and Spire, are offering their own combinations of imagery and geospatial data. But Merski said BlackSky is aiming to carve out a profitable niche for itself.

“The satellite capability that we’ve built in Global has a really nice marriage of capability and price point that really fills a unique spot in the market,” he said. “We are not trying to be everything to everyone.”

Chautard said LeoStella is also aiming for a sweet spot in satellite manufacturing, drawing upon Thales Alenia Space’s experience with the Iridium NEXT, GlobalStar 2 and O3b constellations.

“We combine the best of two worlds,” he said. “We are light, agile, low-cost, very reactive — that’s all the good qualities of a small company starting up in this nice space environment in Seattle — but at the same time, we’re very strong, because we’re backed by Thales Alenia Space. Whenever we need some engineering force, we can tap into this formidable engineering clout we have in Thales Alenia Space.”

LeoStella’s ramp-up comes three years after SpaceX put its satellite research and development center in nearby Redmond, Wash., and further validates the Seattle area’s status as a significant player in the satellite game.

“Seattle is going to continue to be a center of gravity for satellite development and expertise, and there’s really a lot of synergy with other technological areas like cloud computing at scale,” Merski said. “As you look at these space architectures, it’s going to continue to be a really attractive place for people to incubate ideas about satellite hardware and the broader architectures.”

Chautard, who recently moved to Seattle from France, agreed. “I’ve been working in France all the time, more or less, but yeah, Seattle is really the city of space,” he said. “It made total sense to be located here.”

But in light of LeoStella’s focus on low-cost satellite production, it didn’t make sense to be in the heart of Seattle, even though Spaceflight Industries’ headquarters are centrally located on Westlake Avenue. Chautard said property prices were about half as much in Tukwila, a half-hour’s drive south of Seattle. Moreover, getting the building permits took about half as long, he said.

Merski added yet another reason for going to Tukwila.

“There’s room to grow,” he said. “We see an extension of our facilities being in the potential medium-term business plan. So that was a big consideration. … We could have selected some facilities that were directly in Seattle and a little bit closer to Spaceflight. But we thought that going a little bit farther out, closer to the airport and with a little bit more room for growth, was certainly the right move.”

“Yeah, that ties directly to our ambitions,” Chautard said. “We have big ambitions, and so we wanted to be in an area where we can grow.”

Although operationally proven, an evolving mine warfare environment prompted Thales UK to develop the enhanced 2093 Wideband variant, under the 2093 Capability Sustainment Programme (CSP) for the Royal Navy, providing a step-change improvement in threat recognition capability and range.

This summer, the new variant underwent an intense 12-week sea acceptance trial on the Navy’s Sandown class minehunter HMS Grimsby in its BUTEC test ranges off the coast of Scotland.

""This is a unique system; there is nothing like it in the world. We like to think of the Royal Navy’s expertise in mine warfare as being world-leading, and this really is up there."" said Lieutenant Commander Kev Giles,

Thales UK’s Jon Hirst, who conducted the acceptance trials at sea on board HMS Grimsby, said: “The crew were very pleased by the system’s reliability. We drove the system hard during the trials periods and it came through very well.”

HMS Grimsby’s six sister ships will all be refitted with 2093 CSP at the Royal Navy’s dockyard in Rosyth as part of a multi-million pound contract.

2093 Wideband: technical details

2093 Wideband is a multi-frequency variable depth sonar system designed to counter the threat of modern mines in both deep and shallow water. Its sonar transmitter and receiver are contained within a towed body which is lowered below the ship by automated winch of armoured cable, penetrating oceanic temperature layers which can block sonar signals.

The new wideband capability has evolved from Thales’s world-leading 2193 hull-mounted sonar, which has been in service on the Royal Navy’s Hunt-class minehunters for a decade, giving it an extensive deep water performance previously only seen in shallow waters. Pulse compression technology allows long range detection and classification of new generation, low target strength mines, while wider fields of view and multiple search and classification frequencies ensure that the critical mine hunting parameters of ‘coverage rate’ and ‘speed of advance’ are maximised under any operational conditions. 2093 Wideband’s human-computer interface has also been converged with 2193, making familiarisation training quicker for sonar operators from Hunt Class ships.

Export potential

Thales UK already has a contract to deliver 2093 Wideband to South Korea and naval forces in Asia, the Middle East and Europe have already shown interest in the new system and Nathan is confident about the new product’s export market prospects."
Delta continues its IFE push with seat-back screens - Economy Class & Beyond - Kevin Marshall,"Mon, 20 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vZWNvbm9teWNsYXNzYW5kYmV5b25kLmJvYXJkaW5nYXJlYS5jb20vMjAxOC8wOC8yMC9kZWx0YS1jb250aW51ZXMtaXRzLWlmZS1wdXNoLXdpdGgtc2VhdC1iYWNrLXNjcmVlbnMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"IFE (In-Flight Entertainment) and seat-back screens seems to be a hot topic at Delta Air Lines, who are continuing to install the devices in its fleet.

The airline has recently had its 600th aircraft installed with seat-back IFE screens.



Delta Studio seat-back screens – Image, Delta.

The Delta Studio product is now installed on 600 aircraft in the Delta fleet, and is available to free of charge to passengers in all cabins.

But why the continued push for screens? Tim Mapes, Delta’s Senior Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer goes on the record, stating

“We continue to invest in seat-back screens, because customers continue to tell us they’re important,” “With seat-back screens, customers don’t have to choose between using their phones or watching a movie. Whether they want to work, relax, or a little bit of both — we want to give our customers the ability to choose and make the most of their time in flight.”

And this is important. Whilst tablet computers and smartphones with large screens are getting more and more present when travelling, there are those who don’t choose to use those devices, or in a lot of cases – don’t have those devices to hand. Take the case of large families, where packing 4 tablets add considerable weight and inconvenience to a trip.

In addition, the use of the phone as a “second screen” for entertainment or connectivity on a plane is prevalent (especially when there is on-board Wi-Fi, giving you the option to be connected in the air).

As well as the seat-back option, Delta Studio is also available via Wi-Fi, giving passengers multiple ways to access content on a plane.

Competitors United Airlines and American Airlines have gone the other way, with them accepting new deliveries without seat-back screens on their latest deliveries on their narrow-body aircraft.

Where do I stand? I think it’s still a good idea to install IFE screens on flights.

Providing that option will give the passenger more entertainment options, as well as a captive audience for Delta to sell advertising to (as well as ensuring safety advice is distributed to the passenger).

Getting there sooner: a new route to self-driving cars - Thales,"Thu, 16 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi91bml0ZWQta2luZ2RvbS9uZXdzL2dldHRpbmctdGhlcmUtc29vbmVyLW5ldy1yb3V0ZS1zZWxmLWRyaXZpbmctY2Fyc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Manufacturers and regulators still face a long journey, but ground-breaking research by XPI Simulation and the University of Warwick could pave the way for the UK government to allow fully autonomous vehicles on our roads.

Connected and autonomous vehicles – or self-driving cars, buses and lorries, in common parlance – have an enormous potential to deliver significant fuel savings, less pollution, safer roads and fewer traffic jams. So what’s holding them back?

An issue of confidence

Technology, although challenging, is not the only barrier to realising the dream of autonomous vehicles. After all, we’ve had unmanned air vehicles in service for some years. Thales’s Watchkeeper, which is used by the British army, can take off and land automatically, gathering intelligence for 16+ hours at a time. Unmanned underwater vehicles and surface boats are also well-advanced.

The equipment used by these unmanned boats and aircraft, which includes RADAR, LIDAR, GPS, altimeters, gyroscopes, secure communications and imaging systems, is also used in driverless cars. It is grist to the mill for companies such as Thales, XPI’s parent company.

Public confidence is a crucial issue. If something goes wrong with a driverless car on the motorway, many people could die. The stakes are as high as they can be.

No government is going to certify autonomous vehicles for everyday road use without a mountain of evidence to show that they are both predictable and safe, even during a highly improbable sequence of adverse events.

Where we are today

Waymo (Google’s spin off), General Motors, Mercedes-Benz, Uber and many others are already conducting on-road autonomous vehicle testing, with thought-provoking results.

Early data from road tests in the US, a fairly benign environment, revealed that the poorest performing car required human intervention every 1.3 miles. The best, a car from Waymo, required an intervention just once every 5,596 miles - about five times better than its nearest rival.

It is clear that, even if safety performance improves by a factor of ten or even a hundred (and it will), much more testing is needed before driverless vehicles can be certified for use on the road. But, with public safety at stake, sending cars around the streets with a driver babysitting is never going to generate sufficient data. Indeed, the five billion mile calculation in the oft-cited RAND study indicates the sheer scale of such a task – not to mention the prodigious cost of carrying out such activity. Fortunately, there may be a better way.

The role of simulation technology

Innovate UK, a government organisation that was set up to help businesses realise the potential of new technologies, recently awarded funding to XPI Simulation and Warwick University to carry out a feasibility study: Certification of Autonomous Vehicles in Synthetic Environments.

The likes of Waymo already carry out an element of autonomous vehicle testing and development in simulation, but if such simulators are going to be used as part of a formal certification process there needs to be a benchmark of quality for such test environments. How can users be sure that the synthetic environment is an adequate representation of the real environment, and that the vehicle under test is going to behave in a similar way as if it were in the real world?

Examples from other industries exist. Full flight simulators (an area of expertise which has long been a specialism of Thales) are used to train and test pilots. These devices are certified by aviation authorities against a set of objective and subjective criteria, which enables users to be comfortable conducting pilot training in simulation.

If successful, the feasibility study will be used to lay the foundations for the development and certification of all types of unmanned vehicles in any situation and every environment. If something goes wrong then the vehicle can be improved, and the tests run again.

The use of simulation for testing is faster, safer, cheaper, more versatile and more repeatable than any other method. XPI and Warwick University believe – and the government and industry hopes – that it will make truly autonomous driverless cars an achievable reality sooner, rather than later.

Telesat now has two separate teams, comprised of industry leading satellite manufacturing companies, who will work in close cooperation with Telesat over the coming months in a series of engineering activities and technical reviews. These efforts will culminate in each team submitting a firm proposal for final design and manufacture of Telesat’s LEO satellites and ground system infrastructure. Telesat anticipates deciding by mid-2019 on a prime contractor for Telesat’s LEO program — space segment, ground segment and system integration.



Telesat’s state-of-the-art LEO constellation will combine the company’s global spectrum rights in Ka-band with Telesat’s proprietary LEO architecture to transform global communications. Telesat LEO will offer an unsurpassed combination of capacity, speed, security, resiliency and low cost with latency that is as good as, or better than, the most advanced terrestrial networks. Able to serve the entire globe, it will become a core component in satisfying many of the world’s most challenging communications requirements. Telesat LEO will accelerate 5G expansion, bridge the digital divide with fiber-like high speed services into rural and remote communities, and set new levels of performance for commercial and government broadband on land, sea and in the air.

Executive Comment



Erwin Hudson, VP of Telesat LEO, said that Airbus has built a tremendous record in satellite manufacturing and that this agreement will result in Airbus further developing their design and submitting a final proposal for Telesat’s full LEO system, both space and ground segment. Telesat now has two outstanding teams — Airbus and Thales Alenia Space-Maxar — supporting Telesat LEO. Each brings a broad range of technical skills and experience along with a strong belief in the project and a commitment to its success. Telesat looks forward to this next phase of the program and to selecting a prime contractor to develop the firm's LEO space and ground infrastructure."

The government today said it has no authentic report suggesting that data breach is higher than the global average in India.""No such authentic report is available with the government indicating that data breach in the country is higher than the global average,"" Minister of State for Electronics and IT S S Ahluwalia told the Rajya Sabha The minister's response came to a query on whether incidents of data breach in the country are higher than the global average.Last month, Thales, a Rafale aircraft vendor, issued a report which stated data breach incidents in India have been higher compared to the global average.The report said around 52 per cent of Indian respondents surveyed by the firm reported a data breach last year which was way above the global average of around 36 per cent.Around 75 per cent of respondents in India reported data breach at some time in the past, compared with just 67 per cent globally, the Thales report said.It claimed to be based on global survey of over 1,200 senior IT security managers, including 100 in India between October-November 2017. Thales official claimed that Indian companies with revenue in the range of USD 100 million to 1 billion were covered in the study.In a separate reply on cyber crimes including fraud of money, using banks cards and e-wallets, Ahluwalia said a total of 10, 18 and 26 cases were registered under credit and debit Card fraud during 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively, according to information received from National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB).He said the government has taken a number of steps to strengthen cyber security in the country which include botnet cleaning and malware analysis centre to detect and clean infected systems in coordination with the internet service providers and industry.The minister mentioned steps taken by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) as well for strengthening digital payments security. The RBI has issued cyber security framework in banks on June 2, 2016, which includes section on arrangement for continuous surveillance in banks and also covers best practices pertaining to various aspects of cyber security.""An inter-disciplinary standing committee on cyber security at RBI reviews the threats inherent in the existing and emerging technology and suggests appropriate policy interventions to strengthen cyber security and resilience,"" Ahluwalia said."
Malaysian Air Force looks for affordable solution to fighter unavailability - Asian Military Review,"Fri, 31 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFzaWFubWlsaXRhcnlyZXZpZXcuY29tLzIwMTgvMDgvbWFsYXlzaWFuLWFpci1mb3JjZS1sb29rcy1mb3ItYWZmb3JkYWJsZS1zb2x1dGlvbi10by1maWdodGVyLXVuYXZhaWxhYmlsaXR5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Royal Malaysian Air Force is suffering major availability issues with two of its three main frontline types. These problems afflict the ten Russian-supplied Mikoyan MiG-29Ns and NUBs of 17 Squadron and the 18 Su-30MKMs of 11 Squadron.

Malaysian Defence Minister Mohamad Sabu revealed on 31 July that only four of the 28 Russian aircraft in the air force were in working condition, with the MiGs grounded and the remaining 14 Sukhois currently undergoing or awaiting repair and maintenance.

The eight Boeing F/A-18Ds and 13 or so BAE Hawk Mk 108s and five Hawk Mk 108s are unaffected, as are the RMAF’s air force’s Aermacchi MB339s.

The Malaysian air force has said that the low availability rate of the Sukhois and MiGs was partly due to a prolonged and sustained shortfall in funding. This was acknowledged by the Malaysian National Audit Department in its 2017 report.

Malaysian Defence Minister Mohamad Sabu said that this had forced the RMAF to carry out “conservative maintenance repairs on the jets based on the received operating budget,” and this had led directly to the poor availability rate.

The cost of a proposed ten-year overhaul for the Su-30MKMs by the original equipment manufacturer was unaffordable, and would have required them to be sent to Russia for the work to be undertaken, with a further cost and time penalty. The air force looked for alternative solutions, eventually deciding to carry out the required work in Malaysia, using RMAF and local industry resources and expertise. A study was conducted using one of the Sukhois, but this took time, and by the time plans were finalised, 12 aircraft had reached ten years in service, and had to be grounded.

The Malaysian Su-30MKMs form the backbone of the RMAF’s frontline strength, and are among the most capable examples of the type. They incorporate Missile Approach Warning Systems (MAWS) and laser warning sensors (LWS) supplied by Saab Avitronics of South Africa, a Thales HUD and NAVFLIR (Navigation Forward Looking Infra-red) and can carry a Thales Damocles Laser Designation Pod (Thales). The aircraft have been adapted to drop US-supplied 500lb GBU-12 laser-guided bombs.

Malaysia will reduce the types of military aircraft it operates as part of the ‘Capability 55’ long-term transformation programme. The Su-30s, MiG-29s and F/A-18Ds will be replaced by two squadrons equipped with whatever type is selected to meet the RMAF’s multirole combat aircraft (MRCA) requirement, while the Hawks and MB339s will be replaced by three squadrons of whatever aircraft is acquired to meet the light combat aircraft/fighter lead-in trainer (LCA/FLIT) requirement."
A digital journey: modernising London's tube - Thales,"Mon, 20 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi91bml0ZWQta2luZ2RvbS9uZXdzL2RpZ2l0YWwtam91cm5leS1tb2Rlcm5pc2luZy1sb25kb25zLXR1YmXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A digital journey: modernising London’s tube Share this article



LinkedIn

This year 1.4 billion people are expected to travel on London Underground. Daily public transport journeys are predicted to hit 15 million by 2041, so the need for extra capacity has never been more urgent. Along with safety and security – physical and digital – passenger capacity are the most pressing challenges facing the underground, but how do you transform the world’s oldest metro into one of the most modern?

At Thales we have nearly 20 years’ experience on the capital’s transport network, working in close partnership with Transport for London. We have harnessed technology to address many underlying long-term problems that impact on the public transport experience, in particular using digital signalling technology to unlock the capacity ‘pain points’ that develop on certain routes at different times.

A 20-year transformation

Thales became the first company in the world to introduce automatic moving-block signalling in 1985, in Vancouver, Canada. Prior to this the old traditional fixed-block principle had been in place since it was introduced to the urban railway in 1889.

Thales signalling technology was first introduced to London in 1994 when its SelTrac system was installed on the Docklands Light Railway (DLR). The technology – using communications-based train control (CBTC) to operate trains – safely enables the trains to get closer together, which increases train throughput and therefore capacity. CBTC also allows the DLR to operate safely without the need for a driver.

Thales introduced the first radio-based version of CBTC in 2003 on the Bundang Commuter Metro in South Korea, and this tried-and-tested technology was brought to London in 2011 when the integrated communications control centre entered service on the Jubilee Line. This line was upgraded ahead of the London 2012 Olympics, cutting journey times by around 22% and increasing capacity by 33%, with a new higher frequency of 30 trains per hour.

The next phase of London Underground’s modernisation was completed in 2015 when the newly resignalled Northern Line entered service. The technology was similar to the Jubilee Line – a loop-based version - with the addition of complex-junction handling capability, and capacity has been increased by 20%. Passenger journey times have been reduced by 18%, with a new higher frequency of up to 31 trains per hour on the busiest sections of the line.

The first large-scale radio-based CBTC signalling was introduced by Thales on the Paris Metro in 2006, and this new technology is currently being installed in London as part of the Four Lines Modernisation programme (4LM). Covering the Circle, District, Hammersmith & City and Metropolitan Lines, this upgrade will boost capacity by a third on 40% of the London Underground network, transforming one of the oldest parts of the tube into one of the most modern.

The new system will be introduced progressively over 14 sections across the network, each one improving reliability as it’s introduced. Customers will benefit from quicker, more frequent services from 2021, with all four lines using the new system by 2023. With 32 trains per hour in the central London section, this is the equivalent to space for an extra 36,500 customers during the busiest times of day.



A new, state-of-the-art control centre for all four lines at Hammersmith is already up and running. This will bring all the aspects of managing the lines under one roof, helping ensure a smooth, integrated service and more accurate and up-to-date information for customers.

Central to the success of this modernisation journey is the uniquely integrated approach adopted by the team. London Underground and Thales define their working relationship as ‘One Team’, with project managers and engineers from both companies working side by side as a single team on everything from defining the user requirements and the design scope, to the detailed management of installation and testing works.

The size and complexity of these resignalling programmes requires all the stakeholders to work together. It’s essential to give everyone a voice, while making sure that they are collaborating as part of a unified team with clear shared goals. That philosophy is firmly embedded in the Thales/London Underground ‘One Team’ approach.

What’s the future look like?

The next stage of this digital modernisation journey is about developing more integrated solutions, bringing signaling and communications systems together with trains, depots and maintenance, and information about passenger flows. Thales is already adopting this integrated approach in Hong Kong, Singapore and Dubai, and the potential exists to welcome these further enhancements in London.

Digital technology has a central role to play in and future developments, both to meet capacity requirements but also in providing the ‘good public transport experience’: tangible benefits for passengers making their daily commute. Indeed the widespread use of individualised technology has forced the transportation sector to focus more on the customer.

Everything will eventually be connected with digital technology, turning big data into smart information that can help to reduce infrastructure pressures, drive better performance and reliability, providing better and greener journeys.

The population of London is expected to grow to 10 million by the year 2030. We’re making sure that the rail system can cope with that. Come what may, the London Underground will be ready and fit for purpose."

Ex-husband of the Ukrainian singer Ani Lorak, producer Yuri Thales commented on the scandal with the betrayal of the family of the artist.

In his opinion, in this situation, the star is better to forgive Murat Nalchajian, with whom she has a child. The interview was published in the edition “the Interlocutor”.

“I do not follow them with Murat relations, says 57-year-old Yuri Thales. – It’s their personal life. Let them as they want, and live. If their marriage continues to exist, then they are satisfied. I hope that Carolina will be able to forgive her husband because they have a common child.”

Yuri Thales was the first man in my life Lorak. Despite the 18 year difference in age, they lived together for 13 years. The jury is still unpleasant to remember that their relationship with Caroline stopped because of the betrayal of the artist. The singer has gone from Falasi, head over heels fell in love with the football player Sergey Rebrov. Now Yuri and Ani do not communicate.

“We are with Caroline and could not, each other to forgive for what happened, I mean the betrayal and all the rest, – he continues. – On this our communication was over. We don’t agree characters, and ideas. But I do not exclude that anything can happen in the future. If she is difficult and she will need my help, we certainly will communicate. But I think she will cope with all this. I hope they have a Murat smart enough to understand the situation and to understand how to live. So all of them will be fine, believe me!”.

Recall, according to witnesses, Murat and a girl by the name of John in one of Kiev night clubs behaved just like a pair: the whole evening the Turkish businessman kept his eyes and hands away from his companion: gently hugged the girl, stroking her legs and whispered something in her ear. Karaoke, the pair left together after midnight. After the scandal erupted Ani Lorak abruptly disappeared from social networks."
