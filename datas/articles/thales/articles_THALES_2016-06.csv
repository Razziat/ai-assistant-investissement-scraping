Launched on August 12, 2005, the large spacecraft, is looking for evidence that water existed on the surface of the Red Planet for a long time. While other Mars missions have shown that water flowed across the planet’s surface during its history, we still don’t know whether water was ever around long enough to provide the conditions for life. Of the seven current Mars missions, MRO returns more data every week than the other six combined. Among MRO’s contributions to our knowledge of Mars are the (possible) detection of liquid water, an understanding of the seasonal changes on Mars, and the identification of underground geological structures. Thanks to the mission’s longevity, and to the productivity of the orbiter’s instruments, MRO still has a major role to play as an advance scout for both rover and human missions."

In June 2015, Netherlands ordered for 12 new Bushmaster vehicles. The deliveries are scheduled to conclude by mid-2016.

Bushmaster remote weapons station

Some of the vehicles are fitted with a remote-controlled weapon system, and all vehicles have the Thales SOTAS M2 multimedia communication system. The vehicles were deployed to Afghanistan in October 2006. In November 2007, the Netherlands Army ordered an additional five vehicles to replace vehicles damaged in Afghanistan. 13 were ordered in June 2008, 18 in August 2008, nine in January 2009 and 14 in June 2009.

In September 2006, it was announced that Australian Army Bushmaster vehicles would be fitted with a remote weapon station (RWS), for added troop protection. A total of 44 Raven R-400 weapon stations from US-based Recon Optical, and electro-optic systems (EOS) from Australia, have been ordered and upgraded vehicles are to enter service in 2008.

Tactical armoured patrol vehicle (TAPV) programme

In June 2010, Thales Canada signed a teaming agreement with DEW Engineering and Development to offer its Bushmaster for Canada’s tactical armoured patrol vehicle (TAPV) programme. Thales has been shortlisted in the pre-qualified bidders list, but the final contract was awarded to Textron Systems Canada.

In February 2010, the Bushmaster single-cab utility variant was selected by the Australian Department of Defence for its LAND 121 phase three programme.

Bushmaster crew cabin

Bushmaster is designed to transport up to ten troops. The cabin, with a 1,415mm headroom, is fitted with eight face-to-face ergonomically designed seats with full four-point harness seat belts. There is a personal weapons storage area, mission equipment storage, a radio suite intercom and a split air-conditioning system to each occupant seat position.

The cabin is fitted with three roof hatches with locking handles to provide protection against ambush and an alternative escape route.

The vehicle is transportable in C-130 Hercules aircraft for rapid deployment in forward areas of operation.

In June 2008, Thales launched a single-cab utility variant, the Bushmaster single cab armoured combat support vehicle. This variant can carry 4,000kg load on its rear tray, and has a cruising speed of 100km/h and maximum range of 800km.

In 2009, an additional variant was added to the range, which includes a dual cab that has been down selected for the UK MoD’s operational utility vehicle systems (OUVS) requirement.

The Bushmaster family of vehicles is available in a range of variants, including troop transport, ambulance, direct fire, mortar, engineer and command for application in combat and combat support roles. It is capable of sharing a high level on commonality, reducing the training and logistics footprint.

Driver’s cabin

The driver and crew cabin areas are ergonomically designed for comfortable travel in varied terrain and harsh environments, minimising crew fatigue and allowing the crew to rest or concentrate on the mission. The engine noise level inside the cabin and crew compartment is very low.

The cabin is fitted with a large windscreen and side windows for all-round visibility. The dashboard is ergonomically arranged, with easily readable and night-vision goggle compatible cockpit instrumentation.

“Bushmaster armoured vehicles are available in six variants: troop transport, ambulance, direct fire, mortar, engineer and command.”

The driver can use the push-button control central tyre inflation system to adjust the tyre pressure while on the move to suit the terrain type and keep the tyres inflated with limited punctures.

Bushmaster weapons

The forward central roof hatch can be equipped with a weapon mount for a 5.56mm or 12.7mm machine gun. A light cannon can also be fitted. The ballistically protected windows can be fitted with optional shooting ports.

Lockers can be replaced with additional ammunition and arms or fuel and water tanks to extend the operational radius. The crew seating can be reconfigured to accommodate operational requirements.

Propulsion

The Bushmaster engine, a Caterpillar 3126E ATAAC turbocharged six-cylinder, produces up to 224kW (300hp) at 2,400rpm. It provides a power to weight ratio of 16kW/t, governed maximum cruise speed of 100km/h. The vehicle has a range of more than 800km.

A double wishbone independent suspension system designed by Timoney in County Meath, Ireland provides good cross-country mobility across difficult terrains. The complete powerpack, (engine, automatic transmission, cooling system) can be easily replaced in the field without special tools.

Self-protection

The armour-protected monocoque protects against the blast of claymore, anti-tank mines, anti-personnel mines, mortars, improvised explosive devices and has a range of ballistic protection kits. The shaped hull deflects the blast.

Wire cutters are installed on the roof on both sides of the vehicle to protect soldiers exposed above the roofline. The fuel and hydraulic tanks are located outside the crew compartments to minimise fire risk.

A 270l drinking-water tank is installed under the floor of the crew compartment, contributing to crew safety in the event of a landmine explosion. The armour protected seating provides additional protection against spinal injuries.

Furthermore, Thales’s unique towed triplet receive array provides instant left/right ambiguity resolution, and is ideally suited for torpedo defence.Thales is the European leader in naval radars and number one internationally for sonars and underwater systems. This new success confirms the position of the Group as a trusted partner to Navies worldwide.



Thanks to substantial investments into the development of the CAPTAS family, CAPTAS-2 has benefitted from the on-going evolution of Thales’s sea proven technologies, ranging from acoustic components to the most state-of-the-art software processing.



Within the last 20 years, more than €250M of Research & Development investment has allowed Thales to build an unprecedented expertise in very low frequency active towed sonars. Thales’s leading position in many fields such as wideband free-flooded ring transducers and triplet receive arrays, has enabled the company to develop the best Anti-Submarine Warfare tactical assets with the CAPTAS sonars.



Operational at sea in major navies, the CAPTAS family is de-facto the world’s lowest frequency VDS standard with the largest installed base. It is also the only low frequency VDS servicing NATO countries and in service with multiple navies including the Norwegian Navy, the Royal Saudi Navy, the UK Royal Navy, the French Navy, the Italian Navy, the Royal Moroccan Navy and the UAE Navy. Furthermore, CAPTAS has been selected by the US Navy for an Advanced Demonstration Model (ADM).

France Calls for Final Offers in Drac UAV Replacement - Defense News,"Thu, 16 Jun 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS9kaWdpdGFsLXNob3ctZGFpbGllcy9ldXJvc2F0b3J5LzIwMTYvMDYvMTYvZnJhbmNlLWNhbGxzLWZvci1maW5hbC1vZmZlcnMtaW4tZHJhYy11YXYtcmVwbGFjZW1lbnQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — France has asked companies to submit their best and final offer by the end of this month in a tender for a mini drone to replace the Drac UAV, two industry executives said at the Eurosatory trade show for land weapons.

French special forces are particularly interested in the acquisition, as the service has been a heavy user of the Drac in overseas operations. A win in the French tender is seen to be key for export sales.

The competition, which has sparked close interest from French and foreign firms, is for an order of 210 units, consisting of 70 batches of three UAVs and a ground control system, data link, and 10 years of service, the executives said.

A selection is expected by the end of the year.

Among the companies expected to submit offers are:

Airbus Defence and Space is fielding the SkyGhost from its subsidiary Survey Copter. Airbus is the incumbent, having won the Drac contract worth €30 million (US $36 million) in 2005.

Gaci, a French systems specialist, is teamed with Israeli partner Elbit.

ECA Group, a French technology company, has partnered with Delair-Tech of France.

Ineo Defense is fielding a UAV from Aeronautics of Israel.

Safran is offering Fly Eye from Polish partner WB Electronics.

Thales is pitching Aviation Design’s Spy’Ranger.

The Direction Générale de l'Armement procurement office, Army specialists and special forces held flight trials of the mini UAVs in April and March.

The acquisition is for a system ""more or less"" off the shelf, one of the executives said. The first UAV is due for delivery six months after the contract award.

A rough estimate of the deal is a unit price of $300,000-$400,000, an executive said. The requirement is for a UAV that weighs about 11 kilograms (including payload), can fly 30 kilometers and can remain in the air for three hours. There is also a request for two payloads — one with a high-definition television, and the other carrying a TV and infrared laser pointer.

Survey Copter drew on lessons learned on the Drac in campaigns including Afghanistan, fitting its Sky Ghost with skids for landing on rocky and rough terrain. An order for the French forces is seen as a decisive factor in an export drive, with the company hoping to close negotiations in Europe and the Middle East for the sale of 90 units.

Safran's Fly Eye, which is launched by hand, has been designed to drop the sensor pack by a small parachute before the mini UAV lands, cutting the risk of damaging the sensitive payload.

Thales' Spy'Ranger, which is also designed for operating on rough terrain, meets NATO security standards.

Survey Copter and Airbus both emphasize that their drones are 100 percent made in France. French unemployment is firmly lodged above 10 percent and a presidential election is due to be held next year.

Safran, Survey Copter and Thales displayed their mini UAVS on their stands at the trade show."

European citizens increasingly expect broadband connectivity wherever they are. With the full support of the Commission, broadband is taking to our passenger airlines and passengers welcome the advantage, the productivity and the connection to family and friends across Europe.

Satisfying these expectations demands investment in innovation by Inmarsat and Deutsche Telekom. Satellites offer comprehensive coverage to which Complementary Ground Component (CGC) provides additional capacity. European champions Inmarsat, Deutsche Telekom and Thales are stepping up to deliver a ground breaking service, (CGC), that will lead the world. The choice and innovation will carry the highest speeds and the greatest global performance to European skies.

The hybrid CGC approach enables passengers to get the speed that a ground network, built by Deutsche Telekom, can deliver while benefiting from the continual coverage that only satellite can provide. Always-on connectivity is now critical for airlines which meaning that the Thales satellite with be a critical part of inflight broadband services.

Fast and reliable inflight broadband benefits passengers and the connected aircraft benefits from a host of monitoring options: weather, ATC and safety tracking.

“The visionary decision to allow the evolution of technology over time, means that the Commission can bring productivity and human connection to 500 Million European citizens” -— Leo Mondale, President of Aviation, Inmarsat

Following the award of the first spectrum coordination by member states, the European Aviation Network (EAN) was formed In September 2015. Inmarsat is providing satellite connectivity from Inmarsat’s new US$250M [€222M] Thales built S-band satellite, with a ground network from Deutsche Telekom.

Leo Mondale, President of Aviation, Inmarsat comments, “The visionary decision to allow the evolution of technology over time, means that the Commission can bring productivity and human connection to 500 Million European citizens. Regulators are supporting our model at the European and National levels. This is a win for European leadership and digital innovation.”

S-BAND SATELLITE

The Inmarsat S-band satellite, a state- of the-art platform, will provide multi-beam pan-European coverage. The satellite, built by Thales, is custom-designed to offer innovative mobile satellite services (MSS) to commercial and business airlines flying over the dense European routes, utilizing Inmarsat’s 30MHz (2 x 15MHz) S-band spectrum allocation in all 28 EU member states.

LTE GROUND NETWORK

On the ground, Deutsche Telekom will build and manage a new powerful mobile broadband network of approximately 300 LTE sites that seamlessly works together with the MSS services.

This pan-European infrastructure will use the same S-band allocation in the most efficient way, providing an enhanced

passenger experience. Once the aircraft have reached 10,000ft, the S-band satellite connectivity will be combined with the Deutsche Telekom ground solution. The future-proof network will consist of special LTE tower sites, linked together to provide high-speed broadband coverage across all the 28 European Union member states. Switching between the satellite and ground network will be automatically managed by the cabin systems, creating no impact or interference with the service delivered on board.

A New Israeli Sandcat Spoted in Paris - Defense Update,"Wed, 15 Jun 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vZGVmZW5zZS11cGRhdGUuY29tLzIwMTYwNjE1X3NhbmRjYXQtMi5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Israel’s Plasan is showcasing a new model of the Sandcat light armored vehicle at Eurosatory 2016. Two versions of the vehicle are on display here: the Sandcat Stormer, shown in an ISR version, and a light combat vehicle carrying Rafael’s Samson remote weapon station (RWS), mounting a machine gun, Spike missiles and optronics.

The 4×4 Sandcat is currently operational with 15 user nations worldwide. Plasan has launched a production line of the Sandcat in Israel, addressing the growing demand for such light, yet highly protected and affordable combat vehicle. The latest version unveiled by the company at Eurosatory was redesigned with streamlined shapes that improve survivability and protection, especially in seams that require extra protection against small arms and sniper fire coming from high elevations.

The protection available with the vehicle’s baseline configuration comply with STANAG Level 3. extensive use of lightweight composites and ceramics within the kitted hull protection enabled the designers to maintain full protection within the limits available by the vehicle’s curb weight. Plasan implemented similar protection designs in other programs, including the Australian Hawkeye from Thales and the JLTV from Osjhkosh. The main advantage of Plasan’s kitted hull concept is the efficient weight management and flexible upgrading of armor protection, acording to the precieved threat.

To maintain the mobility and responsiveness of the vehicle, Plasan extended the standard Ford 550 high performance chassis, shortened and strengthened to take the maximum allowed GVW. Inside the vehicle the Sandcat offers a spacious cabin for the transportation of troops and mission equipment, with full mission information presented to the vehicle commander, depicted on a tactical screen.

Another innovation introduced here at Eurosatory is the improved dashboard, utilizing part of the original systems with a digital display system linked to the vehicle’s electronic hub, previously known as V-BOX. This new ‘brain’ is an automotive electronic processor that integrates and networks all the vehicle’s systems and sensors with mission systems on board. When fully integrated, upon customer requirements, the hub integrates communications, ISR package, panoramic vision systems and remote weapon stations, providing full situational awareness to the vehicle and crew. The electronic hub aso supports safety and maintenance functions, assisting the vehicle’s operation and support in the field.

Plasan is illustrating these new capabilities in a Virtual Reality (VR) experience that also made its debut at the show."
Cost of Edmonton's Metro Line LRT delays may remain secret: city - CBC.ca,"Thu, 23 Jun 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9uZXdzL2NhbmFkYS9lZG1vbnRvbi9zZWNyZXQtbWV0cm8tbGluZS1jb3N0cy0xLjM2NDk3NjPSASBodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYmMuY2EvYW1wLzEuMzY0OTc2Mw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The public will likely never know how much it cost taxpayers due to the debacles that have plagued Edmonton's LRT Metro line for two years.

Integrated infrastructure manager Adam Laughlin said that's because the city is preparing to make a claim against the contractor behind the signalling system, Thales, which has been blamed for the years of delays.

The line was originally supposed to open in 2014. But it has been hit with with so many delays since then city staff still aren't sure when it will be up to full speed. Latest estimates are pegged at early 2017.

Last year, the city hired a third party consultant, Rail Safety Consulting, to audit Thales' safety documents. Rail Safety consultants will work for the city until the line is fully operational.

The cost of the external consultants has never been revealed, as the city says it will likely be part of the claim.

But that claim will not be publicly filed with the courts. Instead, a private dispute resolution process is set out in the city's contract with Thales, according to communications officer Holly Budd.

Budd said the dispute will be judged by a referee mutually agreed upon. If either side is unhappy with the decision, it will go to arbitration.

Value of claim likely won't be made public

That means the value of the claim will ""likely"" never come to light, she said.

No claim has yet been filed by either the city or Thales.

Laughlin has told councillors they will be privately briefed on the cost of the delays at the end of the year.

He said the contractor may also choose to file a counterclaim. Last August, Thales issued a statement that said it had been ""misrepresented"" and that ""misinformation"" has circulated about the new LRT Line.

As for the line itself, the trains currently still do not operate at full speed. In some causes, faults with the signalling system prevent safety arms from lowering as trains approach.

The city hopes trains will move at the 50 km/h they were designed for by late August, and the line will be fully operational by early next year.

City manager Linda Cochrane said the deadlines still make her nervous, given past experience with the project. She called Laughlin an ""eternal optimist"" for setting those dates.

Cochrane said what gives her comfort is, that for the first time, Thales and the consultant agree on when the work will be done.

The next update about the progress of the Metro Line is expected in August."
German Heron TP to follow in Israel's footsteps - Flightglobal,"Wed, 29 Jun 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vY2l2aWwtdWF2cy9nZXJtYW4taGVyb24tdHAtdG8tZm9sbG93LWluLWlzcmFlbHMtZm9vdHN0ZXBzLzEyMDk4OS5hcnRpY2xl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) Heron TP unmanned air vehicle that is due to be supplied to Germany will be in a similar configuration to the one used by the Israeli air force (IAF), it has been revealed.

While a contract for the deal has not yet been signed, the type was selected in January and technical discussions regarding the contract continue.

The German chief of defence, Gen Volker Wieker, has decided to pursue a leasing of the Heron TP system, and German officers have visited the IAF base that the Heron TP is operated from.

The German minister of defence has also revealed that the Heron TP – which will be provided under prime contractor Airbus Defence & Space – will be capable of carrying weapons.

Berlin has selected the type based on its experience with the IAI Heron 1, which has accumulated some 25,000h with the German air force in Afghanistan.

The Heron TP is an interim solution that will support deployed operations until a European medium-altitude, long-endurance UAV is developed and brought into service.

LAV(CRV) unveiled - Australian Defence Magazine,"Thu, 16 Jun 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1c3RyYWxpYW5kZWZlbmNlLmNvbS5hdS9uZXdzL2xhdi1jcnYtdW52ZWlsZWTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Nigel Pittaway | Anglesea

General Dynamics Land Systems Australia (GDLS-A), Thales Australia and Kongsberg became the second team to unveil their Land 400 Phase 2 offering locally during a presentation on June 7.

The GDLS team presented the LAV(CRV) to media at the Australian Automotive Research Centre (AARC) near Anglesea and it was on display again two days later at Thales Australia’s facility in Bendigo, as part of an industry engagement event.

The LAV(CRV) is a MOTS+ vehicle which uses the MOTS GDLS LAV 6.0 as the reference, but is enhanced with equipment such as the remotely-operated Kongsberg Protector MCT-30 turret, with Bushmaster Mk.44 30mm automatic cannon, Thales’ SOTAS-based open-architecture C4 system and integrated Elbit Torch BMS.

""GDLS-A is the prime contractor for the bid and GDLS Canada (GDLS-C) is the chassis OEM.""

GDLS-A is the prime contractor for the bid and GDLS Canada (GDLS-C) is the chassis OEM. Thales Australia is the principal Australian supplier, responsible for SOTAS integration, mission role kits and final fit out, simulation, ammunition and support and Kongsberg is the weapons systems supplier.

GDLS-C’s international programs manager David Tunney said that the three Risk Mitigation Activity (RMA) vehicles were diverted off the LAV 6.0 production line for the Canadian Army and modified to LAV(CRV) configuration.

The vehicle on display at Anglesea was Vehicle No.2, which arrived in Australia on May 13 and after a period of time at Thales’ Bendigo facility was due to be shipped to GDLS-A’s plant at Pooraka in South Australia this week. Vehicle No.1 has been retained in Canada pending down-select and No.3 has been with Kongsberg in Norway since March, undergoing MCT-30 integration and testing.

Tunney said that a decision on where the vehicles will be built if the GDLS-A team is ultimately successful has not yet been made and will depend on the Commonwealth’s Australian Industry Content (AIC) requirements.

“There will be some work in Bendigo, because that’s where Thales has their armoured vehicle division (and) we have an industrial footprint in South Australia with GDLS-A that we’ll also make use of,” he said.

“To some extent it’s up to the customer how much risk they want to take, in terms of schedule. We are committed to industrial activity in Australia (and) there will be Australian content in these vehicles.”

The team will hold a further industry day in Pooraka on June 22.
