Thales Alenia Space kicks off Euclid construction - European Space Agency,"Mon, 08 Jul 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzYS5pbnQvU2NpZW5jZV9FeHBsb3JhdGlvbi9TcGFjZV9TY2llbmNlL1RoYWxlc19BbGVuaWFfU3BhY2Vfa2lja3Nfb2ZmX0V1Y2xpZF9jb25zdHJ1Y3Rpb27SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Science & Exploration Thales Alenia Space kicks off Euclid construction 08/07/2013 8741 views 59 likes

The construction of ESA’s Euclid space mission to explore the ‘dark Universe’ will be led by Italy’s Thales Alenia Space as prime contractor, beginning the full industrial phase of the project.

The announcement follows that of last month when Astrium Toulouse was confirmed to build the payload module – the telescope and optical bench carrying the science instruments. Euclid will be launched in 2020 to explore the roles played by dark energy and dark matter in the evolution of the Universe since the Big Bang and, in particular, in its present accelerating expansion. Dark matter is invisible to normal telescopes, but acts through gravity to play a vital part in forming galaxies and slowing the expansion of the Universe. Dark energy, on the other hand, causes a force that overcomes gravity and that is accelerating the expansion seen around us today. Together, they are thought to comprise 95% of the total amount of mass and energy in the Universe, with ‘normal’ matter – from which stars, planets and we humans are made – making up the remaining small fraction. But their nature remains a profound mystery.

“We are pleased to confirm the prime contractor for this exciting mission. With the support of European space industry, we are a step closer to revealing the darkest secrets of the Universe,” says Professor Alvaro Giménez, ESA’s Director of Science and Robotic Exploration. “This is a long-awaited milestone after the mission concept was first proposed to ESA in 2007, and we are delighted to see that the spacecraft construction can now begin,” says Yannick Mellier, who leads the Euclid consortium, comprising scientists from 13 European countries and the US. The consortium will provide Euclid’s two state-of-the art scientific instruments: a visible-light camera and a near-infrared camera/spectrometer. Together, they will map the 3D distribution of up to two billion galaxies spread over more than a third of the whole sky. Light from the most distant galaxies streaming towards Earth is slightly bent by gravity as it interacts with matter along the way. This is dominated by dark matter, whether associated with galaxies and galaxy clusters, or in isolation. Thus, by measuring distortions in the shapes of those background galaxies, astronomers can construct a 3D map of the dark matter in the Universe. Furthermore, by assessing how the distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters has changed over cosmic time, scientists can infer the role and evolution of dark energy from the dawn of the Universe until today. The results will help to answer one of the most important questions in modern cosmology: why is the Universe expanding at an accelerating rate today, rather than slowing down due to the gravitational attraction of all the matter in it?

By charting the expanding Universe from the Big Bang to the present day, Euclid will also test theories for the fate of the Universe. In order to achieve its goals, Euclid has to deliver extremely high quality images. In turn, that requires a novel attitude system to control the stability of the spacecraft while making its precision observations. “Euclid will be able to hold its sight on these galaxies with an accuracy and stability equivalent to aiming a handheld laser pointer at a €1 coin 200 km away,” says René Laureijs, ESA’s Euclid Project Scientist. The spacecraft will also employ a fast data link allowing Euclid to collect and download at least 260 gigabytes worth of images each day – the equivalent of taking more than 50 000 colour JPEG images per day with a 16 megapixel consumer digital camera. “With Thales Alenia Space at the helm of constructing Euclid, Astrium preparing the payload module, and a consortium of scientists developing the science instruments, we are confident that we will launch on schedule in 2020, ready for at least six years precisely mapping the dark Universe,” adds Giuseppe Racca, ESA’s Euclid Project Manager. Notes for Editors Euclid is an ESA survey mission to investigate the nature of dark matter and dark energy. It was selected as the second Medium-class mission in ESA’s Cosmic Vision programme in October 2011 and formally adopted in June 2012. The mission will be launched in 2020 and will orbit around the Sun–Earth L2 point located 1.5 million km from Earth. Science and spacecraft operations will be conducted by ESA. More than 1000 scientists from over 100 institutes form the Euclid Consortium building the instruments and participating in the scientific harvest of the mission. The consortium comprises scientists from 13 European countries: Austria, Denmark, France, Finland, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Switzerland, and the UK. It also includes a number of US scientists, including 40 nominated by NASA. For further information, please contact: Markus Bauer

With a swipe of his finger across its surface, Mr. Bonnet called up a list of European airports and selected Charles de Gaulle, near Paris. A vivid three-dimensional map appeared, representing a proposed flight plan, which he manipulated using the familiar pinch and zoom gestures used to operate smartphones and tablet computers. The development of touch-screen technology has enabled a similar revolutionary new approach to cockpit design.

By the end of the decade, says Thales, one of the world’s largest makers of aircraft cockpits, pilots could start dispensing with buttons, trackballs and keypads for performing many routine flying tasks in favor of icons that can be dragged and slide-to-scroll menus.

“The idea is to reduce as much as possible the number of buttons and control panels and replace them with virtualization,” said Mr. Bonnet, the head of cockpit innovation at Thales.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999959468841553}",neutral,0.9999959468841553,0
Combat Capability: DMMA: Making apples and oranges comparable | ADM June 2013 - Australian Defence Magazine,"Tue, 30 Jul 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1c3RyYWxpYW5kZWZlbmNlLmNvbS5hdS9uZXdzL2NvbWJhdC1jYXBhYmlsaXR5LWRtbWEtbWFraW5nLWFwcGxlcy1hbmQtb3Jhbmdlcy1jb21wYXJhYmxlLWFkbS1qdW5lLTIwMTPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Since the Domestic Munitions Manufacturing Arrangements (DMMA) was last covered in depth in ADM in October last year, a few developments have occurred. The field of six has narrowed to four, the first RFP was answered at the end of March and remaining contenders are now hoping for a down select before the government goes into caretaker mode in August.



The Request for Proposals (RFP) from the four remaining contenders for DMMA was due March 25. The RFP is understood to involve suggestions for a preferred business model rather than detailed costings and the wonders of due diligence.



Shortlisting of two or possibly three of the contenders is expected to be announced in June or July prior to the issue of an RFT in October, with a preferred tenderer to be named early in 2014 and contract signature by late 2014. But this timeline seems somewhat optimistic since the Strategic Agreement for Munitions Supply (SAMS) expires in mid 2015 and there may be a transfer period should the Thales led bid not come together. This also does not account for the caretaker period or election later this year. The equivalent of a combined first and second pass approval was provided by government in June 12 for the program. Consequently, further government approval is not anticipated.



As an overview, DMMA aims to deliver new commercial arrangements for the manufacture and supply of domestically produced munitions, propellants and explosives, replacing SAMS and Mulwala Agreements, both of which expire in June 2015.



Contenders comprise Alliant Techsystems (ATK) of the US teaming with NIOA Nominees, an Australian-based SME (see From the Source this month for more); BAE Systems Australia teaming with Expal Systems of Spain; Rheinmetall Waffe Munitions of Germany teaming with Nitrochemie of Germany and RUAG Ammotec of Switzerland; and Thales Australia, the current incumbent, teaming with General Dynamics-OTS of the US, and NAMMO of Norway.



Thales Australia formed Australian Munitions as a separate business with a focus on munitions and energetics. Only 20 per cent of the $1 billion global Thales ordnance business is in Australia, with other businesses in the UK, France, Belgium and Germany.



BAE Systems Australia and Expal combined their individual bids in November last. The Raytheon-led team of South Korea’s Poonsang Corp and Chemring Australia withdrew early this year amid reports that Poonsang was unhappy with the risk demonstrated by the Commonwealth’s abrupt decision last May not to proceed with the purchase of 155mm self-propelled howitzers from a Raytheon-Samsung Techwin team. There were also claims that not all was well within the team politics.



Rheinmetall, together with its partners RUAG and Nitrochemie, is the largest ammunition, propellant and weapons manufacturer in Europe, third largest in the world.



The sites



Under DMMA, both Benalla (munitions) and Mulwala (propellants and high explosives) are on the table. As mentioned in the October edition, the history of SAMS has had its day and both the Commonwealth and Thales will be glad to see the end of the arrangement in favour of a new model that does not include capability payments. After touring both sites recently, it is easy to see that there are large parts of both sites that parts are under utilised for various reasons.



For example, a Meissner facility for the melt pour filling of shells (anything from a small mortar up to a 155mm shell) sits unused at Benalla. A screw extruding plant at Mulwala sits alone on a hill, mothballed, but understandable given the inherent instability of the process that is barely used globally any longer.



Benalla was built on a Greenfield site in 1993 and made its first delivery to the ADF in 1996. It now comprises of 48 buildings across a 147-hectare site and employs roughly 250 people from the local area. It has the capability to manufacture small arms ammunition, medium and large calibre ammunition, grenades, demolition stores, pyrotechnics and aircraft bombs.



In 2009, the US Picatinny Arsenal Report named it in the top 5 per cent of facilities in the world. And indeed, many parts of the plant are running at capacity. The workforce has been multi-skilled in many areas to move around the plant as orders demand.



“About 80 per of the light ammunition work is for Defence and other 20 per cent is for the local and international markets,” Daryl Bennett, Australian Munitions’ development manager, explosive ordnance manufacturing, said. “We have what I call a two speed economy at Benalla. The small arms side of the business is going gangbusters and the high explosives side is very much order driven.”



The company has also invested in the plant outside of the ADF work with a new 7.62mm line for a new range of sporting shooter ammunition for the US market.



It was interesting looking about the Benalla facility in particular seeing the ‘Property of Thales’ stickers on various parts of the plant. ADM understands that the DMO and Thales are negotiating about what equipment and plant would be acquired by DMO or potentially leave the facility should they not be successful in their DMMA bid. Lawyers have not been called in at this stage. Other contenders at this stage do not have a firm idea what plant situation they would walk into.



Mulwala is the home of explosives and propellants manufacturing (see box for more on explosives). The plant, built in 1942, currently produces:

acid and nitrocellulose (NC, based on wood based cellulose rather than cotton)

over 30 different types of propellant powders

cast composites mainly for rocket motors and small scale PBX production

high explosives such as TNT and nitro-glycerine.

Mulwala is going well, with Australian Ammunitions barely able to keep up with their US orders (see next page for more). Less than 30 per cent of the product produced at Mulwala is for the ADF.



Like any explosives facility found internationally, the site is odd to the untrained eye; a collection of small buildings at various distances with a maze of pipes between them. Safety circles mean that various stages of the production process are separated from one another. There is a faint smell of ethanol in most stages of the process and safety is the biggest concern of everyone on site (Note: on the day of my Mulwala visit, there was a burn incident in a propellant drying facility ie it looked like a fireball. No one was hurt, the remote control process building vented as it was designed to do and all safety procedures were followed correctly).



Whoever the winner is for DMMA, they will take over the running of the new plant currently undergoing certification known as the Mulwala Redevelopment Project (MRP). Approved in March 2007 at $337.9 million (Jan 07 prices), the program is being managed as a Project of Concern (due to schedule issues) and the budget is now $369 million of which $331 million has been spent. The Budget papers have seen $24 million allocated for spending this year (see P38 for more on the Budget). The program is primed by Lend Lease with ATK responsible for most of the propellant manufacture and certification work on site.



ADM understands that Australian Munitions is providing operators for the plant but there are issues with the high level of automation and consistency of output thus certification. ATK personnel that expected to come over from the US for a year to 18 months have, in some cases, been here for over three years.



The MRP uses the existing acid plant but has a new facility for virtually every other step of the propellants process. In essence, the plant is a giant chemistry set that introduces a lot of solvents and acid to wood pulp and then takes it out again in various steps to end up with materials that go ‘whoosh’ under certain conditions.



Conclusion

Munitions and explosives are more at the lethal front end of Defence industry than perhaps any other part of manufacturing support to the ADF. These are products that are designed and maximised for the most efficient use of a warfighter at the end of the kill chain. And they are, by their very nature, dangerous goods. Their production is a prime example of Defence industry doing dangerous things safely. DMMA will provide a 10 year framework for Defence and Industry to work together on what has been deemed a sovereign capability. As mentioned, it will be up to the program office how to decide on the best way forward to do dangerous things as safely as possible.

Next reveals plan for 6000 sq foot store in Raynes Park - Surrey Comet,"Thu, 04 Jul 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN1cnJleWNvbWV0LmNvLnVrL25ld3MvMTA1MjY3OTUucmV0YWlsLWdpYW50LW5leHQtc3VibWl0cy1hcHBsaWNhdGlvbi1mb3ItNjAwMC1zcS1mb290LXN0b3JlLWluLXJheW5lcy1wYXJrL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Plans to demolish an empty office block, previously used by Thales Avionics, at Bushey Road in New Malden, and replace it with a 5,970 square foot retail store were unveiled at a public exhibition earlier this year.

The development includes provision for a fashion and home store with a coffee shop, parking for 167 cars and cycle racks.

Developers have said 97 per cent of responses had indicated their support for the project which would bring an extra 200 jobs to the area.

There are also plans to create ties with Raynes Park High who developers have been in contact with to discuss the possibility of career and learning opportunities for students.

A spokesperson for Friends Life and Next Plc, said: ""We are continuing to engage with the school and Next hopes to build this into a long term relationship.

""The store would create more than 200 jobs, as well as access to Next’s training and apprenticeship programmes.

""We have been very pleased with the widespread local enthusiasm for the idea of a Next store in Bushey Road.""

The proposed Next store is near Shannon Corner in New Malden.

The Thales Avionics offices have been mostly empty since 2009 when the defence contractors closed its Raynes Park office.

The planning application can be viewed at merton.gov.uk/planning under the reference number 13/P1802.

Residents have until July 24 to comment on the proposals.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999938011169434}",neutral,0.9999938011169434,0
