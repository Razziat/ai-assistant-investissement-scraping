"Thales Alenia, CGS To Build Telescope for Europe's Solar Orbiter - SpaceNews","Wed, 16 Oct 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS8zNzcyNHRoYWxlcy1hbGVuaWEtY2dzLXRvLWJ1aWxkLXRlbGVzY29wZS1mb3ItZXVyb3Blcy1zb2xhci1vcmJpdGVyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Thales Alenia Space’s Italian division and Italy’s CGS, a subsidiary of OHB of Germany, will build a visible and ultraviolet imaging telescope for Europe’s future Solar Orbiter satellite under a contract with the Italian Space Agency (ASI) announced Oct. 16.

Under the contract, valued at 20 million euros ($27 million), Thales Alenia Space and CGS will build the Multi Element Telescope for Imaging and Spectroscopy (METIS), which will provide high-resolution images of the solar corona in visible and infrared light.

Scheduled for launch in 2017, Solar Orbiter is being managed by the 20-nation European Space Agency (ESA), with Astrium Satellites Ltd. of Britain acting as prime contractor under a 300 million-euro contract.

As is the case with most ESA science missions, individual European governments and laboratories are financing most of the observing instruments. ASI is financing METIS.

In addition to its METIS work with CGS, Thales Alenia Space is building Solar Orbiter’s heat shield. The satellite is designed to operate at a distance of 0.28 astronomical units from the sun, and to withstand temperatures of up to 700 degrees Celsius."
Thales Expands and Changes the Name of its US Business - Via Satellite,"Thu, 17 Oct 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhdGVsbGl0ZXRvZGF5LmNvbS90ZWxlY29tLzIwMTMvMTAvMTcvdGhhbGVzLWV4cGFuZHMtYW5kLWNoYW5nZXMtdGhlLW5hbWUtb2YtaXRzLXVzLWJ1c2luZXNzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"[Via Satellite 10-17-13] Thales Communications has announced a company expansion and the change of its company name. Through recent acquisitions and intra-Thales mergers, Thales Communications has changed its name to Thales Defense & Security, effective Oct. 1, 2013.

Two Thales businesses merged with Thales Communications – the navigation, surveillance, and simulation segment of the Thales air traffic management organization, and the former Thales USA Defense and Security, both long-time partners of Thales Communications. They join Tampa Microwave, Visionix, and InterSense, the businesses acquired by Thales Communications in 2012. Tampa Microwave is the provider of small, man-packable, tactical SATCOM terminals for high-bandwidth, voice, video, and data battlefield communications, and Visionix and InterSense are the developers of helmet mounted display and motion tracking technologies.

As part of the intra-Thales mergers, two other Thales businesses came under management control of Thales Communications, with no changes in their leadership – Thales e-Security, a provider of data protection solutions, and the Thales-DRS joint venture, Advanced Acoustic Concepts, a provider of advanced sonar systems."
Thales wins ROKN AW159 dipping sonar contract | Shephard - Shephard News,"Tue, 22 Oct 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNoZXBoYXJkbWVkaWEuY29tL25ld3MvZGVmZW5jZS1oZWxpY29wdGVyL3RoYWxlcy13aW5zLXJva24tYXcxNTktZGlwcGluZy1zb25hci1jb250cmFjdC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales is to supply the Compact Flash Sonics dipping sonar for the Republic of Korea Navy's new AW159 maritime operations helicopter under a new contract with AgustaWestland announced on 22 October.

Thales Leites fights Ed Herman at UFC 167 - Bloody Elbow,"Wed, 02 Oct 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vYmxvb2R5ZWxib3cuY29tLzIwMTMvMTAvMDMvbW1hLW5ld3MtdGhhbGVzLWxlaXRlcy12cy1lZC1oZXJtYW4tdWZjLTE2Ny_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Ed Herman’s newest opponent is a product of Michael Bisping’s injury, which caused changes to three different fights. The first switch was obviously Lyoto Machida stepping in for Bisping to fight Mark Munoz on October 26th, which left Tim Kennedy (Machida’s original opponent) needing a replacement opponent for his November 6th main event spot. Natal agreed to face Kennedy on UFC: Fight For The Troops 3, leaving Herman waiting for another fight to come along. As of last night, he will face Thales Leites on the preliminary card of UFC 167:



Leites (21-4) made his return to the UFC earlier this year at UFC 163, winning a unanimous decision over Tom Watson. The submission specialist once fought Anderson Silva for the middleweight title in 2009, but the fight itself was horrendous to watch. That loss combined with the controversial decision loss to Alessio Sakara sent him out of the UFC, but he’s racked up enough wins to get back in MMA’s premier organization.

Herman (21-9, 1 NC) picked up a FOTN bonus and a unanimous decision win over Trevor Smith at UFC on Fox 8 in Seattle. “Short Fuse” was previously loaned to Strikeforce to face Ronaldo Souza on the main card of the promotion’s final show in January. Unsurprisingly, Jacare submitted Herman in the 1st round via kimura. The 33-year-old is technically unbeaten in his last 5 UFC bouts, but the loss to Jake Shields was ruled a no-contest after Shields failed his drug test.

UFC 167 will be held at the Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas, with Georges St. Pierre putting his welterweight belt on the line vs. Johny Hendricks.

British MOD Orders 200 Starstreak Missiles under Army 2020 Transformation Plan - Defense Update,"Sun, 13 Oct 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vZGVmZW5zZS11cGRhdGUuY29tLzIwMTMxMDEzX2JyaXRpc2gtbW9kLW9yZGVycy0yMDAtc3RhcnN0cmVhay1taXNzaWxlcy11bmRlci1hcm15LTIwMjAtdHJhbnNmb3JtYXRpb24tcGxhbi5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The UK Ministry of Defense has contracted Thales UK for a further 200 STARStreak short-range surface-to-air missiles. Since its fielding in 1995 the Starstreak missile has been a key component of the UK’s Ground Based Air Defence (GBAD) capability. The order has been placed to increase STARStreak stocks as part of the Government’s transformation agenda for the Armed Forces, Force 2020, to equip both the Regular and Reserve forces with the STARStreak systems. Thales said it is constantly improving its systems in response to evolving military requirements.

STARStreak is the world’s fastest very-short-range air defence (VSHORAD) missile. Its peak velocity of over Mach 3 means it can cover a kilometre in under a second. Targeting and full control of the three dart missiles is maintained by the operator via the use of a unique laser beam riding guidance system throughout the entire engagement, thus increasing positive target identification and significantly reducing the risk of fratricide.

The system can be deployed from a variety of vehicle platforms such as RAPIDRanger – a highly mobile lightweight platform with the options of both Early Warning, Slew to Cue and Command and Control interfaces – or from the tripod-based Lightweight Multiple Launcher (LML) that is easy to set up and which can provide a rapid deployment capability.

Cost of ownership is low as the missiles require no maintenance through life. They have a shelf life of 15 years and a proven record of high reliability. The missile complies with up-to-date Insensitive Munitions requirements."
MU90 torpedo enters Royal Australian Navy service - Australian Defence Magazine,"Tue, 15 Oct 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1c3RyYWxpYW5kZWZlbmNlLmNvbS5hdS9uZXdzL211OTAtdG9ycGVkby1lbnRlcnMtcm95YWwtYXVzdHJhbGlhbi1uYXZ5LXNlcnZpY2XSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The entry of the MU90 torpedo into service, has been achieved as a result of close collaboration between the Djimindi Alliance (comprising the Defence Materiel Organisation, Thales Australia and EuroTorp), the Royal Australian Navy and its RAN Test Evaluation Analysis Authority, and the Defence Science and Technology Organisation.

The MU90 is an advanced lightweight anti-submarine torpedo that delivers superior performance and accuracy in shallow waters, even in congested areas. The weapon is designed to counter nuclear and conventional submarines and associated countermeasures.

Australia’s ANZAC and FFG frigates are now fully equipped with the MU90.

Thales Australia CEO Chris Jenkins said: “The MU90 is a significant addition to the Royal Australian Navy’s anti-submarine warfare capability. This is particularly important given the strategic significance of our maritime operational environment.

“We are very pleased that the torpedo has now entered active service, and we look forward to working closely with the DMO and RAN to support the weapon over the coming years.”

The MU90 was developed by EuroTorp – a consortium between DCNS, Thales and Finmeccanica company Whitehead Alenia Sistemi Subacquei (WASS).

The MU90 is in service in France, Italy, Germany, Denmark and Poland."

The contract with Thales to increase MOD ’s stockpile of the missiles will sustain 475 jobs at the company’s facilities in Northern Ireland.

The high velocity missiles, which can travel over a kilometre in less than a second, provide the Army with an air defence capability that is able to counter the threat from fighter aircraft, helicopters and unmanned air systems.

The order of additional Starstreak missiles, which are due to be delivered by June 2014, will allow both the regular and reserve forces to be equipped with the capability.

Lithgow Arms LA101 CrossOver Rifle Design Changes - The Firearm Blog,"Fri, 18 Oct 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZpcmVhcm1ibG9nLmNvbS9ibG9nLzIwMTMvMTAvMTgvbGl0aGdvdy1hcm1zLWxhMTAxLWNyb3Nzb3Zlci1yaWZsZS1kZXNpZ24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Earlier this year I wrote about the Lithgow Arms LA101 CrossOver rifle, a Thales Australia and Winchester collaboration. It was unveiled at the end of May at an Australian gun expo. I thought it was about to go into production but apparently the general public had a lot to say about the design and Thales have subsequently made many design changes. Nic Jenzen-Jones sent us a press release from Thales …

Lithgow Arms has finished the design of its LA101 CrossOver rifle, following extensive public feedback.

The Australian-made rifle was first unveiled at the Melbourne SSAA Shot Expo in May, attracting a significant response and plenty of enthusiasm from the sporting shooter community.

Following this, the Lithgow Arms team has implemented several improvements to the rifle:

The CrossOver will be offered in a left-hand version. Many people requested this, and components have been optimised to provide this option.

A visual and tactile cocking indicator has been added, as indicated by the small red pin at the base of the bolt shroud in the picture below. The flats on the bolt handle have also been orientated to improve bolt feel.

The size of the trigger guard has been reduced. Shooters will be able to rest their finger along the guard for a safer and more comfortable hand position.

The ergonomics of the trigger and the safety selector have been improved, as the photo below indicates. Specifically, the sear engagement is fully adjustable and the safety selector is now a rotating mechanism rather than sliding. The shape of the safety now makes it easier to use and provides a positive feel. The trigger shape has also changed, and is now more curved with added texture for improved trigger feel.

The five-round magazine and magazine release catch are now flush fitting, so those who want to shoot from their vehicle won’t snag on the window frame. The CrossOver magazine is free to drop into the hand when the release catch is operated, and the stock now incorporates recesses to allow the magazine to be pulled free if necessary. See the profile below:

The length of pull has been made adjustable between 32.5cm and 35.5cm. Three spacers will come standard with the rifle that will enable these adjustments, as indicated in the picture below

The ergonomics of the stock have been improved. A high quality textured elastomer recoil pad has been fitted. Texture has been added around the pistol grip, and the fore-end is stepped and slightly tapered to the front, and also textured to improve grip:

A dedicated recoil lug has been added for durability and repeatability, while a Lithgow Arms grip cap has also been added:

Graham Evenden, Head of Lithgow Arms, said: “The team spent a significant amount of time analysing all the responses for their practicality, exploring design options and the interaction between components, and then making the final decisions based on all of the above.

“We believe the resulting design makes the CrossOver an attractive rifle for shooters.

“We’re now moving closer to finalising the timetable for when the CrossOver will go into production. We do not yet have a date for when the rifle will hit the shops, but we’re still working towards the first quarter of next year. There’s a similar story with the pricing – while we’re still finalising production we can’t provide an exact price, but we stand by our previous statements that it will be competitive.

“Finally, we’d like to thank everyone who contributed their ideas and opinions – it’s been greatly appreciated.”"
