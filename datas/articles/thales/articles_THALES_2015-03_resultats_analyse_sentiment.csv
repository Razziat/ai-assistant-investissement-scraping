Thales will create, build and sell products for broadband via Iridium Next satellites, which begin launching in October.

Iridium previously indicated plans to announce at least one more terminal manufacture partner. The company announced the previous four — Cobham Satcom, Rockwell Collins, L-3, and International Communications Group (ICG) — following a competition between more than 30 companies.

Thales Group and Finmeccanica Group joint venture Thales Alenia Space is the prime contractor for the Iridium Next space segment. The initial launch date for Iridium Next fell behind by four months in order to provide Thales Alenia Space with more time for testing payload software, though the end completion date remains set at 2017.

Iridium plans to reveal broadband service partners by the end of the year. Data speeds for Iridium Certus are planned to reach 1.4 megabits per second for a single user terminal following constellation completion. Iridium is assisting the manufacturing partners by supplying core technologies, technical support and testing services.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999976396560669}",neutral,0.999976396560669,0

On behalf of the French Defence Procurement Agency (DGA) in France and UK MOD’s Defence Equipment & Support organisation, OCCAr1 has awarded the Maritime Mine Counter Measures (MMCM) contract to Thales, in collaboration with BAE Systems and their partners in France (ECA) and in the UK (ASV, Wood & Douglas, SAAB). Initiated in 2012 under a cooperation agreement between France and the United Kingdom, the MMCM programme develops a prototype autonomous system for detection and neutralisation of sea mines and underwater improvised explosive devices (UWIEDs).

The MMCM contract includes three stages, starting with a first phase for design. The next stages, which are subject to contract options, will manufacture and experiment the future mine countermeasures capabilities of both France (SLAM-F future mine countermeasures system) and the United Kingdom (MHC – Mine countermeasures and Hydrography Capability). The programme will deliver an autonomous, remotely operated mine countermeasures solution.

As part of the MMCM programme, Thales is committed to providing systems to both the French Navy and Royal Navy for two years of evaluation testing. Each system will comprise a USV (Unmanned Surface Vehicle) equipped with an autonomous navigation system, an obstacle detection and avoidance sonar, a threat identification and neutralisation capability based on Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs), a Towed Synthetic Aperture Sonar (T-SAS) and Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). The geolocated AUVs will use the latest generation synthetic aperture sonar SAMDIS with multi-aspect functionality for improved classification. They will perform their tasks autonomously with control from a host ship or shore-based station via high-data-rate communication links.

The systems, meeting the operational requirements of both nations, incorporate state-of-the-art technologies including very high-resolution multiview imaging sonars and sophisticated analysis tools to provide unparalleled levels of performance in automatic threat recognition and classification.

The project will be delivered by an integrated team including personnel from Thales in France and the UK as well as BAE Systems. French and UK contractors involved in the MMCM system include ASV Ltd for the supply of the surface vehicle, ECA for the supply of the underwater unmanned vehicles, SAAB for the ROVs and Wood & Douglas for communications.

Thales will deliver the integrated Portable Operations Centre (POC) solution, which will incorporate command & control by Thales and BAE Systems. BAE Systems will provide the Mission Management System, managing the command and information systems, as well as the ROVs, the virtual visualization and experimentation suite.

The launch of this programme builds on the Lancaster House defence and security cooperation treaties signed in November 2010 and follows on from the Franco-British summit held on January 31st 2014.

In addition, the RSN wanted an FCR to be able to warn non-cooperative aircraft before taking ultimate action (firing an ASTER 15 missile). With the Herakles radar acting as fire control for the missiles, there are only two options: You either shoot or don’t shoot. With the addition of the STIR FCR, the crew can now illuminate an aircraft which would trigger alarms and let the pilot know it has been detected and is being tracked. While considered as an “act of war” in most rules of engagement, this brings a “last warning” option before effectively launching a surface-to-air missile.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998798370361328}",neutral,0.9998798370361328,0
Lightweight Multi-Role Missile (LMM) Precision Guided Missile - Naval Technology,"Tue, 31 Mar 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdmFsLXRlY2hub2xvZ3kuY29tL3Byb2plY3RzL2xtbS1wcmVjaXNpb24tZ3VpZGVkLW1pc3NpbGUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Lightweight Multi-role Missile (LMM) is being developed by Thales. Credit: Think Defence. The LMMs will be fitted on the Royal Navy’s new AW159 Wildcat attack helicopters. Credit: Thales. The LMM was integrated with Schiebel S-100 Camcopter unmanned aerial vehicle at Farnborough Airshow 2008. Credit: MilborneOne.

The Lightweight Multi-role Missile (LMM) is a very short-range, precision strike air-to-surface and surface-to-surface missile designed and being produced by Thales for the UK Armed Forces.

The LMM is intended to deliver high accuracy and precision strike capabilities with low collateral damage effect against a variety of threats encountered by armoured personnel carriers, small surface vessels, fast inshore attack crafts and towed artillery/static installations.

It can be integrated on board land, air and naval platforms such as wheeled and tracked vehicles, lightweight tactical helicopters and fixed or rotary-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). It can also be deployed in conventional and asymmetric littoral operations.

Thales received a €56m ($75.8m) contract from the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) in June 2014 to manufacture and integrate LMM as the Future Anti-Surface Guided Weapons Light (FASGW-L) system on to the Royal Navy’s AgustaWestland AW159 Wildcat maritime attack helicopters.

The FASGW-L missile system consists of five barrel launchers and a laser guidance system.

Development of LMM

The LMM missile was unveiled in the UK in 2007 and was introduced to the US market at the Association of the US Army (AUSA) Annual Meeting and Exposition held in October 2008.

Development began in 2008 and a total of 1,000 missiles were produced initially. The MoD placed a contract with Thales UK in April 2011 for full-scale development, qualification testing and series production of LMM in laser beam rider version.

Thales and ASELSAN partnered in 2010 for the joint development of a Missile Launcher System, which incorporates LMM missiles.

The first stage test firing demonstration took place in 2014. The parties signed a new cooperation agreement in February 2015 for the continuation of the joint development and further firings of the LMM Missile Launcher System for naval platforms.

The Missile Launcher System features a two-axis gyro-stabilised turret, a laser range finder and an electro-optical (EO) suite. It can be equipped with four/eight ready-to-fire LMM missiles.

Design and features of the multi-role missile

The low cost, covert, flexible LMM missile features soft launch design and has a shelf life of 15 years. It has immediate launch, high lethality and fire on-the-move capabilities. It is controlled by a highly accurate control actuator system.

The missile measures 1.3m in length, 0.26m in wingspan and 76mm in diameter. It has a maximum weight of 13kg. It is equipped with a modular shaped charge/pre-fragmented blast warhead, which weighs up to 3kg. The warhead is activated by a highly sensitive laser proximity fuse.

The versatile design of the weapon system allows it to be configured to function as an all-in-one weapon system for larger naval platforms or as a hybrid missile/gun system fitted with LMM and integrated with naval guns. It can also be customised for integration on a fast patrol boat.

Missile guidance

Guidance for the LMM missile is provided from an optical tracker system attached to the launch platform. The missile can be operated in multiple secure guidance modes including laser beam riding, automatic guidance and laser designation to ensure precision attack of targets with man-in-the-loop. It can also be equipped with IR terminal homing guidance with INS and GPS navigation, as well as semi-active laser guidance.

The guidance section is part of an optically stabilised mount, featuring charge-coupled device (CCD) and thermal cameras connected with an automatic target tracker (ATT) and missile laser guidance unit.

Propulsion and performance of LMM

The LMM missile’s propulsion system consists of a two-stage rocket motor. It has a velocity of more than Mach 1.5 and an operational range between 6km and 8km, while the minimum range is 400m.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999943971633911}",neutral,0.9999943971633911,0

Thales Alenia Space was contracted to build the Göktürk-1 satellite bus. Image: courtesy of TR MSB Undersecretariat for Defence Industries. The Göktürk satellite integration and test centre is located in Turkey. Image: courtesy of Thales Group.

The Göktürk-1 reconnaissance and Earth observation satellite was built for the Turkish Ministry of National Defence by satellite services provider Telespazio in cooperation with Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI) and Thales Alenia Space.

The satellite provides high-resolution aerial images of the Earth for a wide range of military and civilian applications, including reconnaissance, homeland surveillance, intelligence, environmental monitoring, forest control, and cadastral surveys.

It also identifies illegal construction sites, crop management, damage assessment after natural disasters, and management of natural resources.

The Göktürk-1 satellite was launched by the Vega launch vehicle from the Guiana Space Center, French Guiana in December 2016. It is placed into a sun-synchronous orbit at an altitude of 700km and has a design life of seven years.

The Göktürk Earth observation satellite series also includes Göktürk-2 and Göktürk-3.

Development of Göktürk Earth observation satellite

KazEOSat-1 Earth Observation Satellite KazEOSat-1 is the first Earth observation satellite from Kazakhstan, which launched into a low Sun-synchronous orbit in April 2014.

The Ministry of National Defense of Turkey’s Undersecretariat of Defense Industries signed a contract with Telespazio to build the Göktürk observation satellite system in July 2009. The system comprises an Earth observation satellite fitted with high-resolution optical sensors, ground control segment, and a satellite assembly, integration and test centre.

Telespazio, a joint venture (JV) between Finmeccanica and Thales, is the prime contractor for the Göktürk satellite programme. The JV entered design and construction phase in September 2010. It was responsible to build the entire ground segment and provide services during satellite launch. It also supported early orbit operations and test phase.

Thales Alenia Space supervised the construction of the satellite bus and development of the satellite assembly, integration and test centre in Turkey, which is operated by TAI.

The Göktürk satellite system components were supplied by the local industrial partners in Turkey, including Aselsan, Tubitak Uekae, Roketsan and TR Tecnoloji. The local partners also supported construction of the satellite integration centre, remote sensing data processors, data acquisition station, and mission planning systems.

Arianespace was contracted by Telespazio to provide Vega light launcher for the launch of the Göktürk-1 Earth observation satellite in June 2013. Aselsan subcontracted SDT to provide satellite ground station user services.

Göktürk-1 satellite’s features and communications

“The Göktürk satellite system components were supplied by the local industrial partners in Turkey, including Aselsan, Tubitak Uekae, Roketsan and TR Tecnoloji.”

Göktürk-1 Earth observation satellite has a launch weight of 1,100kg. It is equipped with two deployable fixed solar arrays and batteries. The spacecraft has a signal-to-noise ratio of more than 100.

The satellite image data is transmitted to the ground segment over S-band and X-band links. It is also capable of supplying images of the Earth in all-weather conditions during day and night.

The satellite uses a key management system and cryptosystems developed by Tubitak for the secure transmission of data.

G-DCUA ground station crypto module encrypts satellite commands received from the ground station. It also decrypts the encrypted satellite image data, which is then processed by the ground station.

S-DCUA satellite cryptosystem is used to decrypt and verify commands and transmit them to the satellite. It also encrypts image data before transmitting it to the ground segment.

Payloads attached to the Göktürk-1 Earth observation satellite

The Göktürk-1 satellite is equipped with an electro/optical (E/O) camera system for capturing high-quality imagery of the Earth from any location, with a ground sample distance of 0.5m. The camera system operates in various display modes such as point, strip, wide-area and stereo.

Göktürk satellite’s ground segment

The ground station controls the satellite’s missions as well as in-orbit operations. It receives image data and sends commands to the satellite using a 7.3m fixed antenna with S/X-band feed and a 5.4m S/X-band mobile antenna. It also performs acquisition, processing and distribution of data received from the satellite.

Vega launch vehicle

Operated and marketed by Arianespace, the Vega launch vehicle successfully performed a qualification flight in February 2012. It is intended to launch small to medium-sized satellite payloads. It has a length of 29.9m, diameter of 3.02m, height of 30m, with a lift-off mass of 137t and the capacity to carry payloads of up to 1,500kg.

The launch vehicle comprises four stages. The first three stages are powered by solid propellant motors P80, Zefiro 23, and Zefiro 9. The upper stage, the Attitude and Vernier Upper Module (AVUM), is powered by N2O4/UDMH propellant.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999982118606567}",neutral,0.9999982118606567,0
Dassault: Work on India Rafale Sale 95% Done - Defense News,"Thu, 26 Mar 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE1LzAzLzI2L2Rhc3NhdWx0LXdvcmstb24taW5kaWEtcmFmYWxlLXNhbGUtOTUtZG9uZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Work on completing an Indian contract for acquiring the Rafale fighter jet is taking time, but 95 percent of the paperwork is done, Dassault Aviation Chairman Eric Trappier said.

The deal to purchase 126 Rafales is now ""95 percent completed,"" with the French company working with the Indian authorities to review thousands of contract pages, Trappier said Wednesday, Agence France-Presse reported.

Trappier was speaking at Istres, southern France, as Dassault and Thales handed over the first two upgraded Mirage 2000 fighters to the Indian Air Force. The modernization deal, reported by La Tribune to be worth €1.4 billion (US $1.5 billion), is for 51 fighters.

""I would like to go faster [but] it is an enormous contract,"" Trappier said. ""As I have said before, I prefer that we are taking our time now … rather than have problems later.""

Dassault looks to its 60-year ties with India, forged with the company's sale of the Ouragan fighter in 1953, to help close a deal on the Rafale.

""India is Dassault Aviation's first export client and the historical relationship we nurtured with the Indian Air Force has spanned 60 years, growing from strength to strength,"" Trappier said in a statement.

""The Rafale is the next logical step,"" he said.

Thales, an electronic systems company, worked with Indian partners to modernize the Mirage and would extend the ties.

""We are ready to continue developing this teamwork in the future,"" said Pierre-Eric Pommellet, executive vice president at Thales and head of Defense Mission Systems.

India seeks to strengthen the domestic industrial base with the ""Make in India"" policy.

Dassault sees Indian work on the Mirage as helping prepare the ground for the proposed local assembly of Rafales. The Indian partner, state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd., (HAL), will continue the modernization contract for the remaining 49 Mirages.

HAL would be the local co-contractor for assembling the Rafale.

Thales upgraded the radar, electronic warfare and mission computer on the Mirage.

Big Bang author dismisses ancient Greeks' contribution to modern science - South China Morning Post,"Sat, 28 Mar 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9ib29rcy9hcnRpY2xlLzE3NDg1MDcvYmlnLWJhbmctYXV0aG9yLWRpc21pc3Nlcy1hbmNpZW50LWdyZWVrcy1jb250cmlidXRpb24tbW9kZXJuLXNjaWVuY2XSAXlodHRwczovL2FtcC5zY21wLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvYm9va3MvYXJ0aWNsZS8xNzQ4NTA3L2JpZy1iYW5nLWF1dGhvci1kaXNtaXNzZXMtYW5jaWVudC1ncmVla3MtY29udHJpYnV0aW9uLW1vZGVybi1zY2llbmNl?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The later and greater Greeks - the ones who left long texts that did substantiate their theories - fare no better. ""I confess that I find Aristotle frequently tedious, in a way that Plato is not, but although often wrong, Aristotle is not silly, in the way that Plato sometimes is,"" Weinberg writes in a chapter seemingly calculated to reduce philosophers and formal science historians to apoplexy.

None of them took it upon themselves to explain how their theories about reality accounted for the appearances of things. This wasn't just intellectual laziness, says Weinberg: ""There was a strain of intellectual snobbery among the early Greeks that led them to regard an understanding of appearances as not worth having.""

As they believed in an underlying reality that united all things, the ancient Greeks were like modern scientists, says Professor Steven Weinberg in his provocative new book, . But there the similarity ends.

The ancient Greek philosophers of Miletus looked for the underlying reality: Thales reportedly thought the world was made of water; Anaximander proposed a mysterious substance called the infinite; Anaximenes suggested air and Heraclitus, fire. Empedocles of Sicily nominated a mixture of water, earth, aether and sun as the fabric of all mortal things, and Democritus earned an enduring place in history with one fragment of observation: that all matter consisted of tiny particles called atoms. Sensations such as sweet and bitter existed only by convention. Reality consisted only of atoms and the void.

So Eratosthenes of Cyrene in 240BC became the first person in recorded history to notice that the sun casts no shadow at noon at the summer solstice at Syene, on the Tropic of Cancer at what is now Aswan, while in Alexandria on the Nile delta at noon on the same day, it cast a small shadow. He measured the difference in degrees implied by the change in the angle of the sun's rays and found it to be 1/50th of a circle. From that, he concluded - and who among us today would have made the same leap? - that the distance between the two cities must be 1/50th of the circumference of the earth. (Wrong: the earth's circumference is 47.9 times greater than the distance between the two cities, but Eratosthenes had ""done quite well"".)

The world is a teaching machine, but all the lessons are unplanned and unpredictable

Aristarchus of Samos, who worked in Alexandria before Eratosthenes, however, ""could have done better"": he tried to calculate the relative sizes of the moon and the sun and their distances from the earth, with ""impeccable"" mathematics but faulty measurement. ""The real difference between Aristarchus and today's astronomers and physicists is not that his observational data were in error,"" says Weinberg, ""but that he never tried to judge the uncertainty in them, or even acknowledged that they might be imperfect.""

This is an unabashed vision of then in terms of now, rather than as the world must have seemed then. It is also science history without the science; more precisely, a series of tentative and piecemeal questions about the cosmos that ends with the arrival of something that a modern physicist would recognise as science. In those terms, it is a history not of science, but of the questions from which modern science emerged.

Weinberg has done this sort of thing before. The book that made him famous even before his 1979 Nobel Prize in physics was an unequalled, utterly compelling history of creation called . This instant classic described the Big Bang from the first thousandth of a second of time to three minutes and 46 seconds afterwards, and then brought the chronicle of events to a close with the unforgettable line: ""The universe will go on expanding and cooling, but not much of interest will occur for 700,000 years.""

In this study, the approach is the same: Weinberg contemplates the initial conditions, pursues the trajectory of discovery, and ends the adventure where most of us think it begins: with Galileo and Newton. As in the first book, he appends an epilogue that sums up later thinking, and parcels up the detailed scientific reasoning in a series of appendices for those who want to know more.

There is a difference, however: when Weinberg wrote , the evidence that there really had been a Big Bang - a moment when time, space and matter came into being from nothing - was just a decade old. Everything he told us was new. This time he goes over territory examined and re-examined for the past 2,000 years; he writes with an 18th-century elegance that echoes Edward Gibbon. But he brings to it not a classical historian's perspective - rather, a modern scientist's.

This doesn't change the plot. Weinberg follows the familiar chain of reasoning from Aristotle to the great experimenters of the Abbasid caliphate centred in Baghdad and the later Islamic intellectual capital of Cordoba and ultimately to Copernicus, Tycho, Kepler and Galileo. He understands the intricate connection between religion and natural philosophy, but he doesn't endorse it: he is inclined to view some of the Hellenistic and Abbasid scientists as religious sceptics. (Persian scholar Omar Khayyam is still censored in Iran.) Bacon and Descartes both appear to be dismissed as ""overrated"".

At the end of the day, this book is concerned not just with how we arrived at what is now called science, but why it took so long. That is because Weinberg has a clear idea of the underlying reality. He is one of the architects - he even coined the term - of what is now called the Standard Model of matter, time and space: a theory that stands up to continuous testing by the Hubble telescope and the Large Hadron Collider. The short answer is that modern science is not what Plato, or Aristotle, or even Copernicus and Galileo, or anyone else was looking for. ""It is impersonal. There is no hint in it of human concerns like love or justice. No one who studies the Standard Model will be helped to be a better person,"" he writes.

The impossible Platonic goal of a purely deductive natural science stood in the way of progress. The Greeks didn't test their theories by observation because they had never seen it done. Progress in science has been a matter of discovering what questions should be asked, and, he warns, nothing about modern science is obvious to someone who's never seen it done.

The world is a teaching machine, but all the lessons are unplanned and unpredictable. Newton marked a real discontinuity by formulating an approximation of reality that united all motion, and all matter, in the heavens and on earth, but even this marvellous achievement was an approximation. Einstein's theory of general relativity replaced it, but Weinberg says even that theory is doubtless an approximation to a more satisfactory one.

""Satisfactory"", however, may not be the right word. It may never be possible to fully explain the world. The universe simply may not fit any framework humans can devise. Science offers joy, but not certainty. ""Like me,"" Weinberg writes, ""most physicists today are resigned to the fact that we will always have to wonder why our deepest theories are not something different.""

Harris will deliver two fixed mesh reflectors that will be installed on the Inmarsat S-band satellite to provide fast aviation passenger connectivity services throughout Europe.

The reflectors use Harris’ flight-proven mesh material in a patented arrangement, replacing traditional heavier solid graphite and tri-axial weave surfaces. Adapted from the company’s government and commercial unfurlable antenna products, the reflector’s smaller mass enables operators to add additional payloads or fuel to extend satellite life.

Harris has teamed with Vanguard Space Technologies to build the two reflectors. They are produced with 3D-printed titanium components, a low-cost, high performance alternative to traditional manufacturing techniques.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9975371360778809}",neutral,0.9975371360778809,0
"Vueling makes waves with 186-seat A320, Ka-band and lav-galley - Runway Girl Network","Tue, 17 Mar 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTUvMDMvdnVlbGluZy1tYWtlcy13YXZlcy13aXRoLTE4Ni1zZWF0LWEzMjAta2EtYmFuZC1hbmQtbGF2LWdhbGxleS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Vueling, the low-cost carrier sibling to IAG’s British Airways and Iberia, is making two huge big passenger experience waves: first with Europe’s first commercial Ka-band inflight Internet, and second with a 186-seat A320 configuration using Airbus’ Space-Flex lavatory and rear galley module.

The airline has teamed up with Thales’ LiveTV subsidiary and Telefónica’s Movistar cellphone network to provide connectivity over Eutelsat’s KA-SAT, which the partners are branding with the label “high throughput” — mentioned no fewer than three times in the airline’s 150-second behind-the-scenes video. It is hoped that this Wi-Fi solution can serve up the same sort of inflight speedtest results as offered on JetBlue Airways, which uses Ka capacity from Eutelsat partner ViaSat.

In the cheerily soundtracked video, the airline outlines the installation of the Ka-band hardware and its component parts on A320 EC-LZN — which seems to have taken place several months ago, although with a lack of from-the-plane tweets evident from a search for “Vueling Wi-Fi”, the system itself doesn’t seem to be operating in revenue service yet.

In terms of timing, Telefónica had previously stated an expectation to have four Vueling A320s equipped in 2014.

Elsewhere inside the aircraft, Vueling is the first airline to take advantage of this month’s updated type certificate from European safety regulator EASA that outlines the road to a 195-seat A320.

The airline is boosting its A320 from 180 to 186 seats with the shift of the rear two lavatories from inside the seat track to the rear bulkhead area, using Airbus’ first-generation Space-Flex lav-galley module, which is fully PRM accessible with a swinging partition between two lavs.

In terms of pitch implications, the magic 8-ball says “reply hazy, try again”. Vueling itself doesn’t quote seat numbers, and various second-hand sources online suggest its A320s sit at either 29” or 30”. All 180-seat all-economy A320s with which RGN is familiar — including Jetstar, easyJet, AirAsia and others — are pitched at 29”.

Your 6’3” (191cm) author flew on a 29” pitched 180-seater A320 operated by ANA’s Japanese LCC Peach between Seoul Incheon and Osaka Kansai this week, taking advantage of the $20 “spare seat next to you” option, and would have struggled to straighten his knees to remain within the bounds of his own seat if he hadn’t.

As it was, he was sitting side-saddle in a pose remarkably reminiscent of the way Lady Mary of Downton Abbey‘s Crawley family rides a horse.

Regardless, since the space for the extra row of seats comes from the lavatory move, it’s unlikely that seat pitch will be reduced, and the addition of an unnamed slimline seat resembling Recaro’s SL3510 hopefully means that knees — if not posteriors — shouldn’t complain any more than previously.

All bets are off on the red-eye 4h 20min flight from Barcelona to Moscow, however — that is a brutal trip on a slimline seat however much Wi-FI a passengers has.

Yet the wheels-within-wheels of IAG’s canny management may mean that the implications of both Ka-band and Space-Flex are wider than just a Catalan LCC. Using Vueling as a test-bed for both new #PaxEx propositions to work out the kinks before considering a rollout to BA or Iberia would be smart. That’s especially true given the adversarial relationship with the cabin crew unions on both sides of the Bay of Biscay. RGN will be watching this space for developments.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999887943267822}",neutral,0.9999887943267822,0
A Token Thought for the Ancient Seeds of Science - Skeptic Magazine,"Sun, 22 Mar 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNrZXB0aWMuY29tL2luc2lnaHQvYS10b2tlbi10aG91Z2h0LWZvci10aGUtYW5jaWVudC1zZWVkcy1vZi1zY2llbmNlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Precisely when the guttural croaks and screeching hoots of ancient humans became words is a mystery. We do know language can be measured in hundreds of thousands, if not millions of years—that is, humans have been physiologically capable of sharing observations about their surroundings for a long time. For most of history, the stories we shared have described a universe that is personal, emotional, and whimsical.

Then, about two and a half thousand years ago, something different happened. On the coast of modern day Turkey in a city called Miletus, a man named Thales wondered what everything in nature was made of. His answer was almost mundane: water.

It’s unlikely Thales of Miletus was the first to consider this question, nor the first to suggest an answer. Since none of his writings have survived the ages we are forced to rely on writers like Aristotle and Herodotus to speculate on the thoughts of this so-called ‘first philosopher’. But Thales represented the emergence of a way of thinking new in human history, where the universe emerges from a single system of impersonal qualities.

The demarcation problem makes it impossible to define the boundaries of science, yet it undoubtedly comprises a complex variety of behaviours such as measuring, discussing, modelling and predicting. Crucially, science involves seeing the universe as if it’s governed by unchanging rules rather than personal intentions. These rules are symmetrical in time and space, existing independently of the desires of some supernatural force.

This simple concept opened the way for groups of people to openly hypothesise on the fundamental nature of everything, on properties such as change, time, and matter. The question is, why did it take so long for humans to consider this?

Biologically, the brain in Thales’ head was little different to those in the skulls of ancestors dating back tens of thousands of years. At least, not different enough to account for a sudden spark of insight. To gain some understanding of why humans started to think about the universe in terms of rules rather than supernatural intentions so recently in our past, it pays to ask what impedes us from thinking of a rule based universe, and then look at what was significant about the Turkish coast in the 6th century BCE.

The Tribal Brain

Comprising of tissues and cells and an array of organic chemicals, subject to variation under the control of genes, the chunk of meat called a brain is little different to any other organ in the living world. Its ability to give rise to a mind is a neat trick, but biologically it holds no privileged position as an accident of evolution.

It doesn’t seem unreasonable to think a brain would help create mental models of reality to solve problems. After all, the human species has spread across the globe—and beyond—thanks to this feature. Yet the features of our remarkable intelligence, reflected in our ability to use language, temporal reasoning, and creativity, appear to have more to do with understanding other people than understanding nature.

There are a number of hypotheses explaining human intelligence, but perhaps one of the more compelling arguments focusses on social interactions as an evolutionary pressure. Proposed by British anthropologist Robin Dunbar—he of the famous ‘Dunbar’s number’—the social brain hypothesis suggests larger collectives facilitated an advantage in more complex communication, and an ability to empathise or predict the intentions of competitors within a social hierarchy.

The tools we use to mentally model the behaviour of other people can easily be applied to non-humans. Indeed, most religions imbue objects and environments in our surroundings with human-like intention and sentiment, described as animism among less structured religious cultures.

It’s arguable whether religious thinking has itself offered an evolutionary advantage, but it’s clear its place in our history hasn’t been detrimental enough to seriously compromise the advantage of having a social brain. Indeed, it’s possible that the perception of being allied with non-human features of the universe has particular social advantages. Nobody would want to piss off the guy who is best friends with thunder and lightning, for example.

There’s no reason to suspect this innate bias prevented any individual from speculating on non-animistic systems of nature. But for any such speculation to develop beyond some fleeting flight of fancy, it would require a number of conditions. One would be for the thought to develop into a structured model. Another would be for it to be shared among peers, horizontally across the social group or vertically down through time.

Theoretical models rarely (if ever) spring fully formed into human consciousness. Even in modern science, scientists tend to evolve existing models to explain new phenomena, relying on a similar idea as a metaphor for an otherwise inchoate theory. A complex, teleological model of nature has a ready made analogy in our social brain, unlike a monistic, rule-based one. What’s more, sharing such a radically new model with peers means risking vital social bonds with a personal universe.

The Ionian coast in the 6th century BCE was a far cry from our ancestral tribal lifestyle. By then, diverse human social groups were associating in civilisations fed by an industry of agriculture, where oral tradition had been replaced with written works and the universe could be mapped and measured using complex number systems. This brave new world wasn’t exactly novel to ancient Greece, however. So what was so novel that Thales and friends could revolutionise human thinking forever?

A Melting Pot of Ideas

Many things could conceivably pressure new systems of thinking. Being forced to consider alternative belief systems, for example, could evolve new cultures. Miletus and its surrounds was indeed a multicultural melting pot.

There are two problems with this pathway. For one thing, mixing with different cultures wasn’t new. Phoenicia had been trading with the far reaches of the Mediterranean, journeying as far as the British isles for centuries prior to Greece becoming a maritime power. For another, there seems to be a greater tendency for people to polarise their beliefs when encountering alternative systems, reinforcing ‘us and them’ rather than creating completely new models of thinking.

Another entirely plausible possibility is the development of a new form of government—democracy. Phoenicia concentrated wealth and power, funneling their resources up through a hierarchy into a monarchy. As such, it benefits individuals to subscribe to a central way of thinking and provides limited opportunity to consider new models of nature.

Yet within a democracy, opportunity for a redistribution of wealth exists. Risks can be taken to change allegiances, and more freedom in sharing and debating ideas exists within select social groups. Where else could you chew on a crazy concept except in a democracy?

As appealing as this hypothesis might be, it struggles for lack of strong evidence. The pre-Socratic, materialist philosophers that include the likes of Thales and big names such as Anaximander, Heraclitus, Parmenides, and Zeno weren’t known for favouring rhetoric quite in the same way as their philosophical descendants. If democracy presented a way to criticise old authorities in favour of new ones, the value didn’t seem to be reflected in the pre-Socratic tradition.

Nonetheless, the kindling could well be laid by factors of cultural diversity and democratic freedoms. The spark could have come in the form of one other novelty: the coin.

A Penny for Your Thoughts

As a token of exchange or recording transactions, money has been around a long time—a lot longer than 2500 years. But in a modern sense, the coin represents a lot more than a token of value.

According to historian Professor Richard Seaforth, the nature of the coinage developed in Ionia around the 6th century BCE implied something different to the more ancient exchanges of tokens or of bartering. Emerging from an existing system of redistribution of wealth from sacrificial offerings, it developed into the first true system of communal faith in a value. It was the first time society was monetised.

The consequences of this development aren’t difficult to imagine. For one thing, as with democracy, individuals can take greater risks with the established values of liquid wealth than they can with the personally subjective values of bartered goods. Society becomes more fluid, so to speak. Yet according to Seaforth, the very concept of money also provided a model for thinking differently.

“The universe is no longer imagined as controlled by a monarch but by what may seem to be an all-powerful, all pervasive impersonal substance, and the first and only such substance in history is money,” says Richard.

Coins provided a metaphorical scaffold for considering an economics of nature; one that—like money—was consistent and agreed upon. There was still a role for animism and mythology, one which persisted through the poetic treatises of many pre-Socratics such as Parmenides. But this notion of nature being grounded within a single, impersonal structure seeded a radical new way of looking at the universe.

Looking around at our technologically advanced modern world, it’s easy to take the culture of science for granted. It seems so obvious in hindsight! Why did it take us hundreds of thousands of years to come up with it? The appeal in the coin hypothesis for the generation of material philosophy—and from that, the long road we eventually think of as science—is that it provides a cultural stepping stone from one social behaviour to another.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999421834945679}",neutral,0.9999421834945679,0

Tested using terrestrial launch pads, the trials aimed above all the validate conformity of the F4 type rockets NATO’s STANAG 4187 standards that impose stringent safety design requirements for fuzing systems.

The tests also aimed to establish the capacities of the future Low Vulnerability Ammunition rocket warhead. Benefiting from the latest technological advances in activation by induction, the HE (High Explosive) rocket should be commercialised in 2016 and put in service with French forces in 2017/2018.

Available in two versions

The rocket will be available in two versions: one functioning on impact (HE-IMP) and one in a multimode version (HE-MM), functioning both on impact or in proximity to the target.

In addition, these tests demonstrated the very low dispersion of F4 type rockets, which is inferior to 6 milli-radiants in rocket launchers in service with forces, and 2 milli-radiants in a long tube, a system that enables the simulation of a separation in an air flow of 70 knots.

The excellent performances of these weapons results from TDA’s ambition to optimise its non-guided rockets in order to extend usage to greatly superior ranges than those reached by competitor products.

This modality will enable military forces to reserve the use of laser-guided rockets for mobile or sensitive targets, necessitating sub-metric precision.

Thales will deliver and install an integrated solution for the protection of the infrastructure and its environment, in addition to ensuring the operations of the New Port run safely.

A vital component of Qatar’s economic infrastructure, the New Port will comprise three container terminals with an eventual combined annual capacity in excess of six million containers per year. It will not only cater to the expected growth in container traffic, but will also accommodate general cargo traffic, offshore support, coast guard vessels, a marine support unit, imports of vehicles, livestock and bulk grain. In total, facilities at the New Port will stretch over 20km².



To secure the new commercial port, Thales is to provide a high technology integrated solution managed by a security command & control centre, including a perimeter intrusion detection system, a perimeter surveillance & lighting system, a redundant IT communication network, a redundant video storage system, an under vehicle surveillance system and a tetra communication system. The secured area will have a 19km perimeter.



The Thales port security command & control centre is to bring an integrated response to piracy, trafficking, smuggling and global threats of terrorism. Maintaining port security is of utmost importance and Thales will be providing a complete and real-time situational picture of the site.



Thales’s value proposition for the New Port is focusing on the capacity to integrate various kinds of sensors in a user-friendly Human-Machine Interface. The overall solution is to be highly secured, resilient and, with an eye to future developments, easily upgradable.



This contract marks the first time Thales will deploy its most cutting-edge technologies on such a large scale.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9632529616355896}",neutral,0.9632529616355896,0

LU confirms underground resignalling plans - International Railway Journal,"Wed, 25 Mar 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJhaWxqb3VybmFsLmNvbS9wYXNzZW5nZXIvbWV0cm9zL2x1LWNvbmZpcm1zLXVuZGVyZ3JvdW5kLXJlc2lnbmFsbGluZy1wbGFucy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales was pre-selected for the contract in April 2014 after it presented a solution that meets the intricate operational requirements of the lines following LU's termination of its £354m 2011 contract with Bombardier. The new system will enhance capacity by a third on the lines, which make up 40% of the tube network.

Thales is now entering the final stages of negotiation with LU to deliver the new system, and LU's expectation is that the cost of work will be in line with, or below, the cost per-km of the Northern Line signalling upgrade and significantly less than the Jubilee and Victoria line modernisations delivered under through public-private partnerships.

LU says it expects that the cost of the contract will be higher than the Bombardier deal in which it was supplying a communications-based train control (CBTC) solution and had completed preparatory work. However, LU says with work not progressing and with no guarantee that it would work, it decided to act to avoid the failure of the project.

LU is investing £5.54bn to modernise the lines, which includes delivery of 191 air-conditioned S-Stock trains from Bombardier, which are already in use on the Metropolitan, Circle, District, and Hammersmith & City lines as well as new track, lengthened platforms and rebuilt depots.

This is an increase on the original £4.26bn budget to account for ""a more realistic price for the signalling contract, a longer overall programme, and additional infrastructure and costs identified as necessary following the termination of the Bombardier contract.""

Once completed the signalling upgrade will increase frequency of trains on the Circle Line to every four minutes instead of 10 minutes at present, and there will be a service every two minutes across much of the SSL network when additional District, Hammersmith & City, and Metropolitan line services are added.

LU says that once work on the four lines is complete in 2022 it will move on to purchasing new trains and control systems for the Piccadilly, Central, Bakerloo, and Waterloo & City lines.

""Having modernised three of the most heavily-used lines we now need to bring the next four lines in to the modern era,"" says Mr Mike Brown, LU managing director.

The next major phase of the London Underground’s modernisation will see a new modern train control system introduced on the District, Circle, Metropolitan and Hammersmith & City lines. The system is needed to allow more trains to run - more than double the number will run on the Circle line alone - to help support London’s growing population that is expected to increase by 1.4 million people by 2030.

The work will be delivered by Thales, after London Underground terminated its contract with Bombardier in December 2013.

Thales will use an improved version of the system it has successfully installed on the Jubilee and Northern lines, and also follows on from the Victoria line modernisation where, with 34 trains every hour in each direction, there now is one of the most frequent train services anywhere in Europe.

London Underground said the upgrade will now cost £5.54bn, a 30% increase on the original £4.26bn budget. It said the increase provides cover for a more realistic price for the new signalling contract, a longer overall programme, and additional infrastructure works and costs identified as necessary to the modernisation following the termination of the Bombardier contract.

London Undergrond said it was in the final stages of negotiating a position with Thales and that its “firm expectation” was that the new price will be in line with, or below, the cost per kilometre of modernising the Northern line signalling – and a much lower cost than the Jubilee and Victoria line modernisations.

The contract will see a further 191 modern air-conditioned walk through trains introduced along with other improvements to get the most out of the new trains, including new track, lengthened platforms and rebuilt train depots with advanced technology to ensure the highest levels of train reliability.

The District, Circle, Metropolitan and Hammersmith & City lines together make up nearly 40% of the network and include the oldest part of the network built in 1863. Between them the four lines carry around 1.3 million passengers a day. The current signalling system is not capable of running trains close enough together to provide the high-frequency service now needed. Once completed most Circle line customers will see a train up to every four minutes instead of 10 and once London Underground adds in additional District, Hammersmith & City and Metropolitan line services there will be trains every two minutes across much of this part of the network in Central London.

The improvements will all be delivered within the existing Transport for London business plan and the programme is expected to have a benefit-cost ratio of around 4:1.

Work is expected to begin later this year, and customers will start to see the benefits of the work on the Circle line in 2021, with customers experiencing the full benefits across all lines in 2022.

Once these four lines have been completed, London Underground will move on to buying new trains and control systems for the Piccadilly, Central, Bakerloo, and Waterloo & City lines.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9308531880378723}",neutral,0.9308531880378723,0

Two Gwalior-based IAF squadrons currently fly the Mirage-2000: Number 1 Squadron (Tigers), and Number 7 Squadron (Battle Axes). Meanwhile, HAL is upgrading the next two Mirage 2000s at its Bengaluru facility, with Dassault and Thales providing ""on-the-job training"". Dassault builds the airframe of the Mirage 2000, while Thales provides most of the avionics.Business Standard toured the Mirage facility in HAL in January, and learned that the third and fourth upgraded fighter would be completed in September and November 2015 respectively. There are 120-130 technicians working in HAL's Mirage 2000 upgrade and overhaul facility in Bengaluru.HAL would upgrade the remaining 47 Mirage 2000s without assistance, fitting in upgrade kits provided by Dassault and Thales. This would take 7-10 years.While the upgrade does not involve fitting a new engine, it includes extensive avionics upgrades. Thales is providing a new radar, mission computer and electronic warfare suite, said the French vendors in a statement today. In place of the old analogue instruments in the cockpit, the pilots will now have an ""all-glass cockpit"", with video displays of flight parameters and weapons aiming and operation. They will also have helmet-mounted sights, which allow pilots to aim weapons at targets merely by looking at them.In a linked contract, the IAF has procured 490 MICA ""beyond visual range"" missiles from French company, MBDA, for Rs 6,600 crore.The IAF places high confidence in its Mirage 2000, which have not just provided high serviceability rates but were also modified for delivering ""precision-guided munitions"", or laser-guided smart bombs, during the Kargil conflict in 1999.Alongside the upgrade, HAL is simultaneously overhauling its entire Mirage 2000 fleet, a year-long procedure that each fighter undergoes after flying 2000 hours or 13 years, whichever happens first. The entire Mirage 2000 fleet underwent a first round of overhaul from 1991-94. The second overhaul round began in 2009.""We have developed a high degree of expertise in maintaining, overhauling and now upgrading the Mirage 2000,"" said a HAL line manager.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998538494110107}",neutral,0.9998538494110107,0
Defense firm Thales wins security contract for Qatar port - Doha News,"Sat, 14 Mar 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vZG9oYW5ld3MuY28vZGVmZW5zZS1maXJtLXRoYWxlcy13aW5zLXNlY3VyaXR5LWNvbnRyYWN0LWZvci1xYXRhci1wb3J0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Updated on March 22 with the latest renderings of the new port project

French defense systems firm Thales has won a security contract to protect the $7.4 billion (QR27 billion) site of Qatar’s new port project, it announced this week.

The commercial port, which was officially renamed Hamad Port last month by the Deputy Emir Sheikh Abdullah bin Hamad Al Thani, is set to soft launch by the end of this year, and completion of the first phase is slated for the end of 2016.

It is hoped the facilities at the new port will help resolve existing bottlenecks in the construction material supply chain, as Qatar develops its infrastructure ahead of the 2022 World Cup.

Located in Umm Al-Houl near Mesaieed, the port will cover a site of around 20 sq km and will include three container terminals with an eventual combined annual capacity in excess of six million containers per year.

In addition to an expected increase in container traffic, it will also accommodate general cargo traffic, offshore support, coast guard vessels, a marine support unit, imports of vehicles, livestock and bulk grain.

The port area will also house a new base for the Emiri Naval Forces and “Qatar Economic Zone 3,” a new industrial area integrated with residential units.

Announcing the new contract for what is said to be one of the world’s largest greenfield ports, Thales said in a statement that its mandate is to:

“Provide a high technology integrated solution managed by a security command and control center, including a perimeter intrusion detection system, a perimeter surveillance and lighting system, a redundant IT communication network, a redundant video storage system, an under vehicle surveillance system and a tetra communication system. The secured area will have a 19km perimeter.”

Its port security command and control center will “bring an integrated response to piracy, trafficking, smuggling and global threats of terrorism. Maintaining port security is of utmost importance and Thales will be providing a complete and real-time situational picture of the site,” it added in the statement.

Timelines

In January last year, the country’s transport minister said construction on the site would be speeded up, to put its eventual completion some 10 years ahead of its original 2030 deadline.

Jassim Seif Ahmed al-Sulaiti said that the plan was to merge the first and second phases of the $7.4 billion project so that the third phase is completed in 2020, which would significantly improve the country’s import capacity in the run-up to the World Cup.

Getting enough raw materials into the country on time to facilitate the completion of the state’s numerous ongoing infrastructure projects has been one of the biggest challenges cited by construction and logistics experts in Qatar.

Thales was also previously awarded a contract to provide security for Hamad International Airport (HIA).

According to its website, the firm is responsible for delivering and installing an integrated security and communication systems for the airport, including the passenger terminal complex and the airport campus facilities. The scope of works includes 12,000 CCTV cameras, 3,000 access control points and 150Km of fiber optic backbone.

In December last year, Thales also signed a contract with QDVC for the delivery of communication and control systems for the Lusail Light Rail, it said. This includes providing telecommunications and security, supervisory control and data acquisition, automatic fare collection, fire detection and maintenance management.

Known as OneSKY, the new $600 million system will be developed in conjunction with Thales Australia and is expected to have inital capability within three years and final roll-out done by 2021.

According to Airservices, OneSKY will enable new levels of operational and cost efficiency and safety, while reducing delays for the traveling public and improving environmental outcomes.

“It is now time to look to the next 20 years and seize this once-in-a-generation opportunity to replace the ageing systems used by Airservices and RAAF controllers with a single, national solution,” said Airservices CEO Margaret Staib.

“This will allow us to provide operational efficiency improvements for future growth and ensure we are meeting the demands of our customers and delivering them value for money.

“Importantly, it will also deliver a range of benefits to our customers, stakeholders and ultimately to the travelling public.”

The current system used by civilian air traffic controllers The Advanced Australian Air Traffic System (TAAATS) was commissioned in 1998 and has had 200 incremental changes since then.

Thales Australia, Airservices and the RAAF signed a Forward Services Agreement to go ahead with developing OneSKY at the Australian International Airshow last week.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9997772574424744}",positive,0.9997772574424744,1
Lusail light rail systems contract awarded - International Railway Journal,"Wed, 11 Mar 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJhaWxqb3VybmFsLmNvbS9wYXNzZW5nZXIvbGlnaHQtcmFpbC9sdXNhaWwtbGlnaHQtcmFpbC1zeXN0ZW1zLWNvbnRyYWN0LWF3YXJkZWQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales' integrated solution will provide real-time passenger information, contactless ticketing, passenger security systems and supervision. The contract also includes maintenance services and logistical support.

Lusail's four-line light rail network, which will cover 32km and serve 37 stations, will form the backbone of public transport in the new city located 23km north of Doha and which is expected to house 260,000 people. The network comprises 22.7km of at-grade and elevated railway and 10.4km of cut-and-cover construction, plus 10 underground and 26 surface stations.

QDVC secured all three construction contracts for the network beginning with two initial contracts signed in 2007 and 2012. This involved construction of 7km of tunnel, seven underground and four at-grades stations. QDVC subsequently secured a €2bn design-build contract for the remainder of the network in a consortium with Alstom in June 2014.

This contract encompasses construction of the remaining 25 stations, the depot, architectural and electro-mechanical works and project management. Alstom will supply 35 LRVs, and provide catenary-free electrification, power supply, track, signalling, telecommunications and train control for its €750m share of the contract.

The LRT network will connect with both Qatar's national railway network and the Doha metro, which is now under construction. The first line is expected to open in 2018 followed by the remaining three lines in 2020.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999983549118042}",neutral,0.999983549118042,0
LU confirms delay for sub-surface lines resignalling - Rail Technology Magazine,"Tue, 24 Mar 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJhaWx0ZWNobm9sb2d5bWFnYXppbmUuY29tL1JhaWwtTmV3cy9sdS1jb25maXJtcy1wbGFucy1mb3ItY29udGludWF0aW9uLW9mLXN1Yi1zdXJmYWNlLWxpbmVzLXNpZ25hbGxpbmfSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LU confirms delay for sub-surface lines resignalling

The budget for the new signalling system for London Underground’s (LU’s) sub-surface lines has increased by 30% while the expected completion date has been pushed back until 2022. This is likely to also affect the introduction of new stock under the New Tube for London programme

Thales, whose SelTrac CBTC (communications-based train control) system was successfully implemented on the Northern Line, following a more difficult resignalling of the Jubilee Line, has been contracted to do the work on the Circle, District, Hammersmith & City and Metropolitan lines, following the termination of a contract with Bombardier.

The new £5.54bn budget is a 30% increase from the original £4.26bn, which LU says will provide cover for a more realistic price for the new signalling contract, a longer overall programme, and additional infrastructure works and costs identified as necessary.

LU is in the final stages of negotiating a position with Thales and believes that the new price will be in line with, or below, the cost per kilometre of modernising the Northern Line signalling.

Work is expected to begin later this year; however the previous completion date of 2018 will not be met. Customers will start to see the benefits of the work on the Circle Line in 2021, with all four lines completed in 2022.

The plan uses an ""even further improved"" version of the system built by Thales, now successfully operating on the Jubilee and Northern lines.

The new Thales signalling system will allow the Circle Line to run trains up to every four minutes instead of 10, and once LU adds in additional District, Hammersmith & City and Metropolitan line services there will be trains every two minutes across much of this part of the network in Central London.

Mike Brown, MD of LU, said: “Having modernised three of the most heavily used lines we now need to bring the next four lines in to the modern era. To do so is absolutely vital to us continuing to effectively support London's new economic growth, housing and jobs as London’s population grows from 8.6 million today to 10 million in 2030. The work will transform for the better the journeys of millions of our customers – cutting journey times, wait times and crowding and ensuring journeys are more reliable.

“The scale and complexity of the work and the need to keep London moving as we do it means that it will take several years. In the meantime we are continuing to deliver a better, more reliable service – with delays now at their lowest ever level. We are all focused on getting the next major phase of modernisation underway as soon as possible so all of our passengers, across the city, can get the type of modern Underground which we already are seeing on other parts of the network.”

The District, Circle, Metropolitan and Hammersmith & City lines together make up nearly 40% of the network and include the oldest part of the network, built in 1863.

Once these four lines have been completed, LU will ""then move on"" to buying new trains and control systems for the Piccadilly, Central, Bakerloo, and Waterloo & City lines, it said. This implies a substantial delay in the programme to introduce new rolling stock.
