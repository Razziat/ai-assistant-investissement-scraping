France probes Thales subsidiary over past ID deals in Africa - Biometric Update,"Tue, 14 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpb21ldHJpY3VwZGF0ZS5jb20vMjAyMzAyL2ZyYW5jZS1wcm9iZXMtdGhhbGVzLXN1YnNpZGlhcnktb3Zlci1wYXN0LWlkLWRlYWxzLWluLWFmcmljYdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A subsidiary of Thales – Thales Digital Identity and Security (Thales DIS) — known as Gemalto before the acquisition in 2019, is under heat from judicial authorities in France over accusations that the company got involved in unorthodox practices to secure juicy ID document contracts in six African countries.

According to French investigative publication Mediapart, which first reported the story, Gemalto paid bribes or used other unfair channels like intermediaries or lobbyists to secure at least 10 contracts between 2015 and 2019 to produce different ID documents for Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Gabon, Niger, Senegal and Uganda.

Thales says it is cooperating fully with the investigations into “contracts won by Gemalto before its acquisition by Thales in 2019.”

Per Mediapart, the investigations were set off in 2021 following a report by Tracfin, an intelligence service under the French Ministry of the Economy and Finance.

The report, which was sent to the National Financial Prosecutors’s Office, raised suspicion over some of Gemalto’s foreign contracts.

Acting on the report, officials sent a judicial document requisition to Thales last October, and the company turned over documents from the office of Thales DIS to investigative gendarme officers.

After the conclusion of preliminary investigations which lasted for many months, a full judicial probe was eventually opened in June 2022 and investigators are seeking to establish whether Gemalto was involved in corruption, aggravated money laundering and criminal association, notes Mediapart.

The publication says it has obtained a document which shows the probe is related to government contracts for the production of ID documents such as national ID cards, passports, voter ID cards and vehicle license plates.

These include a contract for national ID cards in Gabon in 2015, three contracts including one for ID cards won in Cameroon between 2015 and 2018, and other contracts in Senegal, Uganda, DR Congo and Niger awarded in 2017.

Elaborating on the case of DR Congo, Mediapart says the investigation partly has to do with information revealed by some partner media outlets in November 2021, relating to a $46 million biometric voter registration contract obtained by Gemalto in 2016. It is reported that the company engaged in serious lobbying through an intermediary to be able to get the contract. Once it won the contract, the company allegedly replaced a local subcontractor with a French one.

About Senegal, the probe is said to be looking to unravel how much Gemalto paid to a Senegalese intermediary to get a €13.8 million (US$14.8 million) driver’s license and license plate contracts in the West African country in 2017, notes Mediapart.

Another part of the investigation is digging into how Gemalto used an intermediary Israeli group, based in Hong Kong, to negotiate two contracts in Cameroon, and one other in Senegal.

Thales says cooperating with investigations

Contacted by Mediapart, Thales emphasized that the probe has to do only with contracts the subsidiary won before it was snapped up in 2019.

Notwithstanding, the company says it is fully cooperating with the investigators in the process of establishing the truth of the matter.

In a statement to AFP, cited by Le Figaro, Thales adds that all its contractual transactions are in conformity with national and international regulations and that it maintains its zero tolerance policy against corruption and influence peddling.

This post was updated at 2:46pm Eastern on February 16, 2023 to clarify that the documents obtained by officials were turned over on request, not found during a judicial search.

The contract for the FTUAS / Peregrine system will see a rotary-powered UAS, fitted with powerful naval surveillance sensors suite, deployed to help protect a Type 23 frigate on operational tasking.

Thales press release

International navies now find themselves increasingly threatened by a range of hostile platforms, often in congested maritime environments. The ability for an uncrewed rotary aircraft that can launch quickly and then provide long-range mission endurance and the ability to find, fix, track and identify targets will bring additional protection for the ship and its crew gaining them invaluable time to prepare and respond.

Thales will act as the lead systems integrator for the programme that brings together an unrivalled combination of proven UAS capability from Schiebel and a range high precision intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance sensors and systems from Thales.

Schiebel will provide its operationally proven CAMCOPTER® S-100, a highly-effective uncrewed air system which already has more than 100,000 operating hours, including demanding deck-launched operations in challenging winds and sea states.

The S-100’s sensors, supported by an Automatic Identification System and fused together with the CarteNav AIMS Mission System provides the operator the ability to detect and identify unknown targets quickly.

The Thales I-Master radar can be operated in both Synthetic Aperture Radar and Maritime Moving Target Indication modes and once it detects and finds a contact, the on board electrooptical/infra-red sensor is cross-cued to perform the identification.

High-definition imagery and radar data is downloaded to the human operator and disseminated in real time through the host ship’s Combat Management System and made available to multiple users.

This partnership will bring together a combined 30 years of experience in UAS design, integration, test and operations with the S-100’s proven track record. This combined capability is built on trusted solutions that deliver real value with immediate effect.

Hans Georg Schiebel, Chairman of the Schiebel Group, said:

“We are immensely proud that the CAMCOPTER® S-100 is the UK Ministry of Defence’s choice for its prestigious Peregrine programme. The S-100 is the optimal UAS for a growing number of Navies worldwide and has proven its superiority and outstanding capabilities throughout its numerous operational deployments.”

Alex Cresswell, CEO of Thales in the UK, said:

“This is a significant milestone for the Royal Navy as it is an immediate enhancement to its operational capability, but it also supports their strategic transition to uncrewed technology in line with their Future Maritime Aviation Force strategy. I am pleased that our long tradition of supporting the Royal Navy’s ‘eyes and ears’ situational awareness capability continues with this latest contract.”

7 Greek philosophers and their brilliantly flawed explanations of nature - Big Think,"Thu, 23 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vYmlndGhpbmsuY29tL3RoaW5raW5nLzctZ3JlZWstcGhpbG9zb3BoZXJzLWJyaWxsaWFudGx5LWZsYXdlZC1leHBsYW5hdGlvbnMtbmF0dXJlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The ancient Greek philosophers produced a vast array of ideas. While thoughts on how to live occupied much of their attention, they also wondered exactly what constitutes the world around us. It doesn’t matter that many of their conjectures turned out to be several leagues wide of the mark — they still blazed a conceptual trail for humankind and our attempts to understand the nature of reality.

Thales: Everything is water

For Aristotle, Thales was the OG: the very first philosopher. Living in Miletus — an ancient Greek city located in modern-day Turkey — during the 6th century BC, Thales is known for his work in philosophy, astronomy, and mathematics.

He also attempted to explain the origin of all substances, deeming water the arche — the first principle from which all others followed. He maintained that water would transform into other substances, and all substances could revert to water. In retrospect, Aristotle (384-322 BC) offered several reasons Thales might have selected water, most of which are simple observations about how life requires water and how the substance can transform from one state to another. It is thought that Thales also argued that the Earth was a sphere that floated on a sea of water. The occasional shifting of the planet in this sea, he reasoned, was the cause of earthquakes.

Aristotle tells us Thales was the first named individual in the history of Greece to be unsatisfied with mythological explanations of the world around him, and then tried to offer alternatives through reasoning. Regardless of his misguided notion that earth could arise from water — which was scientifically disproved as late as 1768 — Thales deserves our lasting admiration for starting a long tradition of trying to explain the world rationally, using only observable evidence.

Anaximander: The endless aperion

A contemporary (and likely student) of Thales also living in Miletus, Anaximander was the first Greek philosopher to have written his ideas down. He also advanced what might be considered the first philosophical arguments for his position in contrast to Thales’ empirical observations. He is also said to have made the first map of the world known to the Greeks.

Anaximander looked at the four classical elements — water, air, fire, and earth — and argued that none could be the arche. These elements were limited, finite, and tended to cancel each other out. Instead, he proposed a new substance called the apeiron, which translates to “the unlimited” and was supposed to be infinite.

He also theorized about the cosmos. Anaximander was the first to argue that the celestial bodies made full circles as they moved through the night sky, a major step forward in astronomy. Furthermore, he argued that the Earth was floating in empty space and that the celestial objects we see were not all equidistant — essentially inventing the concept of outer space.

While these ideas have outlived their usefulness, several were major advancements — he more or less originated philosophical arguments that thinkers like Aristotle and Plato would later refine.

Anaximenes: Everything is air

The last of the great Milesian philosophers, Anaximenes is recorded to have worked and likely studied under Anaximander. He moved away from his teacher’s idea of a separate substance that became the elements we interact with, and proposed that air was the arche. He implied that air was semi-divine and possibly infinite in scope.

Unlike his predecessors, however, he also laid out a theory for how this worked. First, he proposed that condensed air cools and becomes water and earth. When diluted, air warms up and becomes fire. He even pointed out that this could be tested by blowing on your hand with either a wide or narrowly opened mouth. Next, he associated heat and dryness with rarefying air, whereas moisture and lower temperatures were related to condensing air. Then, turning to the cosmos, he posited that air was also the foundation of the stars, which operated just like burning objects on Earth.

With his proposals, Anaximenes introduced into Western thought the idea of an empirically backed theory of transformation that can be discussed and tested. His 2,000-year-old notion that the laws of nature apply in the cosmos just as they do on Earth was proven by Isaac Newton in the early 18th century.

Heraclitus: Flux and fire

Heraclitus was a philosopher from Ephesus (like Miletus, in modern-day Turkey) who lived in the 6th century BC. While his work was likely a response to the Milesian philosophers, he isn’t thought to have studied with them. In his writings, only fragments of which survive, he said that the world has always existed and is based on “ever-living fire,” and that everything is constantly changing.

Heraclitus introduced a system by which the elements transform into one another, however misguided the details appear to the contemporary mind. For example, he explains: “The turnings of fire: first sea, and of sea, half is earth, half firewind.” Furthermore, he maintained that this process can also work backward and that the proportions of matter are maintained.

He argued that the Universe is in constant flux, with nothing ever the same for more than a moment. A quote attributed to Heraclitus — “No man ever steps in the same river twice” — is deceptively profound and has significant implications for the usefulness of empirical knowledge.

Parmenides: The world of unity

A philosopher from Elea (a Greek colony in modern Italy) around the year 500 BC, Parmenides is perhaps the greatest of the pre-Socratic thinkers. Traditionally named “On Nature,” his masterwork was an 800-verse poem on the nature of reality, in which he argues that the world we see is an illusion. The real nature of the world is unavailable to our senses but accessible to us through reason. Furthermore, this “real” world is unchanging, unified, and timeless.

His arguments begin with the idea that we cannot have a rational concept of “nothingness.” Since nothingness can’t exist, he held there was no empty space. (Quantum mechanics has shown this to be correct.) Without empty space to move into, he maintained motion was impossible. He continued in this way until he refuted the ideas of change, difference, and ending. He then turned to the world we interact with, explaining it as mere appearances.

His influence on Western thought has been substantial, particularly through Plato. Zeno, the famed maker of paradoxes, supported Parmenides’ ideas, which continue to influence the philosophy of time. His proposition that our senses are useless when looking for truth has proven enduring. (Immanuel Kant made a similar argument.) Other pre-Socratic philosophers had to engage with his ideas to be taken seriously.

Democritus: Atoms

Born in Abdera (an Ionian colony) in 460 BC, Democritus was a prolific author who wrote on everything from ethics to botany. Although we have only what others say about him to go on (none of his work survived), it is clear that he was among the first thinkers to propose the idea of an atom.

Democritus, or perhaps his teacher Leucippus, laid out a theory called “atomism.” He argued that it was impossible to divide matter infinitely, as there must come a point where something can no longer be divided in half. Then, you have an atomos, meaning “not divisible.”

The atoms, which he argued move through empty space, build up the entire world based on their shape, arrangement, and position at a given time. The qualitative features of the world are not inherent to atoms, but are caused by the interaction of the atoms that make up external objects and the ones that make up our bodies.

Greek atomism was entirely speculative — it wasn’t until the early 19th century that physical evidence for atoms was produced — and Democritus earned the respect of those who disagreed with him. Among them was Aristotle, who praised Democritus for his reasoning ability while rejecting atomism. The idea would be revisited centuries later when thinkers like Galileo and Descartes explored similar philosophical territory.

Plato: The Forms

Working primarily in Athens during the 4th century BC, Plato remains a towering figure among philosophers. His thinking went beyond the ideas of his teacher, Socrates, and influenced essentially all subsequent Western and Middle Eastern philosophy. In addition, he founded the Academy in Athens, where many great minds studied, including Aristotle.

Plato wrote on many subjects, including metaphysics. His Theory of Forms was based on pre-Socratic ideas. He argued that the world in which we live is an imperfect copy of the world of “Forms”: the unchanging, non-physical, enduring essences of all things. Everyday objects, like chairs, are flawed reproductions of the “Form of chairness.” The same is true of everything that exists in the physical world.

Plato argues (like Parmenides, to some degree) that the foundational element of reality is mathematical and idealistic. He agrees with Heraclitus that the world we interact with is always changing, and he borrows ideas on how the elements could transform into one another — and what those elements are — from the Milesians.

Significantly, Plato opened his own theory to question. The Dialogue Parmenides, which depicts a fictitious meeting between Socrates and Parmenides discussing the Forms, appears to show either his rejection of the theory later in his life or the need for revisions to it.

Plato’s legacy remains incomparable. Alfred North Whitehead put it best: All Western Philosophy is a series of footnotes to Plato."
AURA AERO and Thales collaborate to decarbonate regional aviation by developing connected avionics solutions - Thales,"Thu, 02 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi93b3JsZHdpZGUvYWVyb3NwYWNlL3ByZXNzX3JlbGVhc2UvYXVyYS1hZXJvLWFuZC10aGFsZXMtY29sbGFib3JhdGUtZGVjYXJib25hdGUtcmVnaW9uYWwtYXZpYXRpb27SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"AURA AERO and Thales collaborate to decarbonate regional aviation by developing connected avionics solutions Share this article

The reinvention of avionics is at the heart of the challenges for safer and more sustainable flights. AURA AERO and Thales are combining their expertise in a project for the development of new generation connected avionics solutions for regional aviation.





AURA AERO, a pioneer in decarbonated aviation, has signed an agreement with Thales, leader for embedded avionic systems, in order to jointly develop a new generation connected avionics solution, adapted to electric and hybrid regional aviation.

To this day, most regional aircraft are old generation ones, using fossil energy. In view of today’s and tomorrow’s climate challenges, the strong movement of innovation launched by the aeronautical industry welcomes the arrival of new electric and hybrid aircraft.

The level of innovation introduced by these new aircraft is not only about their new propulsion modes. It is part of an overall logic that has already been adopted by other industries like the automotive industry, aimed at taking advantage of a greater balance between material, software, connectivity and services. This approach will help adapt the operations of these new aircraft to their environment through all their lifecycle, by maintaining their operational capacity at the highest.



​Tomorrow’s connected avionics are a strong contributor to the reduction of the environmental footprint, offering in particular hybridation management and real-time trajectory optimization. They will also make viable a new operational mode, where regional aircraft, that can be operated by a single pilot, will perform point to point flights towards secondary airports.

Thales is committed to the development of tactical and connected avionics solutions which will revolutionize the flight experience by giving the pilot quicker and more intuitive access to information, for easier decision-making.

AURA AERO, initiator of the ERA (Electric Regional Aircraft) project, the very first European 19-seater hybrid-electric propulsion regional transport aircraft, and Thales have decided to work together on the development of a global avionics suite specifically adapted for ERA, including a cockpit solution, a secure land-air connectivity solution and a digital platform.

Jérémy Caussade, co-founder and President of AURA AERO, says : “We are very happy to be able to establish this partnership withThales, since the development of decarbonized aviation is not limited to propulsion systems. It also requires many other innovations including the avionics. This objective is a first step and I have no doubt that these innovations will find other applications. By combining the best digital technologies with our experience as a manufacturer, we want to pass a new milestone in the energy transition of aviation.”"

The Commission made the announcement in December 2022, following a call for proposals published in February of the same year. The aim of the pilot schemes is to test the deployment of the EU Digital Identity Wallet in priority use cases such as banking and eGovernment services, and across national borders. These projects will support successful implementation of eIDAS 2, the EU regulation that obliges all member states to make a digital identity wallet available to every citizen who wants one.

“We are pleased to contribute to two of the selected consortia, namely POTENTIAL and NOBID, alongside our customers and partners in the identity, banking and telecom industries,” commented Youzec Kurp VP - Identity & Biometric Solutions at Thales.

“We will make available our expertise in digital security, digital identity and digital payments to best support what we consider a pioneering initiative, which will advance digital security and sovereignty another step forward in Europe while ensuring more convenient services for citizens.”

The POTENTIAL Consortium will test six use cases (“Electronic Government services”, “Bank account opening”, “SIM registration”, “Mobile Driving Licence”, “Remote Qualified Electronic Signature”, and “Electronic Prescription”) across 19 EU member states and Ukraine. Thales, is working alongside a total of 148 participants within the consortium, chosen by the European Commission to build and explore such a wide range of use cases.

In parallel, the NOBID Consortium has been chosen to conduct pilots of pan-European payments based on the EU Digital Identity Wallet. NOBID encompasses six countries (Denmark, Germany, Iceland, Italy, Latvia and Norway) and includes leading digital government agencies, banks and enterprises, as well as European technology providers such as Thales. NOBID’s pilot schemes will leverage existing payment infrastructure to enable payment issuance, instant payments, account-to-account transfers and payment acceptance both in-store and online.

The new consortia were created to shape the future of digital identity, and respond to citizens’ expectations in terms of both user-friendliness and data security and privacy. A recent survey of 1800 European citizens conducted by Thales shows that nearly 7 out of 10 people are looking forward to the EU Digital Identity Wallet. Expectations are even higher among those already using some form of national digital identity scheme. Unsurprisingly, the survey also shows that security is a key issue for 66% of respondents. The work of the recently announced consortia will therefore play a crucial role in ensuring that the EU Digital Identity Wallet lives up to the aspirations of governments, service providers and citizens throughout Europe."

ADS-B (Automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast) is one of the state-of-the-art solutions for civil aviation surveillance and the first technology of its kind that Thales will install in South America.

Contract with DECEA provides for the installation of 66 fully redundant stations in more than 20 Brazilian States.

These sensors will play a key role in optimizing traffic, thus reducing fuel and increasing passengers safety, providing full coverage of the Brazilian continental airspace above FL245

Thales, a global leader in air mobility high technology, announces another partnership with the Brazilian Airspace Control Department (DECEA), the agency of the Brazilian Air Force in charge of air traffic management. Thales will supply and install ADS-B sensors for enhanced safety of commercial civil aviation. These sensors are one of the most modern solutions for air traffic surveillance and the first of its kind deployed by Thales in South America. Thales will install the ADS-B sensors in locations across over 20 Brazilian states.





The ADS-B receives information from the aircraft, such as position, speed, and identification, via transponder, supplementing the surveillance already carried out by secondary radars and providing a much more comprehensive range of data for flight control teams located at airports.

The sensor works as a double-checking, which is deemed a basic premise in civil aviation security procedures. No interference from pilot or flight operators is required, and the data is updated ten times faster than that of current radars. In addition, the sensor is a small piece of equipment, easy to install and maintain, that does not require a high investment in infrastructure.

The contract with DECEA was awarded to Thales after an intense international competition, with the participation of several providers of Air Traffic Management (ATM) equipment, demonstrating, once again, the company's competitiveness and the long-standing trust of the Brazilian Air Force (FAB) in the Group. With more than 130 installed air surveillance radars and more than 200 Navaids in operation in Brazil and a 20 year relationsip between Thales and DECEA, the Group is proud to share the 1.000th air traffic surveillance radar milestone in Brazil.

In all, Thales will provide 66 stations. Sutech, a company specializing in deployment of aviation systems and infrastructure, will partner with Thales in the agreement and be responsible for gradually installing the sensors in four phases.

ADS-B is on the list of recommendations from the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), an entity linked to the United Nations (UN) to develop principles and techniques for safe international air navigation. It is a type of technology already widely used in countries where air traffic isintense , such as the United States, and can be an alternative to minimize the overload of traditional radar systems."

Supporting Ukraine's air defences

The contract signed by the Ukrainian defence ministry, the French defence ministry and Thales covers the delivery of a complete short-range air defence systems, including a GM200 radar, a command-and-control centre, a radio communications system and air target designators.

The visit to Limours by the two defence ministers included a tour of Thales's military radar design, production and support facilities.

Today, Thales's Limours site is recognised as Europe's largest centre of expertise in the field of air defence.

A complete threat detection and protection system for Ukraine

To keep populations and the armed forces safe, threats must be detected as early as possible whenever and wherever they arise – at sea, in the air or on land.

To defeat modern threats, which are more discreet, more manoeuvrable and faster than ever, air defence systems must be capable of detecting and tracking any type of target and providing actionable data on objects in motion in the air, on land or on the surface of the sea.

Thales has long-standing expertise in every aspect of air defence, from drone countermeasures to anti-ballistic missile defence: surface radars, airborne radars, command centres, communication systems and equipment, and different types of effectors.

The GM200 and the other surface radars in the Ground Master family offer an effective response to the types of threats faced by Ukraine, which include drones and long-range threats such as cruise missiles, helicopters and combat aircraft.

As a recognised European leader in systems integration, Thales has the capability to integrate air defence systems-of-systems and to manage compatibility with other defences, which is a real advantage for users needing to deploy their assets quickly and efficiently."

How important is it for Thales to be included once more in this Top 100?

Bernhard Quendt: First of all, it’s a fantastic mark of recognition for our teams of engineers and researchers, and something they should be proud of. It’s also the reward for an ambitious research and technology strategy built on collaboration and openness, because this list also acknowledges our long-established policy of partnerships with research centres and public and private institutes, such as the Atomic Energy Commission, the National Scientific Research Centre (CNRS) and Ecole Polytechnique in France, for instance, or Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University. We have around 150 co-owned patents with the CNRS alone!

Philippe Keryer: If I may, I’d like to mention another reason for us to be pleased: our being on the list for the tenth time is the longest-standing run of any French company.

Thales is a company of inventors: 3,500 of our employees – that’s some 10% of our research and technology teams – have at least one patent to their name.

Bernhard Quendt: It’s also interesting to note that the capacity for innovation doesn’t necessarily dwindle with the passing years. Some companies that have been around for a very long time, such as Toshiba (1875), GE (1876) and Thales (1893), are still at the forefront of technological innovation even today. That doesn’t mean, however, that we have no time for startups; on the contrary, we work with them on a daily basis, and have over 2,000 preferred partnerships.

How big a part do new technologies play in the patents that Thales files?

Bernhard Quendt: 45% of our innovations are digital-related, which is a significant indicator, given how important digital technology has become. And if we dig a little deeper, we see that of those 45%, 14% are related to artificial intelligence and data, 13% to cybersecurity, 11% to connectivity, and 3% to the Cloud.

As for quantum technology, it accounts for 2% of our patents. That may not seem much, but it is a clear indication that we’re already fully involved in the technologies of the future.

One of the things that characterizes Thales is how important the company considers upstream research…

Bernhard Quendt: Very true. What’s interesting is that this accolade highlights not just the quantity, but the quality of our patents. Nature magazine lists us as the number one company in Europe in terms of the quality of our research in the field of physics, thanks notably to our relationships with the world of public research.

There are many examples of innovations patented ten or fifteen years ago that can now be found in our products, which is a testament to their quality and durability: for example, III-V components, low-loss materials, and spectrum stretchers/compressors for high-power lasers.

At a time when climate issues are ever more significant, is Thales filing what might be called “sustainable” patents?

Philippe Keryer: We are, and it’s a trend that’s on the increase. Take the field of electronics, for example, and what we call SWAP (Size, Weight and Power), which is to do with reducing size and weight (and therefore power consumption): from neural networks to the neuromorphic architectures that will be part of the computing systems of the near future. We already have fifteen or so patent families for these architectures.

We are also doing a lot of work on eco-design. It only represents a tiny fraction of our patents – around 2% – but in actual fact many of our innovations contribute to energy efficiency, either because the energy is “returned” to the environment or because it’s converted into improved performance from the same carbon footprint."

How Massive IoT is changing the world - Thales,"Mon, 20 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi93b3JsZHdpZGUtZGlnaXRhbC1pZGVudGl0eS1hbmQtc2VjdXJpdHkvbW9iaWxlL21hZ2F6aW5lL2hvdy1tYXNzaXZlLWlvdC1jaGFuZ2luZy13b3JsZNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Estimated reading time: 5 minutes

The world's largest living organism is not an elephant or a whale. No, it's a fungus located in Oregon's Blue Mountains. The fungus has vast underground tendrils that spread out across 3.4 square miles (8.8 km 2), and is estimated to be up to 8,500 years old. For a few weeks a year, it produces mushrooms that poke out of the soil.

Oregon's 'humongous fungus' is a connected network that transmits information to a number of nodes across a vast and mostly invisible terrain. Remind you of anything? Yes, it is like nature's own Internet of Things. More precisely, it’s like nature’s Massive IoT.

So what exactly is the Massive IoT – and how is it different to other types of IoT?

Well, the distinction is really all about data volumes, latency, energy consumption and processing power. A Massive IoT describes a network with a very large number of connected devices. These machines typically collect data and transmit information back to a central server/cloud. Because of their limited capabilities (and often remote location), the ‘things’ are usually low-cost, low power and relatively 'dumb'. Think of agricultural sensors gathering information in fields, rivers and woodlands.

Now compare this with a critical IoT.

It's the opposite. It describes an IoT of super-advanced machines performing highly strategic functions. Critical IoT applications consume high quantities of data and power, demand low latency and (in many cases) must be available at all times. Think of autonomous vehicles and remote surgery.

Thanks largely to advances in cellular connectivity, the Massive IoT is in the middle of a dramatic growth spurt. Juniper estimates the total number of IoT connections will reach 83 billion by 2024, rising from 35 billion connections in 2020. Experts believe around half of these connected could be Massive IOT.

Meanwhile, in value terms, IndustryARC predicts the market for Massive IoT will grow by a CAGR of 7.1 percent to 2026 to hit $121.4 billion by 2026.



Massive IoT: the critical role of cellular networks

A key driver of the Massive IoT market is the advance in cellular communications. Why? Because any Massive IoT depends on reliable low power wide area network (LP-WAN) technology. This is different from the critical IoT, which demands high power and high speed in concentrated locations.

So what are the properties of a 'good' LP-WAN? There are three:

1. It should connect a large number of devices across long distances cost effectively.

2. It should connect and manage devices over long lifecycles.

3. It should build in security and trust also that users can be assured that devices and data are protected from interception by bad actors.

Obviously, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and other 'short distance' protocols cannot meet many of these requirements. Hence the importance of cellular networks, which have very broad reach.

But there’s a twist. Historically, cellular networks were built with people and phones in mind, not 'things'.

To illustrate the problem, take the example of soil sensors. Let’s say an agricultural company wants to install 5,000 of these small devices across hundreds of square miles. The sensors will be low in complexity – they will merely relay moisture and acidity readings – and most of the time they will be in sleep mode. They will also exist in harsh locations, and will be too remote for a human engineer to visit regularly.

Clearly, it would make no sense for the agricultural company to install 5,000 high-powered and expensive phone-type devices across its land for this purpose.



Network technologies for the Massive IoT: LTE-M and NB-IoT

By the 2010s, the mobile industry's technical standards body 3GPP had recognised the need to support an internet of low-maintenance low power devices. In 2016, it confirmed two new network technologies for the purpose: LTE-M and Narrowband-IoT.

The two standards differ in significant ways. LTE-M (also referred to as LTE Cat M1) uses the same spectrum and base stations as 4G/LTE, but is stripped down. It supports downlink and uplink speeds up to 1 Mbps with a latency of 50 to 100 ms. This makes it useful for real-time communications.

LTE-M has been rolled out extensively across existing LTE networks. According to GSMA, 60 operators were offering LTE-M service as of May 2022.

However, many machines do not need this even this modest bandwidth. For them there is NB-IoT ((also referred to as LTE Cat M2). NB-IoT uses simpler chips that require less power. It supports a maximum of 62.5 kbps and a latency of 1.5 to 10 seconds. Clearly, this is not suitable for real-time communication, but is fine for intermittent data transfers. As such, NB-IOT sensors can support up to 10 years of battery life.

According to the GSMA, 110 operators had launched NB-IoT networks by May 2022.



Massive IoT: the role of 5G

Now, we are entering the era of 5G. It's obvious how the ultra-high speed and low latency properties of 5G will accelerate the deployment of critical IoT. Use cases in remote surgery and autonomous transport are already rolling out.

But what impact will 5G have on the Massive IoT?

First it's important to state that the 3GPP has agreed that its NB-IoT and LTE-M technologies will continue evolving as part of the 5G specifications. In other words, NB-IoT and LTE-M will coexist in the same networks as other 5G components, such as enhanced mobile broadband and critical communications. All of this means that the investments of mobile operators are protected, and also that NB-IoT and LTE-M modules will be future-proofed.

In the 5G era, NB-IoT and LTE-M networks will go wider and support more devices than ever before. This is thanks to the unprecedented capacity of 5G, which boasts the following capabilities.

• Up to 100x number of connected devices per unit area (compared with 4G LTE)

• Support for 1 million devices for 0.386 square miles or 1 km2.

• 99.999 percent availability

• 100 percent coverage

• 90 percent reduction in network energy usage – meaning connected objects can operate for months or years without the need for human assistance.

• Up to 10-year battery life for low power IoT devices

A new type of SIM for a new type of connected device

Needless to say, it would not be possible for the Massive IoT to exist without changes to SIM technology. The plastic SIM card familiar to smartphone owners is unsuited to the world of connected things – too fiddly to insert in millions of small machines and not rugged enough to withstand extremes of temperature, humidity and vibration.

To meet these conditions, the industry developed a dedicated eSIM. It can be soldered into place, and activated remotely across the entire device lifecycle. And tech firms are refining eSIM tech all the time. For example, there are now smaller form factors, such as Thales’ ultra-compact MFFXS, which suit space-constrained designs.

And then there's the iSIM (an integrated form factor of eSIM), which will ship this year. This new form factor has support across the industry – it has been certified by the GSMA, Trusted Connectivity Alliance and the European Telecommunications Standards Institute. The iSIM is embedded on a tamper-resistant element in the device’s system-on-chip (SoC). It eliminates the need to depend on discrete SIM hardware and can be activated wirelessly using an industry-wide secure protocol. Crucially, it measures less than one-millimetre squared.

The GSMA is confident the new SIM form factors will accelerate the roll out of the Massive IoT. Its own research found 83 percent of enterprises consider eSIM to be important to the success of their IoT deployments.

Analyst firm Kaleido Intelligence backs up this confidence. It estimates more than 630 million devices will be iSIM-compatible in 2027, representing 19 percent of all eSIM shipments.



Massive IoT: applications and use cases

As 5G continues to proliferate across the planet, it will present thousands of businesses with the opportunity to digitally transform. Enterprises will be able to save costs, improve efficiency and generate new revenues by turning dumb machines into smart nodes on an intelligent network.

The benefits will be felt across a wide range of verticals such as:

Transport and logistics

Fleet management

Product tracking

Agriculture

Livestock tracking

Soil sensors

Climate monitoring

Environment

Flood alerts

Disaster planning

Atmospheric monitoring

Industrial/manufacturing

Predictive maintenance

Process monitoring

Utilities

Smart metering/grid

Smart cities

Parking

Traffic control

Lighting

Waste management

Bike/scooter fleet management

Cameras

Smart buildings

Alarm systems

Temperature control

Lighting

Access

Wearables

Fitness monitoring

Children/seniors

Medical tracking

This is the promise of the Massive IoT. But is not merely a hope for the future. Examples of the Massive IoT in action are already breaking out across a range of sectors.

Let's highlight a few.

Freight train tracking: Lineas

Belgian company Lineas is the largest private rail freight operator in Europe. Every day it sends thousands of trains and wagons across the continent. It serves customers across every industry from steel to chemicals to automotive and more.

In 2017, Lineas teamed up with Bosch to equip 2,600 wagons with track and trace sensors. The idea was to collect and relay data that could describe the location and functioning of the vehicles. Lineas engineers now use this information to assess the ‘health’ of the fleet and reduce maintenance work. The company says this has improved the available capacity of vehicles by more than 40 percent.

Smart shipping containers: CIMC

There are around 65 million shipping containers in use worldwide. These vessels are extremely important: they power the global economy. But it’s almost impossible to know where they are once they leave port.

New cellular technology is changing this. With the emergence of low orbit satellites, it’s possible to install IoT sensors that track everything from the location and temperature of the container to the amount of air flowing through it and the rate of condensation.

Shipping companies were among the first to make the most of these advances. In 2018, for example, China International Marine Containers (CIMC) teamed up with Telenor to launch its first shipping smart containers. As they travel, the vessels provide accurate information to the owners of both the container and the goods. Previously, all this information had to be retrieved from many different systems and locations.

Precision agriculture: CropX

The promise of Massive IoT is perfectly suited to the agricultural sector, in which farmers need to understand what is happening across vast and remote footprint. In the connected era, farmers can use a fleet of low-power, low maintenance sensors to collect information about soil quality, pests, water, atmospheric moisture and more.

And there are a huge number of technology specialists available to assist them. One is Israel’s CropX. It offers a solution comprising connected sensors and a software platform that synthesizes the data in order to deliver insights for better management and planning. CropX’s solutions are now deployed in more than 50 countries.

Smart buildings: The Edge Amsterdam

In modern buildings the business of maintenance is hugely demanding. There’s so much to consider – from energy consumption to air conditioning to access control. Now, IoT sensors are helping property managers to take control of this process, and to make significant savings.

The Edge in Amsterdam is a fine example. it claims to be smartest building in the world. It is home to more than 28,000 sensors and actuators, which track the flow of energy, data, heating and even people. The platform also links to an app that employees can use to find parking, desks and meeting space. Because of its smart properties, The Edge produces more energy than it consumes (it has solar panels)."

Harnessing the potential of drone swarms - Thales,"Sun, 26 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi9jb3VudHJpZXMtZXVyb3BlL3VuaXRlZC1raW5nZG9tL25ld3MvaGFybmVzc2luZy1wb3RlbnRpYWwtZHJvbmUtc3dhcm1z0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Harnessing the potential of drone swarms Share this article



LinkedIn

What were you doing in the first few minutes of 2023? You may well have been one of the millions who watched London’s firework display, and that choreographed display of 400 drones, dancing into formations including the late Queen Elizabeth and King Charles III.

Large numbers of drones working together like this are known as a swarm. As shown on New Year’s Eve, they can create something almost magical. But their potential goes way beyond entertainment. They can do anything from search and rescue to herding animals. From delivering parcels to boosting wi-fi signals in remote locations. Even catching criminals.

Drones on the beat

We know that policing budgets are under strain. So just think of the possibilities if you could use a swarm to help catch a criminal on the run. Let’s imagine it’s a man; he’s wearing black clothes; he’s within a certain geographical area. We’ve got a photo, but the quality isn’t great. So let’s send in the drones.

What we’re trying to do is eliminate as many people as possible from our enquiries. Somebody wearing blue? No. A woman? No. Some children? No. What about the dogs? No. The drones zero in, building a picture of the area, until they’ve eliminated all but ten people. But they can’t identify which one of these ten is the criminal because they can’t get a camera close enough.

We don’t want to give the game away just yet. So we send in tiny cameras to see if they can get facial recognition. The drones work together to get into position, get a good picture and identify the right person. They eliminate another five suspects, but we still need to narrow it down. We have to do something else in order to flush the right person out.

Let’s make it obvious that we’re looking. If one of these five people starts running, the situation changes. Commands from the central hub, which could be human-led or autonomous, say to grow the swarm. So we multiply our efforts until we’re sure we’ve got the right suspect.

The swarm reconfigures and a squad of drones follows the runner. They’re avoiding obstacles – humans, buildings, street furniture and cars. Using map reading abilities and determining his intent autonomously, the drones predict his route. They get ahead, to the sides, above and behind him: they’re there at every turn.

‘The drones work together to get into position, get a good picture and identify the right person. They eliminate another five suspects. Now we want to flush him out.’

At junctions, drones position themselves on all possible routes, never losing sight of the suspect. This is essential. Part of the swarm must always maintain contact, so we have what is called 100% track confidence. If the drone footage is ever needed in court, we need to show any ‘handovers’ from multiple perspectives, so it’s clear there are no breaks in recording.

Now back to our chase. The criminal changes tack and goes into a building; the autonomous processes kick in again. One or more drones look through the windows to try and spot him; perhaps they use infrared cameras to detect a heat signature. Others stay on standby, ready for the next phase. And what are the means of escape? Let’s reposition the swarm around all the exits so that we can keep tabs on him.

Officers on the street stay involved, ready to confirm the suspect’s identity and make an arrest. Working alongside the drones means they have been able to follow exactly what’s been going on the whole time – and at a fraction of the price of mobilising helicopters or extra officers. And once the job’s done, the swarm reconfigures and either comes back to base or goes off to do another job.

The continuous data that the drones are gathering – the initial detection, the following, the vectoring of the arresting force – will be available for use by the prosecution later.

The power of autonomy

Drones work autonomously, which means they can use data to make their own decisions without direct control by humans. Sound scary? It’s not. In fact, you’re probably already using it.

Think about your sat nav. What happens when you go against its instructions? Not a lot – it simply recalculates and gives you another option. It autonomously works out that you’ve taken a different turn, or passed that junction, but it knows the end result you’re after and it finds a new course to get you there.

Drones work autonomously, which means they can use data to make their own decisions without direct control by humans. Sound scary? It’s not. In fact, you’re probably already using it.

The autonomy of drones is very similar. The overall policy, goals and constraints remain under human control and are adjustable in real time. The drones combine these human-led rules with data from a variety of sensors: cameras, infrared or radar. They also use data from other sources, such as human intelligence (HUMINT) perhaps gathered by the police, and open-source intelligence (OSINT) which is publicly available on the internet and social media. They’ll have the technology to process all this data autonomously. Then they use what they’ve learned, and the ability to detect other drones and communicate with each other, to complete their task.

Of course, many tasks will be subject to change as they unfold. The autonomy means that each individual drone can make its decisions based on its own situation, the position of the swarm as a whole, and a host of external factors.

How Thales supports the safe use of drones

It is scenarios like these that Thales is helping become a reality. But the journey to get there involves grappling with and solving some fundamental challenges.

We deal with safety and mission-critical systems, which really matter to individual people, communities, countries and even the whole world. Using these systems to support autonomy requires substantial collaboration, government policy preparation and public engagement.

That’s why we’ve been working with the Trustworthy Autonomous Systems (TAS) Hub. As part of this collaborative research effort, we’re addressing six key research components – Verifiability, Functionality, Governance and Regulation, Resilience, Security and Trust – which underpin our work in the development of all autonomous technology.

The ultimate aim is to develop trustworthy autonomous systems that will benefit and be trusted by individuals, government and society as a whole. So that one day, the use of drones will be creative, responsible and a welcomed part of everyday life."
Thales pioneers Post Quantum Cryptography with a successful world-first pilot on phone calls - Business Wire,"Fri, 24 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc3dpcmUuY29tL25ld3MvaG9tZS8yMDIzMDIyNDAwNTAyNy9lbi9UaGFsZXMtcGlvbmVlcnMtUG9zdC1RdWFudHVtLUNyeXB0b2dyYXBoeS13aXRoLWEtc3VjY2Vzc2Z1bC13b3JsZC1maXJzdC1waWxvdC1vbi1waG9uZS1jYWxsc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS LA DÉFENSE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Thales, as a worldwide cybersecurity leader, has created the first real-world application of Post Quantum Cryptography (PQC) in its flagship secure ‘Cryptosmart’ mobile app, leveraging 5G SIM for PQC. In the pilot, hybrid cryptography (pre and post quantum crypto) was used in a phone call between two devices to protect the information exchanged during the call. Thales has invested and tested post-quantum cybersecurity technologies over the last decade in order to prepare for these emerging threats.

Even if today's quantum computer1 prototypes are still far from posing a threat to public key cryptography, it is critical to begin investigating resilient solutions. For example, there is a variant of ""store now, decrypt later"" attacks that consists in storing today's exchanged data and messages in order to decrypt these messages once Quantum Computers are available. This means the majority of digital infrastructure security based on public key cryptography (PKC) may already be vulnerable to a quantum attack.

Such threats are relevant for scenarios involving highly sensitive information, such as classified information exchanged over an encrypted phone call. To address these threats, Thales created a proof of concept to test the scalability and quality of its solutions, which range from 5G SIM cards to secure communication software.

This first real-world quantum protected mobile solution, which combines Thales' 'Cryptosmart' application and its 5G SIM, employs hybrid cryptography, as recommended by the NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology). ‘CRYSTALS-Kyber’, one of the four algorithms selected by the NIST2, is the PQC algorithm natively implemented in the 5G SIM and used by Cryptosmart application to encrypt the communication.

“Building defences against threats that do not yet exist may appear to be a daunting task. That is exactly the prospect that the global cybersecurity community faces with the impending arrival of quantum computing. The post-quantum era is still years away, but as quantum computing becomes more prevalent, practicing crypto agility now with such pilots and trials are helping Thales and its customers get prepared” said Philippe KERYER, Executive Vice President Strategy & Technology at Thales.

"Thales, Idemia, Veridos reportedly jostle for mega biometric ID card contract in DR Congo - Biometric Update","Tue, 07 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpb21ldHJpY3VwZGF0ZS5jb20vMjAyMzAyL3RoYWxlcy1pZGVtaWEtdmVyaWRvcy1yZXBvcnRlZGx5LWpvc3RsZS1mb3ItbWVnYS1iaW9tZXRyaWMtaWQtY2FyZC1jb250cmFjdC1pbi1kci1jb25nb9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Some big names in the biometrics and digital ID space such as French giants Idemia and Thales and Germany’s Veridos are said to be among those in the running for a mouth-watering contract to produce new generation national ID cards in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).

According to Africa Intelligence, talks of the new ID card contract in Africa’s fourth most populous country are resuming after the project was put on hold in 2020 over funding constraints.

Per the publication, the re-launched biometric ID card project is estimated at 400 million Euros (US$428 million) and will run for between six and eight years through a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) initiative.

A public-private partnership agreement was signed with Pangea late last year for $70 million to provide an automated biometric identification system for law enforcement and background checks. Dermalog won a $48 million contract to produce biometric passports for the DRC a month later.

Funding for the ID card project was reportedly supposed to be provided by the World Bank, in at least two installments, but the plan fell through, according to Africa Intelligence. These details cannot be corroborated at this time.

The move to select a company for the contract follows the adoption early last year of a draft decree setting up a new national ID card scheme under the auspices of the National Identification and Population Board (ONIP).

Meanwhile, speaking on the occasion of the international ID Day in 2021, ONIP director general Richard Ilunga underscored the importance of legal ID, and gave assurances that the government was taking steps to ensure new ID cards are delivered to citizens before May 2023.

“At the moment, almost 100 million citizens do not have an ID card. It is the responsibility of ONIP to set up a population registry and to oversee the issuance of IDs. That’s why it’s important to sensitize everyone on the importance of having the national ID card,” Ilunga said at the time as quoted by Actualité.cd.

DR Congo’s national population and national ID registry was initially planned to be set up by 2020.

This post was updated at 4:11pm Eastern on February 28, 2023 to reflect that World Bank can not corroborate some of the details reported.

Running a lean and clean PCB manufacturing machine - Thales,"Wed, 08 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi9jb3VudHJpZXMtZXVyb3BlL25ldGhlcmxhbmRzL21hZ2F6aW5lL3J1bm5pbmctbGVhbi1hbmQtY2xlYW4tcGNiLW1hbnVmYWN0dXJpbmctbWFjaGluZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Running a lean and clean PCB manufacturing machine Share this article

Panels that are over 10 meters long, that light up on request or that bend effortlessly – Thales’ Group Competence Center Printed Circuit Boards produces PCBs in all shapes and sizes. Tobi Oude Breuil explains how his team meets the high standards of customers like Airbus and ASML.

“We’re one of the few printed circuit board production facilities left in the Netherlands,” says Tobi Oude Breuil, general manager of Thales’ Group Competence Center Printed Circuit Boards (GCC-PCB). “Twenty years ago, there were more than a dozen, but for the obvious low-cost considerations, this capability has all but moved to the Far East. We’re still here thanks to our focus on 100 percent quality and our industrialization capability, both of which are resonating very well in markets like aerospace, defence and high tech, with customers like Airbus, ASML and Thales itself.”

Specializing in low volume, high complexity, the GCC-PCB produces customized board designs in all shapes and sizes. They consist of a substrate with metal foils, conductive pathways and patterns. On these bare boards, external assembly partners then place the electronic components. The resulting PCBAs, printed circuit board assemblies, as they’re called, go back to the customer, where they’re further integrated to form the backbone of some of the world’s most advanced systems.

Road markings and robot arms

Oude Breuil joined the GCC-PCB as general manager two years ago, coming from Thales’ IT department. “At that time, the center wasn’t doing a lot of work for the Thales Group,” he recalls. “We’ve managed to change that and attract more and more business from our international sister organizations, especially the defence and space divisions in France, the UK and also Belgium. We’re well underway to a more balanced portfolio of doing two-thirds for Thales in the Netherlands and one-third for the Group and external clients.”

“For Thales in the Netherlands, we produce the PCBs for the radar panels,” Oude Breuil goes on to illustrate. “Not just the little ones for the individual transceivers but also the big ones on which the antenna elements are integrated. We’re able to manufacture boards that are 10 meters long. With the new machines we bought this year, we can even go as long as we want – in theory, there’s no upper limit on the length anymore.”

“Together with a nearby startup, Hengelo-based Xcite Solutions, we’ve created electro-luminescent PCB technology,” gives Oude Breuil another example. “The boards get a coating that lights up when it encounters an electric current. This development is still in a pilot phase, but Xcite already has a couple of interesting applications in mind, one of them being road markings.”

The center also makes its fair share of flexible PCBs. These can be used to replace wiring. “We provide flexible circuit boards to connect the foldable solar panels on the space satellites of Airbus, for instance. PCBs are much lighter than cables and wires, take up much less space and can be more durable. Inside ASML’s wafer scanners, our flexible boards are being used in the robot arm to make it move and enable it to bend for much longer before any parts need replacing.”

Manufacturing lines

To create the board designs, there’s extensive collaboration between the GCC-PCB and its clients. “Our board specialists closely work together with our customers’ engineers to tweak a design so that it can be industrialized,” Oude Breuil elaborates. “In this process, we align their wishes with what we know is technically possible. Sometimes they want more, in which case we dive in together to see how far we can push the boundary. This is all still modeling, using electronic design data and CAD drawings.”

Once the design meets the approval of all parties, it’s transferred to the manufacturing floor. “We have a prototype line and a production line,” explains Oude Breuil. “We start by making a prototype, which is extensively tested by the client. This usually leads to some more design tweaks and some more protos. When everybody is happy, we commence series production – small series, typically a couple of hundred PCBs a year.”

Both manufacturing lines consist of four work cells. “In the first cell, a photosensitive film is applied to a copper laminate. Then, using direct imaging, parts of the photosensitive film on the board are exposed. After development, the unexposed parts are etched away, leaving the desired pattern of copper traces and pads. These steps are repeated to create up to a dozen inner layers, which are pressed together. In the second cell, the pressed inner layers are interconnected by drilling holes and plating these with copper. In the third cell, the outside pattern is covered in a green coating, the solder mask, to confine the soldering paste to the solder pads during component assembly. The pads on the surface remain accessible. In the fourth cell, the finished boards undergo a final inspection.”

“Each PCB is thoroughly inspected, not only at the end of the line but also along the way,” Oude Breuil points out. “Every layer is automatically optically checked to see if the patterns match the CAD design. Nothing goes out the door without a 100 percent quality stamp. This is one of the reasons why our customers value working with us.”

Clean and green

Next to this focus on quality, another key selling point is the center’s cleanliness. “Many PCB factories are very messy. We run a very tight and tidy ship,” notes Oude Breuil, smilingly. “We work according to the 5S model: sort, straighten, shine, standardize, sustain. Every Friday afternoon, we organize a maintenance session to keep our machinery spick-and-span. This really pays off. It helps to meet our delivery dates and keep our yield up – unplanned downtime is more expensive than these few hours of extra maintenance – and it helps to reel in customers. When people visit us, they’re amazed by how clean our facility is.”

Oude Breuil is also striving to run a green ship. “We have a lot of machines, most of which are operational from six in the morning to midnight. We have a lot of chemical baths that require heating. We have five cleanrooms that need to be optimally conditioned. Within Thales Netherlands, we’re probably one of the biggest energy consumers. We’re working hard to reduce our carbon footprint. We want to completely turn off the gas and switch to heat pumps. That’s looking very promising. And when buying new machines, we look closely at their energy consumption.”

The GCC-PCB still has quite a lot of legacy equipment in (occasional) use. “We have thousands of designs in our portfolio, some decades old. Navy vessels, for example, can remain in commission for forty years or even longer. On occasion, we’re asked to supply a replacement for one of the early boards. Such older designs require equally old production techniques, like conventional exposure for transferring the PCB patterns onto the copper. Customers really appreciate it that they can still turn to us with these special requests.”

In Hengelo, a team of almost seventy is ready to attend to their every need. “Fifty of them work in production and about a dozen in process and product engineering. Our process engineers closely follow the latest developments in the field and apply that knowledge to further optimize our manufacturing lines. Our product engineers closely work with our customers to optimize their designs. Like the boards we produce, the team is a mix of all shapes and sizes, young and old, male and female, theoretical and hands-on – coming from a desk job in an office environment, that’s really refreshing for me.”

When Rebellion Becomes Virtue: How the Scientific Method Came to Be - Literary Hub,"Tue, 28 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vbGl0aHViLmNvbS93aGVuLXJlYmVsbGlvbi1iZWNvbWVzLXZpcnR1ZS1ob3ctdGhlLXNjaWVudGlmaWMtbWV0aG9kLWNhbWUtdG8tYmUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales is traditionally considered one of the Seven Sages of ancient Greece—more or less historical figures recognized and honored by the Greeks as founders of their thought and institutions. Another of the Seven Sages is Solon, contemporary of Thales and Anaximander, the writer of the first democratic constitution of Athens. According to the traditionally accepted dates, Anaximander is only eleven years younger than his illustrious fellow citizen Thales.

We know nothing of the relationship Thales and Anaximander may have had. We don’t even know whether the speculations of thinkers such as Anaximander and Thales were private, or whether there was a school in Miletus along the lines of Plato’s Academy and Aristotle’s Lyceum. These schools brought together teachers and young students, and their activities included public discussions, lessons, and lectures. Texts from the fifth century BCE tell of public debates among philosophers. Did such debates already exist in Miletus of the sixth century BCE?

As I will discuss later, the sixth century in Greece was the first time in human history that the ability to read and write moved beyond a limited circle of professional scribes and became widespread in large sectors of the general population—essentially the entire aristocracy. Any elementary school pupil today knows that learning to read and write isn’t easy. It must have been even more challenging during the first centuries of the use of phonetic alphabets, when writing was far less widespread than today.

Someone needed to teach young Greeks how to write and read. I therefore think it is fair to believe that teachers, tutors, and schools must have existed in the major Greek cities of the time, though I have found no confirmation of this point. The combination of teaching and intellectual research that characterizes the philosophical schools of ancient Athens as well as the universities of today might very well have already been established in the sixth century BCE. In other words, I think it is reasonable to suppose that a true school existed in Miletus.

Whether or not such a school existed, it is nonetheless clear that Anaximander’s great theoretical speculations were born of and based on Thales’s work. The questions they ponder are identical: the search for the arche, the form of the cosmos, naturalistic explanations for earthquakes and other phenomena, and so forth. Thales’s influence is clear even in smaller details. Anaximander’s Earth is a disk, just like Thales’s. The intellectual relationship between Thales and Anaximander is very close. Thales’s reflections nourish and give rise to Anaximander’s theories. Thales is Anaximander’s teacher—figuratively and probably also literally.

Truth is veiled but may be approached by means of a sustained, almost devotional practice of observation, discussion, and reasoning, where mistakes are always possible.

It is important to consider in depth this close relationship of intellectual paternity between Thales and Anaximander, because it represents, in my view, perhaps the most important keystone of Anaximander’s contribution to the history of culture.

The ancient world teemed with masters and their great disciples: Confucius and Mencius, Moses and Joshua and the prophets, Jesus and Paul of Tarsus, the Buddha and Kaundinya. But the relationship between Thales and Anaximander was profoundly different from these. Mencius enriched and studied in depth Confucius’s thought but took care never to cast doubt upon his master’s affirmations. Paul established the theoretical basis for Christianity, far beyond what is in the Gospels, but never criticized or openly questioned the sayings of Jesus. The prophets deepened the description of Yahweh and of the relationship between him and his people, but they most certainly did not start from an analysis of Moses’s errors.

Anaximander did something profoundly new. He immersed himself in Thales’s problems, and he embraced Thales’s finest insights, way of thinking, and intellectual conquests. But at the same time he undertook a frontal critique of the master’s assertions. Thales says the world is made of water. Not true, says Anaximander. Thales says the Earth is floating on water. Not so, says Anaximander.

Thales says earthquakes are attributable to the oscillation of the Earth’s disk in the ocean upon which it floats. Not so, says Anaximander: they are due to the Earth’s splitting open. And he goes on from there. A still‑perplexed Cicero, centuries later, remarks, “Thales holds that all things are made of water But of this he did not persuade Anaximander, though he was his countryman and companion.”

Criticism was not absent from the ancient world—far from it. Take the Bible, for example, in which the religious thought of Babylonia is harshly criticized: Marduk is a “false god,” his “diabolical” priests are to be stabbed, and so forth. But between criticism and adherence to a master’s teaching there was no middle ground. Even in the generations following Anaximander, the great Pythagorean school—decidedly more archaic than Anaximander in this regard—flourished in reverence to Pythagoras’s ideas, which could not be questioned. Ipse dixit (“He himself said”) is an expression that referred originally to Pythagoras, meaning that if Pythagoras had made an assertion, it must be true.

Halfway between the absolute reverence of the Pythagoreans for Pythagoras, of Mencius for Confucius, of Paul for Jesus, and the rejection of those who hold different views, Anaximander discovered a third way.

Anaximander’s reverence for Thales is manifest, and it is clear that Anaximander leans heavily upon Thales’s intellectual accomplishments. Still, he does not hesitate to say that Thales is mistaken about this or that matter, or that it is possible to do better. Neither Mencius nor Paul nor the Pythagoreans understood that this narrow third way is the most extraordinary key for the development of knowledge.

In my view, modern science in its entirety is the result of the discovery of this third way. The very possibility of conceiving it can come only from a sophisticated theory of knowledge, according to which truth is accessible, but only gradually, by means of successive refinements. Truth is veiled but may be approached by means of a sustained, almost devotional practice of observation, discussion, and reasoning, where mistakes are always possible. The practice of Plato’s Academy is obviously based on this idea. The same is true for Aristotle and his Lyceum. All of Alexandrian astronomy grows out of the continuous questioning of the assumptions made by earlier masters.

Anaximander was the first to pursue this third way. He was the first thinker able to conceive and put into practice what is now the fundamental methodological credo of modern scientists: make a thorough study of the masters, come to understand their intellectual achievements, and make these achievements their own. Then, on the basis of the knowledge so acquired, identify the errors in the masters’ thinking, correct them, and in so doing improve our understanding of the world.

Consider the great scientists of the modern era. Isn’t this precisely what they did? Copernicus did not simply awaken one fine day and proclaim that the Sun was at the center of our planetary system. He did not declare that the Ptolemaic system was an illustrious bit of nonsense. If he had, he would never have been able to construct a new, effective mathematical representation of the solar system. No one would have believed him, and the Copernican revolution never would have occurred.

Instead, Copernicus was thunderstruck by the beauty of the knowledge reached by Alexandrian astronomy and summarized in Ptolemy’s Almagest, and he immersed himself fully in its study. He appropriated Ptolemy’s methods and recognized their efficacy; it was in this way, by exploring the nooks and crannies of Ptolemy’s work, that he came to recognize its limits and find ways to radically improve it. Copernicus is very much a son of Ptolemy: his treatise De revolutionibus orbium cœlestium is extremely similar in form and language to Ptolemy’s Almagest, so much so that one can almost call De revolutionibus a revised edition of the Almagest.

Ptolemy is unquestionably Copernicus’s master, from whom he learns everything that he knows and is useful to him. But to move forward, Copernicus must declare that Ptolemy is mistaken—not just in some detail, but in the most fundamental and seemingly best‑argued assumptions of the Almagest. It is simply not true that, as Ptolemy maintains in an ample and convincing discussion at the beginning of the Almagest, the Earth is immobile and at the center of the universe. Einstein and Newton have precisely the same relationship.

It is the triumphant beginning of scientific thought, the earliest exploration of the possible forms that thinking about the world can take.

And this is not just true for the great scientists: countless scientific articles of today have precisely the same relations to the works preceding them. The strength of scientific thinking derives from the continuous questioning of the hypotheses and results obtained in the past—a questioning that, just the same, takes as its point of departure a profound recognition of the knowledge value contained in these past results.

This is a delicate balance to strike, one that is anything but obvious and natural. In fact, as far as I can see, it is unknown in all of the human speculation that has come down to us from the first millennia of recorded history. This delicate process—following and developing the master’s path by criticizing the master—has a precise beginning in the history of human thought: the position that Anaximander assumed vis‑à‑vis his master Thales.

Anaximander’s novel approach immediately inspired others. Anaximenes, a few years younger than Anaximander, picked up on the idea and, as we have seen, proposed a modified and much richer theory of the arche, or first cause. Once the path of criticism was open, it could not be closed. Heraclitus, Anaxagoras, Empedocles, Leucippus, Democritus: not one of these thinkers hesitated to speak his mind on the nature of worldly things.

Only to an inattentive observer can this variety of viewpoints and crescendo of reciprocal criticisms seem a growing cacophony. Instead, it is the triumphant beginning of scientific thought, the earliest exploration of the possible forms that thinking about the world can take. It is the start of the road that has given us everything, or nearly everything, that we study and know about the world today.

According to a classic thesis, a scientific revolution comparable to the one in the West did not take place in Chinese civilization—despite the fact that for centuries Chinese civilization was in many ways broadly superior to the West—precisely because the master in Chinese culture was never criticized or questioned. Chinese thinking grew by elaborating on and developing established knowledge, never by questioning it.

This seems to be a reasonable thesis, because one can otherwise barely fathom the fact that Chinese civilization, so overwhelmingly great, never managed to understand that the Earth was round until the Jesuits arrived and told the Chinese so. In China, it seems, there was never an Anaximander.

Ukraine hails French gift of radar as 'cherry on the cake' - The Associated Press,"Wed, 01 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3J1c3NpYS11a3JhaW5lLWdvdmVybm1lbnQtYnVzaW5lc3MtZTM4ZDA2MzFjYzVhYmFkY2YzYTIxNDM2NmRlNjc5ZTLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LIMOURS, France (AP) — Ukraine’s defense minister said Wednesday that Ukrainian lives will be saved by a sophisticated air-defense radar that France is supplying and which is powerful enough to spot incoming missiles and exploding drones in the skies over all of Ukraine’s capital and its surrounding region.

The minister, Oleksii Reznikov, was so enthusiastic about what he called Ukraine’s new “electronic eyes” that he quickly coined a nickname for the Ground Master 200 radar — the “Grand Master.”

Speaking through an interpreter at a handover ceremony for the radar with his French counterpart, Reznikov described the French-made GM200 as a “very effective” improvement for Ukraine’s network of about 300 different types of air-defense radars.

Thales, the manufacturer, says the radar detects and tracks rockets, artillery and mortar shells, missiles, aircraft, drones and other threats.

“Because of your support, Ukrainian lives will be saved,” the minister said at the ceremony in Limours, where Thales makes the equipment.

“This radar will be the cherry on the cake,” he added. “That’s why it will be called ‘Grand Master.’”

The French defense minister, Sebastien Lecornu, said the GM200’s range of 250 kilometers (155 miles) would enable it to watch the skies over Kyiv and the Ukrainian capital’s surrounding region, although it wasn’t clear whether that’s where Ukrainian forces intend to deploy it.

The radar is transportable on a truck. Thales says it can be deployed in 15 minutes and be moved to another location in 10 minutes, making it a harder target to hit.

The minister was gifted a small model of the radar at the ceremony and brandished it with a big grin above his head.

Thales Alenia Space recently completed the assembly and testing of an engineering model of the solar array for our Space INSPIRE product line.

Thales Alenia Space recently completed the assembly and testing of an engineering model of the solar array for our Space INSPIRE product line. Featuring ground-breaking technology, this full-scale model will undergo vibration tests in the days ahead. The flexible solar array, aptly named SolarFlex, is a major first for Europe. SolarFlex has been developed by Thales Alenia Space and the Czech BSTG consortium, as part of Novacom II, the ARTES Partnership Project for the development of Space Inspire.

About SolarFlex

Based on patented Thales Alenia Space technology, the SolarFlex solar array wraps around a rail just like an automatic roller blind. The novel concept relies on latest-generation photovoltaic cells mounted on a flexible substrate. SolarFlex offers high power density, while taking up four to five times less space than before.

Space INSPIRE is itself a compact solution, built on a mid-sized platform, with the medium-term aim being to accommodate two such satellites under a launcher’s fairing. Its solar arrays must be equally compact. Automated photovoltaic assembly (PVA) of solar cells will be performed at Thales Alenia Space’s showcase Industry 4.0 facility in Hasselt, Belgium, with support from Belgian BELSPO.

The first SolarFlex flight model will fly on the ASTRA-1Q geostationary communications satellite ordered by Luxembourg operator SES in November 2021.

Our customers increasingly need the agility to develop advanced services and seize new business opportunities. Space INSPIRE is a digital, ultra-flexible solution that is fully reprogrammable in orbit, allowing operators to match capacity to demand anytime and anywhere, whatever the frequency band. With its software-defined technology, Space INSPIRE is a game-changer for the fast-moving communications market.

In 2022, Thales Alenia Space was awarded contracts for six out of ten competitively sourced telecommunications satellites, including 5 Space INSPIRE satellites. Our solution was chosen for Intelsat 41, Intelsat 44, ARABSAT-7A and SES-26, as well as Eutelsat’s Flexsat. For the second year running, Thales Alenia Space is number one in the geostationary communications satellite market.

The development of the Space INSPIRE product line is supported by CNES and by ESA’s Novacom II Partnership Project."

Thales has a total staff of 80,000, of which 40,000 are in France.

In an interview with French weekly Le Journal du Dimanche, Patrice Caine said that Thales had recruited 5,000 to 8,000 people per year over the past eight years and had already hired 11,500 new staff last year.

Caine said that all the firm's activities – defense and security, aeronautics and space, identity and digital security – were growing strongly.

""The company is a reflection of its markets, which are all seeing dynamic growth, with needs growing in all our fields of activity,"" he said.

Caine, who recently met with Ukraine's defense minister, said France would deliver its Ground Master 200 radar air defense system to Ukraine in May.

Since the start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, shares of Thales – Europe's largest arms electronics provider – have risen nearly 60% to new all-time highs, outperforming the Refinitiv Europe Aerospace & Defense index.

President Emmanuel Macron said in January that French military spending would increase by more than a third in coming years, with the 2024-2030 military budget set to rise to 413 billion euros ($447 billion), up from 295 billion euros in the 2019-2025 period as the army adapts to a new security environment following Russia's invasion of Ukraine."

Patrice Caine, Thales Group CEO

Thales Group CEO, Patrice Caine shares his thoughts on the role of engineers in today’s modern world.

Has engineering had its heyday? This might sound like an absurd question as we enter 2023 with an energy crisis in Europe, a global shortage of scientific and technical talent, and a renewed focus on industrial sovereignty.

Yet, despite all these challenges, we still see a growing wave of criticism, particularly in Europe, deeming technology as incompatible with a sustainable future.

In recent times, this way of thinking has even taken root in some French engineering schools, calling for students to change direction in the name of environmental protection.

""Technology is a large part of the answer to the social and environmental challenges we face""

Against this disturbing background, I feel it is important not to lose sight of some very pragmatic considerations – and to keep in mind that technology is a large part of the answer to the social and environmental challenges we face.

This is not to say that philosophers, sociologists and other humanities specialists have no role to play, because we are clearly going to need to fundamentally rethink certain aspects of our ways of life, our relationship with nature and perhaps even how we organise our societies. But in the short term at least, our priorities are to push ahead on renewables, roll out the next generation of heat pumps, develop new battery technologies, design passive-energy buildings, invent new low-carbon modes of transport, and so on. And how can we do that without engineers?

Whether we like it or not, our world is shaped by technology. It has been that way since our ancestors formed the first permanent settlements 15,000 years ago, and we know there is no going back now. Engineers will always have a decisive role to play, treading the fine line between protecting the planet and enabling our societies to grow and flourish. Others may have a deeper understanding of the natural world around us. But when it comes to how we interact with our environment, engineers hold the answers. To refuse this reality – to dismiss it as “techno-solutionism” – is to condemn ourselves to inaction and, ultimately, to a bleak future.

""If you want to change the world, become an engineer""

“If you want to change the world, become an engineer.” This is what we should be telling our children. Because it is this very discipline and vocation that constitute our only real lever for bringing about, on a relevant scale, new ways to produce, live and consume. Their insights hold the key to more informed policy-making and their role is crucial to the resurgence of industry in our countries.

Of course, today’s engineers apply different methods and doctrines from those of their predecessors, and operating within planetary boundaries will likely become an increasingly important aspect of their work. As an engineer myself, and as the head of a company that employs large numbers of engineers, I have experienced first-hand the shifts taking place in the academic world and in industry. Leading engineering schools have overhauled their curricula to sharpen their focus on climate change. And at Thales, for example, we have pledged to adopt eco-design principles for 100% of our new products starting this year.

Finding solutions to the complex problems we face – solutions that take environmental performance and resource scarcity into account – is precisely what engineering is all about. It is high time to restore engineering to its rightful place as a compelling vocation for young people around the world."
From the Bushmaster to Mine-Hunter Coastal: The Thales sovereign solution enhancing equipment situational ... - Thales,"Mon, 20 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi9jb3VudHJpZXMtYXNpYS9hdXN0cmFsaWEvbmV3cy9idXNobWFzdGVyLW1pbmUtaHVudGVyLWNvYXN0YWwtdGhhbGVzLXNvdmVyZWlnbi1zb2x1dGlvbi1lbmhhbmNpbmfSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"HMAS Diamantia – Copyright Australian Department of Defence

The Huon-class Mine Hunter Coastal Fleet has been a stalwart in Australia’s marine defence strategy for over 20 years. They are a ‘workhorse’ of a platform; a hardy ship with outstanding shock resistance and an inherently low magnetic signature.

As the fleet continues to provide critical mine countermeasure operations, both locally and abroad, it is imperative that the health of the ship’s equipment and environment are monitored and maintained.

Steve Laybutt, Project Engineering Manager, at Thales Australia has worked in the mine countermeasures space for 16 years and knew there was a way to enhance the current method of monitoring utilised by the Royal Australian Navy.

‘The MHC’s have been around for decades, and in order to keep them at their best operationally, we knew we could offer a solution that would utilise the ship’s own operational data to improve equipment status situational awareness.’

This solution is called the Health and Usage Management Systems, or HUMS, which is at its core, a Big Data management tool. It gathers and then analyses the ships internal control and monitoring data to get a wholistic view of operational performance.

It provides insights that allow for the team, both onboard and onshore, to not only monitor the current environment, but also retrospectively review performance; both elements of which are critical enablers to enhance the ship’s availability, safety and reliability.

While Steve knew what solution was needed, there was a slight challenge in that there were no Thales designed solutions in the maritime environment that would fit the bill.

So, Steve thought ‘out of the box’ or, to put it more accurately, ‘out of the ship,’ and approached the team who developed and implemented the HUMS on the Thales Australia sovereign designed and built, Bushmaster.

‘We wanted to reuse existing technology that the team had developed, and see whether we could. apply it to a different platform.’

Indeed, they could. Michael Fazio, one of Thales Australia’s Software Architects, worked with the team who designed the Bushmaster HUMS and knew it would start as a good reference point.

“When Steve approached me, I was pretty keen to help out. Initially we thought this would be a fairly simple job of hooking into onboard systems through existing interfaces to monitor their performance, however, that was not the case.”

Not ones to give up, Michael and his team undertook a range of complex activities in order to get the right capability for the customer. They wrote specialised software, monitored 7 months’ worth of the ships data and reverse engineered the information which resulted in a fully customised solution for the MHC, which was born from the Bushmaster.

The HUMS has been trialled for the last 12 months on the MHCs and is consistently providing valuable outcomes. It has been a key enabler in supporting condition-based assessments, rather than relying purely on planned maintenance activities, there has been a reduction in Urgent Defects, or URDEFS, and greatly improved confidence in root causes of equipment issues.

Like all innovators, it’s imperative to keep evolving technology in order to meet, and exceed, customer requirements. The team have been working diligently to refine the capability to make it a ‘modular solution,’ enabling it to be fitted to a range of platforms with minimal customisation."
"G+D, Thales, IDEMIA Lead 2022 Global eSIM Enablement Landscape - Counterpoint - Counterpoint Research","Fri, 17 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvdW50ZXJwb2ludHJlc2VhcmNoLmNvbS9pbnNpZ2h0cy9nZC10aGFsZXMtaWRlbWlhLWxlYWQtMjAyMi1nbG9iYWwtZXNpbS1lbmFibGVtZW50LWxhbmRzY2FwZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Kigen and VALID are the specialists while Oasis Smart SIM, Truphone, Redtea Mobile, and WORKZ are the dark horses, moving rapidly to challenge the leaders.

More than 260 MNOs/MVNOs now support eSIM and the average device support by carriers is more than 30 as well.

G+D, Thales and IDEMIA remained leaders in the Global eSIM Enablement landscape, according to the 2022 edition of Counterpoint Research’s eSIM CORE (COmpetitive, Ranking and Evaluation) report, maintaining their positions from the previous year.

Commenting on the eSIM landscape and the adoption of the technology, Senior Research Analyst Ankit Malhotra highlighted, “2022 was a landmark year for the eSIM ecosystem. eSIM’s adoption has accelerated all around the world and it is now rapidly moving towards becoming the preferred mode of connectivity. More than 260 MNOs/MVNOs now support eSIM and the average device support by carriers is more than 30 as well. Among newer devices, the launch of the eSIM-only iPhone 14 is rightly seen as a huge inflection point. Consumer interest in eSIM is at an all-time high, profile downloads have increased exponentially, and newer players are entering the market – all signs of an ecosystem on the rise. This momentum is being carried over to 2023 and we forecast another strong year with new devices, new technology and innovation, and more widespread adoption of eSIM.”

It has become even more important to better understand the positioning, capabilities, and completeness of various Global eSIM Enablement players. We have analyzed and evaluated key companies in the eSIM value chain using our proprietary CORE framework, which ranks active players according to their capabilities and success in the ecosystem. The evaluation spans a broad range of criteria such as eSIM OS firmware, certification, security, manufacturing, interoperability and ecosystem success. Our criteria continue to evolve every year and we have expanded them by adding new parameters, such as supply chain and customization capabilities.

Source: eSIM CORE (COmpetitive, Ranking and Evaluation) Scorecard and Analysis, February 2023

Commenting on the research findings, Research Vice President Neil Shah said, “G+D continues to lead the Global Enablement CORE Scorecard when compared with the 2021 rankings. The German eSIM technology innovator continues to lead several evaluation criteria such as firmware, security and interoperability. Most importantly, G+D’s eSIM shipments power the highest number of leading consumer eSIM-capable devices, namely smartphones, smartwatches and tablets, including the eSIM-only iPhone 14.”

Shah added, “Thales is a close second in our rankings, also scoring well across most of the parameters. The French vendor has good traction in the automobile and IoT/M2M spaces, with some key design wins in the consumer space as well. These include eSIM Enablement wins across top smartphone OEMs like Samsung, OPPO and Google. G+D and Thales together dominate the eSIM Enablement space right from design wins to tech/standards contribution and end-to-end control over the eSIM value chain.”

“IDEMIA cemented its position as one of the Big Three players and a strong eSIM enabler with a robust portfolio and stable partnerships. IDEMIA has been offering its eSIM firmware since 2016, which has enabled more than 100 devices. The company led our rankings in firmware, security and interoperability, with strong traction in the mobility and IoT segments.”

“Kigen stood fourth in our rankings. It is one of the fastest-moving players in the eSIM Enablement landscape., especially in the IoT space, and striking strong partnerships across the value chain, the company has grown quickly as a specialist in the ecosystem. VALID, an incumbent in the market, leads the scoring in compliance, security and interoperability with a strong presence in the supply chain.”

Commenting on the fast-growing players, Malhotra said, “Oasis Smart SIM, Redtea Mobile, Truphone and WORKZ are the dark horses moving rapidly to challenge the incumbents with disruptive technologies, business models and partnerships. These players improved their capabilities and ecosystem presence in 2022. Oasis Smart SIM’s CloudSIM, which allows the device to connect anytime and anywhere on demand, is a key innovation to watch out for. Redtea Mobile has a strong end-to-end portfolio from firmware to its management platform to connectivity for expansion beyond Asia markets. WORKZ also enjoyed a great 2022 and is one of the key fast-growing players with a notable presence in the supply chain and IoT enablement space. Truphone has a strong positioning with a complete eSIM solution that includes eSIM enablement. It remains to be seen how broadly it can commercialize and leverage the vertical integration similar to Redtea Mobile.”

SpaceX will deploy the satellite into an elongated “super synchronous” transfer orbit stretching more than 30,000 miles (50,000 kilometers) above Earth.

SpaceX scrubbed a launch attempt Sunday evening due to unfavorable weather at Cape Canaveral and in the offshore recovery zone for landing of the Falcon 9 booster on a drone ship in the Atlantic Ocean. Much better conditions are forecast Monday, when there’s a 90% chance of favorable weather for liftoff.

The mission will be the ninth launch of the year for SpaceX.

Thales shipped the Amazonas Nexus satellite from France to Cape Canaveral last month on an Antonov cargo plane. Ground teams from SpaceX and Thales Alenia Space readied the Falcon 9 launcher and Amazonas Nexus spacecraft over the last few weeks, culminating in the payload’s encapsulation inside the Falcon 9’s nose cone and the attachment of the payload to the rocket in the last several days.

The satellite weighs nearly 10,000 pounds (about 4.5 metric tons) and stands nearly 20 feet (6 meters) tall. It is set to begin a 15-year mission beaming broadband services and signals across the Americas, the Atlantic Ocean, and Greenland.

“Amazonas Nexus is the most advanced satellite of Hispasat’s fleet. It’s a very special satellite,” said Ignacio Sanchis, Hispasat’s chief commercial officer.

The satellite, based on Thales’ Spacebus Neo spacecraft design, has a fully electric propulsion system that will maneuver it from the Falcon 9’s initial drop-off orbit to a final position in a circular geosynchronous orbit more than 22,000 miles (nearly 36,000 kilometers) over the equator. That will take several months, and will be followed by comprehensive checks of the satellite’s communications payload. Hispasat expects Amazonas Nexus to be in its final orbit and ready to begin commercial service in July.

Hispasat, based in Madrid, operates seven commercial communications satellite in geosynchronous orbit with coverage over the Americas, Europe, and North Africa. Through an affiliate, Hispasat also holds partial ownership over two communications satellites providing services for the Spanish government.

Amazonas Nexus will be positioned at 61 degrees west longitude, where its orbit will match the rate of Earth’s rotation, giving the satellite a fixed field of view for its communications mission. The satellite will be co-located with three other Hispasat satellites at 61 degrees west: Amazonas 2, Amazonas 3, and Amazonas 5.

The new spacecraft carries Ku-band and Ka-band communications payloads and a “leading edge” digital processor, providing Hispasat with the ability to reconfigure beams from Amazonas Nexus to meet changing market demands, Sanchis told Spaceflight Now in a pre-launch interview.

“That makes it, really, a different asset within our fleet,” Sanchis said. “The satellite will cover all of the Americas, plus the North Atlantic and South Atlantic corridors. As you can already guess from that, one of the main target markets for this satellite is mobility, in particular in-flight connectivity and maritime (services).

“We will also be providing connectivity services for governments and corporations in the fields of energy, oil and gas, etc., as well as telcos and mobile network operators in extending their cellular networks through cellular backhaul. All of these are the main target markets for Amazonas Nexus.”

About two-thirds of the network capacity on the Amazonas Nexus satellite has already been sold to customers, according to Sanchis. The new satellite will help “reduce the digital divide by connecting rural communities, including connecting schools, providing telemedicine applications.”

“It’s a high throughput satellite, but rather than focusing it on residential or consumer broadband, we are focusing it on premium corporate applications in mobility, maritime, in-flight, and other corporate and telco applications,” he said.

Amazonas Nexus will replace the Amazonas 2 satellite, which launched in 2009.

“While it will actually replace, over time, Amazonas 2, it’s a totally different concept. Amazonas 2 has also a focus on video applications, broadcast direct to home in Latin America, while Amazonas Nexus is fully devoted to connectivity, not just in Latin America, but a great deal of the capacity is devoted to North America and the North Atlantic,” Sanchis said.

Amazonas Nexus has a dedicated payload to provide services for Tusass, the national telecom operator of Greenland, to connect towns, villages, and citizens across the country. Another customer signed up to use Amazonas Nexus is Intelsat, which will provide bandwidth for in-flight WiFi for airline passengers over the United States through the service formerly known as Gogo.

The U.S. Space Force also has a transponder on the Amazonas 2 satellite for communications coverage. The military’s hosted payload, called Pathfinder 2, is led by the service provider Artel and supported by Hunter Communications. Pathfinder 2 consists of a 108 MHz payload that meets the Defense Department’s security requirements to supplement the military’s own communications satellites.

Building on Thales Australia’s 30 years’ experience delivering the highest levels of availability to the ADF for critical defence capability, the new partnership with RGM will boost the specialised skills, experience and training necessary to optimise land materiel services and maintain the ADF’s current and future heavy vehicle fleets.

Under the new partnership, RGM will provide a highly skilled workforce in regional areas including northern Queensland and Darwin – coupled with Thales’s services footprint covering 38 sites across Australia, the pairing will support an increased availability of maintenance activities closer to, or co-located with, ADF operational bases, reducing the cost of heavy vehicle transport, providing greater value for money through reduced time and cost of maintenance activities, and deliver training that will enhance local expertise and skills in regional Australia.

A familiar and trusted partner of the ADF since 2002, RGM has supported the ADF and Defence industry partners with light, medium, heavy and protected vehicle maintenance along with engineering plant equipment. The new partnership will expand Thales and RGM’s strong 15-year relationship - RGM currently provides Thales with specialised vehicle on-demand maintenance for Bushmaster and Hawkei protected vehicles, as well as supporting surge capacity requirements such as painting and surface preparation for niche maintenance activities including the recent readying of 40 Australian Government donated Bushmasters to Ukraine.

RGM is a significant regional employer in Queensland and the Northern Territory, and in the past 18 months has committed to over $30 million of investment in new state of the art facilities in Mackay, and the development of a new purpose-built facility in Townsville, Northern Queensland. This new Defence Maintenance collaboration between Thales and RGM will expand the skills, reach and availability of critical sovereign land materiel maintenance capability to the ADF across northern Australia in a time when availability and reliability of ADF capability is key to the National Security agenda.

Cam Purdey, Director Defence Maintenance Services, Thales Australia and New Zealand:

“We are very excited about this new partnership with RGM. This is a clear demonstration of the Thales’s long-term commitment to growing and maintaining an enduring, sustainable and resilient sovereign industrial Defence capability - increasing the skills of the Defence industry workforce, and growing employment opportunities throughout regional Australia.”"
Amazonas Nexus Telecommunications Satellite Successfully Launched - Space Ref,"Tue, 07 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VyZWYuY29tL3NwYWNlLWNvbW1lcmNlL2FtYXpvbmFzLW5leHVzLXRlbGVjb21tdW5pY2F0aW9ucy1zYXRlbGxpdGUtc3VjY2Vzc2Z1bGx5LWxhdW5jaGVkL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Amazonas Nexus Thales Alenia Space

The Amazonas Nexus satellite was successfully orbited today by a SpaceX Falcon 9 launch vehicle from the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Cape Canaveral, Florida.

Amazonas Nexus belongs to Spanish satellite telecommunications operator HISPASAT. The new geostationary high-throughput satellite (HTS) will replace Amazonas 2, stationed at 61º West, affording increased capacity to enable HISPASAT to reach new customers and markets with high-capacity mobility services for the air and maritime transport sectors, among others. The advanced design, HTS capacity and versatility of Amazonas Nexus make it the most efficient satellite in HISPASAT’s fleet.

Thales Alenia Space, the joint venture between Thales (67%) and Leonardo (33%), led design, construction and testing of the satellite as prime contractor, and is in charge of its in-orbit commissioning.

A new-generation satellite for greater in-orbit flexibility

Amazonas Nexus features a new fifth-generation digital transparent processor (DTP), a technological leap essential to increase its geographic flexibility. With this new technology, the satellite’s payload will be handled digitally to match capacity to demand in orbit, giving the satellite great resilience to serve the evolving communications market, supporting connectivity, data, and content transmission.

The new satellite will cover the whole American continent, the North Atlantic corridor, and Greenland, thus strengthening HISPASAT’s position in the burgeoning air and maritime markets. The satellite’s capacity also makes it ideally suited to bridge the digital divide in Latin America, allowing governments and telecom operators to deploy networks and services in regions with low penetration of terrestrial infrastructures.

Built around Thales Alenia Space’s Spacebus NEO all-electric spacecraft bus, the satellite has an estimated lifetime of more than 15 years and a launch mass of approximately 4 metric tons.

“Thales Alenia Space’s teams can be proud of the successful launch of Amazonas Nexus, a mission that will help bridge the digital divide in Latin America while bringing new connectivity services to the air and maritime sectors,” said Marc-Henri Serre, Thales Alenia Space Executive Vice President, Telecommunications. “The design of Amazonas Nexus in partnership with our customer HISPASAT illustrates the flexibility, digital agility, and robustness of our communications solutions to keep pace with the fast-moving communications market.”"

The Group will be hiring all over the world and expects to take on 5,500 new employees in France, 550 in India, 1,050 in the United Kingdom, 600 in Australia, and 540 in the United States.

In an interview with the French weekly Le Journal du Dimanche, CEO Patrice Caine said over the past eight years Thales, which has a total staff of 80,000 of which 40,000 in France, had recruited 5,000 to 8,000 people per year and that last year already it had hired 11,500 new staff.

He said that all the firm's activities---defence and security, aeronautics and space, identity and digital security were growing strongly.

It is recruiting people on permanent or fixed-term contracts as well as providing several internal mobility opportunities in Thales in India and across the globe.

The company is mainly seeking hardware engineers, software engineers, systems architects, experts in digital technologies and project managers, offering them the opportunity to help to build a safer, greener, more inclusive world, as per ANI reports.

Thales is also working to improve the gender balance in its workforce. In 2022, women accounted for 25% of new hires in India and represented 22% of the Group's India workforce.

According to Caine, the company is a reflection of its markets which are all seeing dynamic growth with needs growing in all its fields of activity.

Recently, Thales CEO has also met with Ukraine's defence minister and said that France would deliver its Ground Master 200 radar air defence system to Ukraine in May, Reuters reported.

Since the start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine on February 24 2022, shares of Thales - Europe's largest arms electronics provider - have risen nearly 60% to new all-time highs, outperforming the Refinitiv Europe Aerospace and Defense index.

President Emmanuel Macron said in January that French military spending would increase by more than a third in coming years, with the 2024-2030 military budget set to rise to 413 billion euros ($447 billion), up from 295 billion euros in the 2019-2025 period as the army adapts to a new security environment following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

RAPIDFire or 40Mk4 for French Navy's New MCM Vessels? - Naval News,"Fri, 17 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdmFsbmV3cy5jb20vbmF2YWwtbmV3cy8yMDIzLzAyL3JhcGlkZmlyZS1vci00MG1rNC1mb3ItZnJlbmNoLW5hdnlzLW5ldy1tY20tdmVzc2Vscy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"RAPIDFire or 40Mk4 for French Navy’s New MCM Vessels? The French Navy (Marine Nationale) and DGA (French defense procurement agency) are currently comparing two 40mm naval gun systems for the future French MCM vessels (BGDM program): The RAPIDFire by Nexter and Thales and the 40Mk4 by BAE Systems Bofors.

BGDM (Bâtiments de guerre des mines) is the program for the future mine counter measure (MCM) vessels of the French Navy. These vessels will replace the in-service “Tripartite” vessels, a class of minehunters developed between the navies of Belgium, France and the Netherlands. Belgium and the Netherlands are replacing their vessels with MCM motherships as part of the “rMCM” program.

During Euronaval 2022, France announced it was joining the program, confirming that the rMCM mothership design by Naval Group will be used as a basis to answer the French Navy BGDM requirement, which are to be ordered this year.

Naval News understands that Belgium and the Netherlands welcomed the move because of the many advantages it will bring: economies of scale (in case of joint procurement of equipment and spare parts), greater interoperability and potential benefits in terms of training too.

In an exclusive interview with Naval News in November 2022, Vice Admiral Arie Jan de Waard, Director of the Dutch Defense Materiel Organization (DMO) highlighted the above and insisted that the French vessels would be “exactly the same”. Asked specifically about the benefits he expects from France joining the program, Admiral de Waard replied:

“Of course, economies of scale, so you got more ships than only the ships for Belgium and the Netherlands. Also what we call interoperability and interchangeability: If more navies use the same platform, you can share spare parts, you can exchange crews, there are lots of benefits which you get from buying the same stuff.

And in the discussions, first, France wanted the ship but wanted to change some things… We also have examples that if you buy the same stuff but then you change something in the platform or whatever, that does not help for being interchangeable or interoperable. So, here it is! Again a perfect example, France said no, no, no, we are going to buy exactly the same mothership as Belgium and the Netherlands are going to buy”.

Vice Admiral Arie Jan de Waard

With France adopting the same “platform”, the question of systems and equipment onboard arises. We contacted both the French Navy and the DGA to shed light on this. In a common response, the two services confirmed that France wishes to maximize the commonality of the “French design” with that of the Belgian-Dutch vessels:

“In 2021, the Minister for the Armed Forces validated the choice of the architecture of the Belgian-Dutch mine warfare vessels as the reference architecture for future French BGDMs, with adaptation to French specificities, in particular to integrate the drone system developed in Franco-British cooperation. With this in mind, France wants to maximize commonality with the Belgian-Dutch design”.

French Navy and DGA

The above statement makes reference to the French / British SLAMF / MMCM program in which Thales is the prime contractor. The Belgian / Dutch rMCM program relies on a toolbox mostly provided by ECA Group. The unmanned systems in each program vary in size and type, needing specific adaptions, mainly in the handling systems aboard the motherships.

Regarding the radar system, the French Navy and DGA told us that the Thales “NS50 which will equip the Belgian-Dutch BGDMs is the preferred option for French vessels.”

Last but not least, regarding the main naval gun to be fitted aboard the BGDM, the French Navy and DGA explained:

“For the artillery system, the final choice will be made following the Value Analysis to be carried out between the 2 options 40Mk4 Bofors and RapidFire.”

Value Analysis (VA), also known as Value Engineering (VE), is a standardized, multi-skilled team approach which aims at identifying the lowest cost way and ensuring the highest worth to accomplish the functions of a product, process or service.

Each system has their pros and cons. Namely, RAPIDFire is French, the system is getting fitted on French vessels (and a variation of it on French Army vehicles) but its future air burst ammunition is not yet funded. Regarding the Swedish gun, the 40Mk4 is already integrated on the mothership platform which means reduced costs for France. But while the gun has been selected by seven different customers, it is not in service with the French Navy and its introduction would mean yet another ammunition type which can pose challenges in terms of logistics. Below are more details about each system.

RAPIDFire

The RAPIDFire is being developed through the French Ministry of Armed Forces S40SA program, which encompasses different applications with different users. Naval News had an exclusive access to the gun system while it was still in the factory.

Designed to protect platforms from low-level air threats, including drones, RAPIDFire can autonomously and automatically acquire, identify and destroy a threat using target designation data provided by a combat management system. With a ready rack of 140 rounds of ammunition, corresponding to about 30 interceptions, the system offers effective firepower against drones and swarms of drones, avoiding attrition of surface-to-air missiles in the event of a saturation attack.

The first system produced will be installed on the French Navy new fleet replenishment tanker Jacques Chevallier this month. Back in 2018, the RAPIDFire and the 40Mk4 were competing (along with other systems by Leonardo and Rheinmetall), with the Thales/Nexter gun system coming out as the winning big. Another platforms on which the RAPIDFire will be installed are the 10 offshore patrol vessels known as “patrouilleurs océaniques” (PO), of which the first two are to be delivered in 2025. Nexter and Thales still expect funding for the so called A3B rounds: The Anti Aerial Airburst (A3B) munitions are time-fuzed for greater effectiveness against all types of targets and cannot be jammed, decoyed or triggered by clutter. are time-fuzed for greater effectiveness against all types of targets and cannot be jammed, decoyed or triggered by clutter.

Naval News contacted Nexter to ask why they feel RAPIDFire is the best solution for the French Navy’s future BGDM vessels. Here is their reply:

We consider that the RAPIDFire is the natural solution to equip the BGDMs of the French Navy, because it combines:

MODERNITY: The RAPIDFire is at the forefront of technology both in terms of artillery with the 40 CTA cannon and fire controls and optronics. Its digital architecture is designed to be scalable and integrate the next technologies that will maintain its superiority.

FIREPOWER: The RAPIDFire carries up to 140 telescoped rounds ready to fire. In particular, it will be able to fire the anti-aerial airburst (A3B) ammunition, the development of which has taken new steps this year.

SOVEREIGNTY: Designed by Nexter and Thales, RAPIDFire is a French solution.

CONSISTENCY: The RAPIDFire already equips the new force supply vessels (BRF) of the French Navy. Similarly, its 40CTA gun is currently entering service on the T40 turret of the Army’s JAGUAR.

40Mk4

The 40Mk4 40mm gun is used as a primary or secondary naval gun system to combat both air and surface threats, but it can also be used against coastal ground targets.

The Bofors 40Mk4 has the capability to rapidly switch between optimised ammunition types, including programmable 40mm 3P all-target ammo. It can go from warning to destruction in less than 0.5 seconds. The 3P ammo can be programmed for optimised effect against any target, including airburst patterns for new threats that were previously impossible to engage. The automatically loaded, remotely controlled weapon can also be locally controlled as a backup, equipping the operator for any scenario.

Existing customers of the Bofors 40Mk4 include Sweden, Finland, UK, Brazil, Japan and of course Belgium and the Netherlands for the rMCM program.

Naval News contacted BAE Systems Bofors to ask why they feel the 40Mk4 is the best solution for the French Navy’s future BGDM vessels. Here is their reply:

Here are our strong points about the 40 Mk4."

French company Thales will supply GM 200 radar to Ukraine in May

The French Thales will manufacture and deliver the GM200 radar to Ukraine in May this year.

Patrice Caine, CEO of the company, announced this in an interview with French Le Journal du Dimanche.

In addition, he noted that the Thales Group plans to hire 12,000 new employees this year.

The increased number of new employees is due to an increase in Thales product orders.

He noted that the company has 80,000 employees, 40,000 of them being in France. Previously, the company hired up to 8,000 people a year, and by 2022, the number of new employees had grown to 11,500.

Caine also added that all the main industries with which the company works – defense, security, aeronautics, space, identification, and digital security – are actively developing.

“The company is a reflection of its markets, which are experiencing dynamic growth and growing needs in all areas of our business,” he said.

Since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, shares of Thales, one of Europe’s largest suppliers of weapons electronics, have grown by almost 60%.

On February 1, Oleksii Reznikov, Minister of Defense of Ukraine, signed an agreement to supply a complete short-range air defense system. It will include the GM200 radar, control center, radio communication, and air targeting systems.

The radar will be funded by the special Ukraine support fund set up by France.

The GM 200 medium-range radar is part of the Ground Master family of radars. The GM200 model, with all its equipment, is installed in a container transported by an 8×8 truck.

It can be integrated into the SAMP/T air defense system, which is also provided to Ukraine."
Beyond the Megabits: Taking Spirit's WiFi for a ride - PaxEx.Aero,"Wed, 15 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiLWh0dHBzOi8vcGF4ZXguYWVyby9zcGlyaXQtd2lmaS1yZXZpZXctdGhhbGVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A QR code on the seatback helps encourage passengers to connect to the inflight internet on Spirit Airlines flights

Spirit Airlines claims to offer the fastest internet in the sky. And just looking at a standard speed test result likely would support that claim. The Spirit solution kept me connected reasonably well on a recent flight. But there’s a lot more to connection performance than just the top line numbers, and the Thales Inflyt-powered solution on board shows why there’s more to inflight connectivity than just the megabits.

Connecting to the system is easy. The seatback included a QR code to associate a device to the network, or it can be selected manually.

I logged in to the network using a pass purchased during booking for a prior flight where the system never turned on. I paid just $1 for my “browsing” session on board. The airline was charging $7 for that service during my flight.

Making sure I had the code available without WiFi while on board was a bit tricky; how do I access my older emails without being online at the time? But I planned ahead and was able to connect smoothly once the portal activated.

The prepaid internet voucher process worked well on board my Spirit flight

And, of course, a speed test was the first thing I tried once I got past the advertising on the portal page.

After logging in the portal page offered me a simple set of options, including, of course, the co-branded credit card

Download speeds near 70 Mbps are some of the fastest in the sky. That’s more than enough speed for a video to load, at least in theory. I tested several services, however, and they all came up short.

Speed test numbers from the Spirit/Thales inflight wifi are impressive, but don’t tell the full story

Other services worked reasonably well on the less expensive plan, though I did have one or two small hiccups along the way.

Limiting the performance of streaming services, despite ample bandwidth available, is not much of a surprise. Spirit and Thales also sell a streaming option for $3 more. Fortunately for passengers, the option exists to upgrade for just that incremental fee rather than buying a full plan anew.

Upgrading to the streaming plan was trivial while on board

With the additional $3 paid, speeds increased a smidgen. But, more importantly, streaming videos started to work perfectly.

Slightly faster speeds on the streaming plan, but that’s not why the video started working correctly.

The service also worked well out over the water off South Carolina. This is an area that historically saw coverage gaps when using older satellite solutions optimized for serving terrestrial customers. With coverage provided by the SES-17 satellite designed for mobility applications across the Americas, however, that gap is not an issue.

A decidedly mediocre moving map option, and the time zone was wrong, but the connection worked out over the ocean

Alas, the inflight map defaulted to the wrong time zone, continuing a trend of inflight maps that don’t tell time very well.

Overall, the system performs as advertised in this instance. I’ve heard rumblings that reliability is not quite where Spirit and Thales want it to be, and I’ve personally experienced the lack of service on a flight where it should have been online.

But, generally speaking prices are relatively low, and the prepaid voucher system works, as does buying on board. Now they’ll just have to see if enough passengers are willing to pay for the service to cover the costs.

Ukraine will receive two GM200 radars for SAMP/T SAMs

The French company Thales received a contract for the manufacture of two GM200 radars for Ukraine.

French Defense Minister Sébastien Lecornu and his Ukrainian counterpart, Oleksii Reznikov, attended the signing ceremony.

The ministers met at the Thales site in Limours, which is south of Paris. The visit included a tour of Thales’ military radar design, production and maintenance.

According to the company, the contract, signed by two defense ministers and Thales representative, provides for the supply of a full complex of short-range air defense, including the GM200 radar, control center, radio communication and air targeting systems.

The timing and amount of the transaction were not disclosed. Funds for the radar will be spent from the special Ukraine support fund created by France.

Oleksii Reznikov said that Ukraine will receive two GM200 radar stations.

The GM200 and other Ground Master family radars offer an effective response to the types of threats facing Ukraine, including drones and long-range threats such as cruise missiles, helicopters and combat aircraft.

“Thales is proud to be playing a part in the protection of Ukraine, in particular by providing air defense systems.” Patrice Caine, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer.

The GM 200 medium range radar is part of the Ground Master family of radars. The GM200 model with all its equipment is installed in a container that transports a truck with an 8×8 wheel arrangement.

It can be integrated into the SAMP/T air defense system, which is also provided to Ukraine.

Ground Master GM200 multi-band radar can simultaneously observe air and surface, detect air targets within a radius of up to 250 kilometers (100 km Engagement).

GM200 has an open architecture with the ability to integrate with other Ground Master (GM 400) systems, control systems, and air defense systems. If Thales’ pricing hasn’t changed too much since 2013, when the UAE acquired 17 GM200 radars worth $396 million, then one radar could cost roughly $23 million. However, over 10 years, this technique could significantly improve."

There are also reports that MBDA has offered this airborne variant of the Exocet family for India’s indigenous 4.5-generation twin-engine deck-based fighter, more commonly called TEDBF, which is currently under development by the Indian government-owned Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO).

After arming the Indian Air Force’s (IAF’s) in-service Rafale fighters with a full MBDA weapons suite, along with providing its submarine-launched Exocet SM39 long-range, all-weather missile for the Scorpene submarines currently being manufactured in India, MBDA is thus highly hopeful for more contracts.

MBDA’s debuting AM39 can be launched from multiple platforms such as fighters, maritime patrol aircraft and helicopters. It is an all-weather, day and night, fire-and-forget missile capable of carrying out a low-altitude, sea-skimming attack and can be launched from outside the target ship’s radar coverage. The AM39 is in service with the French Navy’s Rafale M fighters as well as with the Brazilian and Chilean navies, where it is launched by helicopter.

“MBDA is proud to propose the full package of the Exocet family of missiles for the Indian armed forces, as these are highly potent weapons, building on the success story of other MBDA missiles on board the IAF Rafales and also the Exocet SM39 on the Scorpene submarines for the Indian Navy,” said MBDA spokesperson Nick De Larrinaga.

Reiterating its support for India’s ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ (Self-Reliant India) initiative, MBDA has engaged in a joint venture with private Indian defence manufacturer Larsen & Toubro to produce its Exocet MM40 Block 3 ship-based surface-to-surface missile.

Meanwhile, the STARStreak air defence system from Thales UK is attracting large crowds at the Thales stand at Aero India 2023. This lightweight, 14 kg man-portable missile is the subject of a joint venture between Thales and the Indian government-owned Bharat Dynamics Limited (BDL). The agreement, signed in 2021 to strengthen the ‘Make in India’ initiative, caters for the immediate needs of the Indian Army and the IAF, fulfilling the requirement for 60% of the system to be manufactured in India.

“We would like to see the STARStreak supply chains here in India, with exports being done to the UK MoD [Ministry of Defence] from here,” said the head of Thales operations in India, Ashish Saraf, on 14 February. “A proposal has been submitted for this programme to the Indian government and we are awaiting a reply.”

The STARStreak missile, a short-range system that addresses traditional fast-moving air targets. The Starstreak High Velocity Missile (HVM) consists of a booster and three ‘hittile’ submunitions which separate from the booster shortly after launch. These hittiles are then guided to their target by laser beam riding guidance, and use a contact fuze to detonate inside the target, with each hittile possessing a 0.9 kg HE-FRAG warhead with a tungsten fragmentation sleeve. The newer STARStreak II HVM has a maximum speed of around Mach 3.5, and an effective range in excess of 7 km. The missile is qualified for operations in severe climactic conditions, including a nuclear/biological/chemical (NBC) warfare environment.

Gemalto targeted by a judicial investigation for corruption in Africa - Africanews English,"Thu, 09 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFmcmljYW5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjMvMDIvMDkvZ2VtYWx0by10YXJnZXRlZC1ieS1hLWp1ZGljaWFsLWludmVzdGlnYXRpb24tZm9yLWNvcnJ1cHRpb24taW4tYWZyaWNhL9IBcGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFmcmljYW5ld3MuY29tL2FtcC8yMDIzLzAyLzA5L2dlbWFsdG8tdGFyZ2V0ZWQtYnktYS1qdWRpY2lhbC1pbnZlc3RpZ2F0aW9uLWZvci1jb3JydXB0aW9uLWluLWFmcmljYS8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The national financial prosecutor's office in Paris has opened a judicial investigation against the French group for corruption across several African countries.

A judicial investigation targeting government contracts concluded between the smart card manufacturer Gemalto, acquired in 2019 by Thales, and several African countries were opened in June, the National Financial Prosecutor's Office said on Tuesday, confirming information from Mediapart.

This judicial investigation was opened for bribery of a foreign public official in an organized gang, aggravated laundering of bribery of a foreign public official and association of criminals.

The case arose from a report from Tracfin, Bercy's financial intelligence unit. It first gave rise to the opening of a preliminary investigation, relating to government contracts concluded by Gemalto, now Thales DIS, with several African States, confirmed the National Financial Prosecutor's Office. Several searches were carried out in October, the source said.

According to Mediapart, the investigation “concerns about ten government contracts (identity cards, electoral cards, license plates) won by Gemalto between 2015 and the beginning of 2019”, in particular on “commissions affected, to win these contracts, through several intermediaries"".

Thales “cooperates fully”

The investigations would relate in particular to a contract of more than 46 million dollars won in 2016 from the Independent National Electoral Commission (CENI) of the Democratic Republic of Congo, indicates the site.

They would also be interested in another contract won in 2017 in Senegal. Gemalto had concluded a contract with the government there for the manufacture of driving licenses and vehicle registration plates.

An Israeli intermediary from Gemalto is said to have negotiated two contracts in Cameroon and another in Senegal.

Contacted by AFP, Thales confirmed that its subsidiary had been ""given in October 2022 a judicial requisition to communicate documents and information in connection with contracts won by Gemalto before its acquisition by Thales in 2019"".

The group assured, “to cooperate fully with the judicial authorities in the context of this procedure”. ""It strictly complies with national and international regulations"" and practices a zero-tolerance policy with regard to ""corruption and influence peddling"", he added."
Anaximander and the Nature of Science by Carlo Rovelli review – the ancient master of the universe - The Guardian,"Mon, 13 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vYm9va3MvMjAyMy9mZWIvMTMvYW5heGltYW5kZXItYW5kLXRoZS1uYXR1cmUtb2Ytc2NpZW5jZS1ieS1jYXJsby1yb3ZlbGxpLXJldmlldy10aGUtYW5jaWVudC1tYXN0ZXItb2YtdGhlLXVuaXZlcnNl0gGOAWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9ib29rcy8yMDIzL2ZlYi8xMy9hbmF4aW1hbmRlci1hbmQtdGhlLW5hdHVyZS1vZi1zY2llbmNlLWJ5LWNhcmxvLXJvdmVsbGktcmV2aWV3LXRoZS1hbmNpZW50LW1hc3Rlci1vZi10aGUtdW5pdmVyc2U?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Something very startling happened in Miletus, the ancient Greek city on the modern Turkish coast, in about 600BC. That something, physicist Carlo Rovelli argues in this enjoyable and provocative little book, occurred in the interaction between two of the place’s greatest minds. The first, Thales, one of the seven sages of ancient Greece, is often credited as the pioneer in applying deductive reasoning to geometry and astronomy; he used his mathematics, for example, to predict solar eclipses. Wondrous as this was, it was the reaction of the second man, Thales’s fellow citizen, Anaximander, 11 years his junior that, Rovelli argues, changed the world. Anaximander assimilated Thales’s ideas, treated them with due respect, but then rejected and improved on them and came up with more exact theories of his own.

That process, the idea that knowledge was something not handed down by gods or elders, but evolving, something to be quickly interrogated and built upon, set in motion, Rovelli argues, what we understand as the scientific method. If Newton characterised himself as “standing on the shoulders of giants”, then the two men near the very base of that human pyramid were Anaximander and Thales of Miletus. In evolving the thinking of Thales, we’re told, Anaximander was not only the first human to argue that rain was caused by the observable movements of air and the heat of the sun rather than the intervention of gods – the kind of “natural wisdom” that was heretical enough to lead to the trial and death of Socrates 200 years later – he was, crucially, also the first thinker to make the case that the Earth was a body suspended in a void of space, within which the sun and stars did not form a canopy or ceiling but revolved. This literal groundbreaking idea – inventing at a stroke the idea of the cosmos – was, as the historian of science Karl Popper suggested, “one of the boldest, most revolutionary and most portentous ideas in the whole history of human thinking”.

Once people started seeing power as negotiable then everything else became debatable too

Rovelli, author of the bestselling Seven Brief Lessons on Physics, is himself something of a groundbreaker in advances of theoretical knowledge, with his ongoing research into quantum gravity. In this formative book, published in English for the first time, he clearly senses Anaximander as a kindred spirit, though his claims for the Greek are based on scattered traces of evidence. We know almost nothing of Anaximander or his ideas from contemporary sources. Rovelli thus works in this book a little like an archaeologist sifting a burial site for clues, finding reference points in later historical accounts by Pliny and Aristotle and Herodotus among others. Only four lines of Anaximander’s philosophy are preserved intact. They read, in translation, a little like an outtake from TS Eliot’s Four Quartets:

“All things originate from one another, and vanish into one another/

According to necessity;

They give each other justice and recompense for injustice/

In conformity with the order of Time.”

Though part of Rovelli’s project is to grant Anaximander greater prominence in histories of civilisation, he is equally interested in examining the social factors that led to this big bang moment for rational thought. He makes a polemical case that the culture in which the Greek’s wisdom of doubt was nurtured contained, for the first time, all the elements necessary for scientific advance.

These factors have an urgent relevance, he suggests, for the scientists and citizens and policymakers of today. For a start, the Miletus of 2,600 years ago was a time and place in which the ability to read and write moved beyond a limited circle of elite scribes. The effect of extending education far and wide was instantaneous. And it was no coincidence that Anaximander’s revolutionary thinking also coincided with the birth of the polis – the nascent democratic structures built on debate as to how best to govern society. Once people started seeing power as negotiable then everything else became debatable too. “Alongside the desacralisation and secularisation of public life,” Rovelli argues, “which passed from the hands of divine kings to those of citizens, came the desacralisation and secularisation of knowledge… law was not handed down once and for all but was instead questioned again and again.”

This new freedom to doubt received wisdom was crucial in Anaximander revealing what it took Chinese stargazers – advanced in many other respects – another 2,000 years to acknowledge: that the Earth was suspended in space. But there was one other critical factor in the new way of thinking. It was implicit in Miletus’s geography as a trading city in which Greek and Egyptian and Babylonian cultures met. Anaximander borrowed knowledge from all these traditions to build his theories. In this, Rovelli suggests, he sends perhaps his most potent message through the ages, “one that can serve as a warning to us today”. That message, as relevant in Rovelli’s native Italy as in contemporary Britain, is this: “Each time that we – as a nation, a group, a continent or a religion – look inward in celebration of our specific identity we do nothing but lionise our own limits and sing of our stupidity.”"

CHEON SIG SIN, ELECTRONICS AND TELECOMMUNICATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE, REPUBLIC OF KOREA

The Korea Augmentation Satellite System (KASS) is the future satellite-based augmentation system (SBAS) for the Republic of Korea. It is currently developed by the Korea Aerospace Research Institute (KARI) for the government of the Republic of Korea. Thales Alenia Space is the industry prime contractor for this development.

The purpose of KASS is to provide SBAS service compliant with ICAO SARPS Annex 10 [1] over the South Korea area with service level up to APVI.

The KASS system will comprise of the following segments obtained from different manufacturers or service providers:

• A ground segment including network of KASS Reference Stations (KRSs), the redundant KASS Processing Stations (KPSs), the KASS Control Stations (KCSs), the KASS Uplink Stations (KUSs) and an external data interface.

• A network segment ensuring the communication network between all subsystems distributed across Korea (WAN) and the WAN Network Monitoring (WNM).

• A space segment including the Geostationary Earth Orbiting (GEO) satellites and the navigation payloads on-board them.

KASS system deployment began at the end of 2020 with the onsite installation of the system reference stations network. Figures 1 and 2 show the reference station installation details with the station shelter and the reference station hardware (KRS cabinet and antenna).

In parallel, the wide area network has been extensively tested and verified to allow continuous data transmission.

Since this first deployment step, data has been collected and Thales Alenia Space has undertaken the first performance analysis of real data.

This article presents the overall KASS system architecture as well as the first performance results using the deployed system under real conditions. These results are obtained through KRS real data collection and a replay on KASS test bench hosting fully representative KPS algorithms.

KASS Design and Architecture

The KASS system is the SBAS in Korea. A SBAS is a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) augmentation system standardized under the International Convention on Civil Aviation SARPS Annex 10 [1], Volume 1, a document published and maintained by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). KASS will provide safety-critical services for civil aviation as well as an open service, usable by other forms of transportation and possibly other position, navigation and timing (PNT) applications.

The KASS system will provide improved GNSS navigation services for suitably equipped users in the defined service areas of the Republic of Korea by broadcasting a signal augmenting the U.S. Global Positioning System (GPS) Standard Positioning Service (SPS). The augmentation signal provides corrections of GPS satellite orbits and clocks and integrity bounds of orbit/clock residual errors, as well as corrections and integrity bounds for ionosphere delays. The augmentation signal will be broadcast by two GEO satellites and will be used by GPS/SBAS user equipment to compute a navigation solution.

The KASS system is designed to ensure four safety-critical service levels:

• En-Route over Incheon FIR area, flight segments after arrival at initial cruise altitude until the start of descent to the destination.

• Terminal over Incheon FIR area for descent from cruise to initial approach fix.

• NPA over Incheon FIR area, for non-precision approaches (NPA) in aviation, an instrument approach and landing that uses lateral guidance but does not use vertical guidance.

• APV-I over South Korea land masses (including Jeju Island), for precision approaches with vertical guidance. KASS will also provide open service over the Incheon FIR area.

Figure 3 shows KASS service areas.

The KASS system is designed to be a system-of-systems that performs these main functions:

• Collects GPS data at various locations in the Republic of Korea (and possibly in other states in the future).

• Computes corrections and associated integrity bounds from ranging measurements of GPS satellites in view of the KASS service area.

• Formats messages compliant with the SBAS user interface standardized in ICAO SARPS Annex 10 [1] and the RTCA MOPS 229 [2].

• Uplinks a signal carrying these messages to navigation payloads on the KASS GEOs.

• Broadcasts the signal to users after frequency-conversion to the L1 band.

Additional support functions are implemented:

• Wide area network between the KASS sites.

• Monitoring and control of the KASS elements.

• Support to KASS operations.

Main elements of the KASS architecture are:

• 7 KRS (reference stations) deployed on seven KRS sites.

• 2 KPS (processing units) and 2 KCS (monitoring and control units) deployed on the two main control center sites.

• 3 KUS (uplink stations) deployed on 2 KUS satellite broadcast sites.

• A wide area network ensuring inter-sites data exchanges.

Figure 4 shows the overall KASS architecture.

The KASS reference stations network was deployed at the end of 2020. Figure 5 shows the final KRS network locations over Korea land masses.

The KRS detailed site implementations are outlined in Table 1.

The KRS subsystem is composed of two independent channels, each one providing independent measurements to KPS-PS and KPS-CS. The KRS are based on NovAtel WAAS GIII receivers.

The KPS subsystem includes one processing set and one check set. The KPS processing set (KPS-PS) determines the user data information (corrections, confidence intervals, etc.) using GPS raw measurements from one channel of each KRS. The integrity of the information is checked by the KPS check set (KPS-CS) using independent data from the second KRS channel (independent receiver and antenna). The KPS transmits safety status information to the KUS to allow a possible switch by selecting a KPS to be used as the user data provider.

Key Performance Parameters

In the frame of the analysis, KASS system performances are evaluated to verify the main SBAS requirements.

Performance of a satellite navigation system are expressed through five criteria: accuracy, integrity, continuity, availability and time-to-alert (TTA).

The accuracy feature is the difference between the computed value and the actual value of the user position and time.

The integrity risk is the probability that an error, whatever the source, during the period of operation might result in a computed position error exceeding a maximum allowed value, called the alert limit, where the user is not informed of the error within the specific time-to-alert.

The alert limit is, for a given parameter measurement, the error tolerance not to be exceeded without issuing an alert. It is dependent on the flight phase, and each user is responsible for determining its own integrity in regard to this limit for a given operation phase following the information provided by the SBAS SIS.

The system TTA is the time an alarm condition occurs to the time the alarm is displayed in the cockpit. Time to detect the alarm condition is included as a component of integrity.

The continuity of service of a system is the capability of the system to perform its function without unscheduled interruptions during the intended operation (for example the landing phase of an aircraft). It is evaluated as the probability that from the moment the criteria of precision and integrity are completed at the beginning of an operation, they remain so for the duration.

Finally, the availability feature is the percentage of time when, over a certain geographical area, the criteria of accuracy, integrity and continuity are met.

The detailed KASS performance specifications are outlined in Table 2.

It must be noted that performance requirements include:

• The system performance in fault free conditions

• The system performance in front

of threats/feared events (FE) (GPS FE, KRS FE, Hardware FE, etc.)

This article only presents the KASS peformances in fault free conditions, in front of the first real data collection.

Performance Test Bench Description

The performance assessment is based on an engineering test bench that hosts the KASS KPS algorithms (both PS and CS). It is able to simulate end-to-end behavior of the KASS system.

The KASS test bench solution is an evolution of the legacy EGNOS test bench (SPEED), using an optimized hardware architecture and virtual machines. This architecture is based on a single server that ensures:

• The use of KASS Processing set algorithms (KPS-PS prototype) based on Thales Alenia Space development, allowing the ability to monitor any internal data.

• The use of KASS Check set algorithms (KPS-CS prototype) based on IFEN company development, allowing the ability to monitor any internal data.

• The real time monitoring and control (RTMC) behavior of the KPS components that is managed by a hosting structure.

• The KASS network and uplink station emulation.

• The emulated reception of data from KRS and GEO satellites.

• The ability to process data in a fast mode (fast synchronization loop).

Figure 8 shows the SW component architecture overview. The KASS CS and PS algorithms are hosted respectively in TNKICAF and TNKPS SW components. The SIDF, TSWAN, SCCM SW and Bastion SW components manage the external interfaces and ensure the data flow exchange/control to simulate the system close loop.

Results and Discussion

KASS is characterized by relatively small service areas and a concentrated KRS network over South Korea land masses, which constitute some challenging conditions in terms of satellite and ionosphere observability as shown in Figure 9.

The performance assessment was performed from March 20 to 24, 2021 (5 full days). This assessment is not fully representative of the final KASS performance because the real data collection for March 2021 has been limited to GPS raw measurements at high elevations (≥ 15°) defined by the KRS masking angle, whereas the KASS system is designed to allow GPS satellite tracking from 5° of elevation. KRS masking optimization activities will be handled in the frame of the system qualification.

The monitoring performance is mainly driven by the geographic surroundings of the antenna sites that are different for each station. The mountainous terrain constitutes challenging conditions for KASS, in terms of multipath and “clear horizon” obstacles.

Performance results are as follows:

• For March 22, 2021 when daily figures are considered. This is the middle day of the performance assessment period, and daily performances remain equivalent over the overall observation period.

• For the average of the five days when performance results are assessed from the user point of view.

Satellite Monitoring

Figure 10 shows the monitoring of the GPS satellites by KASS on March 22, 2021.

The global monitoring performance is expected to represent about 85% of the maximal observability period (impact of data collection limited to elevation ≥15°).

When displaying the number of GPS satellites monitored at the same time, the analysis shows that five to 11 satellites can be monitored simultaneously (Figure 11).

The KASS system ensures an average of more than seven monitored GPS satellites (around 7.8 satellites).

IGP Monitoring

The IGP Mask is defined by 86 IGPs, more or less close to Korea land masses. The average number of 43 monitored IGPs is achieved on March 22, 2021. The monitoring of IGPs depends directly on the KRS locations and indirectly on IPP locations (Figure 13). The map presents the monitoring ratio for each IGP. Red squares correspond to 100% of monitoring.

The IGP monitoring is satisfactory with respect to the KRS network geometry (Figure 12), in particular at North where the IPP density is weaker (Figure 9). The GIVDs monitoring for the two IGPs at latitude 45° and longitudes 125° and 130° is ensured thanks to the internal model of the ionosphere of KPS-PS. The dynamic of the ionosphere captured at neighboring observation points(IPP) monitored by the system allows this monitoring with a sufficient confidence index.

Integrity from Satellite Corrections

To display the integrity of the satellite corrections for each GPS satellite, the notion of the UDRE Safety Index is used to assess the integrity margin. The UDRE Safety Index is defined as the ratio

The satellite residual error for the worst user location (SREW) is computed as the pseudorange error projection due to the remaining satellite ephemeris and clock errors after KASS corrections have been applied, for the worst user location of the relevant service area. The relevant service area corresponds to the intersection of the service area and of the monitored satellite footprint. The “true” SREW has been computed with the help of the precise GPS ephemerides provided by the International GNSS Service in sp3 format.

The user differential range error (UDRE) is defined in section A.4 of MOPS [2] and provided by the KPS Subsystem. For a given satellite, the user integrity is ensured as long as the UDRE SFI remains lower than 5.33.

The satellite SFI remains under the value of 1 for all GPS satellites on this day (Figure 14), which demonstrates the large integrity margin of the UDRE corrections broadcast by KASS.

Integrity of Ionosphere Corrections

To display the integrity of the ionosphere corrections for each IGP, the notion of the GIVE Safety Index is used. The GIVE Safety Index is defined as the ratio

The GIVD Error is defined as the vertical pseudorange error at the considered IGP location, due to the remaining ionospheric delay after applying the GIVD corrections. The “true” GIVD error is computed thanks to precise real ionosphere conditions provided by the International GNSS Service in IONEX format.

The ionosphere SFI remains under the value of 2.0 for all IGPs on this day (Figure 15), which demonstrate the large integrity margin of the ionosphere corrections that KASS broadcasts.

Given the integrity assessment of satellites corrections (C) and of ionosphere corrections (D), the contribution of fault free conditions to the integrity risk is negligible with real data and is similar with the results obtained from synthetic scenarios used prior to the system deployment. Therefore, the integrity risk for APVI and the other KASS services is mainly induced from the impact probabilities of feared events.

Accuracy at the User Level

The location of users is defined on a grid of longitudes from 124° to 134° East, and of latitudes from 30° to 39° North, with steps of 1°. The presentation is limited to the APVI Service level. The performances requirements for the other services (en route, terminal, NPA) are also fulfilled.

The horizontal and vertical navigation service errors (HNSE and VNSE) are presented in meters for each user position, for the APVI Service (at 95 percentile).

The accuracy performance demonstrates very good behavior of the KPS algorithms, correcting the GPS orbits, clocks and ionosphere with efficiency and high accuracy in vertical as well as horizontal axis (Figures 16 and 17).

APVI Protection Levels at User Level

Figure 18 shows the APVI protection levels (HPL and VPL) achieved for a user located at [128° East in longitude; 36° North in latitude] (South Korea landmass center). The vertical alert limit (VAL) is 50 m and the horizontal alert limit (HAL) is 40 m for the APVI Service.

On March 22, 2021, protection levels show very good margin versus the APVI alert limits (HAL and VAL).

As expected, a high correlation exists between the rising/setting of GPS satellites and the HPL/VPL usable by safety-of-life users.

APVI Availability

The APVI service availability (Figure 19)is fully ensured over the complete service area. Some availability degradation is limited to the extreme South, outside any KASS service area, and without impact on performance.

APVI Continuity Risk

The service continuity is fully ensured over the APVI service area (Korea Land Masses), when using real data from March 2021, in fault free conditions (Figure 20). Continuity degradations are only raised at south edges, with no impact on APVI performance.

The main contribution to the continuity risk in front of APVI and other KASS services correspond to the impact probabilities of feared events.

Conclusions

With a real data collection from March 20 to 24 2021, the KASS system performances in fault-free conditions and for APVI service level show very good levels of accuracy, continuity, integrity and availability.

These performances are achievedwith a data collection of GPS raw measurements being limited to satellite elevations higher than 15°.

The specific geometry of the KRS concentrated network, and the clear horizon around KRS sites (limited by the KRS masking angle), are well handled by the KPS navigation algorithms that ensure service performance during the five day period."
Ukraine acquires new air defence system from Thales featuring Ground Master 200 radar - Defence Procurement International,"Wed, 01 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZWZlbmNlcHJvY3VyZW1lbnRpbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLmNvbS9uZXdzL21hcml0aW1lL3VrcmFpbmUtYWNxdWlyZXMtbmV3LWFpci1kZWZlbmNlLXN5c3RlbS1mcm9tLXRoYWxlcy1mZWF0dXJpbmctZ3JvdW5kLW1hc3Rlci0yMDAtcmFkYXLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Oleksii Reznikov and his French counterpart, Sebastien Lecornu, signing a contract with Thales for the supply of Ground Master 200 radars to help protect Ukraine

Almost a year into the war and building strong enough air defences against the barrage of Russian missiles, drones and bombs fired from the sea, in the air or on land, is still a challenge for Ukraine.

Ukraine has already taken delivery of the National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System, or NASAMS, jointly developed by the US and Norway, which is designed to address a range of aerial threats. But on Wednesday, 1 February 2023, French defence minister Sébastien Lecornu and his Ukrainian counterpart, Oleksii Reznikov, met at Thales’ site in Limours, south of Paris, a centre of excellence for air defence in Europe, to sign a contract for the delivery of a complete short-range air defence system, including a Ground Master 200 radar, to help protect Ukraine.

The contract also includes a command-and-control centre, a radio communications system and air target designators. The visit to Limours by the two defence ministers included a tour of Thales's military radar design, production, and support facilities.

On his Twitter feed, Reznikov said the equipment would help it spot enemy drones and missiles, including ballistic missiles. The contract signing appears to have followed a meeting between Reznikov and French President Emmanuel Macron where the Ukrainian Army’s urgent operational need for self-defence equipment was discussed. France has also supplied the AMX-10 armoured fighting vehicle to Ukraine, as well as the CAESAR self-propelled howitzer, ammunition and fuel.

Thales says its air defence technologies provide protection from all types of air threats at all levels of airspace and cover the entire decision-making chain, from detection and identification to neutralisation.

To keep populations and the armed forces safe, threats must be detected as early as possible, it says, whenever and wherever they arise — at sea, in the air or on land. To defeat modern threats, which are more discreet, more manoeuvrable, and faster than ever, air defence systems must be capable of detecting and tracking any type of target, including small drones, and providing actionable data on objects in motion in the air, on land or on the surface of the sea.

Thales says the GM200 and the other surface radars in the Ground Master family offer an effective response to the types of threats faced by Ukraine, which include drones and long-range threats such as cruise missiles, helicopters, and combat aircraft. As a recognised European leader in systems integration, Thales has the capability to integrate air defence systems-of-systems and to manage compatibility with other defences, which is a real advantage for users needing to deploy their assets quickly and efficiently.

""Thales is proud to be playing a part in the protection of Ukraine, in particular by providing air defence systems,"" said Patrice Caine, chairman & CEO at Thales."

French Minister of the Armed Forces Sebastien Lecornu wrote about this on social networks.

According to the head of the French Ministry of Defense, the cost of the system will be covered by a special fund. This transfer is intended to help Ukraine establish air defense against the backdrop of ongoing massive attacks by the Russian army on Ukrainian infrastructure. Earlier, France transferred Crotale rocket launchers and air defense systems to Ukraine.

In addition, France is going to purchase about 700 Aster-30 anti-aircraft missiles to equip SAMP/T air defense systems, which will also be delivered to Ukraine. The question arises of who will serve the equipment that is rather difficult to operate: the Ukrainian military cannot be trained quickly, and courses lasting several weeks are hardly capable of quickly producing qualified specialists in the field of air defense.

The complexity of some missions means that simply relying on long-range radars for an accurate situational awareness of the airspace may require additional resources. Whether to complement long-range radars in providing airspace protection behind masks or to provide Ground-Based Air Defence (GBAD) to deployed forces – or both – the Ground Master 200 (GM200) has established itself as the multi-mission medium-range radar of choice around the world.

Mind the airspace gap

Long-range radars are, by definition, capable of detecting and tracking threats at very long distances. While this is crucial for maintaining an accurate and up-to-date Recognised Air Picture (RAP), anything behind masks remains undetected. Such a surveillance gap could prove critical to Airspace Protection. Many Command and Control (C2) centers therefore also rely on Medium-Range Radars to fill this gap or take on this role.

Fast track from surveillance to air defense

If detecting, identifying and tracking a threat is essential to maintaining an accurate, up-to-date RAP, neutralizing that threat is crucial to retaining airspace sovereignty. Mid-range radars need to be able to acquire target information and feed it to the GBAD as accurately and quickly as possible to trigger the appropriate response.

The GM200 design detects and tracks simultaneously, low to high-altitude targets in all types of environments. Based on the successfully proven architecture of the GM400α, it provides air defense weapon coordination for Very Short Range Air Defence (VSHORAD) up to Short Range Air Defence (SHORAD) systems.

The Ground Master 200 establishes tracks faster and keeps them locked for longer, thus maximizing time on target. This gives units the time to evaluate the threat and take appropriate action. Because it makes full use of Thales's digital technology capabilities, it also manages to acquire smaller and slower targets.

At the core of Ground Master 200 is the technological legacy of the entire 4D AESA family products (NS100/200, Ground Master 200 Multi-Mission, SM400, SMART-L MM, Sea Fire and Ground Fire), the fruit of years of user experiences in operations by over 20 armed forces. It includes Thales' scalable and upgradable antenna architecture and software-defined radar technology that offers upgrade capacity over the whole life cycle. It also features ""dual-axis multi-beam"", which gives unrestricted steering flexibility in elevation and bearing.

The system is offered in two versions: an ""all in one"" for air surveillance and ground-based air defense up to the medium range, and a ""compact"" version scalable to specific missions like artillery Counter Battery and Weapon Locating. Both versions are very user-friendly, highly automated, and easy to transport. Notice that the Royal Netherlands Army / Defence Materiel Organisation (DMO) has signed the first contract for 9 Ground Master 200 Multi-Mission ""compact"", under the project 'Counter-Rocket Artillery Mortar and Class 1-UAV detection capacity'.

The ""all in one"" version, abbreviated GM200 MM/A, is mainly targeting Air Surveillance as well as Ground Based Air Defense operations up to entry-level Medium Range Air Defense (MRAD). It maintains the well-known Ground Master 200 integrated C2 shelter including the radar mast to gain elevation for low-level air surveillance and 2 operators on board.

The ""compact"" version, abbreviated GM200 MM/C, is a pallet version offering higher tactical mobility and quicker deployment as required by some specific missions like artillery Counter Battery and Weapon Locating. It also suits well Air Defense missions at very short or short range (VSHORAD/SHORAD) like its brother version, the Ground Master 200 Multi-Mission ""all in one"".

Highly mobile, the GM200 is an autonomous solution designed to fit the radar, a mast, a Power Generator Unit (PGU) and an operational cabin to accommodate two operators within a 20ft ISO shelter. Transportable on a truck and deployable for operations in 15 minutes, with a decamp time of 10 minutes, it provides operators with crucial asset survivability and are the key benefits of this radar.

Thales off campus: Why there’s no space for weapons in education - Honi Soit,"Wed, 15 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vaG9uaXNvaXQuY29tLzIwMjMvMDIvdGhhbGVzLW9mZi1jYW1wdXMtd2h5LXRoZXJlcy1uby1zcGFjZS1mb3Itd2VhcG9ucy1pbi1lZHVjYXRpb24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The University of Sydney renewed its partnership with Thales Australia, one of the world’s largest arms manufacturers, in December 2022. Thales first signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with USyd in 2017, sponsoring eight engineering industry placements and providing funding for PhD research. The recently extended deal will further allow Thales to conduct research into high-tech weaponry and military systems on campus. Agreements like this have no place on campus because they only exist to exploit graduates and researchers into growing and sustaining the military and weapons industry. Universities should be for education, not for expanding Australia’s capacity for destruction.

The University’s ties with Thales date back several years, including in the period in which USyd’s Chancellor Belinda Hutchinson was appointed as the chairperson of Thales Australia’s board. It’s not Hutchinson’s only evil act — she and her husband purchased their $20 million Point Piper house in 2018 with funds obtained from involvement in arms manufacturing, climate destruction, gambling, and other unsavoury industries. The University claims that her ties to Thales have nothing to do with their ongoing partnership. Regardless of whether or not this is true, the fact that Hutchinson is now in her third term as Chancellor demonstrates that management has no qualms about the public face of the University being openly linked to militarism.

Thales is complicit in a long list of brutal conflicts around the world and continues to provide arms to major global powers. Their weapons, surveillance systems, and vehicles have been used to wage destruction in places like Iraq, Afghanistan, Palestine, Yemen, Syria, East Timor, and West Papua. And as one of the largest defence contractors in Australia, every person who has stared down the barrel of an Australian Army gun has seen first-hand the products of Thales. In 2021 alone, the Australian government spent around 800 million Euros — over 1.2 billion Australian dollars — on Thales products.

Thales facilitate every stage of warfare, from the tangible weapons used to the technology involved in planning heinous attacks against innocent people. They produce the Australian Army’s standard gun – the F88 Austeyer – as well as a range of munitions and powders. They also produce transports to send troops into other countries to commit atrocities, like those detailed in the Brereton report into Australian war crimes in Afghanistan, described by the Director-General of the ADF as “possibly the most disgraceful episode in Australia’s military history.” Reports produced by the World Peace Foundation and the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute also reveal that fraud, political lobbying, bribery and sales to repressive regimes are inalienable to the weapons trade. These are the exact opposite of the values that an educational institution should impart.

Not satisfied with just creating enormous levels of destruction through their role in weapons production, Thales also helps secure borders. The defence giant produces surveillance drones and operates the Eurodac system, a biometric security database that holds information about every asylum seeker in the European Union. This technology not only denies safety to refugees fleeing from war, climate change, and other disasters, but also dehumanises them by encroaching on their privacy.

Thales wants to increasingly integrate itself into university faculties and research teams, promising an expansion of their insidious presence on campus. University management, not satisfied with last year’s $1 billion surplus, is constantly looking for ways to turn a profit and help gear the University towards what Australian industry, and the military in particular, demand — particularly given rising imperialist tensions. USyd management is clear that increasing the amount of defence research that takes place on campus is a key objective.

“As the collaboration develops,” they note, “both parties intend to embed staff within each other’s organisation to accelerate the translation of research and development into solutions that bring impact to the community, particularly focusing on national security outcomes.”

There are an increasing number of projects on campus explicitly geared towards furthering the ability of the Australian armed forces to wage war. Further, even seemingly harmless coursework, well outside of transparently militaristic projects, may involve training AI or developing some part of a military system for ulterior defence motives.

Our university should play no part in increasing the number of lives lost in murderous wars and armed interventions across the world. Military-funded research and coursework will also be expected to demonstrate military value. When alternative sources of university funding (read: government funding) are crowded out by arms dealers, students and academics are pressured to play a part in Australia’s increasing push for militarisation. This will fundamentally stifle the ability of students and staff to engage in education as a social good, which should be the institution’s primary aim.

As students, we shouldn’t take part in weapons development, or maintain silence while university management gears research towards this destruction. Management cares most about their bottom line and propping up the Australian war machine. On the other hand, we have an interest in free, quality education which is primarily about improving the society we live in.

If we want management to cut ties with Thales, we are going to have to fight for it. The University should tear up its renewed agreement with Thales, get rid of all joint projects, sack Belinda Hutchinson, and redirect money from military partnerships into free, quality education that exists for the good of humanity.

This is why in order to win, we need all the help we can get. Management cheerfully tells us that weapons development helps “make Australia and the world a better place to live”. They are not going to change their minds unless we force them to.

This opinion piece has been amended to more adequately reflect the University’s associations with Thales."

International navies now find themselves increasingly threatened by a range of hostile platforms, often in congested maritime environments. The ability for an uncrewed rotary aircraft that can launch quickly and then provide long-range mission endurance and the ability to find, fix, track, and identify targets will bring additional protection for the ship and its crew, gaining them invaluable time to prepare and respond.

Thales will act as the lead systems integrator for the program that brings together an unrivalled combination of proven UAS capability from Schiebel and a range high precision intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance sensors and systems from Thales.

Schiebel will provide its operationally proven CAMCOPTER® S-100, a highly-effective uncrewed air system that already has more than 100,000 operating hours, including demanding deck-launched operations in challenging winds and sea states.

The S-100's sensors, supported by an Automatic Identification System and fused together with the CarteNav AIMS Mission System provides the operator the ability to detect and identify unknown targets quickly.

The Thales I-Master radar can be operated in both Synthetic Aperture Radar and Maritime Moving Target Indication modes and once it detects and finds a contact, the onboard electro-optical/infra-red sensor is cross-cued to perform the identification.

High-definition imagery and radar data is downloaded to the human operator and disseminated in real-time through the host ship’s Combat Management System and made available to multiple users.

About the Camcopter S-100

This UAV was designed between 2003 and 2005, and it has a maximum take-off weight of 200 kilograms (440 pounds). With a flight endurance of 6 hours, it can be extended to over 10 hours by adding external AVGAS fuel tanks. It has a maximum speed of 140 mph (220 km/h) and a maximum operational altitude of 18,000 feet (5,500 meters)."

Known as Peregrine, the Uncrewed Air System (UAS) is based on Schiebel’s Camcopter S-100 platform. Thales will act as the lead systems integrator, equipping the craft with a suite of naval sensor technology.

“We're contracted to deliver an operational capability to Royal Navy to put in place a VTOL (vertical takeoff and landing), uncrewed aircraft system equipped with a number of sensors,” Matt Moore, Thales UK head of Unmanned Air Systems Sales and Business Development, told The Engineer.

“Those sensors and data are then pulled back onto the ship and then pulled into the combat management system to give it that sort of maritime situation awareness...finding targets, fixing those targets and assessing them to give a valuable input to the command ship and the task force.”

The sensor suite will include an Automatic Identification System (AIS) combined with the CarteNav AIMS Mission System, which together will facilitate the rapid detection and identification of unknown targets. Peregrine will also feature Thales’ I-Master radar, which can be operated in both Synthetic Aperture Radar and Maritime Moving Target Indication modes.

“Once we get a bit closer we can then flip to the electro optical camera and that would give us a positive identification of what's going on,” said Moore.

High-definition imagery and radar data is then downloaded to the human operator, disseminated in real-time through the host ship’s Combat Management System and made available to multiple users.

The S-100 is already in service with several militaries around the world - Schiebel

Austrian firm Schiebel’s S-100 platform has been in operation for 15 years, with both military and commercial customers. It has a maximum takeoff weight of 200kg, with its standard 50kg fuel tank providing around six hours of endurance, though an auxiliary tank can extend that to 10 hours.

“We can carry a mixture of payloads and we’re very much a plug and play, depending on customer requirements,” explained Neil Hunter, director of Business Development at Schiebel.

“We can fly out to a maximum distance of 200 kilometres, but we tend to operate within 100 kilometres of the host platform. That tends to be the normal, which takes you well beyond the horizon of the platform, whether it's land or maritime based.”

Though Peregrine has been developed specifically with the Type 23 in mind, Thales and Schiebel both believe the platform has potential to feature across the wider Royal Navy fleet.

“There’s a big push to move from crewed to uncrewed technologies,” said Moore. “There's a particular requirement for Type 23 in an operational area that needs urgency, to extend the ‘eyes and ears’. But what I would say is the Navy have ambitions much bigger and they want to incorporate these types of technologies. So for us I think this is a first step.”"

The judge presiding over former South African President Jacob Zuma's corruption trial recused himself from the case this week, saying he didn't want there to be any chance that the proceedings could be viewed as biased against Zuma.

It is the latest twist in just one of multiple legal battles involving the 80-year-old former South African leader, who resigned in 2018 amid mounting allegations of corruption but has retained political influence.

Here is a look at the court cases involving Zuma and how they are impacting politics in Africa's most developed economy.

CORRUPTION TRIAL

Zuma was charged in 2021 with multiple counts of corruption over a multibillion-dollar arms deal that South Africa signed in 1999 with French company Thales, then known as Thomson-CSF. He is accused of taking hundreds of bribes to help Thales get the deal and faces at least 15 years in jail.

Zuma is alleged to have taken the bribes while he was a political figure on the rise in the late 1990s and 2000s, although before he became president in 2009.

Zuma was first implicated 20 years ago but charges against him were dropped and reinstated numerous times amid allegations of political interference. His corruption trial officially began nearly two years ago but no evidence has yet been heard as Zuma has launched a series of legal challenges.

One of those is an attempt to get the chief prosecutor removed because Zuma claims he is biased. Because Judge Piet Koen expressed doubts over the validity of Zuma's claim, he has removed himself and allowed another judge to oversee the trial.

Zuma is also taking separate legal action against the prosecutor and a journalist for allegedly leaking his confidential medical records.

IMPROPER PAROLE?

Zuma is fighting to stay out of jail in a second case related to corruption. The former president was convicted of contempt of court in 2021 for refusing to answer questions under oath at an inquiry into allegations of extensive government graft during his time as president, and sentenced to 15 months.

His jailing sparked violent riots in parts of South Africa that left more than 300 people dead, underlining the sway he still holds in some areas. He was freed on medical parole two months later, but his release came under scrutiny when it was revealed his parole was approved by the head of the corrections department, Arthur Fraser, despite a parole committee rejecting it. Fraser is believed to be close to Zuma and served as the state security agency boss when Zuma was president.

Two courts have ruled that Zuma should return to prison and serve the remainder of his sentence. He is appealing that to South Africa's highest court.

BATTLE WITH CURRENT PRESIDENT

Zuma is seeking to privately prosecute current President Cyril Ramaphosa — something that can happen in South Africa if the state prosecutor decides against laying charges — over the leaking of his medical records. Zuma says Ramaphosa needs to explain why he hasn't ordered an investigation into the leak by state prosecutors.

The legal wrangle between Zuma and Ramaphosa is seen as part of a larger political battle between the two.

Analysts say Zuma finally going on trial for corruption is an indicator of Ramaphosa's willingness to ensure high-ranking figures in his own party face the law after years of alleged government corruption. Others serving in senior positions in government or the ANC were implicated in the graft inquiry where Zuma refused to testify.

But the situation has been clouded by a scandal now enveloping Ramaphosa. He's been accused of breaking the law by holding more than $500,000 in U.S. currency at his ranch, money which was stolen in a robbery in 2020.

The existence of the cash and the robbery were kept under wraps until last year. The man who first revealed it and made the allegations against Ramaphosa was Zuma ally Fraser.

Amid the scandal, Ramaphosa won re-election as leader of his party in December and succeeded in avoiding an impeachment inquiry in an initial vote in Parliament but faces further investigations and could be criminally charged."
Thales Australia completes construction on new manufacturing facility at Lithgow Arms site - APDR - Asia Pacific Defence Reporter,"Sun, 19 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL2FzaWFwYWNpZmljZGVmZW5jZXJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS90aGFsZXMtYXVzdHJhbGlhLWNvbXBsZXRlcy1jb25zdHJ1Y3Rpb24tb24tbmV3LW1hbnVmYWN0dXJpbmctZmFjaWxpdHktYXQtbGl0aGdvdy1hcm1zLXNpdGUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales Australia has completed construction on a new advanced manufacturing building at the company’s Lithgow Arms site, the home of sovereign small arms and integrated weapons systems manufacturing in Australia.

Deputy NSW Premier and Member for Bathurst Paul Toole inspected the new facility which is currently being fitted out with state-of-the-art manufacturing equipment. Funding for the new advanced manufacturing building has been supported by the NSW Government via a $1.12 million grant from the NSW Regional Job Creation Fund Round 2 to help grow the state’s advanced manufacturing capability in regional New South Wales.

The funding will be matched dollar for dollar by Thales Australia and will be invested in modern manufacturing capability and equipment at Thales’ Lithgow site with the aim of creating a further 56 jobs to increase production capacity on both military and civil manufacturing lines, as well support export growth over the next three years.

The grant further builds on Thales Australia’s $70 million investment over the past decade to develop the Lithgow facility to create a modern manufacturing and integration hub for the design, development and precision manufacture of next generation weapons systems for the ADF and our industrial partners and export customers.

Thales Australia contracted the design and construction of the new advanced manufacturing facility to Australian family and employee-owned construction and fit out firm, FDC Construction. Local to Sydney and delivering complex and important facilities nation-wide, FDC employs over 550 Australians and has worked with Thales on other significant projects including Navy support facilities at Garden Island in New South Wales, Thales corporate headquarters at Sydney Olympic Park, and other defence critical facilities around the country. The new building at Lithgow will expand the world-leading precision-manufacturing capability of Lithgow Arms to support new sovereign manufacturing partnerships for strategic ADF programs.

The purpose-built facility will also support collaboration across research institutions, SME partners, and key industrial partners to create the soldier systems and small arms of the future, as well as train the next generation of skilled advanced manufacturing workers in the central west.

Thales Australia Vice President Land Julie Bown said the investment in new advanced manufacturing capability at Lithgow Arms would ensure the 110-year history of manufacturing at the site could continue long into the future. “Thales Australia is proud of our stewardship of this critical industrial capability that has supported the ADF and allies for more than a century. In an uncertain world it is vital that Australia maintains its sovereign manufacturing capability to prepare for all contingencies and our investment at Lithgow reflects our commitment to continue providing advanced capability that’s made in Australia.”"

UK Navy Acquires S-100 Drone Helicopter From Austria - The Defense Post,"Mon, 13 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRlZmVuc2Vwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzAyLzEzL3VrLW5hdnktZHJvbmUtaGVsaWNvcHRlci_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The UK defense ministry has awarded a contract to Austrian firm Schiebel to deliver a rotary-wing uncrewed aerial system (UAS) to the Royal Navy.

The agreement is part of the country’s Peregrine program to field a “game-changing” drone that provides a protective “eye in the sky” capability to Royal Navy warships.

The company says it will deliver its S-100 Camcopter UAS equipped with a cutting-edge naval surveillance sensor suite for improved situational awareness.

French technology firm Thales is part of the contract and will focus on system integration to bring “high level” intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities to the drone chopper.

“We are immensely proud that the Camcopter S-100 is the UK Ministry of Defence’s choice for its prestigious Peregrine program,” Schiebel chairman Hans Georg Schiebel said.

“The S-100 is the optimal UAS for a growing number of navies worldwide and has proven its superiority and outstanding capabilities throughout its numerous operational deployments.”

Capabilities

Schiebel’s Camcopter S-100 can perform vertical takeoff and landing and operate day and night in adverse weather conditions.

The drone has a rapid launch ability, superior mission endurance, and high-performance sensors to find, track, and identify targets.

It is fitted with Thales’ I-Master radar, an electro-optical/infrared camera, and an automatic identification system to augment its ability to detect unknown targets.

The camera can produce high-definition imagery transmitted in real-time to give crew time to make operational decisions.

‘Significant Milestone’

Schiebel highlighted the importance of sophisticated UAS when navies find themselves “increasingly threatened” by a wide range of hostile platforms.

Launching quickly and providing long-range mission endurance is crucial in congested maritime environments.

“This is a significant milestone for the Royal Navy as it is an immediate enhancement to its operational capability, but it also supports their strategic transition to uncrewed technology,” Thales CEO Alex Cresswell said."

Last week, social media giant Twitter reportedly shut its offices in Mumbai and New Delhi as a cost-cutting measure. The company fired more than 200 employees in India last year."
France's Thales to extend UAE operations with procurement from local companies - The National,"Mon, 20 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVuYXRpb25hbG5ld3MuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2F2aWF0aW9uLzIwMjMvMDIvMjEvZnJhbmNlcy10aGFsZXMtdG8tZXh0ZW5kLXVhZS1vcGVyYXRpb25zLXdpdGgtcHJvY3VyZW1lbnQtZnJvbS1sb2NhbC1jb21wYW5pZXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"French defence and technology group Thales is to increase procurement from UAE companies, boost engineering activities and nearly double the workforce at its UAE subsidiary, in line with the country's local manufacturing push.

The company is in talks with the government to explore opportunities in defence production, Pascale Sourisse, senior executive vice-president of International Development at Thales, told The National on Monday.

“We are always interested in diversifying the supply chain and, particularly in the UAE, we want to increase the role of UAE companies in the Thales supply chain, so we have launched an initiative called Go To The UAE.

“We want to procure much more from UAE companies,” Ms Sourisse said.

“In the UAE, we are not only supplying our customers, but we are also working on reinforcing our footprint,” she said on the sidelines of the International Defence Exhibition (Idex) in Abu Dhabi.

The company's wholly-owned unit Thales Emarat Technologies aims to increase its workforce to 300 employees by 2025, from 160 people now. At least 30 per cent of those will be Emiratis, she said.

The subsidiary focuses on radar, radio communications and defence aerospace technology, according to its website.

Gulf states such as the UAE and Saudi Arabia are developing their military production capabilities to reduce reliance on foreign suppliers. The move is intended to diversify economies away from the oil sector, create more jobs for citizen and attract highly-skilled employees.

The transfer of advanced technology and technical know-how from international partners to local companies will become part of offset and procurement regulations and are likely to be reflected in deals signed at Idex, industry analysts said.

“We have a plan to set up a radar academy. The location will be in Tawazun Industrial Park (in Abu Dhabi). We are discussing it and the objective is to start it quickly,” Ms Sourisse said.

The idea is to expand Thales' supply chain in the UAE.

“We want to increase the activity that will be performed in the UAE … so, what we will be doing here will be local production, engineering activities in development with Emirati partners,” Ms Sourisse said.

“This is the best approach to build solutions that ideally suit the needs of users in the UAE and create a level of competence that goes much further if you involve not only manufacturing but also engineering, research and development and services to support the equipment you supply to your customers.

“Then, you have the whole supply chain and you can build a pool of competence that is very solid.”

Ms Sourisse said Thales is discussing these opportunities with government and hopes the process will be quick as its UAE unit has grown rapidly in the three years since it was established.

“It's really about agreeing with the other stakeholders on what activities will be included and then we can put it in place within the structure of Thales Emarat Technologies that is already there,” she said.

“We hope to be able to make some announcements very soon.”

Thales also expects its overall business in the Middle East to grow, driven by customers’ demand across its segments, from space exploration to defence.

The Middle East is a “very important region” for the company, representing about 10 per cent of its total global sales, Ms Sourisse said.

Thales expects its business in the region to grow “above average”, driven by interest in its latest technologies, from satellites to space exploration, telecoms and earth exploration, which represents a lot of opportunities, she said.

The level of demand is growing in the short term despite uncertainties from geopolitical tensions and macroeconomic challenges, she added.

Supply chain diversification

Aerospace and defence companies are diversifying their procurement as pandemic-induced supply chain problems caused delays and disruptions.

Thales has worked with its suppliers to find solutions following disruptions in 2021 and has found ones that allow it to produce at a pace required by its customers but it remains “vigilant about this”, Ms Sourisse said.

“It's constant work. It's a strong area of focus, but as compared to the situation in 2021, we can say that particularly at the end of 2022 and the beginning of 2023, it is much better because everybody has been able to take actions,” she said."

These centres focus on hardware, software and systems engineering capabilities for both the civil and defence sectors, serving global needs. In support of this expansion, Thales HR executives will be present during the public days to meet the Indian engineering talent at the Show and share exciting career opportunities with them.

Growing India’s defence and aeronautics capabilities: what is being shown at Aero India 2023

Thales provides a wide range of products and services to aid the Indian armed forces in achieving operational superiority. Building on the four major pillars of digital technology: connectivity, big data, artificial intelligence and cybersecurity, Thales’s solutions ensure mission readiness and simplify complexity so that military personnel can focus on strategic and operational decision-making.

At Aero India 2023, Thales will exhibit its air defence capacities from sensors to effectors. As a systems integrator, the Group will showcase its full range of radars as well as leading very short range air defence systems including Laser Beam Riding MANPAD, among others.

Thales will showcase the best of its airborne optronics capability: the 2-in-1 targeting & reconnaissance pod TALIOS (Targeting Long-range Identification Optronic System) that delivers unmatched image quality.

On the connectivity side, Thales will introduce SYNAPS A, the airborne member of the SYNAPS software-defined radio family designed to support battlespace digitisation and C4I systems, and also Identification Friend of Foe (IFF).

Under the navigations segment, the TopAxyz inertial navigation system for air, naval and land transport will be featured.

Thales covers the entire spectrum of maritime security and naval combat, from the open ocean to the shorelines. The Group is positioned across the entire value chain for electronic equipment (radar, sonar, effectors, communications, electronic warfare, optronics), command and combat systems and services.

In support of Indian Navy, Thales will showcase Sonoflash, a new generation of sonobuoy that strengthens anti-submarine warfare capabilities.

Thales has also been actively contributing to India’s aviation sector with its services and solutions for airlines, Airports Authority of India, among others. At this year’s show, Thales will feature AVANT Up, its latest evolution of industry leading inflight entertainment (IFE) solutions.

Another striking feature will be the presentation of our earth observation space capabilities.

Ukraine getting GM200 radars from France as talks on SAMP/T air defense system continue - Defense Brief,"Wed, 01 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vZGVmYnJpZWYuY29tLzIwMjMvMDIvMDEvdWtyYWluZS1nZXR0aW5nLWdtMjAwLXJhZGFycy1mcm9tLWZyYW5jZS1hcy10YWxrcy1vbi1zYW1wLXQtYWlyLWRlZmVuc2Utc3lzdGVtLWNvbnRpbnVlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"France will be supplying Ukraine with the GM200 air defense radar under a contract signed with Thales on February 1, as talks on the joint donation by Italy and France of a SAMP/T air-defense system continue.

Earlier this week, Italy’s defense minister Guido Crosetto said the country was making progress on supplying unspecified systems for Ukraine’s defense needs.

It is known that Ukraine earlier requested the SAMP/T theater-level air defense system which is in service with the French Air Force and Italian Army.

While Crosetto did not provide details on the defense aid that is being prepared, he did mention that the delivery is being coordinated with France. Speaking to reporters in Paris on January 31, Ukrainian defense minister Oleksii Reznikov said he was pleased with “progress on the SAMP/T system.”

According to Financial Times, Italy could be providing missile launchers, while France would be sending the interceptors for the SAMP/T. Earlier this week, Italy and France revealed they signed a contract for the purchase of an additional 700 Aster 30 B1 New Technology, Aster 30 B1 and Aster 15 medium range missiles that are used by SAMP/T among other platforms.

The contract for the GM200 air defense radar with Thales was signed during the official visit of Reznikov to Paris.

The complete short-range system includes the GM200 radar, a command-and-control center, a radio communications system and air target designators.

Reznikov’s French counterpart Sébastien Lecornu used the occasion of the Ukrainian official’s visit to announce that France would be supplying an additional 12 Caesar self-propelled howitzers.

These will be in addition to the 18 Caesars already sent by France since the start of the Russian invasion in Ukraine in February last year. The only difference is that the additional howitzers would be supplied directly from weapons manufacturer Nexter and not from French Army stocks, which had a total of 76 systems in its inventory at the time of the start of invasion.

In addition to the howitzers, France is coordinating the supply of 155mm shells to Ukraine with Australia. France will also host 2,000 Ukrainian soldiers for training on French territory by the summer, while 150 French soldiers will deploy to Poland at the end of the month to train up to 600 Ukrainian soldiers per month."

From Thales’s perspective, how is Aero India 2023 different from its previous editions in terms of your exhibits and participation?

Thales’s participation at Aero India this year reaffirms our engagement to the significant modernisation and indigenisation unfolding in the Indian aerospace and defence sector. We are committed to contribute to the ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat’ vision and will showcase our high-end technology solutions across aerospace, defence as well as space in that spirit.

Thales has expanded its presence in India. What does its future in India look like currently, especially given the ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat’ vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi?

As India progresses towards its goal of becoming Aatmanirbhar, constructive measures are being taken across sectors including defence. These measures along with the collective efforts of the industry will pave the way for long-term success of India’s indigenous defence sector.

For seven decades, Thales has been India’s trusted partner, sustaining its growth story by sharing technologies and expertise in defence, aerospace, transport and digital identity & security markets. Thales continues to develop a mature industrial footprint in the country through a diverse range of high-tech products, services, and collaborations with the Indian industry and academia. The Group has been proudly supporting the Indian armed forces’ modernisation efforts, helping them to prepare for, achieve, and maintain tactical superiority over any form of risk.

The group planned to set up a maintenance and repair organisation (MRO) in India to support Indian airlines. What is the progress on this?

Thales has extensive and recognised expertise in providing, maintaining and upgrading avionics systems. From initial equipment providing to maintenance, overhaul, equipment trading and Aircraft on the Ground (AOG), Thales covers the complete product lifecycle and supports its customers across the world, including India, to protect their valuable assets. Our team in India already provides services and support to airlines. We are now assessing localisation and repair options in this area for airlines flying in India and abroad.

At the DefExpo 2020, Thales signed an agreement with Bharat Forge to manufacture F90 rifles. Any new development since the signature?

Under this agreement, Bharat Forge is to manufacture rifles using technology and equipment supplied by Thales. This partnership aligns with the Indian government’s ‘Make in India’ initiative, which aims to boost domestic manufacturing and reduce the country’s dependence on imports. This cooperation is progressing well with the aim to manufacture rifles for the Indian armed forces as well as for export, thereby boosting domestic production.

Thales has been engaged in capacity-building in India through its engagement with both academia and industry. Can you share some details on this?

India is one of the key engineering pillars of Thales. Today, we have more than 1,300 engineers working with Thales in India in our engineering competence centres (ECC) in Bengaluru and Noida. Our engineering centre in Noida focuses on the Digital Identity and Security business of Thales, including technologies around data protection & encryption, cybersecurity and biometrics, etc. Our engineering centre in Bengaluru is a first-of-its-kind in India, focusing on hardware, software and systems engineering capabilities for both the civil and defence sectors, serving global needs. Thales has been ramping up its teams at these engineering centres, continuing its commitment to create jobs and nurture talent in the country.

Thales also continues to partner with academia to fuel R&D in the country. Both of Thales’ ECCs complement the cooperation undertaken with several IITs (namely IIT Madras, IIT Delhi, IIT Bombay) and Indian Institute of Science Bangalore. In April 2022, Thales signed an MoU with the Central Manufacturing Technology Institute (CMTI) of India for advanced collaborative research and development in the field of Open Hardware. This partnership involves the designing of micro-processors using open-source assets which will enable the indigenous development of hardware and complete control of the behaviour of the processor tailor-made to software applications, which is not doable with proprietary hardware.

In July 2021, Thales joined hands with IIIT-Delhi on open hardware Research and Development. The collaboration seeks to enable co-development of complex microprocessor architectures and multi-core processing systems using configurations available with the RISC-V open ISA specification. These systems will bring value to applications in areas such as edge computing, smart manufacturing, defence and space."

But the effort is facing stiff resistance from the Belgium government which are worried over Chad’s spotty human rights track record

The Belgian government cited the brutal repression of demonstrations last October by Chadian security forces that left around fifty people dead.

Chadian Cessna 208s are equipped with L3 Wescam MX-15 cameras which can support up to six sensors simultaneously, and blend electro-optical and Infrared imagery.

However, Chadian government has earmarked $15 million since 2021 to upgrade and arm its two Cessna 208 aircraft which are still not operational since they were delivered in 2018.

Sofema, a French military equipment specialist in partnership with Belgian Thales will convert the two Cessna 208 aircraft.

The authorities in Belgium’s Walloon region, which has control over Thales’ exports from the country, vetoed the sale of FZ275 laser-guided rockets.

The French company Safran has already delivered its Euroflir 410 optronic pods since last February, but the aircraft are not yet in use because the guided rockets and missile have not arrived.

The Euroflir™ 410 family allows fixed, rotary-wing aircraft and UAV to carry out, in any conditions, ISR, search and rescue missions due to long-range observation and accurate targeting and designation capabilities.

France had earlier postponed the sale of Safran ISR equipment to Chad’s air force, to the great displeasure of N’Djamena, however, the Chadian air force tried to turn instead to the Israeli firm Elbit Systems.

But negotiations between Thales, Sofema and N’Djamena are still in going.

The aircraft will now likely be armed with Turkish Cirit air-to-surface laser-guided missiles produced by Roketsan to carry out counter-insurgency missions.

Recent rapport with Turkey will guarantee the sale of the Cirit laser-guided rockets. Chad is already expecting three Hürkuş light combat aircraft from Turkey due to arrive later this year.

Chad’s efforts to forego it’s traditional suppliers for Western and European arms in order to reinforce the legitimacy of General Itno Déby regime seems not to be going according to plans.

As the security situation in the region is fluid, Chad may likely have carried out an attack against Wagner and CAR troops on the behest and assistance of France in December last year.

French defense company Thales will be partnering with India’s state-owned Bharat Dynamics Limited (BDL) to set up local manufacturing of the former’s Forges de Zeebrugge (FZ) 275 70 mm/2.75-inch laser-guided rockets (LGRs) in India

French defense company Thales will be partnering with India’s state-owned Bharat Dynamics Limited (BDL) to set up local manufacturing of the former’s Forges de Zeebrugge (FZ) 275 70 mm/2.75-inch laser-guided rockets (LGRs) in India, Report informs referring to the Asian Military Review.

The joint announcement noted that anticipated memorandum of understanding (MoU) will provide an opportunity for BDL to offer locally produced FZ275 LGRs for the Indian armed forces’ growing fleet of indigenously developed Advanced Light Helicopters (ALHs) and Light Combat Helicopters (LCHs).

Thales also said that BDL is also expected to become a part of the FZ275 LGR global supply chain, providing components to existing and future customers around the world.

The FZ275 is a semi-active laser (SAL) folding fin aerial rocket (FFAR) that measures 1.75 m long and has a loaded weight of around 12.5 kg and range of between 1.5 and 6 km.

The FZ275 LGR’s SAL seeker is compatible with NATO standard (STANAG 3733) laser pulse repetition frequency codes, although other laser codes can also be integrated for non-NATO customers.

The standard FZ275 LGR is equipped with the FZ71 high explosive general purpose warhead, although other types of warheads – such as the FZ319 high explosive armor piercing and the FZ181 flash/illuminating – are also available. The rocket can be used to engage light-armored vehicles and other soft-skinned vehicles and infrastructure."
Peregrine rotary wing UAV to enter service with the Royal Navy - Navy Lookout,"Fri, 10 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdnlsb29rb3V0LmNvbS9wZXJlZ3JpbmUtcm90YXJ5LXdpbmctdWF2LXRvLWVudGVyLXNlcnZpY2Utd2l0aC10aGUtcm95YWwtbmF2eS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Under the Future Tactical Uncrewed Air System (FUTAS) programme, the RN has selected the Schiebel S-100 Camcopter which will operate in the intelligence-gathering, surveillance and reconnaissance role, initially from warships based in the Persian Gulf.

The Rotary Wing Uncrewed Air System (RWUAS) can provide real-time imagery and radar data back to a parent ship and will become operational in mid-2024, with HMS Lancaster likely to be the first vessel to carry the aircraft. Peregrine will fly in conjunction with the Wildcat helicopter but its data can be fed directly into the ship’s combat management system, (unlike the Wildcat which lacks a TDL), aiding situational awareness and rapid decision-making.

The standard S-100 can be launched rapidly, has a 6-hour endurance, a top speed of around 120 knots and a range of around 180 km (97nm), although this varies depending on the payload.

Thales is the prime contractor and systems integrator, providing their I-Master radar, a compact, lightweight airborne surveillance radar that offers ultra-fine Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery, Maritime Moving Target Indication (MMTI) and Ground Moving Target Indication (GMTI) modes. I-Master was first integrated with the S-100 in 2013 is capable of detecting small and slow-moving targets. Thales says the radar can detect ships at up to 100km, vehicles at 35km and infantry movement at 15km. (The I-Master radar can be seen in the main image above as the main payload carried below the aircraft. The EO camera is mounted in the nose.) Peregrine will also have an Automatic Identification System (AIS) and the CarteNav AIMS Mission System for multi-sensor integration, planning, collection and information dissemination.

The contract with Thales is initially for 2 years with an option to extend. This very cautious approach will allow the RN to learn lessons from RWUAS operations that will inform decisions around the Future Maritime Aviation Force programme. The Austrian-made Schibel S-100 is a very mature platform that has been in service with civilian and military users since 2005. Accumulating more than 100,000 operating hours, it has performed more than 2,000 deck launches and recoveries from ships including in challenging winds and sea states.

As we have previously observed, is hard to understand why the RN did not grasp the opportunity to bring this capability into service years ago as it dramatically extends the area that a single warship can monitor at a fraction of the cost of launching a crewed helicopter. It is also a lot less unwieldy than the Scan Eagle UAS the RN experimented with between 2014-17.

The aircraft has been named after HMS Peregrine, the former Royal Naval Air Station Ford in West Sussex. The air station was the Fleet Air Arm’s test and development centre in the early years of carrier-borne jet aircraft but was closed in 1959 and is now the site of an open prison. There is another link to naval image gathering as HMS Peregrine was also home for many years of the RN School of Photography and the ‘Peregrine trophy’ is also the name of the annual RN photographic awards."

Anglo-French row erupts over breakdown of Britain's £3bn aircraft carrier - The Telegraph,"Fri, 10 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlbGVncmFwaC5jby51ay9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIzLzAyLzEwL2FuZ2xvLWZyZW5jaC1yb3ctZXJ1cHRzLWJyZWFrZG93bi1icml0YWlucy0zYm4tYWlyY3JhZnQtY2Fycmllci_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"However, the Government report, which according to Navy sources is due “very soon”, is understood to focus on a component on the propeller shaft that may have failed because of design or fitting failures, dashing these hopes.

If it does prove to be a design flaw or construction problem, the companies should be on the hook for the cost of repairing it, says former defence minister and member of commons defence committee Mark Francois.

He said: “It seems clear that if there is an inherent design or construction flaw, it should be down to the Aircraft Carrier Alliance, or their subcontractors, who actually built the ship, to pay to fix it, not the taxpayer. We cannot afford a £3 billion plus aircraft carrier with a limp.”’

The contract covering the building of the carrier is understood to make the contractors jointly liable. Given this, the companies involved are likely to want to get to the bottom of what happened as well

Repairs will be undertaken at Babcock’s shipyard in Rosyth under a maintenance deal with the MoD, although that deal is understood to not cover costs beyond routine maintenance.

Shipbuilding bosses are keen that the problem does not derail the joint venture structure used to build the ships, which helps spread work over a number of shipyards and therefore helps maintain skills should more work come their way.

Industry sources are at a loss as to how the ship passed sea trials and has now developed this problem.

However, the propeller shaft problems are the latest setback to the troubled project. Flooding issues in 2020 meant that the vessel spent less than 90 days at sea in two years and led to £3.3m of repair work.

Last week, MPs questioned Vice Admiral Paul Marshall about problems with the HMS Prince of Wales. He said that the broken starboard shaft should be fixed by the Spring, but revealed that investigators had found “issues” with the port shaft of the vessel as well.

He declined to say whether a build defect or damage at sea was the problem, but allayed MPs’ fears that its sister ship could have the same defect.

“We are confident that [...] it is not a class issue with the carriers,” he said.

A Babcock spokesman said: “One of the most complex maritime engineering programmes in the UK, the Alliance was supported by a supply chain of hundreds of organisations across the country. We remain focused on completing the repair, working with the MOD and other industry partners.”

A Royal Navy spokesman said: “We remain committed to ensuring HMS Prince of Wales commences her operational programme, as planned, in autumn 2023.

“An investigation has been commissioned to establish the cause of the starboard shaft failure on HMS Prince of Wales. This is nearing completion and it would be inappropriate to comment any further at this time.”"

Baroness Goldie, the defence minister, confirmed in a parliamentary answer that the Ministry of Defence had begun an investigation into who will bear the “cost of repairs and responsibility for payment” for what has been called a national embarrassment.

Ukraine hails French gift of radar as 'cherry on the cake' - CityNews Toronto,"Wed, 01 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vdG9yb250by5jaXR5bmV3cy5jYS8yMDIzLzAyLzAxL3VrcmFpbmUtaGFpbHMtZnJlbmNoLWdpZnQtb2YtcmFkYXItYXMtY2hlcnJ5LW9uLXRoZS1jYWtlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LIMOURS, France (AP) — Ukraine’s defense minister said Wednesday that Ukrainian lives will be saved by a sophisticated air-defense radar that France is supplying and which is powerful enough to spot incoming missiles and exploding drones in the skies over all of Ukraine’s capital and its surrounding region.

The minister, Oleksii Reznikov, was so enthusiastic about what he called Ukraine’s new “electronic eyes” that he quickly coined a nickname for the Ground Master 200 radar — the “Grand Master.”

Speaking through an interpreter at a handover ceremony for the radar with his French counterpart, Reznikov described the French-made GM200 as a “very effective” improvement for Ukraine’s network of about 300 different types of air-defense radars.

Thales, the manufacturer, says the radar detects and tracks rockets, artillery and mortar shells, missiles, aircraft, drones and other threats.

“Because of your support, Ukrainian lives will be saved,” the minister said at the ceremony in Limours, where Thales makes the equipment.

“This radar will be the cherry on the cake,” he added. “That’s why it will be called ‘Grand Master.’”

The French defense minister, Sebastien Lecornu, said the GM200’s range of 250 kilometers (155 miles) would enable it to watch the skies over Kyiv and the Ukrainian capital’s surrounding region, although it wasn’t clear whether that’s where Ukrainian forces intend to deploy it.

The radar is transportable on a truck. Thales says it can be deployed in 15 minutes and be moved to another location in 10 minutes, making it a harder target to hit.

The minister was gifted a small model of the radar at the ceremony and brandished it with a big grin above his head.
