MBDA and Thales extend their cooperation on CAMM | Press Release - mbda-systems.com,"Fri, 05 Apr 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1iZGEtc3lzdGVtcy5jb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvbWJkYS1hbmQtdGhhbGVzLWV4dGVuZC10aGVpci1jb29wZXJhdGlvbi1vbi1jYW1tL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The core Team Complex Weapons (Team CW) air defence missile development programme – the Common Anti-air Modular Missile (CAMM) for the Future Local Anti-Air Defence System (FLAADS) – has been the catalyst for the creation of a new business relationship between MBDA and Thales UK’s Belfast site.

Over the last year, as part of on-going activity to develop the UK Complex Weapons (CW) supply chain and to realise the complementary skills of Thales, the two companies have been exploring opportunities to work together on CAMM, drawing on the missile design and manufacture capabilities in Northern Ireland.

Work placed with Thales Belfast on this important development project now exceeds £1M and has also opened up opportunities for a further £8M of manufacturing work in the next phase of the project. Thales is involved in a number of aspects of the CAMM Demonstration project with work now covering the assessment and modelling of the thermal management within the missile, structural analysis work, and the use of precision manufacturing capabilities to make a number of the missile components.

Steve Wadey, MBDA Executive Group Director Technical and Managing Director UK, commented that “This is a significant milestone between MBDA and Thales Belfast, demonstrating a new business relationship utilising CW capabilities across the UK in the most effective way for the benefit of our customers”.

Alex Cresswell, Executive Vice President for Land and Air Systems at Thales, said, “The companies are now planning to build on this successful start in the next few months by putting in place a single overall enabling contract to facilitate the efficient placement of future work. This illustrates the commitment of both MBDA and Thales to work together to benefit our complex weapon customers.”

The companies are now exploring a number of areas of likely cooperation across other projects and throughout the product lifecycle. In the area of In-Service Support (ISS), for example, the companies are working together to see what additional value can be delivered to the UK customer by exploiting the opportunity created by the British Army re-basing decision to bring all of its current air defence assets together at Thorney Island.

In addition, MBDA and Thales UK’s Basingstoke site have also taken significant steps forward over the last six months using two pilot projects, focused on missile safety and arming units and intelligent fuzes, to transform the traditional transactional customer-supplier relationship into one where both parties are actively working together. In January 2012, MBDA selected Thales Basingstoke to supply the CAMM laser proximity fuze under an £11m contract."
Eighth and Final Royal Navy Frigate Upgraded with Sonar 2087 - MarineLink,"Wed, 10 Apr 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmluZWxpbmsuY29tL25ld3MvdXBncmFkZWQtZnJpZ2F0ZS1laWdodGgzNTMzNjTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Following an extensive refit, HMS Portland has become the final Royal Navy Type 23 frigate to be fitted with Thales U.K.’s Sonar 2087, a towed array sonar system that enables warships to hunt submarines at considerable distances and locate them beyond the range from which they can launch an attack. Portland has now returned to service, with a rededication ceremony on March 21.



The 12-month multi-million pound refit in Rosyth Royal Dockyard of Portland’s sensors, weapons and systems completes a successful joint program between industry and the U.K.’s Ministry of Defense (MOD) to ensure the upgraded ships are now the most advanced of their kind in service.



The Royal Navy has described how the combination of a Type 23 frigate fitted with Thales’s Sonar 2087 and a Merlin helicopter equipped with the Thales FLASH dipping sonar makes the class the “most potent anti-submarine warfare platform of any navy at sea today”.



Eight of the Royal Navy’s fleet of Type 23 frigates have now been upgraded for use as submarine hunters. The other seven upgraded ships are Westminster, Northumberland, Richmond, Somerset, Sutherland, Kent and St. Albans.



Sonar 2087 is a low-frequency sonar with both active and passive sonar arrays. The system is manufactured at Thales sites in the U.K. (Cheadle Heath in Manchester and Templecombe in Somerset) and France (Brest).



Greg Pugh, Sensors Program Manager for the MOD’s Defense Equipment and Support headquarters, said, “The T23 frigates are at the heart of the Royal Navy’s frontline fleet, and are proving to be a formidable and highly-effective capability. The Sonar 2087 is a very capable ASW system, giving these platforms a significant capability enhancement.”



Ed Lowe, head of Thales U.K.’s naval business, said, “We welcome the news that HMS Portland has completed this upgrade. Fitted with Sonar 2087 and FLASH dipping sonar, the Type 23s represent a formidable anti-submarine warfare force. We are proud to be a key sensor supplier to the Royal Navy.”
