Thales becomes latest global giant to open AI lab in Montreal - The Globe and Mail,"Tue, 10 Oct 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWdsb2JlYW5kbWFpbC5jb20vdGVjaG5vbG9neS90aGFsZXMtYmVjb21lcy1sYXRlc3QtZ2xvYmFsLWdpYW50LXRvLW9wZW4tYWktbGFiLWluLW1vbnRyZWFsL2FydGljbGUzNjUyNzIwMC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Siegfried Usal, vice-president of strategy, research and technology with Thales’ Canadian operation said the new Montreal-based lab will develop AI applications for use by its airline, air traffic, satellite rail military and infrastructure customers.Getty Images/iStockphoto Share

French industrial giant Thales SA has become the latest in a slew of foreign multinationals to open an artificial intelligence research lab in Montreal.

The company, which employs 1,800 people in Canada, is announcing Tuesday it will open a lab in Montreal early next year in collaboration with the Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms (MILA), with plans to hire 50 AI scientists by mid-2019. Thales' AI-related research is concentrated in Paris, where it employs 120 AI research scientists and developers. The company currently employs 15 AI professionals at its operations in Toronto and Quebec City.

""We want to create new technologies based on AI that we can industrialize in our verticals and sell to the world,"" said Siegfried Usal, vice-president of strategy, research and technology with Thales' Canadian operation, which generates $500-million in annual revenue from such ventures as building mass transit signalling technology and control systems for business jets. He said the lab will develop AI applications for use by its airline, air traffic, satellite rail military and infrastructure customers. ""What we propose…is to bring AI to the physical world.""

Thales is the fourth foreign giant since August to announce a new AI lab in Montreal, home to Yoshua Bengio, a pioneering AI academic with University of Montreal and a driving force behind the development of the city's AI-focused institutions, including MILA and the Institute of Data Valorization (IVADO). Last month, Facebook hired renowned McGill University professor Joelle Pineau to head its lab in the city, and her colleague Doina Precup was hired to lead a Montreal lab for DeepMind Technologies Ltd, the British AI company owned by Google parent Alphabet Inc. Samsung Electronics' Advanced Institute of Technology opened an AI lab at the University of Montreal in August. Microsoft Corp. this year bought Montreal AI startup Maluuba and backed local AI startup Element AI in its fundraising.

Recent breakthroughs in such areas of AI as ""deep learning"" and ""reinforcement learning"" – much of it generated by academics either trained or based in Canada – have turned the field into one of the hottest areas of technology, enabling machines to recognize patterns and make predictions based on vast troves of data. Many global tech giants have invested heavily in AI – hiring up many of the leading academics in Canada and elsewhere – in the hopes of developing leadership in what is expected to become a dominant, general-purpose technology.

Thales already uses AI for a range of applications, including helping air-traffic managers more effectively manage the skies and suggesting efficient flight plans for aircraft to help operators reduce fuel costs. The company recently built a control centre in Mexico City to help police more swiftly gather images of crimes in motion to reduce their response times. Thales already supports both IVADO and the Vector Institute, a new AI-focused research organization in Toronto.

Mr. Bengio said while the recent moves by multinationals to open AI labs in Montreal helps to bolster the reputation of the city and Canada as a global AI hub, ""the negative is that I don't think that it is by these companies that Canada will emerge as a world leader in AI. Those foreign companies might be doing research here [but] the products are going to be manufactured or sold from elsewhere, and the profits for those products will be taxed in other countries, so it's not really going to help Canada make the transition that's probably going to happen in the next decade due to automation and AI.

""The only way we'll become a real world leader in this field is if we have enough Canadian companies becoming strong players.""","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999852180480957}",neutral,0.9999852180480957,0

Thales Leites defends Bisping vs. St-Pierre: UFC sells entertainment and people buy it - MMA Fighting,"Sat, 07 Oct 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1tYWZpZ2h0aW5nLmNvbS8yMDE3LzEwLzcvMTY0MTM4MDIvdWZjLTIxNi10aGFsZXMtbGVpdGVzLW1pY2hhZWwtYmlzcGluZy1nZW9yZ2VzLXN0LXBpZXJyZS1nc3AtdWZjLWVudGVydGFpbm1lbnTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales Leites returns to the Octagon at Saturday’s pay-per-view event in Las Vegas, and while many fellow UFC middleweights complain about the upcoming title bout, he has a different opinion regarding the state of the division.

One of the last men to face Michael Bisping before “The Count"" captured middleweight gold, Leites, who takes on Brad Tavares at UFC 216 on Oct. 7, sees the clash between the British star and former welterweight kingpin Georges St-Pierre at Madison Square Garden as a chance for the fighters to make more money.

""Everyone criticizes this fight, but everyone will watch it,” Leites told MMA Fighting. ""I don’t think (Bisping) is wrong. He’s going after superfights and keeping the belt longer. This fight with St-Pierre will sell a lot. Everyone will watch it. People might complain about it, but will watch it when the day comes.

""The UFC sells entertainment. If you sell it and people buy it, it’s working. It’s good for (other) fighters who want that, too.""

The big question about this match-up is what will happen with the 185-pound belt next. With Robert Whittaker currently holding an interim title, Bisping talking about a potential retirement with a win in New York City, and the possibility of GSP going back to 170, the division could see Whittaker ending 2017 as the undisputed champion.

""GSP is getting the title shot now, and whoever wins, I don’t think they will continue (the title reign) much longer,” Leites said. ""Bisping is fighting for a long time, and GSP, if he wins, he won’t keep it. He won’t keep the belt much longer. … This is more of a superfight. I see this as a superfight.”

We won’t know for sure if Bisping will actually retire after UFC 217 until Nov. 4, but the Brazilian doesn’t believe money would be a reason for “The Count” to either fight again or leave the sport for good.

""I think he has made a lot of money in his life, he’s one of the most well-paid fighters in the UFC,” Leites said. ""He was the name in Europe before (Conor) McGregor. I don’t think it's about money. He could’ve had retired already but he put his name in history, and he wants to keep moving forward.""

The Nova Uniao veteran, who lost a split decision to Bisping back in 2015, would pick the current champion to win at UFC 217, but believes “everything can happen” when St-Pierre is in the cage.

""Bisping has the advantage because this is his division, he’s taller and stronger,” Leites said, ""but GSP is one of a kind. He has showed that he has a real chance of becoming champion. But I see a slight advantage for Bisping because he’s more active than St-Pierre and because this is his real division.”

Leites, a former UFC middleweight contender himself, is still going after a second shot at the gold after coming up shot against Anderson Silva in 2009. Ranked at No. 13 in the division and coming off a win over Sam Alvey, Leites sees his match-up with Tavares as a chance to climb another step in the middleweight division.

""I believe (Tavares) will try to keep the fight standing like he always does in every one of his fights,” Leites said. ""He has a good cardio, a good volume of strikes standing, but I see holes in his game. Everyone has holes in their games, especially if you start to analyze everyone’s fights closely, as I’m sure he did with my game as well. I see the holes in his game and worked on this to go there and seize the opportunity.

""I think everything that is happening right now (in the middleweight division) is good,” he continued. ""There are a lot of great fighters in the division. Everyone in the top 10 has a good shot at becoming the champion, and there are a lot of great fighters outside the ranking. There’s no easy fight. Everyone is tough.""","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9996657371520996}",neutral,0.9996657371520996,0
Thales Towed Synthetic Aperture Sonar for mine hunting - Defence Procurement International,"Tue, 31 Oct 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuY2Vwcm9jdXJlbWVudGludGVybmF0aW9uYWwuY29tL25ld3MvbWFyaXRpbWUvdGhhbGVzLXRvd2VkLXN5bnRoZXRpYy1hcGVydHVyZS1zb25hci1mb3ItbWluZS1odW50aW5n0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales' Towed Synthetic Aperture Sonar

A NATO report has awarded a high probability of detection and classification to a Synthetic Aperture Sonar system on board an autonomous unmanned vehicle platform for unmanned mine detection at sea, says Thales.

Thales demonstrated its SAMDIS Multi-view Synthetic Aperture Sonar (SAS) system integrated on board an ECA Group A27 autonomous underwatervehicle (AUV) platform, during a mine warfare sea exercise held at Zeebrugge Naval Base during the Belgian Defence Technology & Industry Day in June this year.

According to Thales, an official report from NATO’s Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation (CMRE) on the trials, indicates an excellent measured performance at sea for the sonar, featuring a very high probability of detection and classification associated to a low false alarm rate.

Thales says the results are significant given that the sonar provided a high combined level of detection and classification needed to counter modern mines. By defeating static underwater threats while reducing human exposure, Thales says its autonomous mine-hunting systems give strategic, operational and tactical freedom of manoeuvre to help navies move safely along strategic routes and through choke points.

In the framework of the Belgian/Dutch MCM capability replacement programme, Thales will rely on its multi-domain pedigree to offer solutions in mine countermeasures' mission system integration and naval combat systems. This will ensure a strong level of local industry involvement in terms of system development as well as future system support.

Since 2016, Thales has performed demonstrations involving its Halcyon unmanned surface vessel towing its Towed Synthetic Aperture Sonar (TSAS) off the North Sea Coast of Zeebrugge in Belgium, and in Northern Scotland for the Royal Navy Unmanned Warrior exercises.

At the end of the 2016 trials in Belgium, Thales says it was already well assessed for detection performance against all mine types.

Thales is the prime contractor of the Maritime Mine Counter Measures (MMCM) programme, the only European project aimed at developing, concretely, a prototype autonomous system for detection and neutralisation of sea mines and underwater improvised explosive devices, under a cooperation agreement between France and the United Kingdom.

“The technology is maturing, but MMCM is the only programme that has sought to develop a complete end-to-end system based on a full user requirement, and to test it in real environmental conditions against realistic MCM operational scenarios,” an MMCM programme manager stated.

The MMCM programme will deliver two prototype/ demonstrator systems; one for France and one for the UK; and the contract includes an option for a two-year period of in-service support, during which the Marine Nationale and Royal Navy will evaluate the delivered systems.

The UK demonstrator will inform requirements for the UK’s Mine Countermeasures and Hydrographic Capability (MHC) programme.

A key challenge, says the programme manager, is to demonstrate that the capability can be delivered with the necessary level of confidence, including mission survivability, availability and reliability. The MMCM programme enables the challenges to be tested, understood, known, overcome and fully assessed before capability is delivered enabling confidence to grow in a transition between current and future capability.

At DSEI in London in September, the UK Royal Navy’s First Sea Lord, Admiral Sir Philip Jones, said that an unmanned system for mine countermeasures would be deliverable in the next two years.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.6640945076942444}",neutral,0.6640945076942444,0

LinkedIn

Engineers find solutions to problems for almost every element of modern life which impacts the way we work and live. Emma Barden does just that. Working as a Senior Research Engineer at Thales Research and Technology, she tells us about her passion for taking things apart, her work at Thales and how we can overcome the skills shortage.

Emma – the big question: what inspired you to get into engineering?

I was one of those kids who collected bugs and was always taking things apart. It was a combination of things I enjoyed, making things work, and applying maths and science. This led to my decision to study Electronic and Communications Engineering at the University of Kent. If you like solving problems, you’ll most likely fit the profile of an engineer.

What made you apply for a role at Thales?

I chose Thales because of the scope for growth and progression in terms of career. Working in the research field means that I have the ability to cut across into different domains to find solutions for a range of different products, many of which make a massive difference to how we live. I love my role at Thales as I get to be involved with a range of activities – for example STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) outreach is really important to me.



What are you currently working on?

I’m currently working on VHF (very high frequency) radio communications systems for aircraft, which is an existing platform. What I’m doing is working on making the hardware smaller, more cost effective, and better to use.



What does this technology mean to the end user – you and me?

If we can make radio systems on planes perform better, by making them more efficient, you can allow for more bandwidth to fit in the fun things like a greater selection of films to view whilst on board. You won’t be compromising the safety of the pilot (and in turn the passengers on the plane!). Everyone wants to be able to connect to multiple devices, which aren’t compatible and so part of my job is to overcome some of the most difficult engineering challenges, which keeps the work interesting!

Diversity is key for an organisation to succeed – what do you think the industry should do to encourage more women into engineering?

We need more of everyone in engineering! Everything you interact with every day - electricity, vehicles, computers, ovens and security systems, for example - someone had to design, build, and test, or in other words, ‘engineer’ it. What most people fail to realise is that they already possess the necessary skills, which are applicable in engineering contexts. The industry needs to demystify what engineers do, the sort of people that do it, and help people to understand how rewarding and important the work is. I don’t think you can be innovative without being diverse as an organisation.

What has been your proudest achievement during your career?

I am always proud of how much I have learnt, how every day I know a little bit more about how something works or why. It's good to realise when you can about a topic confidently, despite not even having heard of it a few months earlier!

What would be your dream project to work on?

Anything involved with changing the world and pushing the boundaries of human knowledge really excites me. Thales pushes boundaries with its research and development – we have the ability to create anything smarter, faster, and cheaper. I don’t mind what it is, as long as it’s the cutting edge!

Working to increase the number of women in engineering is a key business priority at Thales in the UK. We are continually supporting this initiative across the UK by working closely with local schools, providing inspiring examples of what women do in the engineering industry and demonstrate the different educational routes to get them there.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9961297512054443}",neutral,0.9961297512054443,0

The scientists concluded that the explosion resulting from a neutron star merger produces heavy elements like gold and platinum!

The top artistic view shows two tiny but very dense neutron stars at the point where they merge and explode as a “kilonova”. An event such as this is exceedingly rare, and is expected to produce gravitational waves and a short burst of gamma rays – both observed on August 17, 2017 by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO), in the United States, and the Virgo Interferometer, in Italy, as well as ESA’s INTEGRAL spacecraft and NASA’s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope.

Fifteen years ago, on October 17, 2002 at 6:41 GMT, the European Space Agency's INTEGRAL mission was launched to detect gamma rays and other energetic spectra in the Universe, and to look for new sources in this relatively unexplored field. It has met and even exceeded all these objectives.

Discovering about 100 new gamma-ray sources a year, the satellite is still operational and continues to contribute substantially to discoveries in high-energy astrophysics and to help solve some of the biggest mysteries in astronomy.

INTEGRAL is an outstanding example of the longevity that a well-planned and executed space mission can offer. After 15 years the spacecraft and its scientific instruments are still operating perfectly, and this performance has enabled ESA to plan the extension of its operational lifetime until at least December 31, 2018.

Integral is a truly international mission with the participation of all ESA member states, plus the United States, Russia, Czech Republic and Poland. Thales Alenia Space (at the time Alenia Aerospazio, Italy) was named industrial prime contractor by ESA, in charge of satellite design, integration and testing.

Thales UK has welcomed the news of the MOD’s new £1billion support model for the Royal Navy which will bring one approach to keeping the Fleet ready for operations.

For Thales, it means a £100 million contract for providing internal and external communications systems support for fleet-wide communications, including long-term support for the QEC Carriers and Type 45 Destroyers.The model confirms Thales’s presence at the heart of Royal Navy communications systems – the ability for ships and aircraft to talk to each other. Our communications systems are critical for the new platforms such as the Queen Elizabeth Aircraft Carriers and Type 45 Destroyers to operate at sea.The Thales communications systems fitted to the carriers and supported under this new contract enable the ship’s company to talk securely to each other within the vessel, its aircraft, the rest of the Navy, allies, civilian vessels and air traffic, anywhere in the world.Without these systems being operational, the ships cannot go to sea. The new contract brings a new harmonised approach to communications support on board.Under this new seven year contract, around 40 Thales jobs have been secured at Crawley, Portsmouth, Plymouth and Bristol, and a further 40 companies are involved with the UK and global supply chain.“We are the key sensor and systems partner for the Royal Navy with our communications, sonar, radar, optronic and electronic warfare systems giving the Fleet that critical situational awareness capability.

MEOLUT Next confirms in 2017 best-in-class performance - Thales,"Fri, 13 Oct 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi93b3JsZHdpZGUvc3BhY2UvbmV3cy9tZW9sdXQtbmV4dC1jb25maXJtcy0yMDE3LWJlc3QtY2xhc3MtcGVyZm9ybWFuY2XSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"After being commissioned in August 2016, MEOLUT Next started operation on December 13 of that year, as the world’s first spaceborne Search & Rescue system of this type. Since then, MEOLUT Next has continuously delivered high performance, especially in terms of coverage and positioning precision. The latest COSPAS/SARSAT demonstration & evaluation tests of the MEOSAR service have proven the ability of the MEOLUT Next system in France to detect distress signals from a test beacon in Miami, Florida, over 5,000 kilometers away! These tests clearly showed the power of MEOLUT Next signal correlation algorithms, coupled with an ability to track all satellites in view of the phased array antenna. The MEOLUT Next system regularly provides geolocation of distress signals from the Gulf of Mexico, Arctic Ocean and Red Sea.



In short, Thales Alenia Space’s breakthrough technology has proven its ability to deliver unprecedented performance, and therefore help the COSPAS/SARSAT Search & Rescue service (MEOSAR) save time and money, and save even more lives.

What's COSPAS/SARSAT?



COSPAS/SARSAT is an intergovernmental organization founded by Canada, the United States, Russia and France. In operation since 1985, it provides a free global Search & Rescue service, using the infrastructures from 43 countries worldwide. French space agency CNES is the official French representative for this organization. Today, some 500,000 ships and 150,000 aircraft are equipped with COSPAS/SARSAT distress beacons, allowing them to use this service. The service has saved more than 37,000 lives since the outset.



How does COSPAS/SARSAT work?



The beacon on a plane or ship is triggered, manually or automatically, and transmits a distress signal at a frequency of 406 MHz. This signal is picked up by surveillance satellites, which retransmit it to a Local User Terminal (LUT) on the ground. This terminal processes the signal, calculates the position of the transmitting beacon, and sends this information to the Mission Control Center (MCC). The MCC is in charge of filtering out false alerts, and then contacting the most appropriate Rescue Coordination Center (RCC), to save the persons in danger.



Until now, this system has called on secondary payloads on observation satellites in both low Earth orbit (LEOSAR), which will be reaching end-of-life towards 2020, and geostationary Earth orbit (GEOSAR). Satellites in medium Earth orbit (MEOSAR), with secondary payloads mounted on GPS, Galileo and Glonass positioning system satellites, will then take over this task, improving performance, precision and responsiveness.





The MEOSAR approach

Because of the large number of satellites visible to a given beacon (up to 30), the MEOSAR service can indicate the position of an endangered person in less than 10 minutes (versus 2 hours for the LEO and GEO generations). Furthermore, the position-determination accuracy improves to just 200 meters, versus 5 kilometers previously. Another major advantage is that moving beacons (typically in aircraft) can be detected, which was not the case previously. MEOSAR services will start operating by the end of 2018, and will be able to detect the location of aircraft in trouble during their flight.





Thales Alenia Space's MEOLUT Next solution





Thales Alenia Space's solution uses compact active antennas comprising 64 patches. These antennas are fitted with a high-performance RF (radio frequency) unit, for upstream digitizing of the signal, followed by a highly innovative algorithmic beamforming processing method.



Conventional MEOLUT systems, each fitted with six large parabolic antennas in an area about the size of a football field, are capable of receiving signals from six satellites (one per antenna). Thales Alenia Space's MEOLUT Next solution, with its small antennas located in less than 6 square meters, tracks up to 30 satellites, thus significantly enhancing the distress beacon detection rate, while also expanding the coverage zone. Furthermore, since there are no mechanical components in these antennas, hardware maintenance costs are the lowest on the market. Thales Alenia Space already contributes to the COSPAS/SARSAT system as exclusive supplier of digital signal processors (DSP) on LEOSAR satellites since the 1990s. Today, Thales Alenia Space is offering a brand-new solution concerning the Local User Terminals (LUT). These terminals are in charge of processing the signals received from the satellites and calculating the position of the beacon, then sending it to the Mission Control Center.Thales Alenia Space's solution uses compact active antennas comprising 64 patches.

"GRICAS, an operational solution for aeronautical Search & Rescue that will save more lives - Thales","Fri, 13 Oct 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi93b3JsZHdpZGUvc3BhY2UvbmV3cy9ncmljYXMtb3BlcmF0aW9uYWwtc29sdXRpb24tYWVyb25hdXRpY2FsLXNlYXJjaC1yZXNjdWUtd2lsbC1zYXZlLW1vcmUtbGl2ZXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Imagine the following: a technical incident occurs on a long-haul commercial flight. The aircraft’s computer identifies the root cause of the problem and activates a distress beacon while the plane is still en route. It sends out a distress signal, picked up by the special payloads on certain navigation satellites (including Galileo), which retransmit these signals to a ground station, called the Local User Terminal (LUT). This terminal receives and processes the warning message, calculates the position of the transmitter based on certain characteristics of the received signal, and sends this data to the Mission Control Center. The MCC then passes on this information to Rescue Coordination Centers (RCC), which are in charge of launching rescue operations by calling on the appropriate organizations. In other words, while the aircraft is still in flight, the entire rescue process is already set up.

Beforehand, a scenario of this type was unthinkable: the distress beacon was designed so that it could only be activated after a crash. Today, a study called GRICAS [Galileo Search and Rescue Return Link Improvement for a better Civil Aviation Safety] is investigating an innovative solution to improve operational Search & Rescue (SAR) systems for civil aviation… and save human lives!

MEOSAR

Until now, the COSPAS-SARSAT* system operated via secondary payloads carried by observation satellites in low Earth orbit (LEOSAR), which will be reaching end-of-life towards 2020, and geostationary orbit (GEOSAR). A new service in medium Earth orbit (MEOSAR) will then take over this task starting in 2018, using secondary payloads mounted on GPS, Galileo and Glonass satellites, to improve performance, precision and responsiveness.

Thanks to the large number of satellites visible to a given beacon (up to 30), the MEOSAR service can indicate the position of an endangered person in less than 10 minutes (versus 2 hours for the LEO and GEO generations). Furthermore, stationary beacons or those moving at low speed can be located to within 200 meters, versus 5 kilometers previously. Another major advantage is that fast-moving beacons (typically in aircraft) can be detected and located in flight, with guaranteed accuracy, which was not the case previously. MEOSAR services will start operating by the end of 2018, and will be able to detect the location of aircraft in distress during different flight phases. And this is where GRICAS comes in.





What exactly is GRICAS?



GRICAS is a study initiated by the European GNSS Agency (GSA), within the scope of the Space section of the Horizon 2020 research & innovation program. A consortium led by Thales Alenia Space is developing innovative operational concepts to improve aeronautical SAR, by calling on the COSPAS-SARSAT MEOSAR system. The consortium submits recommendations to EUROCAE, the European organization for aviation standards, especially through an international working group involving RTCA (the U.S. aviation standards organization) and COSPAS-SARSAT. The activities of the GRICAS project are carried out within the scope of the development of an Autonomous Distress Tracking solution, as part of the EUROCAE GADSS (Global Aeronautical Distress and Safety System).

The activities of the GRICAS project are carried out within the scope of the development of an Autonomous Distress Tracking solution, as part of the EUROCAE GADSS (Global Aeronautical Distress and Safety System). The project draws on recommendations from the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to facilitate the development of an autonomous warning system on aircraft, enabling the identification of distress situations in flight.



The consortium has already published a document describing an innovative and ambitious operational concept, and developed, within the scope of the MEOSAR approach, a distress beacon called ELT-DT, capable of being activated automatically or manually in flight, if a situation is detected that could cause the airplane to crash.



For example, the GRICAS ELT-DT beacon, fitted with a GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) receiver, could be triggered automatically if the aircraft stalls, thus enabling ground SAR operators to determine the position of the aircraft in distress situation. Thanks to this beacon, rescue teams can be informed very quickly, in fact before an incident occurs. From this standpoint, we can clearly state that the overall system, combining the precision location of the aircraft, and the fast deployment of rescue organizations, would be able to save people’s lives. Furthermore, the GRICAS beacon offers another significant advantage: it can be remotely activated via the Galileo Return Link, which means that even on an aircraft that has fallen off radar screens and has lost all means of communication, the beacon can be activated. This would enable the instantaneous location of the aircraft to help identify the problem, and rescue the passengers and crew. A function such as this means that we would no longer have to see cases like Flight MH370, which disappeared in March 2014.

GRICAS: revolutionizing the global SAR approach

The GRICAS study kicked off in February 2016 and will be completed in April 2018. The development of the solution relies on the capabilities offered by the MEOLUT Next solution developed by Thales Alenia Space, which offers an excellent fit with aeronautical SAR requirements. Demonstrations of the GRICAS operational concept and tests of the performance offered by the ELT-DT beacon are carried out using the



By 2021, the COSPAS-SARSAT system will be perfectly capable of monitoring aircraft in distress, thanks to ELT-DT beacons. The technical aspects of the solution were successfully tested on a Cessna 182 in April 2017 , showing that an aircraft in flight can be located within about one kilometer. Two new series of tests are scheduled by the end of the project, including one in Toulouse. One of these two series of tests will demonstrate the possibility of remotely activating a beacon from the ground, using a Galileo Return Link message (transmitted via a Galileo satellite to the beacon), to locate an aircraft that has seemingly disappeared. The primary aim of this solution is to improve aeronautical Search & Rescue operations, via the COSPAS-SARSAT system, to save more human lives.

The S1850M is produced by BAE and Thales. It is a modified version of the SMART-L radar. The S1850M is advertised as being capable of fully automatic detection, track initiation and tracking of up to 1,000 targets at a range of 400km. The system is also claimed to be highly capable of detecting stealth targets, and is able to detect and track outer atmosphere objects at short range, making it capable of forming part of a Theatre Ballistic Missile Defence system.

An even stronger version of the S1850M is under testing, which is actually an updated version of the current SMART-L radar that the Dutch Navy will call the SMART-L-EWC (Early Warning Capability) Radar. This will have a greater search radius, be capable of detecting ballistic missiles and have a tracking range of 2000 km for ballistic missile defence and 480km for air defence.

As part of the ongoing Formidable Shield exercise, an international naval exercise organised by the US Navy’s Sixth Fleet for the international organisation for the defence against ballistic missiles, a ballistic missile was launched from the Hebrides.

The Thales SMART-L Multi Mission radar in Hengelo detected the target as soon as it appeared over the horizon. The system maintained a stable track for more than 300 seconds.

Gerben Edelijn, CEO of Thales in the Netherlands said:

“This milestone proves that Thales is a world leader in radar applications for ballistic missile defence. With SMART-L MM, Thales can provide armed forces all over the world with a powerful sensor that enables the protection of nation states against the increasing threat of ballistic missiles.”

Thales say:

“Thales builds the SMART-L Multi Mission radar system for deployement in Naval and Ground-based environments. Four SMART-L MM radar systems will be delivered to the Royal Netherlands Navy, to be installed from 2018 onward on the four De Zeven Provinciën class frigates.

Further, Thales will deliver two SMART-L MM radar systems to the Royal Netherlands Air Force for surveillance of the Netherlands’ national air space. These systems will be installed on two towers. The SMART-L MM supports multiple simultaneous missions including Ballistic Missile Defence.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9964824914932251}",neutral,0.9964824914932251,0
