Could Airbus’ Bizarre New Double Decker Be the Plane of the Future? - Skift Travel News,"Tue, 07 Jul 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vc2tpZnQuY29tLzIwMTUvMDcvMDcvY291bGQtYWlyYnVzLWJpemFycmUtbmV3LWRvdWJsZS1kZWNrZXItYmUtdG9tb3Jyb3dzLWEzODAv0gFaaHR0cHM6Ly9za2lmdC5jb20vMjAxNS8wNy8wNy9jb3VsZC1haXJidXMtYml6YXJyZS1uZXctZG91YmxlLWRlY2tlci1iZS10b21vcnJvd3MtYTM4MC9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"We’re not sure what to make of the Frankenplane, but Airbus' airline customers probably will.

A new patent filed by Airbus has us wondering: Is this new plane a bird, a whale, or a mammoth?

The patent describes an enigmatic double decker aircraft with a variety of possible configurations. Technically, it’s at least three planes, for now, until Airbus decides where to put the wings and the engines.

What’s That in the Sky?

When we looked at the various aircraft configurations proposed, we saw features borrowed from today’s A380, some borrowed from the manufacturer’s aircraft carrier Beluga, even some features that seem inspired by the Russian Antonov aircraft. But little things like aeronautics aside, the common thread is to appeal to airlines by making a double-decker flexible, practical and viable on more routes.

Airbus Knows From Big Birds

The core concept behind this very odd double-decker duck is compelling, and could prove very useful to airlines. It also addresses some of the downsides of the manufacturer’s current double-decker A380.

While some airlines have turned their A380s into brand showcases, a few airlines have found them too big to handle, and others have just avoided them.

Still, some can’t get enough and want them to be bigger and more efficient.

Some attribute this mixed reception to inherent flaws in the A380’s design. The new just-a-concept aircraft in the patent seems to address these A380 deficiencies.

The A380 Vs. the A3-Whatsit

The A380 has a lot of passenger capacity, but the cargo hold isn’t big enough to fit both passenger luggage and profitable cargo in the hold, once you put the fuel in for longer routes.

This concept double-decker makes room for both. As Airbus states:

“[T]he airplane comprises one passenger compartment and cargo compartment whose dimensions can be adjusted to the airline needs by moving the partition wall. Foldable seats installed on guides in a sliding manner may be used to increase/reduce the dimension of a passenger compartment.”

Eeek! Those Seats

The idea of folding seats, as presented in this patent, might alarm those who already worry about today’s crowded cabins, or those who are still not over the shock of other “unique” seating concepts that Airbus has patented. But the folding seats in this yet-to-be-engineered aircraft would be useful to airlines, letting them change the structures of the cabin quickly–even overnight.

“Airlines can thus shift the cabin walls and add or remove seats to make room for cargo or other cabin configurations,” Airbus states in the patent brief.

The Airport Issue

Another downside of today’s A380 is that, while it is a long range aircraft, it is too large to serve many of the world’s airports, thereby limiting what city pairs the A380 can fly. Airports which want to attract A380 business have to build bigger runways and special piers.

Airbus intends this strange-new-aircraft-that-has-more-people-in-it to be more airport-friendly. The concept includes a lower deck at a height from the ground that would let passengers embark and disembark without any special airport ground equipment. Once Airbus decides on the engines and wings and dimensions, it could also take-off and land at more runways around the world.

As the manufacturer states in the patent brief:

“The invention provides a double-deck airplane that facilitates passenger embarking/disembarking and cargo loading/unloading operations in order to maximize the number of flight missions carried out in any given time.”

The Tomorrow People-Mover

Criticism aside, Airbus stands firm behind its A380. At the Paris Air Show this June, the aircraft manufacturer described the A380 as still “going strong” ten years after it was introduced, saying it can still “wow” passengers and airlines alike.

To prove the aircraft’s popularity, the manufacturer points out that an A380 is taking off or landing somewhere in the world every three minutes, “and remains well positioned for the future.”

Frank Vermeire, Airbus’ Head of A380 Product Marketing, says of the A380:

“It’s the aircraft that passengers love to fly—the quietest, the most comfortable and the smoothest way to travel. For airlines it’s a flagship product, offering them the opportunity to innovate and enhance the flying experience.”

The manufacturer also believes the A380 is ideally suited for tomorrow’s aviation megacities.

Airbus predicts mega cities will nearly double over then next 20 years, as stated its latest global market forecast.

At least one the world’s aviation megacities, and base of the world’s largest collection of A380s, is reconsidering the whole airport city concept. But airport design aside, Airbus’ Chief Operating Officer–Customers, John Leahy, believes that the industry needs large aircraft to cope with the hike in passenger numbers over the coming decades.

“You cannot just increase frequency, you have to have larger and more efficient aircraft,” he said during a briefing at the Paris Air Show. “That’s called the A380.”

The same could be true of this new Airbus..whatchamacalit. But, for the next generation of flyers, this A3XX-BBT (Bird Beluga Thingie) is a concept far flung from the European manufacturer’s more aspirational aircraft of tomorrow. Maybe, with fast, free Wi-Fi, tomorrow’s flyers won’t care."
Opinion: The Airbus A380NEO is a Good Idea - Airline Reporter,"Tue, 28 Jul 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAxNS8wNy90aGUtYWlyYnVzLWEzODBuZW8taXMtYS1nb29kLWlkZWEv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"First things first; I am sick and tired of all the A380 hate. I get it; it’s not made by Boeing and doesn’t fit the U.S. major route network. Here’s the thing: that doesn’t make it a terrible aircraft and an absolute aviation sin.

I am tired of reading comments from people saying, “Since Delta never ordered it, it must be too big.” No one also wants to hear your comments about how the A380 only works for “government-subsidized airlines,” or, “how all the other airlines that operate it regret it.” I’m looking at you, Jeff Smisek.

There are two immediate things I’ve always thought were an issue with the A380…well, maybe two and a half. Things that I have wanted Airbus to fix for a while now. Let’s dive in…

Airbus A380 Fix Number One:

There is too much wing.

The A380-800 as we know it today was always designed to be the baby of the family. In the name of engineering, maintenance, and certification commonality, it was “over-winged” to meet the needs of any potential stretches that could fit within the 80m ICAO code-F parking space at any A380-compatible airport. Thing is, it was long suspected that both the A380 freighter (which was cancelled during the global financial crisis) and the undetermined-length stretched A380-900 would have a maximum take-off weight of 590,000kg (1.3 million pounds). This meant the A380’s wing chord was significantly beefed up to meet an additional 15,000kg demand that was never placed upon it.

An easy, but not cheap, solution: re-profile the wing. Cut the chord down to match the weight of the current needs of the ultra-long-haul A380 operators. Cutting the chord will change the span slightly, but changing the span means than rather than having old-style, but giant, wing-tip fences to fit within the Code-F box, you can add a modern A350-style sharklet.

These changes would not only save weight, they’d also reduce aerodynamic drag. Less aerodynamic drag equates to lower fuel burn. Lower fuel burn and less structural weight can lead to either lower unit cost, or longer range.

Even the older A380-842s operated by Qantas can operate Dallas-Ft. Worth to Sydney (with some payload restrictions). Now, imagine that route with no payload restriction?

This is not just about range. Reprofiling the wing and changing its tip device is about increasing payload and reducing operating cost.

It’s no wonder that Airbus has said that if their A380NEO arrives with an EIS of somewhere between 2020 and 2025, they will have done unspecified things to the wing. I suspect the above.

Airbus A380 Fix Number Two:

To stretch or not to stretch?

Believe it or not, I think the A380NEO needs a stretch option. Not an extremely technical and expensive A380NEO/R option that can match the range of today’s A380-800. No, not at all. But a 10-frame stretch with no max gross weight changes would be beautiful.

Steven Udvar-Hazy, CEO of Air Lease Corporation, suggested this back around 2007 when the A380 was being introduced into service. An A380-900NEO of that length would allow a 600 or more passenger capacity in even a four-class configuration. That’s a serious contender for hub-to-hub flying, and there are routes that can sustain this. London-Mideastern Hub-Sydney instantly springs to mind. Obviously, it would not be a huge seller, but it would more than pay for its development cost in orders.

Here’s where I think Airbus needs to do something a little different. Add at least a four frame stretch to the base model 800NEO. Range is not an issue for the current A380-800, but cargo capacity is. Extending the cargo hold forward or aft of the wingbox will make the airframe more competitive and the extra seats will lower unit cost.

Emirates, for instance, could configure a four-frame stretch 800NEO to seat 550, while still being able to fly Dubai-Los Angeles with full payload at a lower trip cost.

Even if there is an economic downturn between now and the EIS of the A380NEO between 2020 and 2025, that will not halt global economic growth and passenger demand for time immemorial there after. There needs to be more seats on this lighter NEO to get the unit cost down to either 777-9 levels or below. I think that it can be done.

Airbus A380 Fix Number Three:

New engine?

Well, yes, of course. Airbus has said as much, and that it will be single-source.

How? Every oddly anti-Airbus person I know was cheering when the CEO of Rolls Royce said he didn’t see a market, nor wanted to spend a lot of money developing an engine for an A380NEO. Truth is, he never really said either.

If you actually read between the lines, he didn’t really say anything that would be construed as a comment other than, “If they are willing to pay, I guess?” A lovely and non-commital answer. Truth is, no one is going to do a 100% clean sheet engine until the major engine manufacturers can figure out how to scale geared turbofans to above ~30k pounds of thrust (let alone the 80k you would need to match the current max output of a Trent 900).

The best option for the sole-source engine would be something derived from the Rolls Royce Trent XWB. After all, the lowest-thrust Trent XWB slots nicely into the A380 thrust range as it is. With a new wing, it is less likely to need as much power on takeoff to hurl it into the air.

Though my dream would be a breakthrough in the Pratt & Whitney Purepower program that created an 80k pound geared turbofan. Can you imagine the saved fuel consumption? It would be amazing!

What Airline Would Take the A380NEO?

So who of the existing operators should buy this lighter, more efficient, and maybe larger A380?

Emirates, Etihad Airways, and Qatar Airways. By the time that the A380NEO EIS, they’ll need to replace their old A380-800s. Accounting for growth, that’s at least 200 frames right there. With Dubai World Central, hopefully, opening by then as Emirates’ super hub, Emirates could probably operate 200 on their own. Let’s look in more detail with each airline…

Qantas: With the Emirates tie-up to the east and the American Airlines (pending) joint-venture to the West, plus throw in some absurdly long flights where frequency is obliterated by crazy time differences, and you need something big to meet future demand. True, Qantas deferred their last A380 tranche, but deferred is not canceled. Rationalize the A380 to serve merely Dubai, London, Hong Kong, Los Angeles, and Dallas with not a frame to spare and it makes sense to replace them. Lower fuel burn, greater payload.

Lufthansa: Replacement, maybe expansion, but my bet would be on replacement. There is a place for the A380 at Lufthansa, but it will not be used for anything radical.

British Airways: Simple really, Heathrow is not going to get any less crowded, and by 2025, their original A380s are not going to get any younger.

Korean and Asiana: They are both in the same amazing transfer hub of Incheon. Their small fleets will need replacing, maybe even expansion. The Korean economy is hot and those two airlines are forming a nice bridge across the Pacific from the Americas into Korea, Northern China, and the Russian Far East.

Air France, Malaysia Airlines, Thai Airways International: I feel they all need help running an airline. By the time Malaysia Airlines relearns this art, they will have a new name and a regional niche.

Turkish: They do not have any yet, but they should. They’ll have a new super hub replacing the current manifestation IST. They have the end game of being a major connecting carrier, but they also deal extensively in passenger volume. Give them compelling operating economics, when they have an airport where they can fit their fleet at peak times, it’d be good for them. They could even fly it to their more popular European destinations on off-hours between long-haul flights.

Then you have China, which is a strange market. It’s growing ridiculously fast and its airports are starting to become the crowded ramp the A380 was designed for. As we all know, however, China has seemingly infinite money to spend on infrastructure. Crowded airport? Build another one! Just look at Beijing.

By 2025, it will have two giant international airports (Capital and Daxing). The state could either abandon the A380 in favor of filling its new super airports with hundreds of smaller twins, or just order dozens of A380NEOs and hundreds of twins — it will play out in a manner that befits the trade-surplus the central government wants to address.

Cathay Pacific: Hong Kong can only have so much land to park 777s around. Cathay Pacific has four flights a day to JFK, two of which arrive in New York within two hours of each other. Similar story for Los Angeles. They are not hurting on seat factors either. Now yes, the current A380 lacks the freight-train like capabilities that the 777-300ER can offer, but the NEO will offer lower unit cost as well as a more compelling belly-freight capacity. On top of this, frequency on ultra-long-haul flights works when fuel prices are low, but who is to say what a gallon of Jet-A will cost in 2025. As much as the airline dislikes the current A380, the NEO is a different beast. The 777-9 serves a great purpose, slight expansion in capacity on current 777 routes, but it does not solve the problems of crowded airspace and even-more-crowded airports.

Realistically, by the time the A380NEO enters into service, the global economy will be a completely different landscape. More people are going to be flying than ever, and airlines that make no sense as operators right now could easily grow into them.

Meet Airbus E-Fan - FLYING,"Wed, 15 Jul 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZseWluZ21hZy5jb20vYWlyY3JhZnQtbWVldC1haXJidXMtZS1mYW4v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Disrupt or be disrupted. It’s one of the hard lessons emerging in today’s tech-fueled economy, in which the frenetic pace of innovation means not only seeing new ideas materialize with dizzying speed but also watching as they threaten to obliterate entire industries that came before them. We’ve glimpsed this trend in aviation already with everything from old-school radios to paper charts as a number of smart and tenacious newcomers — names like Garmin, Avidyne, Aspen and ForeFlight come to mind — have turned bright ideas into successful start-up business enterprises.

More disruption, we are told, lies ahead. If you’re an airplane manufacturer still turning out products first conceived of in the 1940s or 1950s — and you don’t have anything revolutionary in the planning stages — the time to panic is now.

It’s appearing increasingly likely that the next wave of disruptive innovation will come from Europe at the hands of Airbus Group, which has formed a subsidiary called ­VoltAir SAS in France to build a family of plug-in and hybrid-electric light airplanes. The plan figures to play a key role not only in recalibrating how we look at light aviation but also in shaping the future direction of the world’s second largest airplane manufacturer.

VoltAir’s immediate aim is to build a factory in the south of France and begin producing the ­E-Fan line of small airplanes, beginning with a two-seat trainer called the E-Fan 2.0, powered entirely by batteries and electric motors and slated to reach the market in 2018. A follow-on, hybrid-electric four-seater called the E-Fan 4.0 targeted primarily at buyers in the United States will emerge soon after and is projected to go on sale in 2019.

Welcome to the Future

Different doesn’t begin to explain the approach to designing and producing these airplanes. The shapes are all new; the electric motors are new; the ducted variable-pitch fan propellers are new. The engineers will take advantage of the latest carbon-­fiber design techniques with never before tested aerodynamic shapes. It’s all made possible by the aesthetic freedom electric motors give to the engineering design team, since the motors can be placed just about anywhere on the airframe.

Airbus’ real aims with VoltAir and the E-Fan family of airplanes, however, are far more ambitious than merely producing electric airplanes for an admittedly limited general aviation market. The prolific maker of commercial airliners is instead laying the groundwork for a tomorrow that could include fleets of ­futuristic-looking hybrid-electric airliners under the Airbus E-Thrust project. They’ll be capable of whisking 100 or so passengers on short-haul flights of perhaps 1,000 miles. Designs for even bigger planes with farther reach are in the works. It’s staggering stuff.

Before any of these ambitious goals can be realized, though, planners at Airbus know they first need to take the small steps that will incrementally bridge the technological gaps necessary to make a battery-powered hybrid-electric airliner feasible.

Some of these steps are being undertaken already. VoltAir has formed a partnership with engineering conglomerate Siemens of Germany to produce the power systems for the small E-Fan battery-powered and hybrid-electric production models. If the companies are successful with this first stage, they envision expanding their cooperation to tackle the hybrid-electric drive systems for much larger airplanes, which could become a reality within the next couple of decades.

Airbus Group is also enlisting ­Daher, maker of the TBM 900 turboprop single, to produce the E-Fan 2.0 and 4.0 models at the new factory in Pau, France, near the Pyrenees Mountains on the border with Spain, construction of which is scheduled to start next year. Daher will also play a key role in marketing and selling the VoltAir models through its established dealer network.

The big question at this point is whether the GA market will really want to buy and own electric airplanes. Nobody knows. Airbus’ success will depend largely on the utility, performance and safety of electric airplanes, not to mention their price. Done right, E-Fan could be just the boost general aviation needs to succeed and thrive for many years to come.

Dawn of Electric Flight

Preliminary data looks promising. Airbus tells us the E-Fan 2.0 trainer will incorporate two main electric motors connected to two multirotor shrouded fans with enough battery power to allow flight lessons of perhaps 40 minutes (plus reserves) confined mainly to the traffic pattern and practice areas near the airport.

As soon as one lesson ends, the E-Fan 2.0’s depleted battery packs can be removed and fresh packs slid into the wing in their place so the next lesson can begin. Meanwhile, the old batteries are plugged in for recharging. Fully charging a set of depleted battery packs is expected to take a few hours, so multiple battery packs would be required at busy flight schools.

As exciting as this all sounds, the really big news is what Airbus has in store for general aviation pilots in America. The E-Fan 4.0 will be powered by bigger electric motors and fitted with a single piston engine producing perhaps 200 horsepower. The engine (probably a compression ignition diesel burning jet fuel) won’t directly drive the propellers but will instead be used in cruise flight to power an electric generator that will supply power to spin the fans and keep the batteries fully charged.

The idea is to be able to offer an airplane with similar performance to that of today’s gasoline piston offerings but which would burn 25 to 50 percent less fuel. Purchase price is targeted to be close to those of current GA piston airplanes like the Cessna 172 (so somewhere in the range of $400,000) with smaller fuel bills theoretically tilting the economics in favor of the hybrid-electric approach.

As envisioned, the E-Fan 4.0 would use pure battery power for takeoff and climb, taking advantage of the ample torque of its electric motors to launch the airplane to cruise altitude without burning an ounce of liquid fuel. Climbing away from the runway in near total silence would also serve to appease airport noise critics, an important consideration in Europe and an increasingly important one in the United States as well.

Once airborne, the computers would switch on the piston engine, enabling flight of three hours or so at a cruise speed of perhaps 150 knots as the onboard electric generator powered the motors and kept the batteries topped up to allow for the possibility of a quick-turn departure after landing, if desired.

A New Way of Thinking

Airbus first publicly broached the topic of electric-powered flight five years ago, in 2010, when it brought an electric-powered Cri-Cri single-seat airplane to the Paris Air Show. Nobody knew then what to make of the little contraption with its electric motors whirring furiously to propel it into the air. Most who saw it pointed and laughed.

Next, Airbus publicly introduced the VoltAir name in 2011, announcing plans for future electric-­powered airliners. This time the world mostly scoffed, with some in aviation (nudge, Boeing) dismissing the idea as a flight of fancy.

In the time since then, however, few still doubt the lofty aims of Airbus Group and its project partners as they make it abundantly clear just how serious they are about advancing electric-powered flight.

Shortly after forming VoltAir, Airbus partnered with Diamond Aircraft of Austria to build an electric-powered proof-of-concept using a Diamond motorglider airframe and small electric motor supplied by Siemens. Work on the first E-Fan prototype started at around the same time. By the time Airbus began demonstrating the E-Fan 1.0 prototype at airshows in Europe last spring and announced plans for production models, nobody was laughing. Suddenly, the question wasn’t if a fully certified production electric airplane from Airbus would materialize, but rather when.

Unquestionably the E-Fan proto­type is a revolutionary design. Packs of lithium-ion batteries fitted into its wings are the sole power source for the E-Fan 1.0’s two 30 kW electric motors driving thin blades inside tiny nacelles that give the airplane a jetlike appearance. The demonstrator has two retractable wheels fore and aft and two more under the wings. A separate 6 kW electric motor connected to the rear main wheel provides extra oomph for takeoff acceleration, which reduces electrical power burden on the main motors on the ground.

Because of the limited power density of current lithium-ion batteries, the E-Fan 1.0 has less than an hour’s flight endurance. To address the concern of range anxiety, the airplane is outfitted with a backup emergency battery with enough power to allow the pilot to choose a suitable landing site. In the production version there will be a backup battery as well as a whole-airframe parachute that can be deployed if all the batteries are drained in flight. Like in electric cars, a power-level gauge informs the pilot as to how much energy remains in the batteries.

The production versions of the E-Fan are sleeker-looking designs than the prototype and include tricycle landing gear, modern automotive inspired interiors and a number of other innovations currently in the works. A key technology on the ­E-Fan is its E-fadec energy management system, which automatically handles power loads for the electrical systems. This greatly simplifies system controls, easing the workload of future E-Fan pilots.

“It’s a totally different approach to flying,” says Airbus chief technical officer Jean Botti. “The computers handle everything for the pilot. Everything is simplified. There is no noise, no emissions.”

Unlike in the prototype, electric motors probably won’t drive the wheels on the ground for taxi and takeoff in the E-Fan 2.0 and 4.0. Airbus is developing the avionics in-house, and you can be sure the E-Fan family will incorporate the very latest in glass-cockpit touchscreen technology with an array of situational-awareness and other safety tools.

Airbus plans to break ground on the E-Fan factory at Pau Pyrénées Airport next spring. The site was chosen for its proximity to Daher, based in nearby Tarbes, France, and the perennial good weather that will enable the E-Fan development team to take maximum advantage of the accelerated test flying schedule.

The VoltAir team is now busy building the E-Fan 2.0 proof-of-­concept airplane, which is expected to fly next year. The first production E-Fan 2.0 is scheduled to make its first flight in 2017. Both the 2.0 and 4.0 will have twin fans and electric motors, T-tail, canopy and winglets.

The certification timeline of the models is important. Airbus wants to bring the products to the marketplace as quickly as possible to give them a head start on the competition. A number of different companies are developing electric airplanes, most notably Pipistrel in Slovenia and Aero Electric Aircraft Corp., the brainchild of electric airplane proponent George Bye. Airbus is in a race to be the first to enter full-scale serial production of an electric airplane. It is a race the company intends to win.

Certification Hurdles

It won’t be easy, though. At the annual CAFE Foundation symposium in Santa Rosa, California, this spring, around 170 of the electric airplane world’s smartest minds came together to discuss the future of battery- and solar-powered flight. The mood was upbeat, and nearly everybody there seemed to agree that the dawn of electric flight is upon us.

There is a starting gun of sorts in this race, however, and it’s the FAA’s rewrite of Part 23 light airplane certification regulations, which was supposed to have been finished by now. The agency is busily crafting a notice of proposed rulemaking for this transition, which aims to allow new technologies like electric airplanes to reach the market faster while also cutting the cost of certification in half.

As the rules are written now, Airbus, or anyone else, could never hope to create something so revolutionary as the E-Fan 2.0 or 4.0 because certification regulations were crafted many decades ago, when airplane models from the 1940s and 1950s still seemed fresh and new.

The revised regulations, expected to appear in NPRM form by the end of the year and go into effect in 2017, will presumably make allowances for the inclusion of battery power and for the use of two small electric motors in place of one large piston engine. Plenty of questions remain, however. Will a student pilot learning in an E-Fan 2.0 earn a multiengine certificate? Or will new pilot certification classes need to emerge? Will a pilot who learns to fly in an E-Fan 2.0 be able to fly a Cessna 172 without additional pilot certification? The FAA will grapple with questions like these and many more as the disruptors of the world continue doing what they do best.

The disruptees, meanwhile, might want to consider a different approach. After all, there’s little chance that what has worked for the last 50 years will continue working for the next 50 — or even the next 10.

Botti signed on as chief technical officer at Airbus Group in 2006 after spending most of his career in the automotive industry. It will be his job to ensure that the E-Fan family of products emerge on the ambitious time schedule Airbus has announced while also meeting key performance and price targets.

The tight schedule might seem impossible, but Botti said engineers at VoltAir have been involved in certification efforts with regulatory authorities in Europe since day one.

“We have already started the technical work that will lead to certification with the DGAC [the French civil aviation authority],” he said. “Our colleagues at Airbus North America have also begun discussions with the FAA.”

Whether E-Fan becomes a bonafide business is still something of a question mark, even Botti admits. “E-Fan is a learning tool,” he said. “The expectation is to be able to get to the point where we can do volume production, but it’s very important to note that our real aim is to be able to produce hybrid-electric regional airliners.”

Still, he said, the advantages of an electric-hybrid approach to light general aviation, meaning everything from reduced noise and lower cost to lessened environmental impact and better efficiency, should make E-Fan a compelling choice for airplane buyers.

As you might suspect, there will also be some radical changes in the E-Fan cockpit. While it’s unlikely we’ll see fly-by-wire technology or automatic thrust capability come

to the E-Fan 2.0 and 4.0, the approach to designing the computer brains of these airplanes is very different as well, and in a good way.

VoltAir engineers are developing the E-Fan cockpit with considerable input from ENAC, the French civil aviation school, which expects to buy a fleet of E-Fan 2.0 trainers. The overarching philosophy will be a focus on user friendliness, enabling flight planning tasks to be carried out with a few taps on the screens, checklists to be more automated and emergency scenarios to require far less input by the pilot as the computer software of the system handles the majority of time-critical tasks.

It’s an idea that has already taken root in the airline and business jet realms, where cockpit automation is routinely put to maximum effectiveness. Which begs the question: Will E-Fan be a pilot’s airplane or instead something only a systems manager could love?

If Airbus can succeed in giving the world a family of light airplanes built for the 21st century, at competitive prices, while keeping some of the attributes we can’t live without, this big bet could very well herald general aviation’s future.

With Airbus about to launch assembly on its first Alabama-made passenger jet, the Aeroplex has seen a burst of activity from aerospace companies.

Earlier this month, the Aeroplex announced that AAA Aerospace USA will provide services including engine installation and wheel assembly for the Airbus Alabama facility. AAA is expected to create around 20 full-time jobs once full production is reached.

At the Paris Air Show in June, France-based Hutchinson Corp. announced that it plans to set up an Aerospace Manufacturing Center of Excellence at the Aeroplex, which will serve Airbus and the region’s growing aviation cluster.

Also during the air show, Messier-Buggatti-Dowty, a member of the Safran family of companies, announced plans for an office and workshop at the 1,650-acre industrial complex. In addition, MAAS Aviation announced it will build a $39 million paint hangar at the Aeroplex.

Days later, the initial shipment of major components for the maiden Alabama-made Airbus jet arrived in Mobile. Wehner reported today that another shipment was arriving at the Aeroplex this morning."

Airbus To Build ESA's Jupiter-bound Juice Orbiter - SpaceNews,"Fri, 17 Jul 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9haXJidXMtdG8tYnVpbGQtZXNhcy1qdXBpdGVyLWJvdW5kLWp1aWNlLW9yYml0ZXIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — The European Space Agency on July 16 selected Airbus Defence and Space to build Europe’s Juice orbiter, to be launched in 2022 aboard a European Ariane 5 rocket and to arrive at the Jupiter system in 2030.

The contract, for 350.8 million euros ($389 million) was approved by ESA’s Industrial Policy Committee and will be signed by ESA and Airbus in September. The Ariane 5 launch will be contracted separately by ESA.

Airbus bested a team composed of Thales Alenia Space of France and Italy and OHB SE of Germany, a frequent pairing for ESA competitions because it fills a hole in each company’s production-site premises.

ESA science missions are funded by mandatory contributions from the agency’s 22 member states, based on national gross domestic product. ESA’s geographic return rules mean work-share distribution must closely match each nation’s financial input, meaning Germany, France, Britain and Italy, as ESA’s biggest members, must be guarantee major pro rata roles for their domestic industry.

Airbus has major operations in France, Germany, Britain and Spain. Thales Alenia Space is focused on France and Italy, and OHB’s main facilities are in Germany.

With some exceptions, ESA’s member states finance science missions on their own, often with contributions from nations outside ESA. Juice will carry 10 instruments coming from 16 ESA members, and also from the United States and Japan.

The trajectory to Jupiter will include gravity-assist flybys of the Callisto and Ganymede moons, and two close-in flybys of the Europa moon. At the end of the mission, Juice is expected to spend eight months dedicated to the study of Ganymede."
Airbus and Cricri battery-powered planes make historic journeys across English Channel - CBS News,"Fri, 10 Jul 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLWNyaWNyaS1iYXR0ZXJ5LXBvd2VyZWQtcGxhbmUtaGlzdG9yaWMtam91cm5leS1hY3Jvc3MtZW5nbGlzaC1jaGFubmVsL9IBbWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzL2FpcmJ1cy1jcmljcmktYmF0dGVyeS1wb3dlcmVkLXBsYW5lLWhpc3RvcmljLWpvdXJuZXktYWNyb3NzLWVuZ2xpc2gtY2hhbm5lbC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"CALAIS, France -- With zero fanfare, an independent French pilot beat aeronautics giant Airbus by about 12 hours Friday in the race to fly the first electric plane across the English Channel -- a symbolically important step toward making battery-powered flight viable in the long term.

Several people and companies in different countries are developing electric planes in hopes of offering a fuel-free, noise-free, emissions-free flight alternative for the future. So the battle to perform world ""firsts"" in electric planes is heating up as the technology becomes more durable.

European planemaker Airbus flew its E-fan plane from Lydd, England, to the French port of Calais on Friday morning. The plane operates exclusively on batteries, and since there's no oil or water, the 20-foot long, 1,300-pound jet releases zero emissions.

Yet pilot Hugues Duval had also long dreamed of making that flight and knew that his two-engine, one-seat Cricri plane was ready to cross the Channel. So instead of letting Airbus grab all the glory Friday, he set out for a Calais airfield the day before.

Pilot Hugues Duval in his twin-engined ""Cri-Cri"", one of the world's smallest electrical planes, waits to take off from an old Broussard aircraft, on which it is attached to, during a flying display at the 51st Paris Air Show at Le Bourget airport near Paris, June 19, 2015. Reuters

""I was really motivated to go,"" he told The Associated Press on Friday, describing it as a family goal, to repeat a journey his father made across the Channel. ""Our vocation (as pilots) is to take on challenges.""

Because he lacked authorization to take off from Calais, a larger, fuel-driven plane towed his 220-pound Cricri for the start of the trip, he told The Associated Press. Then he separated from the helper plane and flew autonomously to Dover and then back to Calais, landing safely.

Duval said he reached a speed of 90 mph on his 31-mile journey.

When he approached the Calais airfield again, he said, ""The fact that you are flying over land is reassuring.""

""Then when you land well you are happy,"" Duval said, calling it an ""important moment"" after years of fine-tuning the plane and flying it over land.

Airbus officials gathered in Calais to celebrate the landing of the E-fan would not comment on Duval's trip.

""I don't have to talk about that.... We did something today, it is important for us,"" said the pilot of the Airbus flight, Didier Esteyne.

The E-fan took its maiden voyage in March 2014, and has taken off 100 times since its latest flight at the Paris Air Show last month. Airbus aims to put the two-seater on the market in 2017, targeting sales at training facilities for entry-level pilots.

""It's a great victory, but it's also a start. For us, it's an adventure that permits us"" to imagine commercial flights on electric or hybrid planes, Esteyne said. ""It's really the beginning of great innovations.""

The choice of flight path was not coincidental: In 1909, French pilot Louis Bleriot was the first person to fly a plane across the English Channel.

For Airbus' flight Friday, security professionals were out in full force, with helicopters and rescue speed boats trailing the E-fan. Safety was of secondary priority for Bleriot - he was concentrated on winning $1,550 in prize money from the British Daily Mail newspaper by performing the feat first.

Electric flight is a nascent sector of the aviation industry, so safety regulations are still in development. Airbus and the French civil aviation authorities worked together to create a test flight program for the jets.

Many compared this week's flights to the feats achieved by Solar Impulse, the solar-operated plane that is traveling around the world in stages and just completed a 5-day journey from Japan to Hawaii.

While the E-fan only seats two for now, the aircraft manufacturer is aiming bigger down the line. Chief Technical Officer Jean Botti told The Associated Press at the Paris Air Show last month that ""our objective here is to make a hybrid-electric 100-seater for the future,"" calling it an ambition that Airbus could realize in the next 15 years.

Slovenian company Pipistrel was also hoping to send its electric plane across the Channel this week. But engine-maker Siemens blocked the trip at the last minute, saying the motor didn't have authorization to fly over water, Pipistrel general manager Ivo Boscarol told The AP.

Boscarol said he felt his plane was ready for the journey and estimated about 10 other electric planes in development are also capable of making the flight. He hopes to continue working with Siemens to develop the plane.

He compared this week's flights to those of Bleriot 106 years ago.

""The Channel, in aviation, has a special place. It's kind of religious,"" Boscarol said."

The 37 minute flight itself might not seem that impressive, but considering the current state of electric propulsion, it is a hopeful glimpse into the future of electric air transport.

Battery powered air travel is not currently commercially viable simply because the energy storage capacity of batteries has yet to compensate for their heavy weight. The E-Fan’s battery pack enables it to stay airborne for up to 50 minutes, but the twin-engine plane only weights 500 kg (1102 lb) when empty. The battery pack, located in the wings, represents 33% (167 kg) of the total weight.

The E-Fan uses lithium-Ion battery cells with an energy density of 207 Wh/kg. In comparison, the popular Model S, Tesla Motors’ full electric sedan, uses 233 Wh/kg battery cells. The battery industry observes an average improvement in energy density of about 7% every year, and as much as a 50% to 100% improvement will be needed to make commercial flight viable – meaning we might be able to fly on clean energy in a not-so-distant future.

In the meantime, Airbus shows us what they can do with current technologies and frankly, it is impressive. The crossing was 45 miles (74 km) long and the total energy capacity of the batteries was about 34.5 kWh. Another comparison to the Tesla Model S; the base version of the car can travel 240 miles (386 km) with a 70 kWh battery pack. Comparing electric ground transport to electric air transport is far from ideal, but with the later being almost nonexistent, I think it is a useful perspective to look at what we do know from available electric transport.

Who's first? Airbus or Cri-Cri? - AOPA,"Sat, 11 Jul 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFvcGEub3JnL25ld3MtYW5kLW1lZGlhL2FsbC1uZXdzLzIwMTUvanVseS8xMS9jcmktY3JpLW9yLWFpcmJ1c9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Who’s first? Airbus or Cri-Cri?

Airbus’ electrically powered E-Fan twinjet crossed the English Channel on July 10, but the story certainly hasn’t ended there. Airbus says that the E-Fan was the first electrically powered airplane to make the flight—from Lydd in the United Kingdom to Calais, France.

Or was it? Hugues Duval says he made a Channel crossing the day before—in his Cri-Cri E-Cristaline airplane, powered by twin 15-horsepower Electravia electric motors. But there’s a twist to his flight that promises to keep this story alive.

In a telephone interview, Duval said that his flight did not begin with a conventional takeoff. Instead, his Cri-Cri was launched mid-air from a Broussard MH1521, a 1950s French observation and liaison warbird powered by a 450-hp Pratt & Whitney R-985 Wasp radial engine. Authorities prevented Duval from taking off from an airport for “administrative reasons,” Duval said. Reasons that he wouldn’t explain.

The Cri-Cri was released from the Broussard at a “quite high” altitude (the Broussard’s ceiling is 14,500 feet) near Kent, England according to Duval, who asserted that the world’s aviation record-keeping organization, the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale, and the Aeroclub de France, will grant him recognition as being the first to cross in an electric airplane. Duval also landed in Calais.

Duval said that the launch procedure will carry as much validity as the Wright brothers’ use of a drop-weight catapult did back in 1903. The Wrights’ being catapulted down a launch rail was considered the legitimate start of a flight back then, and so Duval believes his air launch will be treated similarly."
Airbus files patent for massive double-deck aircraft that could improve upon the A380 - USA TODAY,"Tue, 07 Jul 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogFodHRwczovL3d3dy51c2F0b2RheS5jb20vc3RvcnkvdHJhdmVsL3JvYWR3YXJyaW9ydm9pY2VzLzIwMTUvMDcvMDcvYWlyYnVzLWZpbGVzLXBhdGVudC1mb3ItbWFzc2l2ZS1kb3VibGUtZGVjay1haXJjcmFmdC10aGF0LWNvdWxkLWltcHJvdmUtdXBvbi10aGUtYTM4MC84MzA3MTU0Mi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus files patent for massive double-deck aircraft that could improve upon the A380

Airbus has filed a patent for a new double-deck airplane — a massive, borderline unwieldy aircraft that could address some of the limitations of its current massive, borderline unwieldy aircraft, the A380. On the patent application, Airbus described the craft as ""an airplane that facilitates passenger embarking/disembarking and cargo loading/unloading operations in order to maximize the number of flight missions carried out in a given time."" The distribution of the wings, the engines and even those passengers have yet to be determined, and the French manufacturer illustrated three possible configurations.

When Skift author Marisa Garcia reviewed the patent, she saw elements from the A380, from the Airbus Beluga freighter and from the Russian Antonov cargo aircraft. But two features of the as-yet-unbuilt behemoth improve upon some of the most frowned-upon features of the A380, namely that it can't accommodate passengers, luggage and ""profitable cargo"" – which can generate between 15 and 20% of an airline's earnings – along with enough fuel to make long-range trips. Also, the plus-sized A380 is just too big for some airports, requiring new oversized runways or larger jetways to allow passengers to board and disembark.

The new craft proposes solutions to both problems by allowing the cabin and cargo compartments to be reconfigured, by moving the internal partition walls, and by using foldable seats that slide together, sort of like the stackable metal chairs from a school PTA meeting. As for getting passengers on and off the plane, Airbus says the new plane would have entrances on the lower deck, which could be reached by existing jetways, without the use of special or modified equipment.

Despite its shortcomings (and that's the wrong word for a plane this big), the A380 is still part of the fleet of 13 different carriers, including Air France, British Airways Emirates and Etihad.

Emirates, which has ordered 140 A380s and currently flies 62 of them, has encouraged Airbus to make a stretch version of the plane that would accommodate more passengers. During its appearance at the recent Paris Air Show, Airbus execs said that they had considered ""a little stretch"" to the fuselage, which would allow for between 40 and 60 more seats. But that modification might be as far off as the aircraft in these patent drawings; Airbus says that it isn't modifying the aircraft for one customer and it has failed to find any additional carriers willing to buy an A380 for more than two years.

We'd say 'back to the drawing board,' but Airbus beat us to it."

The move will extend Airbus’s military telecommunications reach in X- and UHF-band to a near-global coverage. The company owns the eight Skynet satellites and leases a large portion of their capacity to the British government under a long-term contract.

Once the contract is ended, the Skynet spacecraft revert to British government ownership under the terms of the contract, despite the fact that Airbus financed their development and launch. The contract continues until at least 2022.

In combination with French and Italian capacity, Airbus also provides the NATO alliance with satellite communications under a multi-year lease.

In addition to the Skynet satellites, Airbus owns the X-band payload aboard Canada-based Telesat’s Anik G1 satellite at 107.3 degrees west, covering the Americas and the eastern Pacific Ocean region."

The charts and text have been updated to reflect this information.

July 7, 2015, © Leeham Co. Airbus pulled ahead of Boeing in firm orders through June, and both companies have a number of commitments that were announced at the Paris Air Show that aren’t included in the year-to-date tally.

Airbus leads with single-aisle orders and Boeing leads with widebody orders, but at the half-way point of the year, the contest is far from over. The leads could shift or increase, depending on how the balance of the year goes.

For example, Airbus’ YTD tally doesn’t include the commitment for 110 A321neos from Wizz Air, a last minute win at the Air Show in which Boeing was making an aggressive bid for the 737 MAX 200. Nor does it include the announcement for 45 orders from China for A330ceos, made on the last day of June.

For Boeing, a major Memorandum of Understanding announced at the Air Show, for up to 20 747-8Fs from Volga-Dnepr, must be converted into a firm order, although our market sources indicate this may be as few as four new firm orders, plus taking up two white tails, and the balance in options. Korean Air announced a Letter of Intent for 30 MAXes and two Boeing 777-300ERs that need firming. A Chinese lessor announced an MOU for 30 MAXes that also needs firming.

Airbus ended the year’s first half with 54% of the market share between the Big Two OEMs.

Boeing delivered more airplanes in the first half, with full production of the 787 (now at 10/mo) giving it the boost over Airbus, which is only this year ramping up production of the A350.

Airbus' double-decker concept aircraft looks like a toy plane - WIRED,"Tue, 07 Jul 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9haXJidXMtcGF0ZW50LXRveS1wbGFuZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus/Shutterstock

Airbus has patented a double-decker aircraft design that looks as though it could have been based on a children's toy.

Airbus is famous for its double-decker passenger planes, most notably the A380. This latest plane has some similar features to the A380, but rather than a long chassis the cockpit sitting low down, just on the peak of its nose, the new design has a short and squat design with a high-up cockpit perched on the top of the steeply sloped nose. The design, spotted by Skift, has something childish about it -- as though it has been squished together lengthways.

That doesn't necessarily mean that it's not a viable successor to the A380, however. Many airlines have found Airbus' simply too large to manage, and not suitable for certain airports and runways. This new design would require no special arrangements to get passengers on and off the plane -- the lower deck, says the patent, ""is located at a height from the ground that allows carrying out passenger embarking/disembarking autonomously without any specific airport ground equipment"". Depending on the final dimensions of the plane, it could also be more capable of taking off from and landing at some of the airports that cannot cope with the A380.

It's possible that Airbus might use an aircraft such as this to test out some of its ideas for cramming in more passengers. For example, the foldable bicycle-style seats patented by Airbus last year, which provide nothing more than basic lower back and arm support. In the patent there are also designs for another type of folding seat. which can be bundled in order to change the cabin configuration, or change the position of cabin wall to allow in more cargo.

The aircraft has specifically designed to be flexible, depending on the airline's needs. Either the cabin could be configured in a permanent layout, or in a layout that could be changed overnight, or in a way that would allow it to be changed between each and every flight.

Ultimately, the patent explains, the plane has been designed to ""maximise the number of flight missions carried out in a given time"" and meet the needs of commercial airlines ""which are continuously demanding airplanes that maximise revenue while reducing operational costs"". As with every patent, it's not necessarily the case that this plane will ever be made, but if one day you look up and see this funny aircraft flying through the sky, you'll at least know where it came from.

Completion services are being performed by Hangar One Avionics of Carlsbad, Calif.

LAPD has taken delivery of its first H125 as part of its plan to upgrade from AS350 B2 helicopters to the more capable H125. Customers of Airbus Helicopters Inc. for 25 years, LAPD continues to be pleased with the capabilities and support offered by the Grand Prairie, Texas-based company.

“The H125 is the premier platform for conducting aerial patrol police missions,” said Lt. Phil Smith of the LAPD Air Support Division. “These helicopters provide us with the best power, safety and efficiency needed to do our job, and we are excited for the opportunity to upgrade our fleet.”

The City of Los Angeles Department of General Services will handle completion of the new LAPD H125.

“Many agencies in the State of California and across the country are ready to replace their aging law enforcement helicopter fleets and the H125 is the ideal platform to meet all mission requirements, while keeping operating costs low,” said Ed Van Winkle, sales manager for airborne law enforcement for Airbus Helicopters Inc. “The recent deliveries to CHP and LAPD demonstrate the high level of trust that each agency has in the performance and capability of the Airbus Helicopters H125 AStar.”

Airbus Helicopters’ AS350-series aircraft are the most widely purchased helicopters by U.S. law enforcement agencies. More than 220 are in use nationwide with 43 different law enforcement agencies, 75 of them delivered in the last five years.

The AStar is known for its performance, reliability and multi-mission flexibility. The H125 features dual hydraulics, dual channel engine FADEC, 30-minute take-off power and advanced glass-panel cockpit displays. With a Turbomeca Arriel 2D engine, the H125 boasts a significant power reserve, along with unmatched tail rotor authority and hot and high performance. The H125 is the perfect platform for a wide variety of law enforcement missions in varied operating environments.

Airbus Helicopters Inc. will display a new H125 operated by the Austin Police Department at Booth 739 during the Airborne Law Enforcement Association ALEA Expo 2015 in Houston, July 15 to 17."
Airlines have not yet picked 10-abreast layout for A350: Airbus - Runway Girl Network,"Mon, 20 Jul 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTUvMDcvYWlybGluZXMtaGF2ZS1ub3QteWV0LXBpY2tlZC0xMC1hYnJlYXN0LWxheW91dC1mb3ItYTM1MC1haXJidXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Have any Airbus A350 XWB customers selected a 10-abreast economy class seating configuration for the new widebody? The answer to that question depends on whom you ask at Airbus.

Last week, when the airframer took its A350-900 to New York Newark as part of an #A350XWBTour, RGN contributor Jason Rabinowitz while on assignment for NYC Aviation posed the question to A350 XWB marketing director Mike Bausor.

“So far no customer has actually selected 10-abreast,” Bausor said definitively.

Noting that Airbus is just beginning its delivery stream for the type, Bausor said airline customers “need to freeze their definition around about … 18 months to 24 months before delivery so as we go forward, I think we’ll see a lot more configurations being frozen”, but no customer has locked down a plan for 10-abreast. “Not yet,” he confirmed. “I think we will see that.”

His revelation contrasts to a recent statement made by Airbus executive VP, strategy and marketing Dr. Kiran Rao, who told RGN that while he was not at liberty to provide the names of customers that have chosen 10-abreast, there are “probably less than a handful of airlines on 10-abreast”.

Rao also revealed to RGN that the European airframer is working to make the layout more comfortable, by playing with angles on the sidewalls, tweaking the armrests, and employing other clever modifications to achieve a seat width that is just shy of 17” versus the 16.4” seat width originally advertised for the high-density 3-4-3 option.

“It will be 16.8” or 16.9”, something like that,” said Rao.

Irrespective of whether any airlines have formally frozen a plan for 10-abreast, both Bausor and Rao are in agreement that Asian airlines are most likely to be adopters.

“Obviously for operators that plan to do longhaul, low-cost – the kind of thing we see emerging very much today in Asia, not so much here [in the US] and not so much in Europe, but definitely in Asia; we’ve got to remember that people are smaller there as well – there we can actually do 10-abreast configuration: 3-4-3,” said Bausor.

Both Airbus executives also agree that the A350’s standard 9-abreast layout – with 18” wide seats – is optimal for ensuring a positive passenger experience (#paxex). The cross-section and wider cabin of the A350 XWB ‘extra wide body’ has been designed “to fit into that 3-3-3 as the basic configuration, providing wider seats, more comfort, and a nicer area environment…” said Bausor.

He also pointed out that the embedded inflight entertainment system on board has been greatly approved. “IFE is a basic feature on board this aircraft. What the customer gets is a choice between two providers; one which is Panasonic which we have on board this airplane today, and the other Thales. Both of those systems are what we call 4th generation IFE, and the beauty of that is that we actually multiple the bandwidth by five, so that means that even in coach all screens are wide-screen and high-definition, which couldn’t be achieved before. On top of that, the aircraft comes with connectivity – wifi, GSM, live TV [in this case from Panasonic] and all of these good things.

“The other good thing about 4th generation IFE is the electronic box that used to be at your feet under the seat, has now been … integrated completely into the seat-back, so that there again you provide more comfort for the passengers by providing a totally unencumbered foot space. Even the cable that goes from seat to seat now runs under the floor so you don’t get that plastic strip…it’s a completely flat floor which is unique to the A350.”"
Innovative Airbus comes to AirVenture in Oshkosh next week - WDJT,"Wed, 15 Jul 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiczU4LmNvbS9uZXdzL2lubm92YXRpdmUtYWlyYnVzLWNvbWVzLXRvLWFpcnZlbnR1cmUtaW4tb3Noa29zaC1uZXh0LXdlZWvSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Innovative Airbus comes to AirVenture in Oshkosh next week

(CNN)--Parked inside a giant hangar on the fringes of an Atlanta airport sits an airliner that's getting the star treatment. Sure, the Stones are touring this summer. So are Taylor Swift and One Direction. But for aviation enthusiasts in Brazil, Colombia and the United States, this tour is even better. Welcome to the \""A350XWB Tour.\""

The Airbus A350XWB (for extra-wide body) is the world's newest family of innovative jetliners. This one is touring the Americas, as the French-based aircraft manufacturer shows off its new generation of ultra-efficient planes.

In the coming decades, more and more travelers will be boarding these kinds of lightweight airliners that fly long distances and burn less fuel. Passengers will be enjoying wider, quieter cabins with more headroom and more comfortable cabin pressure.

This week, the A350 tour came to the world's busiest airport, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International, where the sleek, gray, black and white airplane ruled over Bay 10 at Delta Air Lines' TechOps facility.

The invitation-only event included aviation industry journalists and news reporters. Even some enamored Delta employees lined up for a rare chance to get on board. The public will get its opportunity next week, when the plane visits the gigantic AirVenture airshow in Oshkosh, Wisconsin.

I admit it: stepping onto the plane through the rear door kind of felt like venturing backstage at a concert. We were met in the galley by an entourage of crew members and company officials who were more than happy to talk about the band -- I mean, the airplane.

Some serious engineering is happening here. During test flights, technicians sit in special monitoring stations in the cabin where they analyze data. A few days earlier during a stop in Bogota, the plane's pilots performed 13 takeoffs and landings to gather enough data to prove to aviation officials that the plane's auto-landing feature will work reliably at high-altitude airports.

\""It's definitely a preparation visit as much as it is just showing off the product to the people who bought it,\"" said Mike Bausor, Airbus' A350XWB marketing director.

Airport crews in Bogota and Atlanta greeted the plane with water cannon salutes. \""It's always great when we go to a new airport for the first time,\"" said Airbus test pilot Frank Chapman. \""People are excited, waiting for us there with their cameras, taking photos.\""

The A350's wings sweep back like an Olympic swimmer poised on the starting block. The plane's curly, carbon fiber wingtips have become one of its signature features, bending upward in a dramatic, 14-foot swoop.

\""It's like Nike decided to enter the airplane manufacturing business,\"" joked one observer on Reddit.

The wingtip design lets the plane cut through the air more efficiently, saving fuel.

In fact, instead of aluminum, most of the plane's wings and fuselage are made of carbon fiber composite material, making these kinds of planes so lightweight they can fly much farther on a single load of fuel.

During the cruise phase of a flight, pilots can save even more fuel by changing the shape of the A350's wings. Pilots are able to shift specific flaps on the A350's wings without changing the wing's entire shape. \""That is unique to the A350,\"" said Bausor.

Next we walked through the main cabin, where the airliner coach seats were arranged in a 3-3-3 configuration. Each seat had its own snazzy fourth generation in-flight HD entertainment system.

The two-class layout also included a business class with seats that lay fully flat into a 73.5-inch bed. Depending on the model and configuration, total capacity for the A350 is more than 300 passengers.

Delta, which plans to buy 25 A350-900s, is still in the process of deciding its specific cabin configuration.

During an opportune moment, I asked Chapman to let me peek inside the cockpit. Once inside, it kind of felt like I'd talked my way into Taylor Swift's dressing room. Thrilling to be sure, but sorry, no. Not sexy. A trio of crew were discussing the A350's latest test run.

The A350 is part of a new breed of airliners that aims to open new long-distance, nonstop routes that were traditionally too unprofitable for old-style planes.

For example, Boeing's new 787 Dreamliner has allowed British Airways to launch a nine-hour, nonstop between Austin, Texas, and London. United flies its 787s on a 12.5-hour nonstop route bridging San Francisco and Chengdu, in central China far from the coast.

The A350 has been flying commercially since January, via Qatar Airways.

Next year, travelers departing from the United States will have a chance to experience the A350 when Qatar Airways begins flying it to Doha from New York and Boston. Those routes, more than 6,500 miles long, will provide the first proving ground as to whether this plane will live up to its billing. Airbus says the plane's 900 model has a maximum range of about 8,900 miles.

Later, American Airlines will be the first North American carrier to fly the A350 because of a deal that predated its merger with US Airways. United plans to fly the A350 as well. Delta's A350s are expected to start being delivered in 2017, helping to replace the fleet's fuel-guzzling 747s.

The A350 will continue its tour this month, with scheduled stops at Liberty International Airport in Newark, New Jersey; Chicago's O'Hare; Milwaukee's General Mitchell International; and then the huge national airshow in Oshkosh, Wisconsin.

But can a beautiful beast like the A350 land elegantly at a small airport such as the one at Oshkosh? No problem, said Chapman, who, in 2009, landed there piloting a double-decker A380, the world's largest airliner.

\""The biggest issue is going to be with all those small airplanes, bringing the aircraft around on the ground,\"" he said. \""The tractor driver who's going to tow us around -- he's got a job-and-a-half.\""

So, the A350XWB Tour may not be as flashy as this summer's One Direction concerts, but it definitely will thrill America's aviation geeks."

Airbus E-Fan: Building a Better Electric Motor - FLYING,"Wed, 15 Jul 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZseWluZ21hZy5jb20vYWlyY3JhZnQtYWlyYnVzLWUtZmFuLWJ1aWxkaW5nLWJldHRlci1lbGVjdHJpYy1tb3Rvci_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Since the earliest days of powered flight, propulsion technology has mattered more than anything else in humankind’s quest to break the bonds of earth and rise triumphantly into thin air.

For the Wright Flyer it was a 180-pound, 12-horsepower gasoline piston engine built by Orville and Wilbur’s trusty mechanic, Charles ­Taylor. For the P-51D Mustang, the mighty Rolls-Royce Merlin V-12 did the honors. In the case of Concorde, four twin-spool afterburning Olympus 593 turbojets made supersonic commercial air travel a reality.

It stands to reason, then, that before the profound shift to electric-powered flight can become an everyday reality, we’ll first need a breakthrough in electric propulsion technology, transforming electric airplanes from mere aeronautical curiosities to practical means of long-range transportation.

German engineering firm Siemens may have hit upon just such a technological innovation with a new high-output electric motor to power bigger airplanes, with maximum takeoff weights of 4,000 pounds.

Weighing in at a little over 100 pounds and with an impressive power-to-weight ratio of 5-to-1, the latest electric aero motor from Siemens delivers a continuous output of 260 kilowatts (the gasoline-piston engine equivalent of about 350 hp), compared with just 60 kW for the electric motor tested in flight by Siemens, Airbus and Diamond Aircraft in an HK36 motorglider last year.

To develop the new motor Siemens studied every component of previous motors and optimized each to their technological limits. New simulation techniques and lightweight construction, the company says, enabled the drive system to achieve its unparalleled performance of 5 kilowatts per kilogram. Comparable motors used in industrial applications deliver less than 1 kW per kilogram, while drive systems used in electric cars offer about 2 kW per kilogram.

Also, because the new motor delivers its performance at a rotational speed of just 2,500 rpm, it can drive propellers directly without requiring energy-sapping reduction gears.

“This innovation will make it possible to build series hybrid-electric aircraft with four or more seats” with speed and range similar to those of today’s piston-powered light airplanes, says Frank Anton, head of eAircraft at Siemens Corporate Technology, the company’s research unit.

The Siemens motor is scheduled to begin flight-testing before the end of the year. In the next step, researchers say they will attempt to boost output even further.

“We’re convinced that the use of hybrid-electric drives in regional airliners with 50 to 100 passengers is a real medium-term possibility,” Anton says.

Airbus could solve a huge problem with jumbo jets - Yahoo Finance,"Thu, 09 Jul 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHA6Ly9maW5hbmNlLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FpcmJ1cy13YW50cy1wYXRlbnQtcGVyZmVjdC1qdW1iby0yMDE0NTYwMzUuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Double Decker

Airbus has struggled to find customers for the A380 Superjumbo over the past few years.

In fact, Airbus hasn't had an airline order for the double-decker mega-plane since 2013.

But Airbus' infatuation with the double-decker has not lessened.

In June, the US Patent and Trademark Office published a patent application filed by Airbus' Raul Llamas Sandin, Lars Vollers, Philip Bradshaw, and Thierry Salmon late last year.

The application is for a future double decker passenger and cargo-liner.

While the A380 was billed as a flying palace, the aircraft described in the patent is considerably more utilitarian in nature.

Instead of luxury, the core purpose of the proposed jet is focused on functionality, operational flexibility, as well as the efficient boarding and deplaning of both decks.

The goal for this plane is to ""maximize the number of flight missions carried out in a give time,"" Airbus wrote in the application.

What Airbus wants to do with the new jet is to produce an aircraft that can switch back and forth between cargo and passenger duties.

Aircraft that can carry both passengers and cargo in the same cabin — known as ""combis"" — have been around for decades. For a while Boeing even sold combi versions of its 747 jumbo jet. However, past combis have not offered this level of flexibility.

According to the patent application, the jet can be equipped with a partition that can be adjusted based on how much passenger and cargo room is required for a particular flight.

In fact, some variants can be equipped with foldable chairs and moving partition that allows the plane to be quickly converted from cargo to passenger jet and vice versa.

Airbus Double Decker

This addresses a major concern for anyone operating large jumbo jets — the fear of flying around massive, half-empty planes. With Airbus' proposed double-decker, the makeup of the cabin can be tailored to meet the specific needs of each flight.

Story continues

In theory, based on the application, the plane may be able to fly into an airport as a cargo jet. After a short conversion process, it could leave the same airport as a passenger-liner. Or a combination of both.

In addition to its cargo and passenger carrying ability, the proposed double-decker will be able to board and offload its passengers without the need for a jetbridge or air stairs.

Airbus A380

So far, the Airbus jet is only an idea on paper. The company has not yet been granted a patent for the double-decker. Even then, there's no guarantee that the ideas proposed will ever come to fruition.

The A380 is Airbus' only double-decker aircraft and with sales lagging, it's unclear how many more years the plane will be in production. In fact, it's entirely possible that by the time the plane in the application is ready for production, Airbus will have already moved on from the A380.

Airbus cries foul over first electric cross-Channel flight by Frenchman - The Guardian,"Fri, 10 Jul 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS93b3JsZC8yMDE1L2p1bC8xMC9haXJidXMtZnJlbmNoLXBpbG90LWZpcnN0LWVsZWN0cmljLWZsaWdodC1jaGFubmVs0gFfaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL3dvcmxkLzIwMTUvanVsLzEwL2FpcmJ1cy1mcmVuY2gtcGlsb3QtZmlyc3QtZWxlY3RyaWMtZmxpZ2h0LWNoYW5uZWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A French pilot has made the first flight in an electric plane across the Channel just hours before a rival Airbus venture completed the journey.

Airbus immediately cried foul, claiming Hugues Duval’s effort should not be counted as the first official electric-powered flight because his Crici plane is believed to have been launched from another aircraft.

Duval flew from the French port of Calais to the English shoreline and back on Thursday night in the one-seat Crici plane. His 22-mile journey is considered a milestone in the attempt to make electric flights a viable form of travel.

Duval told the Associated Press that his successful flight was a relief and an important moment after years of developing the plane and flying it over land.

Airbus’s electric plane successfully completed a flight from the UK to France on Friday morning.

The pilot, Didier Esteyne, flew a battery-powered two-seat Airbus E-Fan from Lydd, in Kent, to Calais. The journey took around 40 minutes.

Video footage showed Esteyne waving to spectators and airport crew after landing the plane. He told reporters: “[The flight] was almost perfect. Of course I feel good. We had to do it and we did it. The job is done now.”

Airbus applauded Duval for his attempt but downplayed the pilot’s claim to the cross-Channel record. Airbus spokesman Jeremy Greaves said: “We are not worried. It would not count because we understand he set off from another plane. We applaud the intrepid aviator that did this, although the actual details are yet to be confirmed.”

Esteyne declined to comment on Duval’s attempt, stating: “I don’t have to talk about that.”

Jean Botti, the chief technical officer of Airbus Group, said: “I’m very happy; when I look at my team, I can only thank them.”



He said the flight brought to mind the Swiss solar-powered aircraft project Solar Impulse, “a fantastic human adventure”. He added: “I’m thinking of those two guys up in the sky and it’s the same thing for us. This was not a traditional industrial project, it was a shared project. We shared hours at the drawing board.”

Several companies in different countries have been trying to develop electric planes in the hope of offering fuel-, emissions- and noise-free flights in the future. So far, the planes have only made short test flights at air shows and airfields, but Airbus said it hope d Friday’s flight was a significant step towards creating a 90-seat electric or hybrid-powered plane by 2050.



Due to its lightness, the E-Fan is cheaper to operate than a normal plane. The electric aircraft, which is made of carbon fibre, costs £10 an hour to run compared with £35 for a similar-sized piston-engine, petrol-powered plane. It has a wingspan of 9.45 metres (31ft) and is two metres high, with a total engine power of 60kW. It operates on a 120-minute lithium battery system that needs only 90 minutes to recharge fully.

In 1909, the French pilot Louis Bleriot made aviation history by completing the first cross-Channel flight from Calais to Dover. Esteyne’s journey was made in the opposite direction of Bleriot’s crossing.

aircraft manufacturer, accusing it of pressuring Siemens to make the sudden contract termination, calling its alleged behavior ""

If successful, the Airbus E-Fan will be the first electric airplane to cross the English channel tomorrow, the 10th of July. The attempt, which comes 106 years after Louis Blériot accomplished the same feat using an internal combustion engine, was almost several days too late to have historic significance, however. Pipistrel , a small, but scrappy light airplane manufacturer from Slovenia with its own battery-powered bona fides had plans, via its French distributor, for a Channel crossing on the now-past 7th of July. After eight months of preparations, its two-seat Alpha Electro trainer was scheduled to not only fly from France to England, but also make the return flight on a single charge. After what some believe was some behind-the-scenes shenanigans, though, it was scrubbed.Just two days before the flight was to take place, Siemens, a Pipistrel strategic partner and supplier of the plane's motor, issued a seemingly extraordinary demand that its Dynadyn 80-kW unit not be used in the history-making attempt, and returned immediately. According to a letter addressed to general manager(embedded below), the German company claimed that its consent was required for any flight, and, more specifically, the use of that particular motor over water violated its usage agreement.Now, we are neither electrical engineers nor aviation experts, but it strikes us as odd that an electric motor might function differently depending on the terrain beneath the craft it sits within, but that, indeed, does seem to be the argument that is being made here. The situation also strikes Michael Coates, a top distributor of the company's aircraft, as bizarre, and he is quick to point a finger of blame at another Siemens partner: Airbus.In a letter sent to AutoblogGreen (which you can read in full below), Coates calls out the huge Europeanstraight out bad sportsmanship from a company with very deep pockets and a desire to be first, first, first at any cost.""For its part, Pipistrel has avoided any third-party accusations. Boscarol issued a statement regarding the situation (also in full below) which denies any mention of over-water flight prohibitions in its contract with Siemens. He says, that despite the ""bizarre and incomprehensible"" decision, the endeavor was cancelled and the Alpha Electro brought to where it could be inspected by a Siemens official. Arrangements have been made for the removal and return of the motor.We reached out to Siemens to respond to the situation and allegations of pressure and received the following response: ""We always liked to drive forward the development of the electrical flying with Pipistrel and did that proactively. In spite of all commitment Siemens would never pull its own safety demands aside. There was no agreement upon the realization of the flight between Pipistrel and Siemens.""We also reached out to Airbus, but it has not responded.Despite the controversy, we look forward to the E-Fan channel crossing. If you'd like to follow this electric plane as it makes history, a live stream will be available here . The event is scheduled to begin at 5:15 AM, Eastern time.

Dear Sirs, today, the seventh day of July 2015 could have been a very historic day for world aviation with Slovenian light aircraft manufacturer Pipistrel planning to be the first aircraft powered with an electric motor to cross the English Channel in both directions without recharging. This achievement would cement the very real practicality of electric aircraft flight.



It pains me to write this email to you but I am so disappointed by the bad sportsmanship displayed by Siemens and Airbus that I have no other alternative than to let you know what is happening behind the scenes to stop the Pipistrel's French dealer Finesse Max's historic attempt and aviation adventure.



As you may be aware, the Pipistrel ALPHA Electro aircraft has been in development for more than two years with the aircraft recently receiving certification and is available for sale to aviation markets around the world. The Pipistrel ALPHA Electro is more than a proof of concept aircraft it is an aircraft that has proven already to be the first, real, practical training aircraft in the market and Pipistrel has already received a number of orders from our first excited customers.



The plan today was to make the English Channel flight after the French Pipistrel dealer obtained all the permits and demonstrated the aircraft endurance to the French authorities by testing in France. The Pipistrel ALPHA Electro flew the same course distance overland demonstrating the endurance to cross the English Channel in both directions. Our testing overland demonstrated that we can take off from France, land in England and return to France and still have a remaining 25% battery capacity which validated the safety of this event



It is unfortunate that Airbus managed to flex their muscle with Siemens who are supplying motors to Pipistrel and have the Pipistrel motor agreement immediately terminated. Airbus managed to have this longstanding agreement terminated within hours of finding out about Pipistrel's cross channel plans which had been months in the planning. Siemens in turn requested the immediate seizure of the engine before the channel crossing attempt could be attempted by Pipistrel. It is also interesting to note that whilst the air bus E-Fan project does not use Siemens motors it does have Siemens stickers over the side of their aircraft and it also disturbs me that I have now found out it's the intention of Airbus to fly the E-Fan over the English Channel on Friday making Airbus the first electric powered aircraft to cross the English Channel and receive the notoriety and recognition that comes from this achievement and its important to note, they are only going one way and not a return trip on the same charge!



Obviously this backhanded attempt by Airbus to pressure Siemens to immediately withdraw the engine agreement and stop the Pipistrel attempt can only be seen globally as very bad sportsmanship. It has been mentioned to the Pipistrel dealer in France that Airbus have already invested 500,000 Euro in the Friday event and they cannot take the risk that any other company could be the first and this is why they flexed their muscle with Siemens.



It seems the agreement between Pipistrel and Siemens for using their electric motors in the Pipistrel ALPHA Electro aircraft has been squashed by an aviation giant which in my opinion is straight out bad sportsmanship from a company with very deep pockets and a desire to be first, first, first at any cost. I also feel extremely disappointed for the Pipistrel French distributor and his team who have invested many months preparation into this event only to be hobbled at the very last moment.



Michael Coates.



Official statement of Ivo Boscarol, Pipistrel general manager, regarding the planned attempt of the Pipistrel French distributor Finesse Max, to fly electric across the English Channel:



""Flying across the English Channel is probably the last challenge left to conquer in the field of flying with electric aircraft. Electric aircraft are at the moment approximately equally efficient as the petrol-engine aircraft were 106 years ago when Louis Bleriot first crossed the Channel by aircraft. So despite all the achievements of other electric aircraft such as Solar Impulse, the flight over the Channel is still a worthy achievement.



Pipistrel has been preparing for this feat since last October, especially when it came to obtaining authorizations to fly an electric aircraft in France and in England. The French authorities finally issued the permit last week, so our French distributor seized the opportunity and immediately prepared all the logistics to carry out the flight, which was meant to happen on the morning of 7. July at 10 am.



On Sunday 5. July in the afternoon we received by mail a letter signed by Dr. Frank Anton, head of e-Aircraft at Siemens, and by Mr. Tim Grage, Commercial Head of e-Aircraft, saying:

""Our Motor in its current version is neither designed, nor tested, nor approved by us for a flight above water - we explicitly prohibit you to use or let anyone else use our Motor for any flight above water.""

The letter went on to say:

""In the event you do not inform us immediately about the location of the Motor and hand it back to us, we will take any further necessary legal steps to stop any planned flight.""



We deeply regret the action of Siemens which prevented the flight - especially because on the other hand, it would be Siemens that would have enabled the flight, being that our aircraft used a Siemens electric motor. This is why we find this decision even more bizarre and incomprehensible. Siemens never forbade Pipistrel to fly over the water with their motor in any document or engine rental contract, so Pipistrel never broke any contract with Siemens. We are known as a company which respects the agreements and we will certainly continue to do so in the future. As requested in the letter we immediately stopped the flights in France and put the aircraft back in the trailer. On the same day the head of the local Siemens factory in Haguenau came to verify if we really did so and can confirm it. The aircraft was returned to the Pipistrel HQ facility today, Wednesday 8. July. In the next days the engine will be dismounted as requested and put on Siemens' disposal.



Pipistrel aircraft Alpha Electro has twice the range of the competitor E-fan and one third of its announced price. The biggest advantage is probably the availability: it is already possible to order and very shortly receive the Alpha Electro - but maybe not with a Siemens motor anymore.



On this occasion let me point out that it was Pipistrel that offered the first fully electric two-seat aircraft in the market, the first electric two-seat training aircraft and the first (and still the only) fully electric four seat aircraft in the world. These three aircraft belong in the elite group of less than 10 electric aircraft that are at the moment capable of flying over the Channel. Therefore we considered it logical and as our mission to perform this flight. Unfortunately it was once again the interest of the capital that prevailed, and we lost the competition on the account of fair play - we could of course still perform the flight in the next three days, but we respect Siemens and their demand not to fly over the water with their motor.



Pipistrel would like to congratulate in advance to our competitor Airbus and their pilot Mr. Francis Deborde for this new milestone in electric flight."" Ivo Boscarol, Pipistrel general manager"
European Clout Expands in South Korea - Defense News,"Sun, 12 Jul 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS9pbmR1c3RyeS8yMDE1LzA3LzEyL2V1cm9wZWFuLWNsb3V0LWV4cGFuZHMtaW4tc291dGgta29yZWEv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"SEOUL — European defense clout is expanding in South Korea, which has long been regarded as a second home turf for American weapon systems.

In a sign of growing popularity of European weapons here, Airbus has clinched back-to-back arms acquisition deals for helicopters and in-flight refueling tankers.

In the latest competition for four airborne refueling tankers, Airbus Defense and Space beat US rival Boeing and Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI). Under the $1.2 billion contract, the European aerospace giant is to supply the South Korean Air Force with four Airbus multirole tanker transport (MRTT) aircraft between 2018 and 2019.

""The A330 MRTT showed better performances than its rivals in terms of the duration of flight mission in larger areas and amount of refueling, as well as troop- and cargo-carrying capacity,"" said Kim Si-cheol, spokesman for Seoul's Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA).

""With the deployment of the refueling tankers, our fighter jets could fly up to Pyongyang in case of an emergency,"" Kim said. ""It will enhance our combat readiness and facilitate our peacekeeping operations and emergency relief efforts overseas by enabling long-distance mass supplies.""

The European refueling aircraft, based on the Airbus A330-200 passenger jet, also is effective in depot maintenance since lots of countries use the same type of jet, the spokesman said. The A330 MRTT has been selected by a number of governments, including the United Kingdom, Australia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, France and the United Arab Emirates.

What may have tipped the scales in favor of the A330 MRTT is its price and availability, according to DAPA sources.

The South Korean Air Force had wanted the planes delivered as early as 2017. Airbus offered to start delivery in 2018, but Boeing could not promise its KC-46A at least until 2019, given its development and flight-test schedules.

The recent decline in the euro against the US dollar was a factor in favor of the European company, sources said.

""Price accounted for only 20 percent of the evaluation, but it was the most important criteria for selecting the winner amid increasing budget pressure,"" a source said.

The decision to acquire European refueling tankers comes on the heels of a mega-deal for light armed helicopters. In March, South Korea opted to build a 10,000-pound helicopter based on Airbus Helicopters' H155. Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) signed a $1.4 billion contract with Airbus Helicopters to build the light helicopter, to be used for civilian and military purposes.

A series of decisions to procure European weapon systems will open the door for more European weapon systems in South Korea, observers said.

""The South Korean government is seeking to diversify the routes of arms acquisition,"" said Kim Dae-young, a researching member of the Korea Defense & Security Forum, a Seoul-based defense think tank. ""In particular, South Koreans want to have more home-built weapons than before, so European firms could have more opportunities to sell their products to Korea, offering more lenient tech transfer than the US.""

The leverage of the South Korea-US alliance in arms acquisition programs has also weakened because equipment from other NATO nations has few interoperability gaps with US systems, Kim said.

He said Boeing's waning in the South Korean market is noticeable.

Chicago-based Boeing was the reigning champion in the first two stages of the country's F-X program, winning deals for 60 F-15K aircraft. The company also won major South Korean weapon procurement programs, including airborne early-warning aircraft and AH-64D helicopters. But it suffered successive defeats on the F-X III fighter procurement program and the refueling tanker contest.

The F-X III for 20 aircraft was awarded to US company Lockheed Martin in a come-from-behind victory. Boeing was dropped in a final stage due to what the DAPA claimed was the F-15 Silent Eagle's lack of stealth capability.

""Boeing was a signature brand of US weapon systems in South Korea, but it's waning definitely,"" Kim said. ""Boeing has now few products to meet the required operational capability of the South Korean military's modernization programs, and the merit of the Korea-US alliance is not as strong as before in arms acquisition.""

Kim Yeol-soo, professor of international politics at Sungshin Women's University in Seoul, said US dominance in the South Korean defense market will not be weakened shortly, but the introduction of European weapons will change the environment of a market previously dominated by the US.

""US defense firms are expected to do more to meet the Korean demands, including tech transfer and logistics services, to respond to European rivals,"" Kim said. ""That will make the market more balanced than before.""

Eco-friendly and eco-efficient technologies take to the sky with Bluecopter demonstrator - Vertical Magazine,"Tue, 07 Jul 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2Vjb2ZyaWVuZGx5YW5kZWNvZWZmaWNpZW50dGVjaG5vbG9naWVzdGFrZXRvdGhlc2t5d2l0aGJsdWVjby_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"From left: Michael Schulz, experimental flight test engineer; Marius Bebesel program manager research and innovation in charge of the Bluecopter demonstrator; Jean-Brice Dumont, executive vice president engineering Airbus Helicopters; Stefan Thomé, head of engineering Germany; Wolfgang Schoder, CEO Airbus Helicopters Germany; Volker Bau, chief test pilot Germany.

A quieter and more fuel efficient future for rotorcraft flight has been unveiled by Airbus Helicopters with its Bluecopter demonstrator, which has validated leading-edge technologies ranging from an advanced Fenestron, improved rotor and airframe design to intelligent engine power management.

In the more than 28 flight hours logged during evaluations performed throughout its operating envelope, Bluecopter has confirmed the feasibility of Airbus Helicopters’ advancements in eco-friendly helicopter design while also proving the company’s next-generation eco-efficient technologies.

Using one of the company’s light medium twin-engine rotorcraft as the demonstrator platform, Bluecopter incorporates transversal technologies that can be applied across Airbus Helicopters’ product line. The aircraft made its public debut July 7, during a presentation at Airbus Helicopters’ Donauwörth, Germany facility.

“By bringing together the best of our company’s innovation, we are opening the way for a new generation of rotorcraft that will have lower noise levels, burn less fuel and are more efficient to operate,” explained Marius Bebesel, program manager research & innovation in charge of the Bluecopter demonstrator. “With Bluecopter, we have met our goals of decreasing fuel consumption by as much as 40 percent, significantly reducing CO2 emissions, and lowering noise to approximately 10 decibel effective perceived noise (EPNdB) below ICAO noise certification limits, while raising the maximum payload and the passenger comfort.”

More than 28 flight hours have been logged during evaluations of the Bluecopter demonstrator. Airbus Helicopters/Charles Abarr Photo

Airbus Helicopter’s signature Fenestron is further evolved on Bluecopter, with additional performance improvements from the shrouded tail rotor achieved through optimized blade and stator designs. The acoustic liner integrated in the Fenestron’s shroud and the active rudder on the tail fin contributes as well to the reduced noise footprint of the Bluecopter.

Its newly-developed rotor system improves operating efficiency while attenuating the acoustic footprint. The demonstrator’s innovative five-blade bearingless main rotor system has BlueEdge style blades with an increased diameter, significantly reduced tip speed and an improved distribution of twist along their length.

To achieve the ambitious targets in reducing CO2 emissions, a dedicated engine power management is implemented. During cruise the Bluecopter can be switched to an “eco-mode” by shutting off one engine. The remaining engine operates more efficiently and the fuel consumption is drastically reduced. The “eco mode” is based on an automatic control system that assists the crew and ensures safe operation of the aircraft.

The demonstrator features several measures to reduce aircraft aerodynamic drag, including fairings for the main rotor hub and the landing skids, a newly developed aft-body concept and the use of a specially-designed empennage with a T-tail horizontal stabilizer.

The eco-friendly approach is extended even to the attractive paint scheme of the Bluecopter, which was realized using the latest water-based paint technologies.

The Bluecopter development has been accomplished in the frame of a short-term skunk works project, largely covered by company self-funding. Certain technologies integrated into the demonstrator were developed in the framework of Europe’s Clean Sky joint technology initiative and Germany’s LuFo-IV research program."

Suffolk County Police Department takes delivery of second Airbus Helicopters H145 - Vertical Magazine,"Wed, 15 Jul 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL3N1ZmZvbGtjb3VudHlwb2xpY2VkZXBhcnRtZW50dGFrZXNkZWxpdmVyeW9mc2Vjb25kYWlyYnVzaGVsaS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Suffolk County Police Department’s H145s primarily conduct medical evacuation missions across Long Island. Airbus Helicopters Inc. Photo

Airbus Helicopters Inc. is pleased to announce the delivery of a second H145 helicopter to the Suffolk County Police Department (Long Island, N.Y.). The new H145 (previously EC145) has joined the department’s existing fleet of one H145 and two AS350 B2s, and will replace an older AS350 B2 AStar.

The Suffolk County H145s primarily conduct medical evacuation missions across Long Island. They are also equipped to perform law enforcement missions with a thermal imager, searchlight and moving map system. The AS350 B2s primarily conduct calls for law enforcement services and are back-up aircraft for air medical transport missions. The Suffolk County Police Department’s Aviation Section performs a wide variety of missions including law enforcement, medical evacuation, inter-hospital transport and search and rescue.

“We are excited to have our second H145 in-service for our air medical and law enforcement missions to support the citizens of Suffolk County,” said Sgt. Brian Barrett, commanding officer of SCPD’s Aviation Section. “The second H145 gives us the flexibility to have an H145 and an AS350 B2 operating at each of our two bases on Long Island. Airbus Helicopters Inc. continues to provide excellent support, and we look forward to continuing our long partnership with them.”

“The decision to deploy an additional H145 by Suffolk County PD demonstrates the multi-mission capabilities of the Airbus Helicopters light twin-engine helicopter family,” said Ed Van Winkle, sales manager for airborne law enforcement for Airbus Helicopters Inc. “Numerous law enforcement agencies rely on Airbus Helicopters H145 and H135 twins to perform a wide variety of complex missions. Having an H145 and an AS350 B2 AStar at each base gives Suffolk County PD unparalleled flexibility in providing the right tool for the job.”

The combination of performance and speed, high-set main and tail rotors, and clamshell rear doors make the H145 a top choice for many law enforcement and air medical service operators in the United States. Powered by two Turbomeca ARRIEL 1D1 engines, the H145 offers low maintenance requirements, which increase aircraft availability while keeping operating costs low.

Airbus Helicopters Inc., the U.S. law enforcement helicopter market leader, will exhibit at the Airborne Law Enforcement Association ALEA Expo 2015, Booth 739, in Houston, July 15 to 17."
Airbus electric plane makes history by flying over English Channel | Daily Sabah - Daily Sabah,"Sat, 11 Jul 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5c2FiYWguY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvMjAxNS8wNy8xMS9haXJidXMtZWxlY3RyaWMtcGxhbmUtbWFrZXMtaGlzdG9yeS1ieS1mbHlpbmctb3Zlci1lbmdsaXNoLWNoYW5uZWzSAXRodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseXNhYmFoLmNvbS9zY2llbmNlLzIwMTUvMDcvMTEvYWlyYnVzLWVsZWN0cmljLXBsYW5lLW1ha2VzLWhpc3RvcnktYnktZmx5aW5nLW92ZXItZW5nbGlzaC1jaGFubmVsL2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The E-fan electric plane of European planemaker Airbus has made history by being the first battery-operated electric plane to fly over the English Channel.Flying from Lydd, England, to Calais, France, on Friday morning, the environmentally-friendly plane which operates on batteries only, uses no oil or water.

Flight Review: Gatwick to St. Lucia on Virgin Atlantic in Economy Class - Airline Reporter,"Thu, 02 Jul 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAxNS8wNy9mbGlnaHQtcmV2aWV3LWdhdHdpY2stc3QtbHVjaWEtdmlyZ2luLWF0bGFudGljLWVjb25vbXktY2xhc3Mv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"I recently flew Virgin Atlantic from London Gatwick (LGW) to St. Lucia (UVF). It was a first-time experience for me, both flying the airline and riding on an Airbus A330-300. The flight was part of a Virgin Holidays package that my wife and I bought at the last minute, although flights to the island from London at this time of the year are also available with British Airways. I’d read mixed reviews about the Virgin Atlantic product, but my wife is a big fan – so I kept an open mind and we opted for the red livery.

I was excited to experience Airbus’ smallish wide-body over the distance, even though I understand Virgin operates the route with a 747 from time-to-time. The closest Boeing equivalent I’d flown on was a British Airways 767 from Moscow a few years ago, and I’d also enjoyed Etihad’s A340 from Abu Dhabi a few months ago ’“ both en-route to London Heathrow – so I relished the prospect of adding a new aircraft type to my repertoire.

Now, I’m a European LCC short-haul aficionado for both personal and (formerly) professional reasons (I used to be the Airports and Ground Ops lawyer for a UK airline). Minimalist seat width, pitch, a single aisle, and scratching around for euros or pound coins to pay for coffee and a muffin are my norms, so frankly any change from that is a win in my book. Actually, that’s rubbish. I love luxury, pampering, and upgrades as much as the next person. I was just full of AvGeek zeal and excitement on the day. Even the delay at LGW security whilst my Kindle Fire was tested for explosive substances was good-natured and efficient.

We flew economy as the upgrade options were limited. Besides, we were off to the Caribbean for a week’s holiday so I figured any discomfort from the sub-10-hour-flight could be set off against lying on the beach with a cocktail in due course.

The seat itself was slightly hard, but not uncomfortably so. I could live with it easily enough over the distance. The winged headrest that could be shaped into position and adjusted to your choice was nicely functional, but I didn’t need to use it in the end. And the leg space was also an unexpected boon.

Our seats, 61D and 61F, were the first in a set of three in the middle, as opposed to four, as the fuselage narrows towards the rear of the aircraft. I initially kicked myself for not checking in as early as possible (the customary 24-hours before departure) in order to select a berth of two with a window, but assumed that staring out at large stretches of the Atlantic would be nothing special. 61G was empty so we had even more space. However, the wider aisle space between 61D and 61C became a bit of a nuisance, with people perching there to chat to others within their traveling party. We eventually shifted ourselves across one seat to 61G, where the aisle space between it and 61H wasn’t wider, after more than one accidental elbow and/or behind in the face.

I enjoyed some IFE for most of the trip, especially the brilliant safety demonstration video, delivered as a cartoon using several different themes ranging from westerns to superheroes, police chases and, of course, a 007 moment. You can tell that these guys like to have fun and live in a world of bright colors and funky music.

The IFE system is not as smart as the one I’d experienced a few months ago on an Etihad A380 to Abu Dhabi, complete with noise-cancelling headphones, but the range of films was decent. There was a broad range of Bollywood choices, which I put down to VA’s popularity on Indian Ocean routes. Adjusting the volume on screen was the only real annoyance ’“ it was too fiddly.

Having enjoyed some tonic water with lemon and ice (too early for a Bombay Sapphire, at least for me anyway) an hour into the flight, it wasn’t that long before I was tucking into the main meal. I chose a very pleasant beef burgundy, over Spanish-style chicken and veggie bolognese, and a hearty bottle of Spanish red wine to accompany it ’“ I have my doubts about people’s ability to maintain a discerning palate for claret at FL39, but it was good enough for me to enjoy whilst wondering whether Bradley Cooper would take the shot in American Sniper, playing on my IFE.

Despite the longer flight time than scheduled, the headwinds didn’t generate more than light turbulence. Typically, it always seemed to arrive when we were delicately balancing different miniature foodstuffs and cups of liquid on the tray table. Fortunately, turbulence didn’t interfere with the delicious GU Chocolate & Orange Ganache. Something that is essentially a cake filler or icing can, in its own right, corner the market in airline desserts for chocolate-lovers. Virgin is inherently brand-conscious, so a dessert from GU is a pleasant addition to the meal.

A couple of hours later, cabin crew passed by with another mini treat. It was a mini Fab ice lolly from Nestle. I did a quick bit of research and found out that the Fab was originally launched by British firm J Lyons & Co Ltd. in 1967. I wonder if they could ever have imagined it being served on the ’œGolden Girl’ en-route to the Caribbean. There’s something quaintly British about it all and, although not a big ice lolly fan, I enjoyed it and the affected sense of occasion, immensely.

Not long after we’d all been ’œfabbed’, I took a discreet cabin picture for the sake of posterity. I’d not flown on an A330 before and had expected to feel cramped at the back. A few rows behind us were empty though, so that must have added to my sense of peace, calm, and feeling distinctly un-cattle-like.

An hour-and-a-half before landing came what the menu said was that great British tradition of “Afternoon Tea.” A chili chicken wrap and crisps probably stretches that concept somewhat, but I willingly participated anyway. I chuckled to myself at the ’˜plane’ flavored crisps; it’s a nice touch and even at the end of a nine-hour trek across the Atlantic, it’s oddly heart-warming.

We passed over the green, mountainous Lucian terrain and touched down gently at UVF at about 1pm local time. Well, I caught a few glimpses of it anyway. I didn’t get any photos on the descent into UVF because of both my central seat and the on-board reminder that all photography of the airport, ramp, and surrounding infrastructure was forbidden. I’m not sure how strict the handling staff would have been if I’d snapped a few cheeky ones once on stand, but we were on a week’s break, and the prospect of beginning it with a dressing down from some Lucian official didn’t appeal, so I bottled it and put the camera away.

Anyway, to sum up, I like Virgin Atlantic. At least I do for long-haul on what is mainly a holiday sector. They’re a nice airline and clearly have fun doing these routes. I can’t help but have Divine Comedy’s ’œNational Express’ playing in my head as I write this. The service is perhaps less refined or slick than BA and the other legacy carriers of this world, but the experience nevertheless gets the “thumbs up” from me.

Airbus Helicopters may build fourth H225M assembly line - Flightglobal,"Fri, 10 Jul 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYWlyYnVzLWhlbGljb3B0ZXJzLW1heS1idWlsZC1mb3VydGgtaDIyNW0tYXNzZW1ibHktbGluZS8xMTc1ODcuYXJ0aWNsZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters could set up a fourth assembly line for its H225M Caracal if it is successful in a forthcoming tender in India for naval helicopters.

The France-based manufacturer recently unveiled a pact with India’s Mahindra Defence covering the establishment of a joint venture to answer New Delhi’s pending rotorcraft requirements.

If it is successful in any of the three tenders, the partners will set up a manufacturing facility for local assembly of the helicopters under the “Buy and Make Indian” initiative.

The Caracal has been proposed for the nascent naval multi-role contest, which is still at the request for information (RFI) stage. If it wins an eventual order, however, the local assembly line for the type would add to current plants in Brazil and France, and a planned facility for the H225M in Poland.

Airbus Helicopters confirms that each tender is for a sufficient quantity of rotorcraft to make it “feasible to consider a manufacturing facility”. The nation has issued RFIs for two additional competitions covering reconnaissance and surveillance, and naval utility helicopters, for which the airframer is proposing the H125M Fennec and AS565 MBe Panther, respectively.

It confirms that there will be no element of indigenous design – as with Korea’s light civil helicopter/light attack helicopter programmes, for example – but technology transfer will form part of the offset package.

“The Indian armed forces have urgent requirements to replace their ageing fleet and our proposed helicopters are already military proven and have been evaluated by the users,” it says.

Although the initial release on the Mahindra deal raised the possibility that the production facility could also target the export market, Airbus Helicopters says it is “premature to elaborate” at this stage.

No date has been given for the release of the full tender, but the manufacturer anticipates developments in the coming months.

The first H135 configured for offshore hoisting duties has been delivered to HTM Helicopter Travel Munich GmbH, marking a new milestone for the enhanced version of Airbus Helicopters’ lightweight rotorcraft previously known as the EC135 T3.

The H135 is well adapted to the full range of offshore operations, benefitting from the helicopter’s excellent performance, especially in OEI (one engine inoperative) conditions. It fulfills all requirements for offshore missions, with equipment that includes a rescue hoist, an external life raft system, Helicopter Emergency Egress Lighting, Automatically Deployable ELT (Emergency Locator Transmitter), 3-Axis-Autopilot, Weather Radar, Underwater Locator Beacon and Emergency Floatation System certified for Sea State 6. In addition, its outstanding handling qualities, compact airframe size and small rotor diameter makes it the first choice in offshore wind business.

HTM will operate the H135 from its bases at Emden, Norden, Borkum and Helgoland, serving offshore windfarms in the German Bight. HTM has meanwhile contracted ten windfarms and customers like DONG, EWE, EON, Siemens, DOTI, ADWEN and Senvion. The H135 joins HTM’s already-extensive inventory of Airbus Helicopters-built rotorcraft that includes five EC135 P2+ versions already based along the North Sea coastline, with the company’s fleet growing to as many as eleven H135-family aircraft by early 2016.

“We look forward to the H135 joining our inventory. With its increased OEI performance and the additional equipment features offered it is the perfect complement to our existing fleet complying already with future offshore requirements. The EC135 fleet has proven its reliability and safety with a perfect availability static in offshore operation since 2009 having flown more than 6.000 hours with more than 25.000 hoist cycles” said Bernd Brucherseifer, managing director at HTM.

“As wind turbines gain an increasingly important role in renewable energy, the new H135 is ready to support highly cost-effective and efficient implementation, development and maintenance of offshore wind farms,” said Axel Humpert, head of the H135 program at Airbus Helicopters. “It is ready to join other rotorcraft in our product lines that are proving their capabilities every day in flights for the offshore oil and gas industry around the world.”

Airbus Helicopters already is the market leader in the offshore heli-lift segment, building on more than 40 years’ experience in supplying rotorcraft for missions such as transportation to oil and gas platforms at increasingly long distances out to sea, in overwater search and rescue missions, for the transfer of sea pilots, and, more recently, the installation and maintenance of wind farms.

The H135 is part of Airbus Helicopters’ light-medium family of twin-engine rotorcraft that carried the EC135 designation in the company’s former numbering system. Among the H135 version’s enhancements are two new turboshaft engine options with FADEC full authority digital engine controls: Turbomeca’s Arrius 2B2PLUS and Pratt & Whitney Canada’s PW206BB, which provide additional payload and deliver best-in-class performance throughout the flight envelope – along with low fuel consumption. Other features are the use of a bearingless main rotor and Airbus Helicopters’ signature Fenestron shrouded tail rotor, along with a new lateral air intake.

The H135 expands HTM’s fleet, which consists of 21 helicopters (and 4 business jets) and also comprises the EC145, EC120, AS350, AS355 and BK 117 rotorcraft types from Airbus Helicopters and its predecessors."
Airbus Helicopters promises safe single-engine operations with Bluecopter demonstrator - Flightglobal,"Wed, 08 Jul 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mbGlnaHRnbG9iYWwuY29tL2hlbGljb3B0ZXJzL2FpcmJ1cy1oZWxpY29wdGVycy1wcm9taXNlcy1zYWZlLXNpbmdsZS1lbmdpbmUtb3BlcmF0aW9ucy13aXRoLWJsdWVjb3B0ZXItZGVtb25zdHJhdG9yLzExNzU1Ni5hcnRpY2xl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters has unveiled a new demonstrator aircraft that brings together a basket of new and existing technologies aimed at drastically cutting fuel consumption, carbon dioxide emissions, and noise levels. For the first time, these include the possibility of safely operating a twin-engined helicopter in normal flight using just one engine.

In gestation since 2011, Bluecopter, as the manufacturer calls it, is targeted at cutting fuel burn by as much as 40-50%, says chief technology officer Jean-Brice Dumont.

Speaking at the public unveiling of the Bluecopter at an event at its Donauwörth, Germany site, Dumont said Airbus Helicopters had faced the choice over whether to develop a “brutally disruptive” rotorcraft –- for instance altering the position of the main rotor – or employing several incremental technology improvements, “techno-bricks”, in his words, to achieve the same goal.

Dominic Perry/Flightglobal

Using the original EC135 test airframe as a base, the company has chosen the latter course, adding so much new equipment “that there is not so much left from the original aircraft”.

Modifications include a next-generation shrouded Fenestron tail rotor which features optimised blades and stators, a T-tail to bring the horizontal stabiliser out of the path of the rotor wash improving stability and lift, an active rudder to reduce the power required for the Fenestron, a reshaped rear fuselage, aerodynamic skid covers, a bearingless main rotor featuring five curved Blue Edge-style blades – some 50cm (20in) longer than those in the regular EC135 – and a main rotor hub fairing.

The changes, notably the increase in rotor efficiency, have reduced the required power by around 15%, says Dumont, as well as increasing payload.

However, the most transformative technology is single engine operation (SEO), he says, which raises the potential fuel consumption saving to the 35-40% level.

At present, the system simply alerts the pilots that they are within certain parameters – a speed of about 120kt (222km/h) and altitude of between 1,640-5,000ft – to enable one engine to be safely shut down. Restart takes about 20-30s, says Marius Bebesel, programme manager research and innovation.

However, Dumont says the eventual goal is to automate the system, “to add intelligence” that allows the FADEC to control the shutdown or restart once “eco mode” is selected.

Airbus Helicopters

Airbus Helicopters has been working with engine supplier Pratt & Whitney Canada to implement the change to the FADEC software on the latter’s PW206 powerplants and hopes to trial a more automated system later this year, says Bebesel.

The enhancement could be applied to any twin-engined helicopter without the need for changes to dynamic components and additional certification work, says Dumont: “We don't see that as a risk.”

In addition, the engine manufacturer also worked with Airbus Helicopters to help reduce the engine and rotor RPM by 16% to reflect the improved rotor efficiency.

Dominic Perry/Flightglobal

Phase one of the flight-test campaign ran from April to October 2014, with a second effort kicking off in early 2015 that will terminate towards year-end.

So far it has accumulated 28 flight hours using the testbed, the majority during the initial period last year.

Although trialled on a light-twin rotorcraft, Airbus Helicopters says the technologies are largely platform agnostic and could be applied to any helicopter in its range, both those in production and in development.

We flew the airplane from Chicago-O’Hare International Airport on a demonstration flight, returning after about 90 minutes. We were then able to get an in-depth look at the aircraft, including areas not normally seen by passengers.

Flight Tests

This aircraft—while fitted with a cabin—is in fact still a test aircraft. That fact is most evident in the console occupied by two flight engineers throughout the flight. Flight data, engine data, Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) data, and much more is fed to the seven screens that make up the console. The flight engineers also have access to the feeds from the on-board cameras, providing them with visual information about the aircraft’s performance. Throughout the cabin sensors are present measuring everything from atmospheric pressure to cabin temperature.

Seating

The seating, both business class and economy, was quite comfortable. Although the demonstration flight only lasted about 90 minutes, we were able to sample multiple seats. The economy cabin is arranged in a 3-3-3 configuration and the business cabin is arranged in a 1-2-1 configuration so that each seat has aisle access. We also explored the crew rest area that is located above the forward galley just behind the flight deck. There is also a separate crew rest area in the rear of the aircraft for the cabin crew. The forward crew rest has two bunks and a reclining seat for an optional third person.

The Flight Deck

The first thing one notices when entering the flight deck are the screens. The six main screens offer pilots a variety of views and information. In addition to each pilot’s dedicated screens there are two large center screens available for cooperative use.

Other Impressions

The A350’s Rolls Royce Trent XWB engines are gigantic. But for their monstrous size, they’re hardly noticed on the inside. When our demonstration flight landed, the thrust reversers were barely noticeable. We enjoyed our flight and getting to see the A350. We hope you’ll enjoy the rest of the photos from our tour!"
INC leaders using planes worth billions of pesos? - Rappler,"Sat, 25 Jul 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJhcHBsZXIuY29tL25ld3NicmVhay9pbnZlc3RpZ2F0aXZlLzEwMDQ0NS1pZ2xlc2lhLWxlYWRlcnMtYmlsbGlvbnMtcGVzb3MtYWlyY3JhZnQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This is AI generated summarization, which may have errors.

EXCLUSIVE: The price of a huge Airbus ranges from P8.8 billion to P11 billion, while an executive jet costs about P3.6 billion. These aircraft are being used by the Iglesia executive minister in his pastoral and personal trips abroad, Rappler learns.

MANILA, Philippines – Flying in style? Why are the Iglesia ni Cristo (INC) leaders using an ostentatious Airbus 330-202 and a Boeing executive jet that cost billions of pesos?

The price of a huge Airbus ranges anywhere from P8.8 billion ($200 million) to P11 billion ($250 million). It is being used by INC executive minister Eduardo Manalo in his pastoral and personal trips abroad, informed sources confirmed to Rappler.

A long-term lease of an Airbus 330 could easily cost $5 million to $6 million, excluding payment for the pilot and flight times. This $5-million minimum lease translates to at least P225 million, sources in business circles said.

On record, the last time the plane was used was on June 27, 2015, when Manalo visited Taipei and officially established Taiwan as an ecclesiastical district.

In February, the INC chief also used the Airbus to go to Seattle, Washington and embark on a series of pastoral visits in the US, one Iglesia source, who requested anonymity for fear of being expelled, said.

Photos sent by the source showed that at least one security aide of the INC had his photo taken inside the modified cabin of the Airbus. Aircraft of this kind may be customized to have a living area similar to the photo below.

The Airbus that Manalo and his ministers are using is aside from a Boeing Business Jet 737 that had been described as “the best-selling jet airliner in the history of aviation.” Depending on the model, a passenger business jet can seat from 85 to 215 passengers, while a customized executive jet can have a bedroom and seats good for 20-30 passengers, sources familiar with aircraft told Rappler.

The Boeing Business Jet 737 is said to have been purchased 4 years ago at an estimated price of about P3.6 billion ($80 million), the sources told us. Yearly maintenance costs of these types of aircraft, according to those in the know, easily amount to from P3 million to P4 million. This excludes fuel expenses.

Cayman Islands

At any given time, the Airbus is supposed to be parked at a private hangar in Clark Airport. This was independently confirmed by a top-level source based in Clark who has seen the plane in Clark and who said it is the property of the Iglesia.

It is however registered under a different name, based on registration papers. Data from the Civil Aviation Authority of the Cayman Islands show the plane’s registered owner as “Skytrooper Limited”. The Airbus plane, model A330-202 and with serial number 1321, was registered on July 19, 2012.

Skytrooper Limited is a company in the Cayman Islands.

As it turns out, the other executive jet, a Boeing 737-700 IGW model was also registered under the name of “Skytrooper Ltd” on December 6, 2011. “Skytrooper Ltd” is also a company in the Cayman Islands.

According to its website, the Cayman Islands Aircraft Registry “is the registry of choice for many owners and many management companies with corporate aircraft ranging from Cessna Citation, Gulfstream, Embraer, Airbus and Boeing Business Jets.”

Rappler has learned that maintenance of the Airbus is being handled by the staff of a business tycoon.

Sought for comment about the Airbus and the executive jet, INC spokesman Brother Edwil Zabala merely said, “’Yan, hindi ko kayang sagutin personally, dahil wala akong personal knowledge diyan.” (That I cannot answer personally because I don’t have personal knowledge about it.)

Members enraged

The personal use of the Airbus has enraged some INC members who say it is “excessive luxury” which the former INC head did not lavish upon himself.

Referring to the late Eraño “Ka Erdy” Manalo, who died in August 2009, one INC member said, “He pays for commercial travel even if back then he had enough funds to do this type of spending.”

Now headed by Ka Erdy’s son Eduardo, the powerful INC is caught in its worst crisis since it was founded in the Philippines a century ago.

INC members have accused their leaders of harassment and corruption, and the scandal broke days before the INC’s 101st anniversary on Monday, July 27.

From a struggling sect in the early 1900s founded by Felix Manalo, the INC has grown dramatically, now claiming to be present in 100 countries spanning 6 continents. In the Philippines, it has about 2.5 million adherents as of 2010, many of them poor. (INFOGRAPHIC: What you should know about the Iglesia ni Cristo).

An INC source said that Felix Manalo’s divine task was to establish the roots of the INC faith in the Philippines. His successor and son, the late Eraño Manalo, was tasked with spreading the faith in the country and abroad.

The divine role of current INC head, Eduardo Manalo, for his part, is to see to it that the faith further spreads worldwide and makes the INC self-sustaining. Eduardo assumed the post of executive minister in 2009 after his father “Ka Erdy” died in August.

While Eraño’s administrative style may be calculating, Eduardo is proving to be more of a risk-taker.

It was during his term that the INC got more aggressive in purchasing properties in Australia, Korea, and Japan, an INC insider pointed out. The sect’s most controversial purchase is the abandoned property in South Dakota in 2011, to the tune of $700,000 (P30.8 million). (READ: INC services begin in South Dakota ghost town.)

The INC also got aggressive in money making ventures and tourism, with its grand, 75-hectare Ciudad de Victoria in Bulacan, whose centerpiece is the Philippine Arena – the world’s largest indoor arena. (READ: Iglesia ni Cristo’s centennial project draws world attention to PH)

Earlier, Felix Nathaniel “Angel” Manalo said of his brother Eduardo in Filipino, “Our request is, he should not believe in the Sanggunian that he is trusting, because donations to the Iglesia are wasted on unnecessary projects.” He also alluded to corruption within the church. – Rappler.com"
How “Crazy” Was That Tom Cruise ‘Mission: Impossible’ Plane Stunt? The Movie’s Cinematographer Tells All - Hollywood Reporter,"Fri, 31 Jul 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvbW92aWUtbmV3cy9taXNzaW9uLWltcG9zc2libGUtcGxhbmUtc3R1bnQtdG9tLTgxMjE1OC_SAWJodHRwczovL3d3dy5ob2xseXdvb2RyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vbW92aWVzL21vdmllLW5ld3MvbWlzc2lvbi1pbXBvc3NpYmxlLXBsYW5lLXN0dW50LXRvbS04MTIxNTgvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In the run-up to Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation, Paramount’s marketers and Tom Cruise himself have turned the movie’s opening sequence in one of the film’s main selling points.

The scene features Cruise’s Ethan Hunt hanging onto an Airbus 400 as it taxies down a runway and takes off. And the media has taken the bait, describing it under headlines that have called the stunt “dangerous,” “crazy,” “insane” and even “death-defying.”

In fact, the stunt, which was filmed at RAF Wittering air base in the U.K., did actually take place — the sequence wasn’t created digitally. Testifies Robert Elswit, the film’s director of photography, “There’s no digital Tom, and there’s no fake plane. He’s really strapped to an Airbus.”

In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Elswit said, “It’s pretty damn crazy; it’s over a hundred knots when it takes off. They can slow down pretty quickly, but it still does on a complete circuit. They go up, get altitude, make a complete circuit and land. I think it’s up in the air for about 6-8 minutes before it lands again. It had to be at least 1,000 ft. up. And he’s attached to the thing the whole time. The visual effects that were involved were erasing the wires (which held Cruise to the plane).”

But, at the same time, there was plenty of planning and practice involved in order to minimize the risks.

“Tom was in a full body harness and he’s cabled and wired to the plane through [its] door. Inside the aircraft was an aluminum truss that was carefully bolted to the plane, which held the wires that went through the door, which held Tom,” the cinematographer said of safety measures. “He was also wearing special contact lenses to protect his eyes. If anything hit him at those speeds it could be really bad. They were very careful about cleaning the runway so there were no rocks. And we took off in certain weather conditions; there were no birds. And he’s sort of protected by the way the air moves over the wing.”

Elswit, an Oscar winner for There Will Be Blood, explained that to get the shot of Cruise, a truss device was built to attach to the plane an ARRI 35mm film camera with a Panavision anamorphic zoom, housed in an aerodynamic Nettmann System’s stabilized head. Elswit and members of the camera crew were inside the Airbus, watching the [Airbus-mounted] camera on a video tap. “I could remotely pan and tilt the camera, ” he added.

“We did the takeoff twice, possibly three times,” he said. “We taxied a lot. But the actual takeoff is so grueling and so specific, I think that may have been only twice.”

A helicopter flying alongside the plane, was also used. According to Elswit, “There was a helicopter flying next to us. From the helicopter, we were shooting [the additional aerial perspective] of Tom attached to the door. In the VFX, they erased the [Airbus-mounted] camera that we were shooting with [as it was in the helicopter shot].”

The cinematographer added that the sequence came together with careful planning by the camera and effects teams, working with the Airbus Defense and Space flight test team (Airbus announced its involvement here). “The first time they did a test with a dummy,” he said. “They then flew with the camera rig, and the day before we went up with a stunt double just to make sure everything was okay.

“When he wants to do something, he’ll figure out a way to do it,” Elswit said of working with Cruise. “He’s the most obsessive artist. … If it couldn’t actually be Tom on the plane, I think he wouldn’t want the sequence in the movie. That’s what happened on the Burj [Khalifa skyscrapter in Dubai, for an action sequence in Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol]. I’m always stunned. What inside of him makes it possible for anybody to do that kind of shit — and not be scared shitless? He loves it.”

Airbus A350XWB gets star treatment on world tour - CNN,"Wed, 15 Jul 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vdHJhdmVsL2FydGljbGUvYWlyYnVzLWEzNTB4d2ItYW1lcmljYXMtdG91ci1mZWF0L2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Story highlights The Airbus A350XWB is the world's newest airliner It's part of a new generation of lightweight, super-efficient widebody jetliners Airbus is taking a test version of the plane on a tour of North and South America

Atlanta CNN —

Parked inside a giant hangar on the fringes of an Atlanta airport sits an airliner that’s getting the star treatment. Sure, the Stones are touring this summer. So are Taylor Swift and One Direction. But for aviation enthusiasts in Brazil, Colombia and the United States, this tour is even better. Welcome to the “A350XWB Tour.”

The Airbus A350XWB (for extra-wide body) is the world’s newest family of innovative jetliners. This one is touring the Americas, as the French-based aircraft manufacturer shows off its new generation of ultra-efficient planes.

In the coming decades, more and more travelers will be boarding these kinds of lightweight airliners that fly long distances and burn less fuel. Passengers will be enjoying wider, quieter cabins with more headroom and more comfortable cabin pressure.

Plus, these planes just look cool.

This week, the A350 tour came to the world’s busiest airport, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International, where the sleek, gray, black and white airplane ruled over Bay 10 at Delta Air Lines’ TechOps facility.

The invitation-only event included aviation industry journalists and news reporters. Even some enamored Delta employees lined up for a rare chance to get on board. The public will get its opportunity next week, when the plane visits the gigantic AirVenture airshow in Oshkosh, Wisconsin.

Some fans were following the event via Twitter and clearly loving it.

@thompatterson Very cool. Looking forward to seeing it in Oshkosh next week. — Matt Gjedde (@mdgjedde) July 14, 2015

I admit it: stepping onto the plane through the rear door kind of felt like venturing backstage at a concert. We were met in the galley by an entourage of crew members and company officials who were more than happy to talk about the band – I mean, the airplane.

Now, don’t get me wrong. This ain’t no party.

Some serious engineering is happening here. During test flights, technicians sit in special monitoring stations in the cabin where they analyze data. A few days earlier during a stop in Bogota, the plane’s pilots performed 13 takeoffs and landings to gather enough data to prove to aviation officials that the plane’s auto-landing feature will work reliably at high-altitude airports.

“It’s definitely a preparation visit as much as it is just showing off the product to the people who bought it,” said Mike Bausor, Airbus’ A350XWB marketing director.

Airport crews in Bogota and Atlanta greeted the plane with water cannon salutes. “It’s always great when we go to a new airport for the first time,” said Airbus test pilot Frank Chapman. “People are excited, waiting for us there with their cameras, taking photos.”

The A350’s wings sweep back like an Olympic swimmer poised on the starting block. The plane’s curly, carbon fiber wingtips have become one of its signature features, bending upward in a dramatic, 14-foot swoop.

“It’s like Nike decided to enter the airplane manufacturing business,” joked one observer on Reddit.

The wingtip design lets the plane cut through the air more efficiently, saving fuel.

In fact, instead of aluminum, most of the plane’s wings and fuselage are made of carbon fiber composite material, making these kinds of planes so lightweight they can fly much farther on a single load of fuel.

During the cruise phase of a flight, pilots can save even more fuel by changing the shape of the A350’s wings. Pilots are able to shift specific flaps on the A350’s wings without changing the wing’s entire shape. “That is unique to the A350,” said Bausor.

Next we walked through the main cabin, where the airliner coach seats were arranged in a 3-3-3 configuration. Each seat had its own snazzy fourth generation in-flight HD entertainment system.

The two-class layout also included a business class with seats that lay fully flat into a 73.5-inch bed. Depending on the model and configuration, total capacity for the A350 is more than 300 passengers.

Delta, which plans to buy 25 A350-900s, is still in the process of deciding its specific cabin configuration.

During an opportune moment, I asked Chapman to let me peek inside the cockpit. Once inside, it kind of felt like I’d talked my way into Taylor Swift’s dressing room. Thrilling to be sure, but sorry, no. Not sexy. A trio of crew were discussing the A350’s latest test run.

The A350 is part of a new breed of airliners that aims to open new long-distance, nonstop routes that were traditionally too unprofitable for old-style planes.

For example, Boeing’s new 787 Dreamliner has allowed British Airways to launch a nine-hour, nonstop between Austin, Texas, and London. United flies its 787s on a 12.5-hour nonstop route bridging San Francisco and Chengdu, in central China far from the coast.

The A350 has been flying commercially since January, via Qatar Airways.

Next year, travelers departing from the United States will have a chance to experience the A350 when Qatar Airways begins flying it to Doha from New York and Boston. Those routes, more than 6,500 miles long, will provide the first proving ground as to whether this plane will live up to its billing. Airbus says the plane’s 900 model has a maximum range of about 8,900 miles.

Related story: Does the world’s biggest airliner have a future?

Later, American Airlines will be the first North American carrier to fly the A350 because of a deal that predated its merger with US Airways. United plans to fly the A350 as well. Delta’s A350s are expected to start being delivered in 2017, helping to replace the fleet’s fuel-guzzling 747s.

The A350 will continue its tour this month, with scheduled stops at Liberty International Airport in Newark, New Jersey; Chicago’s O’Hare; Milwaukee’s General Mitchell International; and then the huge national airshow in Oshkosh, Wisconsin.

But can a beautiful beast like the A350 land elegantly at a small airport such as the one at Oshkosh? No problem, said Chapman, who, in 2009, landed there piloting a double-decker A380, the world’s largest airliner.

“The biggest issue is going to be with all those small airplanes, bringing the aircraft around on the ground,” he said. “The tractor driver who’s going to tow us around – he’s got a job-and-a-half.”

So, the A350XWB Tour may not be as flashy as this summer’s One Direction concerts, but it definitely will thrill America’s aviation geeks."
Ohio State Highway Patrol orders first U.S. built H125 AStar - Vertical Magazine,"Tue, 14 Jul 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL29oaW9zdGF0ZWhpZ2h3YXlwYXRyb2xvcmRlcnNmaXJzdHVzYnVpbHRoMTI1YXN0YXIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Capt.

Airbus Helicopters Inc. is proud to announce that the Ohio State Highway Patrol (OSHP) has ordered the first H125 AStar produced on the new final assembly line at the company’s production facility in Columbus, Miss. The AStar, America’s most popular single-engine turbine helicopter, is now built in the United States by American workers.

Airbus Helicopters Inc. will recognize the Ohio State Highway Patrol at a brief ceremony at the Airborne Law Enforcement Association ALEA Expo 2015 in Houston, on Friday, July 17.

Ohio State Highway Patrol currently operates two AS350B2 AStars to conduct a wide variety of law enforcement missions including patrol, aerial searches with thermal imagers, photo missions and marijuana eradication. The highway patrol has been operating AStars for more than 20 years to protect and serve the citizens of Ohio.

Airbus Helicopters Inc. had partially assembled AS350B2 and AS350B3 AStar helicopters in Columbus since 2005. Production of the H125 (formerly AS350 B3e) on the full final assembly line began in late 2014. The OSHP aircraft is the first H125 produced from the Columbus assembly line and certified by the Federal Aviation Administration.

Airbus Helicopters installed the Columbus final assembly line to allow shorter delivery times, increased aircraft customization and the ability for customers to see their aircraft being manufactured, and to offer enhanced customer support. The H125 assembly line is part of Airbus Helicopters Inc.’s 40-acre facility in Northeastern Mississippi that also produces the UH-72A Lakota for the U.S. Army. The plant has delivered more than 340 Lakotas to date, all of them on time, on budget and meeting Army quality requirements.

Captain Randy Boggs of the Ohio State Highway Patrol Aviation Section said the agency is ready to begin operations with the latest, most capable version of the AStar. “Our new H125 will give us increased power and useful load, along with additional safety features,” said Boggs. “We are looking forward to placing our new helicopter into service later this year.”

“It is exciting that the first Made in America H125 will be delivered to the Ohio State Highway Patrol,” said Christopher Emerson, President of Airbus Helicopters Inc. “Law enforcement and government operators will value that the H125 is made in the USA, and it is important that the first ship goes to a long time AStar operator such as the OSHP. Now that we are producing helicopters on the Columbus final assembly line, Airbus Helicopters Inc. will provide better support and service to customers both before and after delivery.”

The OHSP will take delivery of its new H125 at Airbus Helicopters Inc. headquarters in Grand Prairie, Texas, later this year.

Airbus Helicopters Inc. has been the U.S. airborne law enforcement helicopter sales leader for more than a decade and the AStar is the top selling helicopter in the market. More than 220 are now in operation with U.S. law enforcement agencies, including more than 75 delivered in the last five years.

The H125 provides law enforcement operators with high cruise speed, long range and high altitude capability. It has a spacious cabin and modern safety features, including energy-attenuating seats and fuel tank. The H125 also features dual hydraulics, dual channel engine FADEC, 30-minute take-off power and an advanced glass cockpit Vehicle and Engine Multifunction Display that lowers pilot workload. With a Turbomeca Arriel 2D engine, the H125 boasts a significant power reserve, along with unmatched tail rotor authority and hot and high performance. The H125 is the ideal platform for a wide variety of law enforcement missions in varied operating environments.

A new H125 operated by the Austin Police Department will be exhibited by Airbus Helicopters Inc. at ALEA EXPO 2015, Booth 739, to highlight the features of the aircraft for law enforcement operators."
Electric aircraft makes first English Channel crossing - New Atlas,"Sun, 12 Jul 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3YXRsYXMuY29tL2ZpcnN0LWVsZWN0cmljLWFpcmNyYWZ0LWNyb3NzLWVuZ2xpc2gtY2hhbm5lbC1haXJidXMtY3JpLWNyaS8zODQxMC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"An electric aircraft has crossed the English Channel for the first time. The question is, which one is it? On Friday, Airbus Group announced that its E-Fan technology demonstrator claimed the prize by flying from Lydd, Kent to Calais. However, it soon came to light that French Aerobat Hugues Duval had flown from Dover to Calais 12 hours earlier on Thursday in a Cri-Cri electric plane. Exactly which one gets in the record books may hinge on a technicality.

The first powered flight across the Channel was achieved by Louis Blériot in his Blériot XI on July 25, 1909. Last week's attempts at being the first electric plane to make the same flight was something of a flashback to those days, with no less than three competitors vying for the £1,000 (US$1,500) prize offered by the Daily Mail newspaper.

Of course, the money was mainly symbolic, since Airbus alone sunk £14 million (US$22 million) into its effort. In addition, though the flight across the Channel may seem small compared to the ocean-spanning legs of the Solar Impulse 2 circumnavigation attempt, the channel jumpers are aiming for a more immediately practical form of electric flight that could see 100-passenger electric hybrid planes entering service by 2030.

The first of the three competitors to fall by the wayside was Pipistrel, a Slovenian company that had to abandon its effort when Siemens, the makers of the plane's electric motor, refused to allow its motor to fly over water.

This seemed to leave the field open to the Airbus E-Fan. On July 10, the E-Fan took off from Lydd Airport with test pilot Didier Esteyne at the controls and flew 46 mi (74 km) to Calais in 36 minutes at an altitude of about 3,500 ft.

Built with an all-composite construction, the two-seater E-fan is 22 ft (6.7 m) long and has a wingspan of 31 ft (9.5 m). From the outside, it almost looks like a toy jet aircraft with a pair of nacelles that aren't jets, but ducted, variable pitch fans. These are spun by two electric motors powered by a series of 250 V lithium-ion polymer batteries. The ducting increases the thrust while reducing noise, and by centrally mounting them, the fans provide better control.

The E-Fan landed in Calais to considerable media attention, but the event went from congratulations to confusion as the Associated Press reported that Hugues Duval had quietly taken off from Dover in his Cri Cri and had landed in Calais some 12 hours earlier on July 9.

With a wingspan of about 16 ft (4.9 m) and two 35 bhp Electravia electric motors, the Cri Cri flew at 65 mph (105 km/h) and had a 25 min range.

According to AP, Duval's flight took only 17 minutes, which was shorter than the Airbus flight because the latter aircraft circled Lydd Airport after taking off while a helicopter carried out a visual safety check.

One difference in Duval's flight that may be a point of controversy is that he did not have formal permission to take off from Dover, so his aircraft was towed into the air by a conventional plane. This assistance may place recognizing Duval's record flight in jeopardy.

""We are not worried,"" said Airbus spokesman Jeremy Greaves said in a Daily Mail interview. ""It would not count because we understand he set off from another plane. We applaud the intrepid aviator that did this, although the actual details are yet to be confirmed.""

Airbus Patents Even More Massive Double-Decker Airplane - SlashGear,"Tue, 07 Jul 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNsYXNoZ2Vhci5jb20vYWlyYnVzLXBhdGVudHMtZXZlbi1tb3JlLW1hc3NpdmUtZG91YmxlLWRlY2tlci1haXJwbGFuZS0wNzM5MjAwNi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus patents even more massive double-decker airplane

A new patent shows the Airbus company may be making an aircraft larger than its already largest air-ready vehicle. This patent application suggests that a double-decker airplane is once again in order, making way for more fuel economy as it carries just as many passengers, luggage, and otherwise ""profitable cargo"" across the planet. This airplane aims to improve upon the A380, the most talked-about Airbus airplane in the world today. Foldable seats that slide together and possible requirements for still-oversized jetways remain included.

This plane is being called the A3XX or ""A3-whatsit"" by airway specialists like Marisa Garcia at Skift. Garcia suggests that ""When we looked at the various aircraft configurations proposed, we saw features borrowed from today's A380, some borrowed from the manufacturer's aircraft carrier Beluga, even some features that seem inspired by the Russian Antonov aircraft.""

This aircraft is made to be more airport friendly with ground-level exits and options for standardized exits.

Below you'll see the folding seat concept from the product brief. More moveable room means a better versatility for the crew, allowing them to accommodate all sorts of passengers and cargo.

It's also made to fit more people than ever before. While this patent doesn't expressly say the number of passengers this plane would be able to carry, the A380 already carries 853 people at once.

Can you imagine flying with over 900 people on a single craft?

This patent does not get extremely specific on engines and wing dimensions. Given the rest of the details here, it's fair to assume this craft will be made to be able to take off from and land on far more runways than its predecessor.

Above you'll see an Airbus A380 next to the smallest of Airbus machines, the Airbus A318. That's the size plane you'd fly out of Bismarck, North Dakota. The new A3XX will be even bigger than the A380 – not necessarily on the outside, but certainly in capacity and versatility."
Pontifications: Casting eyes toward Dubai Air Show - Leeham News and Analysis,"Fri, 31 Jul 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNS8wOC8zMS9wb250aWZpY2F0aW9ucy1jYXN0aW5nLWV5ZXMtdG93YXJkLWR1YmFpLWFpci1zaG93L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Aug. 31, 2015, © Leeham Co. September begins tomorrow and we’re only nine weeks away to the 2015 Dubai Air Show.

We’re looking to this event to be the last big opportunity for major airplane orders for this year. While it’s true that Airbus, Boeing and the other OEMs make a big year-end push to top off the order book, the Dubai show has become increasingly on a par with the Farnborough and Paris air shows, but focused on wide-body orders and program launches.

Eyes on the Dubai Air Show will be watching for what could be would be this year’s prize catch: whether Emirates Airlines will be ready to place the oft-talked about order for 50-70 Airbus A350-900s or Boeing 787-10s. (Some have floated an even higher number.) The other big item of interest: whether Airbus will launch the A380neo.

Tim Clark, president and COO of Emirates, is adamant there is no linkage between the prospect of an A380neo and the medium twin-aisle order. Clark, of course, is the strongest advocate for re-engining the A380. Qatar Airways CEO Akbar Al-Baker said if the A380neo is launched, he’ll order some. Lufthansa Airlines said Airbus has to do the neo if it’s to regain the lead in seat mile costs over Airbus’ own A350-1000 and the forthcoming Boeing 777-9.

These are the only public declarations of interest I’ve seen.

Airbus might have gained some advantage with the expected launch of the A350-900LR, which adds about 600nm to the range of the airplane at the expense of some passenger seats. The range is now computed to be about 8,500nm. The 787-10 now has a range of less than 6,500nm under Boeing’s new Standard Rule data.

Boeing continues to comfortably lead in the wide-body backlog.

Figure 1. Wide Body Market Share: Sources: Airbus, Boeing, at July 31, 2015.

Boeing’s lead is boosted by its dominance in the freighter market, where it has a backlog of 147 747-8F, 767-300ERFs and 777Fs to a meager 10 A330Fs for Airbus. This is a 94% market share for Boeing. (The Boeing KC-46A and Airbus A330 MRTT are not included.) In terms of passenger aircraft only, Boeing has a 52% market share of the backlog.

Figure 2 shows the data at July 31, 2015, from the Airbus and Boeing websites:

The aircraft are grouped by seating capacity to best show how the aircraft stack up against each other. Airbus does not have a competing offering to the Boeing 777-9.

Figure 2 indicates the bragging rights at stake for the Dubai Air Show.

The aerospace world will be watching.

Made For Tourism - Vertical Mag - Vertical Magazine,"Thu, 23 Jul 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL2ZlYXR1cmVzL21hZGVmb3J0b3VyaXNtL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Visiting Niagara Helicopters in the summertime is like jumping into the middle of a busy beehive–things are hopping, but everyone moves with purpose. The company, which has roots going back more than half a century, is well known for offering aerial helicopter tours over the Niagara region. Each year, about 80,000 to 100,000 tourists arrive at its Victoria Avenue location to embark on nine-minute, 27-kilometre “flightseeing” rides over the mighty Niagara Falls.

During Niagara Helicopters’ busy season, from June to October, there are four helicopters in the air for the better part of each day, with one of them taking off every three minutes.

The Airbus Helicopters H130 has been called the “limousine” of aerial tourism. Along with a more powerful Turbomeca Arriel 2D engine, the new H130 offers a vibration control system, improved air conditioning, a flat floor interior for passenger comfort, and other enhancements.

The operation ticks along like an expensive watch–a legacy, no doubt, from former owner Ruedi Hafen, a Swiss-born businessman who established the helicopter sightseeing branch of the company back in 1985. From its early days with just one four-seat Bell 206 JetRanger, the company grew steadily. By the mid-90s, Niagara Helicopters was operating a fleet of four brand new Bell 407s, made in Mirabel, Que. Those machines served the company well for almost two decades, until 2015, when the previously all-Bell operator acquired a brand new fleet of four Airbus Helicopters H130s.

“The Bells served us very well; we never complained about the 407s. But now, these new helicopters are stepping it up for the tourist experience,” commented Anna Pierce, vice president of Niagara Helicopters.

Pierce, who has worked at the company since 1984, said the H130 is made for tourism. When Vertical visited Niagara Helicopters at the end of May, she and her team were busy. In addition to preparing for the imminent arrival of the last three new helicopters, the company was also heavily involved with Rendez-vous Canada–the country’s largest tourism trade show, which was held in Niagara Falls this year. Niagara Helicopters attended the show to promote its helicopter rides to excursion organizers from around the world–and this year, the new fleet was a hot topic.

Shiny birds: Niagara Helicopters’ new H130s fly in formation over the city of Niagara Falls, Ont. Airbus Helicopters Canada filled the tour operator’s order in record time, delivering all four machines in just over two months.

As part of the trade show, Pierce and her team invited selected tour company representatives to fly over the Falls. At the time of the demo, the company had acquired one brand new H130, so it was called into service alongside the Bell 407s. The new arrival got a lot of attention.

“The way it was put to us is that the 407s were like regular economy in an aircraft–there was nothing wrong with them,” recounted Pierce. “But these (the H130s) are like executive class. There’s more leg room, there’s a better view, and more creature comforts. They feel like they have a lot more space. Everyone wanted to go on the H130!”

Pierce is pleased with the reaction to the new machines. Making a good impression on tour operators is critical, and catering to an international clientele is the key to success. Most of the visitors to Niagara Helicopters come from South Korea, while numbers from the U.K., the United States, France, Germany and now China are on the rise.

The Niagara Helicopters A-Team: from left to right are Rene Huessy, operations manager and chief pilot; Tony Dempsey, director of maintenance; and Anna Pierce, vice president.

During the summer, the helicopter operator’s large parking lot is often full of motor coaches, which bring in more than 50 per cent of annual business. Hundreds of sightseers spill into the lobby, where they are greeted by Niagara Helicopters’ front desk staff. After tickets are purchased [at a price of $140 per adult], the excited visitors line up, chattering in a variety of different languages, cameras at the ready.

It could be a recipe for chaos, but it’s clear that the staff have been down this road more than a few times. The ground crew takes over from the front desk, ushering each group of passengers up to the waiting helicopter, belting them in and helping them to don headsets before closing the door and flashing a thumb’s up at the pilot.

The pilot assumes command at that point–greeting the passengers before bringing the helicopter up gracefully to pose for a company photographer, and then lifting off to join the pattern for the Fallsview tour.

One minute later, the next helicopter lands and it’s time to disembark those passengers while preparing the next group. And so it goes, over and over again during the busy high season. Timing is everything. Sometimes, one of the pilots will call for a “slow load,” when a passenger needs extra assistance boarding and exiting the helicopter. That creates a domino effect, with the other three helicopters easing back until the machine on the ground has lifted off again.

For the pilots at Niagara Helicopters, timing is everything. During the company’s high season from June to October, four helicopters are usually in the air, with one taking off every three minutes.

“If you look at our approaches and departures, they’re not your standard airport procedures,” explained Travis Hopkin, a 4,000-hour pilot who has been with Niagara Helicopters for seven years. “In fact, it’s a little faster. Our ride is based on time, rather than A to B. So if we’re running four machines, our timing is critical.”

He points out that flights must keep pace with the pre-recorded commentary that passengers hear through their headsets–available in 12 languages.

Hopkin explained that weather minimums fall in line with VFR (visual flight rules) requirements for a controlled airspace. However, the area over Niagara Falls is restricted airspace, extending for a two-mile radius up to 3,500 feet above sea level. Only five tour companies are allowed within the restricted zone; three operate helicopters and two fly fixed-wing aircraft.

Taking aerial tourism to a new level: One of Niagara Helicopters’ outgoing Bell 407s hovers in the foreground, while a new Airbus Helicopters H130 rises above the heliport.

“Within that bubble, there is a required pattern and frequency,” continued Hopkin, who said the circuit presents some challenges on busy days. “We fly a 500-foot separation. Basically, it gives us a fairly strict flight pattern and that’s for safety. It also gives us the best view, and everybody is doing the same thing. If the weather isn’t cooperating, there are some alternate routes.”

Besides the classic Niagara Falls tour, the company also offers custom charters, aerial surveillance, film and photography shoots, and external load services. Local wineries are popular specialty charter destinations. Aerial weddings are also in demand, with Niagara Helicopters hosting nuptials at least once a week during the summer. Many years ago, Hafen also established a partnership with the Niagara Parks Police, offering ad hoc rescue services for injured hikers, for example, in need of a quick evacuation from the gorge.

CHANGE AND GROWTH

Since Hafen founded the sightseeing company 30 years ago, Niagara Helicopters–which now flies a total of 2,500 to 3,000 hours annually–has experienced steady growth. In December 2011, it was acquired by Helicopter Transport Services (Canada) Inc., or HTS, a longtime Ottawa-based helicopter operator. From modest beginnings 39 years ago, HTS has steadily increased its fleet, acquiring two fixed-wing support aircraft and more than 60 helicopters of all types. Missions vary from forestry and mining work to aerial firefighting, construction and heavy lift projects, air ambulance, and electronic news gathering, among others. But the acquisition of Niagara Helicopters marked the company’s first foray into flightseeing.

“HTS had never been in the tourism business and they initially had a lot of questions,” recounted Pierce. “The best part was that they really got it. I am so thankful that they took over, because they’ve challenged us in a way, but they’ve given us a bit more drive to succeed. And so we have. We’ve gone from a family-run type of business to more corporate standards, and it’s exactly what we needed to reinvigorate us to go to the next level.”

Hafen officially retired in 2013, after staying on for a year to facilitate the transition. Today, the company is run by Pierce, who is assisted by operations manager and chief pilot, Rene Huessy. Ten pilots (four full-time and six part-time) and 25 to 30 additional staff members deliver front desk, souvenir shop, photography department and ground crew services. Aircraft maintenance is provided by a three-person crew including director of maintenance Tony Dempsey, shop foreman Joe Giampa, and an AME co-op student.

FLEET TRANSITION

It was Pierce who got the call from HTS owner Luc Pilon at the end of March 2015, informing her that a deal had been signed to acquire four brand new H130 helicopters from Airbus Helicopters Canada, located just down the road in Fort Erie, Ont.

“The boss said we were looking for a June delivery, and I thought, ‘Well, at least we have more than a year to plan.’ Then he said no, June of this year. So in less than three months, we had to be ready to transition to a new aircraft type without a hitch!” said Pierce, who added that she hadn’t really slept since that call came in.

The Fenestron-enclosed tail rotor on the H130 allows for quieter operation and added safety on the ramp.





That type of turnaround is virtually unheard of in the helicopter industry. Instantly, the Niagara Helicopters team sprang into action. The plan was to have all paperwork and operational requirements in place early, so that the new helicopters could go to work as soon as they arrived.

“You don’t want to bring home your new Ferrari and leave it in the driveway,” Pierce said, explaining that the focus was on transitioning to the new aircraft ahead of time. “Our COO had us start working on the AOC (air operator certificate) for the H130s as soon as the order was placed.”

When all was said and done, Niagara Helicopters’ first H130–the demonstrator aircraft from Airbus Helicopters Canada–was brought online just a week and a half after it was delivered on May 15. (Two more were brought up from the OEM’s Grand Prairie, Texas, location, while the fourth was shipped over from France. After final prep in Fort Erie, these three machines were delivered to their new home during a celebratory ceremony on June 2.)

“Transport Canada was amazing; they really were very good with us,” said Pierce. “The paperwork was ready to go. It was just a matter of getting in that final flight. They helped us get it all ready to just before the finish line. Then, they came in on a Saturday to inspect the machine and by the following Wednesday it was flying–just in time for the first group of Rendez-vous Canada tour operators.”

Shop foreman Joe Giampa is looking forward to working on the new H130 fleet.





Manufacturer training for both pilots and maintenance technicians was included in the sale.

“Some pilots with previous ratings from the AStar series had an endorsement, and they just had to do training,” explained Hopkin. “Some of us needed an endorsement, so we needed to be trained to company standards.”

Either way, he said the H130 is a sweet ride, offering many creature comforts that were missing from the older Bell 407s.

“Air conditioning is a big plus, as well as the newer engine and avionics,” said Hopkin. “For me, it’s tough to compare the two machines directly. It’s like sailing a different sailboat. You know how to sail, and everything kind of looks the same, but a new boat may perform differently. The rotors on this aircraft spin in the opposite direction, so there are some different tendencies. But you have to spend time in it to figure out the differences.”

He added that noise testing last November revealed that the H130 is quieter than the Bell 407 (which had been fitted with noise reduction kits), due in part to the former’s Fenestron-enclosed tail rotor.

From a profitability factor, one key difference is that the new Airbus helicopters take seven passengers instead of the six that were previously accommodated on the Bell 407s.

What a view! With its cinema-style seating, panoramic view and nose- down attitude in flight, the H130 is perfectly suited for flightseeing.

According to Huessy, the company’s operations manager and chief pilot, the new helicopters offer additional benefits from a pilot’s perspective. “Safety, dual hydraulics, a two-and-a half channel FADEC (full authority digital engine control), and increased simplicity of operations are among the benefits of the H130,” he told Vertical.

Niagara Helicopters didn’t commission any special mods for the new H130s, other than the installation of FM radios for internal communications. Huessy explained that the company’s sightseeing route was adjusted slightly, so that the helicopters now approach the Falls head on–to take full advantage of the H130’s cinema-style seating, panoramic view and nose-down attitude when flying.

The H130 makes a positive impression on passengers, too. “I’ve been tipped so many times lately in the Airbus, and that was rare before,” laughed Huessy. “People love it. It has a limousine feeling to it.”

He said that working with Airbus Helicopters Canada has been a very positive experience. With pilot and maintenance training complete, only small operational details remain on the to-do list.

All H130 pilot training was provided by Airbus Helicopters Canada.

Pierce agreed wholeheartedly. “Airbus has been extremely supportive,” she said. “Their engineering department helped calm our nerves. We were transitioning to a new machine, and change is always hard. But they were very patient and understanding with us. Frankly, we thought the transition was going to be a total horror show, but everyone stepped up and helped us!”

She also gave credit to the Niagara Helicopters staff. “Our team pulled it together like you would not believe! For us to get these machines coming off the line and onto our flight line within hours is amazing work, from our head office down to our ground crew and everyone in between.”

Likewise, shop foreman Joe Giampa said the new fleet has necessitated some additional changes in the maintenance department–from standard to metric tools, for instance. He and director of maintenance Tony Dempsey completed three weeks of training in Texas, with three months of support being provided by Airbus Helicopters.

Bell 407s and Airbus Helicopters H130s crowd the Niagara Helicopters ramp on June 2, otherwise known as “fleet transition day.” The 407s didn’t stick around for long; owner HTS planned to repurpose them for bush flying.

“I’m looking forward to the challenge of working on the H130,” said Giampa, who has been maintaining the Bell 407 since 1999. He said that most heavy maintenance will be done in the winter slow season, usually with two aircraft online and two in the shop.

So, what’s next for Niagara Helicopters? Pierce told Vertical there are a lot of irons in the fire. “From my perspective, we’re really going into emerging markets and trying to expand the business. It’s very exciting. Now we just have to see how far we can push it, and I’m the type that will push it all the way! I want it to be that we actually need five, six or seven helicopters just to get the business done.”

As surely as tourists flock to the Falls, Niagara Helicopters’ fleet of four brightly-coloured H130s will be as busy as the Bell 407s before them. And as for that faithful fleet, HTS plans to upgrade the 407s before sending them to work in the bush later this summer."
Tomorrow an electric plane will fly the English Channel for the first time - Ars Technica,"Thu, 09 Jul 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vYXJzdGVjaG5pY2EuY29tL2NhcnMvMjAxNS8wNy90b21vcnJvdy10aGUtZmlyc3QtZWxlY3RyaWMtcGxhbmUtd2lsbC1mbHktYWNyb3NzLXRoZS1lbmdsaXNoLWNoYW5uZWwv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Updated @ 05:23 EDT: The e-Fan's flight across the English Channel was successful! Intriguingly, it appears that Hugues Duwal may have flown his tiny electric Cri Cri plane across the Channel last night, under the cover of darkness, beating Airbus to the title of ""first battery powered crossing of the English Channel."" We are investigating what exactly happened.

Original story

The English Channel isn't just the body of water that separates Great Britain from its European neighbors, it's also something of a yardstick in aviation. Need to prove that your new flying technology is ready for prime time? Flying the 20.6 miles (33.1km) from Calais to Dover will do that. The first person to reach Great Britain by means other than boat was Louis Blériot in 1909 [edit: in fact, Jean-Pierre Blanchard and John Jeffries crossed the Channel via balloon in 1785, Matthew Webb swam across in 1785, and in prehistory people walked across a land bridge when sea levels were lower]. More recently, Felix Baumgartner (of the Red Bull Stratos jump) used a carbon fiber wing to skydive across the strait in 2003. Now it's the electric airplane's turn.

Tomorrow, Airbus is going to attempt a Channel crossing with the e-Fan electric airplane, flying from Lydd, UK to Calais, France. The e-Fan is propelled by a pair of ducted fans, good for 80hp (60kW), powered by lithium polymer batteries stored in the plane's carbon fiber wings. But the flight is not without controversy. A rival crossing had been planned for earlier this week by the Slovenian plane builder Pipistrel and its Alpha Electro, a more conventional propeller plane powered by a 67hp (50kW) electric motor. Now Pipistrel is crying foul and blaming a conspiracy between Airbus and Siemens (who supply the electric motor in Pipistrel's Alpha-Electro).

Pipistrel obtained permission from the French civil aviation authority to cross the Channel on July 7, but its plans came to a halt just two days before the attempt. In a statement, Pipistrel's general manager Ivo Boscarol quoted a letter sent to the company by Siemens, which states, ""Our Motor in its current version is neither designed, nor tested, nor approved by us for a flight above water—we explicitly prohibit you to use or let anyone else use our Motor for any flight above water.""

Pipistrel's US dealer went further, telling FLYER that Airbus' bad sportsmanship was really to blame. ""Airbus managed to flex their muscle with Siemens who are supplying motors to Pipistrel and have the Pipistrel motor agreement immediately terminated,"" it said.

However, in a statement to Ars, Siemens told us that Pipistrel had not informed it in advance about the planned flight, nor was there any agreement between the two companies about the attempt. ""We can say that we always liked to drive forward the development of the electrical flying with Pipistrel and did that proactively. In spite of all commitment Siemens would never pull its own safety demands aside—because in the end, flight safety is absolutely crucial,"" company spokesman Florian Martini said. Siemens also told us that although it had helped Airbus characterize and verify its e-Fan motor, it had no direct involvement with the Airbus e-Fan program.

Airbus referred us to a statement released earlier this week in which the company denied any knowledge of the agreements between Siemens and Pipistrel. “We applaud all efforts to advance electric flight. But all that we do has to meet legal requirements and the highest safety standards. There cannot be any compromise on safety, and the authorities have been very stringent in their requests in order to be able to cross the Channel. Indeed, it would have been fun to cross the Channel together—but this is currently not possible under present circumstances,” the company said (via Twitter, no less). Airbus' statement also focused heavily on the safety measures the company had in place for tomorrow's flight, adding that ""[t]here is no comparable status known for any other player.""

Airbus electric plane and rival fly across English Channel - CBC.ca,"Fri, 10 Jul 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9uZXdzL3NjaWVuY2UvYWlyYnVzLWVsZWN0cmljLXBsYW5lLWFuZC1yaXZhbC1mbHktYWNyb3NzLWVuZ2xpc2gtY2hhbm5lbC0xLjMxNDcwMDXSASBodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYmMuY2EvYW1wLzEuMzE0NzAwNQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus may not be the first to accomplish the feat after it emerged that a stunt pilot flew across and back in a similar aircraft just hours before

A bid by aircraft giant Airbus to fly the first electric plane across the English Channel between Britain and France on Friday received a challenge when it emerged a stunt pilot had flown across and back in a similar aircraft, just hours before.

Amid fanfare, Airbus flew its E-fan plane from Lydd, England, to the French port of Calais, 74 kilometres away, on Friday morning. The plane operates exclusively on batteries and can reach top speeds of 220 km/h. Since there's no oil or water, the six-metre-long, 600-kilogram aircraft releases zero emissions.

Airbus initially claimed that their plane, piloted by Didier Esteyne, had become the first twin engine electric flight to cross the Channel.

But Hugues Duval, a French stunt pilot, emerged with a rival claim that he had flown from Calais to the British port of Dover and back just a few hours before on Thursday evening in a twin-engined, electric powered one seater Cri Cri plane.

Because he lacked authorization to take off from Calais, another fuel-driven plane towed his 100-kilogram Cricri for the start of the trip, he said. Then he flew autonomously back to Calais and landed safely, having covered a total distance of 52 km and reaching at top speed of 150 km/h.

Duval said his successful flight was a ""relief"" and an ""important moment"" after years of fine-tuning the plane and flying it over land.

Airbus initially queried his claim on the basis that his craft had been launched mid-air from a conventional aircraft, British media said.

Later, the company issued a statement to Reuters saying: ""We applaud the intrepid aviator Hugues Duval for his flight in his Cri Cri! He plays in his own category.""

Fuel-free future

Several companies in different countries are developing electric planes, in hopes of offering a fuel-free flight alternative for the future — and the battle to perform world ""firsts"" in electric planes is heating up as the technology becomes more durable.

Earlier this month, a solar-powered plane set the record for the longest non-stop solo flight as a Swiss aviator piloted it from Japan to Hawaii over five days.

Airbus's E-fan took its maiden voyage in March 2014, and has taken off 100 times since its latest flight at the Paris Air Show last month. Airbus aims to put it on the market in 2017, targeting sales at training facilities for entry-level pilots.

While the E-fan only seats two for now, the aircraft manufacturer is aiming bigger down the line. Chief technical officer Jean Botti said at the Paris Air Show last month, ""Our objective here is to make a hybrid-electric hundred seater for the future,"" calling it an ambition Airbus could realize in the next 15 years."

Franco-German merger to be the 'Airbus' of tank manufacturing - RFI English,"Thu, 30 Jul 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJmaS5mci9lbi9ldXJvcGUvMjAxNTA3MjktZnJhbmNvLWdlcm1hbi1hbGxpYW5jZS1sYW5kLW1pbGl0YXJ5LXdlYXBvbnJ50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"France-Germany

French and German tank producers have teamed up to stay competitive in the international market. The agreement signed between France's Nexter and Germany's KMW on Wednesday, comes after 10 years of negotiations between the companies CEOs.

""This joint enterprise aims to be the 'Airbus' of military land weaponry and will have an estimated sales revenue of 2 billion euros and a personnel of 6,000 people,"" Doctor Michael Brzoska, a researcher at the University of Hamburg, and expert on the German arms industry, told RFI's Gilda Di Carli.

This future entity, which does not yet have an official name because until now it was referred to as Newco, will produce armoured vehicles, ammunition, canons and other heavy artillery.

It will take fourth place in arms manufacturing behind the American General Dynamics, British BAE Systems, and American Oshkosh Defense.

However, the alliance has been widely criticized in Germany, which fears it will lose control of its ""made in Germany"" trademark.

Germany is the third largest arms export country in the world, but it is losing ground.

The government was pressured into adopting more restrictive arms export legislation during the 2013 federal elections, after it was criticized for exporting to countries in the Middle East.

Therefore, the merger with France will open the possibility of exporting to an otherwise sensitive market, Brzoska told RFI.

Germans are worried about the ""transfer of jobs to France,"" as the industry moves its facilities there.

The company's headquarters will be based in the Netherlands, a neutral country between France and Germany.

"CAV Aerospace fined £600,000 for death of worker crushed by Airbus parts - The Guardian","Fri, 31 Jul 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS91ay1uZXdzLzIwMTUvanVsLzMxL2Nhdi1hZXJvc3BhY2UtZmluZWQtNjAwMDAwLWRlYXRoLXdvcmtlci1jcnVzaGVkLWFpcmJ1cy1wYXJ0c9IBbGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS91ay1uZXdzLzIwMTUvanVsLzMxL2Nhdi1hZXJvc3BhY2UtZmluZWQtNjAwMDAwLWRlYXRoLXdvcmtlci1jcnVzaGVkLWFpcmJ1cy1wYXJ0cw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A British firm has been fined £600,000 for the “avoidable” death of a worker crushed by a dangerously high stack of Airbus parts.

Paul Bowers, 47, was killed on 26 January 2013 when a pile of metal “stringers”, delivered to the warehouse in Hangar 14 of Cambridge airport, toppled on to him.

The prosecution said CAV Aerospace Limited was responsible for ordering stock and maintaining health and safety at the warehouse run by a subsidiary.

The company, based in Consett, County Durham, denied charges of corporate manslaughter and breaching health and safety but was found guilty at the Old Bailey after a jury deliberated over four days.

The firm was fined £600,000 and £400,000 for the two offences to run concurrently and was ordered to pay £125,000 prosecution costs.

Following the verdict, Mr Bowers’ widow, Jose Bowers, spoke of the “unbearable sadness and insurmountable hurdles to carry on living without my husband and soulmate”.

She said in a statement: “This has taken from me an amazing and unique husband and our children have lost a very special father and stepfather. Paul was only 47 years old and we had a lifetime still to share with each other.”

The judge Gerald Gordon said: “It was only the tragic events causing the death of Mr Bowers that forced the company to face reality and deal with the problem.

“Mr Bowers’ death was avoidable. Instead, he lost his life and his family have been left devastated as has been movingly recorded by Mrs Bowers in a statement that I have read.”

He said there had been a failure from top to bottom of the company to recognise its responsibilities for the operation in Cambridge.

In setting the fine, he said that the company was substantial but recognised it was not making “vast amounts of money – at least at present”.

In mitigation, Prashant Popat QC expressed “deep regret and remorse on the part of the company for the incident, the death of Mr Bowers, and the enormous pain and loss of Mrs Bowers and her family and friends”.

He maintained that the firm had a good health and safety record in the past and had taken steps to ensure the incident could not happen again.

Until its closure in June last year, the subsidiary company CAV Cambridge Ltd was involved in milling extrusions of raw materials for conversion into parts known as “stringers and ribs” for use in the manufacture of aircraft by Airbus.

Mr Bowers died when an unstable stack of stringers collapsed as he made his way down a designated safe walkway, trapping him up to his chest and crushing him, prosecutor Duncan Atkinson had said.

The court was told that on-site management were not able to make any operational decisions and purchase of materials, storage and transport were all dealt with by the parent company.

However, CAV Aerospace Ltd chief executive, Owen McFarlane, had argued that the parent company was not responsible for Mr Bowers’ death or the way the parts were stacked at the warehouse."
Pipistrel Cancels Channel Flight After Siemens Pulls Support - AVweb,"Tue, 07 Jul 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF2d2ViLmNvbS9yZWNlbnQtdXBkYXRlcy9idXNpbmVzcy1taWxpdGFyeS9waXBpc3RyZWwtY2FuY2Vscy1jaGFubmVsLWZsaWdodC1hZnRlci1zaWVtZW5zLXB1bGxzLXN1cHBvcnQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Pipistrel cancelled plans to symbolically fly its Alpha Electro electric-powered training aircraft over the English Channel on Tuesday after Siemens, the supplier of the motor, issued a “demand not to fly over the water with their motor,” said Pipistrel CEO Ivo Boscarol in a statement (PDF). Boscarol said his company’s flight has been in the works since last October, with the company finally receiving approval from French authorities last week. Takeoff was planned for July 7 at 10 a.m. and shortly before that Siemens demanded the flight be stopped and seemed to suggest that using its motor to fly over water would violate its development contract with Pipistrel.

In a statement to AVweb (PDF), Siemens spokesman Florian Martini said Pipistrel didn’t tell Siemens it was planning the flight. Martini cites Siemens’ “safety demands” in the statement but did not directly address the question of why it ordered Pipistrel to not use its motor. The Slovenian company has developed the aircraft with the intent to certify itwith the Siemens motor and is in production.

Boscarol described the last-minute decision by Siemens “bizarre and incomprehensible.” He did, however, leave broad hints that he speculates the decision has something to do with Airbus’ plan to fly its E-fan electric airplane over the Channel on Friday, which would have made it the second electric airplane to make the crossing. Siemens is listed as a sponsor of that splashy event, which has been widely promoted by Airbus and the first such crossing of the Channel.

Siemens does not supply the motors for the E-fan but it does supply a lot of electrical components to Airbus. Boscarol hinted that he believed there was some connection there. “Unfortunately it was once again the interest of the capital that prevailed, and we lost the competition on the account of fair play — we could of course still perform the flight in the next three days, but we respect Siemens and their demand not to fly over the water with their motor,” he said. He also congratulated Airbus in advance for the scheduled Friday flight.

Airbus spokeswoman Christine Manderscheid didn’t directly address the question of whether it pressured Siemens to pull its support for the Pipistrel flight but instead chided Pipistrel for a perceived lack of preparation for the flight, the approval of the French authorities notwithstanding (PDF). She said that while Airbus didn’t know the specifics of Pipistrel’s flight, she was unaware of any other company that had taken the precautions Airbus is undertaking for its flight on Friday, including chase aircraft, air traffic control coordination and rescue boats. “There is no comparable status known for any other player. We are not aware of the test status and the agreements between Siemens and Pipistrel. But no serious player in aviation compromises on safety,” Airbus tweeted on Tuesday.

Airbus Helicopters is developing the EC135 T2+ light, twin-engine, rotary-wing military training helicopter for the Australian Defence Force’s (ADF) new Helicopter Aircrew Training System (HATS) programme.

Airbus Helicopters will deliver 15 EC135 T2+ military training helicopters to the Australian Army and Royal Australian Navy. The helicopters are designed to meet the training, technical and safety requirements of the future combat helicopter aircrew of the army and navy.

Maiden flight of the first EC135 T2+ military training helicopter took place at Airbus Helicopters’ production site in Donauwörth, Germany, in January 2015.

EC135T2+ is the latest variant of the EC135 multi-mission helicopter. The law enforcement-configured EC135T2+ helicopters are operational with the Massachusetts State Police and the National Police Air Service (NPAS) of West Yorkshire, UK.

Details of the HATS programme

MRH90 Multirole Helicopter, Australia The MRH90 helicopter is the Australian version of the 10t class NH90 multirole helicopter.

The JP 9000 Phase 7 HATS programme is a joint training scheme for the helicopter aircrew of Australian Army and Royal Australian Navy. Initial operating capability (IOC) of the project is scheduled for late-2018. The programme will also utilise a new flight-deck equipped, sea-going training vessel, and EC135 flight simulators.

The Australian Government approved the acquisition of EC135T2+ helicopters for the ADF in November 2014. Boeing Defence Australia (BDA) is the prime contractor for the HATS programme, while Thales Australia will provide three full-motion Reality H Full Flight Simulators (FFS) and associated equipment.

The EC135T2+ helicopters are expected to replace the Army’s Bell Helicopter 206 and the Navy’s AS350 helicopters.

Airbus examining open-cowl cockpit warning for A320neo - Flightglobal,"Mon, 27 Jul 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYWlyYnVzLWV4YW1pbmluZy1vcGVuLWNvd2wtY29ja3BpdC13YXJuaW5nLWZvci1hMzIwbmVvLzExNzc0MS5hcnRpY2xl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus is considering implementing a cockpit-warning system for the A320neo which would alert pilots if the engine fan-cowl doors are not secure.

The system would monitor the condition of the cowl locks and provide a warning to the crew if they are unlatched.

Airbus is looking at making such a system available from service entry of the re-engined aircraft type, which is scheduled to take place before the end of this year.

It would form part of a rethink on the problem of cowl-loss, particularly in the wake of the British Airways Airbus A319 event in May 2013 in which both engines shed their cowls on take-off. The right-hand engine’s fuel system was damaged, resulting in a fuel leak and fire.

UK investigators remarked that this was “by far the most serious” of the 38 cowl-loss incidents to date involving A320-family aircraft.

The airframer has previously resisted pressure from investigators to devise a warning system, citing complexity, weight and cost, and believing that the solution to unlatched cowls lay in simpler measures centred on the locks.

But such measures – including high-visibility paint on the latches and mechanisms designed to keep unlocked cowls slightly open – have not proven as effective as desired.

While the rate of incidents has halved since 2002, to around one in 2.4 million cycles, the proliferation of the A320 has resulted in twice as many cowl losses involving aircraft with these measures in place.

Airbus says it is adopting a multi-faceted approach to preventing the problem which will encompass design, operational and training aspects.

As well as the cockpit-warning system being considered for the A320neo, the airframer has been developing a new latch system for the current A320 models.

This involves a dedicated key to open the latch, to which is attached a red warning flag. The key cannot be removed while the latch is open, so the flag will dangle visibly below the engine nacelle if the cowl has been closed but not locked.

Airbus says it intends to make this latch a line-fit on production aircraft and the mechanism will be available as a retrofit from early 2016.

Mechanical solutions will be “incorporated in parallel” on the A320neo, the airframer adds. The manufacturer has also revised maintenance procedures to require an entry in the aircraft’s logbook when the cowls are open, which has to be closed off once the cowls have been shut and latched.

Investigators have attempted to determine the contributing elements to A320 cowl-loss events by analysing the circumstances of the recorded incidents.

Both engine types – the International Aero Engines V2500 and CFM International CFM56 – have been affected. But the UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch says there is a “marked correlation” between the cowl loss and the position, inboard or outboard, of the specific engine’s latches.

The V2500 cowl is latched on the right side of the engine while the CFM56 cowl is latched on the left.

An engine with its latch positioned on the inboard side was three times more likely to be the subject of a cowl loss than the engine mounted on the other wing, the analysis found.

More than two-thirds of the events examined for the analysis followed the opening of the cowl for checking or servicing of the oil level in the engine’s integrated drive generator.

Airbus has doubled the oil-level check interval, says the inquiry into the BA event, in order to reduce the number of occasions that the cowl needs to be opened. It has also introduced an optional viewing window on CFM56 engines enabling the generator’s oil level to be checked without opening the cowl at all.

Airbus Defence & Space Awards Contract For Electrical Ground Support Equipment From Antwerp Space

[SatNews] Antwerp Space has been awarded a contract for approximately 9 million euros by Airbus Defence & Space, Bremen, for the development of a new-generation, EGSE (Electrical Ground Support Equipment) to support the European Service Module (ESM) of the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV).

Airbus Defence & Space selected Antwerp Space to design, industrialize and manufacture the complete EGSE consisting of a series of power-related Special Check-Out Equipment (SCOE), based on the reference system developed by Airbus Defence & Space. Orion is a spacecraft developed by NASA for future manned missions to destinations beyond LEO, such as a lunar orbit, near-Earth objects and Mars. The EGSE comprises a service module—the ESM—that will provide essential support functions to the crew module and its four astronauts. These include propulsion and attitude control, power generation and control, thermal control, as well as consumable resources (water, oxygen and nitrogen).

Antwerp Space will supply the system in a total of four different configurations which are to be used for assembly, integration and verification (AIV) purposes in various industrial facilities across Europe (e.g., in Bremen, Germany and Les Mureaux, France) and in the U.S. states of Ohio, Colorado, Florida and New Mexico. Antwerp space has already delivered one configuration consisting of a number of core unit testers for use in Europe.

The ESM is being funded by the European Space Agency and developed under the responsibility of Airbus DS GmbH in Bremen. It represents the in-kind contribution made by Europe to cover its share of utilization of the International Space Station.

Oliver Juckenhoefel, in charge of MPCV-ESM at Airbus Defence & Space, said, ""Antwerp Space has, for many years, been an established leader in the assembly of the EGSE used by spacecraft integrators for on-ground verification of their hardware before the actual launch. We are confident that using the latest technological evolution by Antwerp Space will guarantee smooth and efficient testing and delivery of the ESM by Airbus Defence & Space to ESA and NASA.""

Oliver Salisch, Managing Director of Antwerp Space, said, ""The award of this contract is the recognition of Antwerp Space's expertise in the development and integration of complex ground tests systems."""
Airbus working with Air India to extend life of its oldest A320s | Mint - Mint,"Fri, 10 Jul 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVtaW50LmNvbS9Db21wYW5pZXMvaERLbUc3ZDB1MUtDWlgzYXlFTjR6Ti9BaXJidXMtd29ya2luZy13aXRoLUFpci1JbmRpYS10by1leHRlbmQtbGlmZS1vZi1pdHMtb2xkZXN0LUEuaHRtbNIBhQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5saXZlbWludC5jb20vQ29tcGFuaWVzL2hES21HN2QwdTFLQ1pYM2F5RU40ek4vQWlyYnVzLXdvcmtpbmctd2l0aC1BaXItSW5kaWEtdG8tZXh0ZW5kLWxpZmUtb2YtaXRzLW9sZGVzdC1BLmh0bWw_ZmFjZXQ9YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"New Delhi/Toulouse: Airbus Group SE said it’s working to extend the life of Air India Ltd.’s narrow-body A320 fleet as the state-owned carrier grapples with competition from low-cost rivals operating much younger aircraft.

Air India, which has 62 A320s, the 17 oldest averaging 18 1/2 years, is tapping an Airbus programme introduced in 2008 that allows airlines to operate the single-aisle jets for an extra 10 or 20 years, according to the European manufacturer.

Airbus will subject sections of the aircraft to fatigue tests to determine how long they can operate, with permitted flight hours or cycles increased accordingly, spokesman Justin Dubon said in an e-mailed response to questions from Bloomberg.

State-owned Air India is seeking to keep its jetliners in service for longer as private carriers led by Indigo pile on new planes to meet the country’s growing appetite for air travel. The move aims to address a short-term fleet requirement and is in no sense an airworthiness issue, Dubon said.

New Delhi-based Air India is also discussing new-plane purchases with manufacturers, though surging demand for the latest models means near-term delivery slots aren’t available.

Talks with Airbus focus on the purchase of at least 14 re- engined A320neos worth $1.5 billion at list prices, with current-version planes to be leased as a stop-gap, a person with knowledge of the plans said in May. The airline was also looking at Boeing Co.’s rival 737 Max, another person said in January.

IndiGo last year pledged to buy 250 A320neo planes worth $25.7 billion in what was set to be Airbus’s biggest order by number of aircraft. The deal wasn’t firmed up and has lapsed, though talks are ongoing, the discount airline said recently.

IndiGo, which says it’s building toward a 1,000-jet fleet, ordered 180 A320s worth $15 billion as recently as 2011 and has purchase rights for 100 more. Bloomberg
