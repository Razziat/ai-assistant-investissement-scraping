New battle breaks out between Airbus and Boeing-in advertising - Leeham News and Analysis,"Tue, 27 Nov 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxMi8xMS8yNy9uZXctYmF0dGxlLWJyZWFrcy1vdXQtYmV0d2Vlbi1haXJidXMtYW5kLWJvZWluZy1pbi1hZHZlcnRpc2luZy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A new battle has broken out between Airbus and Boeing, this time with a sharp (and perhaps unprecedented) advertisement by Airbus accusing Boeing of outright lying.

(Click to enlarge.)

We don’t remember ever seeing this direct assault by one of the Big Two OEMs on the other. We certainly recall advertisements in the debate over two engines (Boeing 777) vs four (A340)–but to call the competitor a liar like this? It’s new territory, at least in print.

Airbus has been calling Boeing a liar in conferences for its representations for years.

As regular readers of this column know, we’ve been especially skeptical of Boeing claims, based on conversations we’ve had with airlines that have analyzed the aircraft involved, and in some cases those which operate both fleet types. The neutral arbiters–these customers–universally tell us Boeing claims are exaggerated and that the costs between the two OEM’s narrow-body aircraft are about equal. The costs between the Boeing 747-8I and the A380 are also exaggerated by Boeing, these companies tell us.

Furthermore, we’ve cast doubt on Boeing’s reliance of US DOT Form 41 data (which in itself is distorted and unreliable) and a study in Europe that looks at data from 2006-2009, data that is clearly out of date.

At the same time, we’ve taken Airbus to task over its parameters in concluding the A330-300 is a better airplane economically than the forthcoming 787-9.

At ISTAT Europe in September, an official from Virgin Atlantic publicly challenged Boeing’s Randy Tinseth over economic data Tinseth presented comparing Boeing and Airbus aircraft. Tinseth, according to those present, merely responded that he stood by the numbers.

Bloomberg has this story on the controversy. Reuters has this story.

In a way, the entire fight is silly. No airline or lessor will buy Airbus or Boeing aircraft based on these sort of claims. The airlines run their own economic analysis and the lessors are more concerned about lease rates and residual values. The entire conference and advertising effort is for consumption by uninformed journalists, financiers and aviation geeks. Those who actually understand the nuances tend to dismiss the claims of either manufacturer (as we do) and run our own analysis or rely on the airlines and lessors for impartial information.

The market has spoken. Airbus currently has sold about 1,400-1,500 A320neos to Boeing’s 1,000 737 MAXes. Airbus also, in recent years, has sold more current-generation A320s than Boeing has sold 737NGs. For the Very Large Aircraft, Airbus has an 86% market share of passenger airplanes.

These statistics tell more than anything Airbus or Boeing manipulate.

Airbus turns a Boeing plane into Pinocchio in ad designed to debunk the rival’s claims - Skift Travel News,"Wed, 28 Nov 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vc2tpZnQuY29tLzIwMTIvMTEvMjgvYWlyYnVzLWdldHMtYmFjay1hdC1ib2VpbmctZm9yLWFkLWNsYWltcy1ieS10dXJuaW5nLWl0cy1haXJjcmFmdC1pbnRvLWEtbHlpbmctcGlub2NjaGlvL9IBeWh0dHBzOi8vc2tpZnQuY29tLzIwMTIvMTEvMjgvYWlyYnVzLWdldHMtYmFjay1hdC1ib2VpbmctZm9yLWFkLWNsYWltcy1ieS10dXJuaW5nLWl0cy1haXJjcmFmdC1pbnRvLWEtbHlpbmctcGlub2NjaGlvL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It’s rare to see the companies so blatantly go toe-to-toe over their global competition, but neither ad touches on what’s most important to customers – seat room and comfort.

Airbus and Boeing, the world’s largest manufacturers of commercial passenger aircraft, have clashed over the performance of their newest planes.

This week Airbus accused its rival of making exaggerated claims about the fuel efficiency of the most recent variants of both its 737 and 747.

An advertisement taken out by the Toulouse-based firm in Aviation Week on Monday included a photograph of a Boeing aircraft with a protruding nose – a reference to the fictional character Pinocchio.

It states: “Our competition, it seems, has begun to exaggerate the capabilities of its ‘latest technology’ 737 and 747 aircraft, both of which are derivatives of 1960s designs…The [Airbus] A320neo is the fastest-selling aircraft in the history of civil aviation, with more than 1,500 orders in less than two years, and the A380 has captured 80 per cent share in the very large passenger aircraft market. No wonder they’re sleepless in Seattle.”

According to John Leahy, Airbus sales chief, it was published in response to an advert by Boeing claiming its planes held a massive advantage.

“They are blatantly misrepresenting the truth by orders of magnitude,” Mr Leahy told Reuters. “What is going on is just over the top.”

Marc Birtel, a spokesman for Boeing, defended its own advertising. He said: “We believe in – and history has shown – the superior performance of our products and services. We stand behind our performance claims.”

With high oil prices and dwindling profits putting pressure on airlines, both manufacturers recently announced new fuel-efficient variants of their most popular models.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9975169897079468}",positive,0.9975169897079468,1

The ad, running in several aviation trade magazines, including Aviation Week, features an image of a Boeing jet with its nose stretched like Pinocchio, with the headline “Why is our competitor stretching the truth?”

It says Boeing is “sleepless in Seattle,” calling the new 737 Max and 747 models “derivatives of 1960s designs.”

Airbus sales chief John Leahy tells Reuters the European aircraft maker that the Pinocchio theme is in response to recent Boeing ads claiming a massive advantage for Boeing aircraft over Airbus models.

“They are blatantly misrepresenting the truth by orders of magnitude,” Leahy told Reuters. “What is going on is just over the top.”

“We believe in – and history has shown – the superior performance of our products and services. We stand behind our performance claims,” said Boeing Commercial Airplanes spokesman Marc Birtel.

“Ultimately, our customers will decide based on their experience and analysis relative to their needs,” he told Reuters.

"Launching Airplanes from Catapults, Part 3: Airbus' Eco-Climb Concept - Core77.com","Wed, 21 Nov 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvcmU3Ny5jb20vcG9zdHMvMjM4ODcvTGF1bmNoaW5nLUFpcnBsYW5lcy1mcm9tLUNhdGFwdWx0cy1QYXJ0LTMtQWlyYnVzLUVjby1DbGltYi1Db25jZXB00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"While many eyes in the commercial airline industry were undoubtedly watching the U.S. Navy's EMALS (Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System) testing, it is Airbus that has first stepped forward suggesting commercial applications. Earlier this year the manufacturer announced ""Smarter Skies,"" a series of concepts and promotional videos revealing where they want to be by 2050.

One component in their plan is for an EMALS-like system, though they never directly refer to military subcontractor General Atomics' invention; instead the company calls it ""Eco-Climb,"" writing that ""Aircraft could be manoeuvred onto a track system and accelerated using either electro-magnetic motors built into the track or an inductive circuit within the aircraft itself."" Starting at 0:52 in the promo video below, you can see they're envisioning a much wider platform than what EMALS uses, this one scaled up to accommodate a commercial jetliner:

In the previous entry we looked at the advantages of EMALS over steam-driven catapults; but what's the benefit of having an electromagnetically-propelled takeoff, rather than a conventional one, for a commercial airliner?

Listen to the changing sound of engines during flight and it's obvious: an aircraft draws on its power reserves more during takeoff than at any other time... However, this takeoff power only is required for a very brief portion of the total flight. Once cruising in the sky overhead, an aircraft doesn't need as much to maintain altitude. So why not source the energy required at takeoff from an innovation installed on the ground?

An assisted takeoff - using some form of propelled acceleration - would mean aircraft could be lighter, with smaller engines consuming less fuel...A continuous ""eco-climb"" would further cut noise and CO2 emissions....

With less time and distance required for takeoff, the runways could be shortened by up to 1/3rd, minimising land use, and enabling airport capacity to increase or new micro-airports to emerge. These could be located near city centres - or the mega-cities that will become a reality - with space becoming even more of a premium.

It's been more than a century since the Wright Brothers needed a catapult to get their contraption to fly. They would undoubtedly be astonished to see us circling back to the same concept, and Airbus envisions a twist Wilbur and Orville might not have signed off on: ""The ultimate, albeit very extreme, concept,"" the company writes, ""is to have a system that not only launches but also captures the aircraft, removing the need for landing gear."" Gee, what could go wrong?","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.5334390997886658}",positive,0.5334390997886658,1
IN FOCUS: Boeing vs Airbus in China | News | Flight Global - Flightglobal,"Thu, 08 Nov 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vaW4tZm9jdXMtYm9laW5nLXZzLWFpcmJ1cy1pbi1jaGluYS8xMDc3NTAuYXJ0aWNsZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"For Boeing and Airbus, China is a market they both know that they cannot afford to lose, or even loosen their grip on. For both heavyweights, China is set to be the second-largest market outside the USA. Flightglobal's Ascend Online database reveals Chinese carriers operate 846 and 830 Boeing and Airbus aircraft respectively. As China develops, numbers will only increase.

Boeing forecasts China will need 5,260 commercial jets worth $670 billion in the next 20 years, where 75% will be for fleet growth instead of replacement. During the next 10 years, one out of every six aircraft that roll off Boeing's production lines will be delivered in China.

Boeing Last year, Air China received its first 737-800 with a Sky Interior

Airbus, meanwhile, expects China to require 3,832 new passenger and freighter aircraft in the next 20 years - 2,520 narrowbodies, 1,084 widebodies and 228 very large aircraft. Right now, more than 20% of all newly-assembled Airbus aircraft are destined for China.

The giants will not have the market all to themselves, and both agree that home-grown manufacturer Comac will take a slice of the coveted Chinese pie. ""We take it as a reality that the duopoly is over and that it's going to be a market of three OEMs,"" says Boeing China president Marc Allen.

""The arrival of a third manufacturer will scramble the field. The market share will shift; there is no doubt about it.""

The good news, analysts say, is there is room for all three. ""Even with the C919 in production, the Chinese market will absorb significant numbers of western narrowbodies for years to come,"" says Raymond Jaworowski, senior aerospace analyst at Forecast International.

Rookie Comac has already scored 330 orders for its narrowbody, mostly from Chinese airlines and leasing companies. Paul Sheridan, Ascend's head of consultancy in Asia, forecasts the C919 will have up to 80 deliveries a year by 2021, most of which will be for China.

SCORING ORDERS

The Ascend Online database shows that between 2007 and 2011, Airbus and Boeing delivered an average of 73 and 60 aircraft a year respectively to China.

""These numbers should grow over the next 10 years, but it shows that the C919 has the potential to achieve a similar market in China as the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320,"" says Sheridan. ""Boeing and Airbus will want to ensure that this does not spread to any other countries.""

With the C919 on the horizon, Boeing and Airbus are battling to convince Chinese carriers and lessors to continue on with them to their re-engined Max and Neo.

Airbus scored first in August with its inaugural Chinese Neo order, when ICBC Leasing inked an agreement for 20 A320neos and 30 A320s. Fabrice Brégier, Airbus chief executive, expects more orders to roll in before the year ends, and is targeting to grow market share in China to above 50%. He claims the Neo ""is much better than its competitors"".

""The C919 will find its way into the Chinese market - this is clear,"" he says. ""But the Chinese airlines have been using the A320 and the 737, which are good aircraft. They will also possibly move to the Neo and the Max. This will require Comac to develop a competitive, reliable aircraft and once they do, they will have a premium on the Chinese market.""

Allen is quick to point out that although no Chinese Max sales have been closed, it does not mean discussions are not ongoing. ""It's going to be a dogfight all the way through,"" he says. ""We're in the midst of a dynamic point because of the Neo and Max. What's going to happen in the next couple of years is, you'll see airlines' interest in the Max becoming an overwhelming part of the story line. You'll see a lot of Chinese airlines being very early in the Max delivery line up.""

Boeing is also confident its 787 and 777-300ER will take a leadership position in China's widebody market. It expects more orders for the 787 to come as the aircraft starts flying in the country. China Southern Airlines is on track to take delivery of its first Dreamliner this year, assures Allen.

SIZING UP

Airbus, meanwhile, is certain the A320 and A330 will continue to serve the market well. Sales for its A350 and A320neo should also pick up when China announces its 13th five-year plan. ""Because of airport constraints, for example, between Beijing and Shanghai, there will be a move from single- to double-aisle aircraft,"" says Laurence Barron, president of Airbus China.

When asked about the Airbus A380, which has so far only garnered one order for five aircraft from China Southern, Brégier says: ""We expect the Chinese market to be a huge A380 market, probably the biggest in the world. But this will take time.""

Boeing disagrees, saying the superjumbo is ""too large"" to have a strong presence in many markets. ""Ultimately, the A380 is a plane that fits just a very small number of routes. So as our 747-8s arrive, we think we'll have a better-sized airplane at the jumbo level,"" says Allen.

With regard to A320 sales, Airbus believes its decision to set up an A320 final assembly line in Tianjin, its first outside Europe, has certainly accelerated its growth in China.

Airbus In July, China Aircraft Leasing Company committed to 36 current-generation A320s

""When we started in 2005, there were questions of whether it would work. After seven years, now we see the strategy really paying off,"" says Brégier, adding that its market share in China has grown by about 20% since it set up shop in Tianjin.

Airbus has also negotiated an extension of its Tianjin assembly line, signing a framework agreement with state-owned airframer AVIC and the Tianjin Free Trade Zone to continue manufacturing A320s in Tianjin beyond the previously-contracted 2016.

Details of the 10-year contract extension will be firmed by mid-2013. Brégier also confirms the Tianjin line will produce the A320neo - after its Hamburg and Toulouse facilities. Airbus has 430 employees on the Tianjin line and 1,200 in China.

Airbus's China efforts, however, have been rendered ""more complex"" as a result of the EU's Emissions Trading System (ETS), says Brégier. Approval for $12 billion of Airbus widebody orders remains suspended as China continues retaliation against the ETS, although narrowbody sales for domestic and regional use have not been affected.

Boeing has no immediate plans to start an assembly line in China. Rather, to maintain its dominant position, it will focus on innovation to ensure it has an efficient aircraft in every class.

Boeing has about 2,000 staff in China right now - from those in its corporate office to those at Boeing Tianjin Composites. China builds various parts including horizontal stabilizers, vertical fins, the aft tail section, doors and rudders for several Boeing aircraft including the 787.

The US airframer is also collaborating with Comac by supporting research to improve aviation and industry fuel efficiency, while reducing its environmental footprint.

""We believe it's essential and unavoidable that we both compete and collaborate to create technology together to make each of us more successful,"" says Boeing's Allen.

""We hope that by doing so, as airplane growth matures, Comac will steal a share from Airbus. That's the perfect outcome.""

Passengers reported hearing a loud bang and seeing flames coming from the engine of the Airbus A380 after it took off from Sydney on Sunday night. The plane landed without incident and passengers were rebooked on other flights. There were no injuries.

John Fothergill of Auckland, New Zealand, told Australia's News Limited that he saw flames shooting out of the engine and felt the plane shake.

""I thought it could have been lightning but then we saw flames come out of the engine,"" he said. ""The whole interior of the A380 lit up.""

Passenger Ross Clarke told Australia's Seven Network that he heard a loud bang.

""We were told by the pilot that something had gone wrong on the starboard engine, number three engine,"" he said.

An Emirates spokeswoman, speaking on the airline's customary condition of anonymity, denied there were flames in the engine.

""There was no fire, no flames, no smoke,"" she said. ""There may have been a loud bang.""

Investigators were looking into the cause of the engine fault, she said.

It is not the first time the new flagship of the Airbus fleet has been hit by in-flight problems.

Europe's air safety authority ordered checks in February on the entire global fleet of Airbus A380 superjumbo jets for cracks on parts inside the wings -- extending a previous order for nearly a third of the planes to be inspected.

Before that, a Rolls-Royce engine on a Qantas A380 burst into flames during flight in November 2010, prompting the engine maker to a series of checks on the Trent 900 engines involved.

The Emirates A380 which turned around on Monday uses different engines, made by a Rolls-Royce's competitor, a joint venture by General Electric and Pratt & Whitney.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9437539577484131}",neutral,0.9437539577484131,0
Airbus owner takes €200m hit from A380 wing repair bill - The Guardian,"Thu, 08 Nov 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDEyL25vdi8wOC9hMzgwLWNyYWNrcy1yZXBhaXItMjAwbS1ldXJvc9IBTmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDEyL25vdi8wOC9hMzgwLWNyYWNrcy1yZXBhaXItMjAwbS1ldXJvcw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus owner EADS has taken a €200m (£160m) hit from costs related to repairing cracks inside the wings of A380 super-jumbos.

The Franco-German aerospace and defence group said earnings before interest and tax, including the A380 costs, were up 82% at €1.6bn for the nine months to 30 September. However, it continues to incur costs from the discovery of stress cracks inside the wings of A380 jets. EADS said it had spent €200m so far this year on repairing the fault, which has required safety checks for all A380s in service. The total expenditure on the A380 wings this year will be €260m, EADS said. ""Airbus still targets 30 A380 deliveries for 2012 which means the total charge for the A380 wing rib feet is still expected to reach around €260m for the full year,"" said EADS. Airbus has delivered 89 A380s to airlines. Dubai-based Emirates is the largest customer, having received 26 A380s so far.

The most serious cracks have been located on brackets that attach the A380's wing ribs – the oval-shaped frames that run along the width of the wing – to the wing's metal skin. The cracks were caused by the stress generated when the brackets were fastened to the skin during the manufacturing process. The impact was exacerbated by the flexing of the wings during flight. The A380 wings were designed and built in Britain, at facilities in Filton outside Bristol and Broughton in north Wales. The overall repair bill includes covering the cost of safety checks and replacing cracked parts with new fittings if a fault is found. If serious cracks are discovered, engineers will cut out the part and replace it.

In its first results statement since the failure of a proposed €35bn merger with BAE Systems, Britain's largest defence contractor, EADS added that the construction programme for the next big Airbus project – the A350 long-long haul jet – ""remains challenging"". Under the current schedule the first A350, a test aircraft, will take to the air in mid-2013 with the first delivery to Qatar taking place in the second half of 2014.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9874336123466492}",neutral,0.9874336123466492,0
FAA to Airbus: Install rudder warning after fatal crash - USA TODAY,"Mon, 19 Nov 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS90cmF2ZWwvZmxpZ2h0cy8yMDEyLzExLzE5L2FpcmJ1cy1ydWRkZXIvMTcwNzQyMS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"FAA to Airbus: Install rudder warning after fatal crash

The Federal Aviation Administration has ordered aircraft maker Airbus to update the rudder systems on 215 of its planes because of a fatal 2001 crash, but some industry officials question the remedy, and safety experts wonder why it took so long.

The FAA rule was finalized almost exactly 11 years after the fiery crash of American Airlines flight 587 in Queens, N.Y., on Nov. 12, 2001. The crash occurred soon after take-off from New York's JFK airport, when the Airbus A300-605R's tail came apart. All 260 on the plane were killed, as were five people on the ground.

The National Transportation Safety Board found that the plane's tail fin -- the vertical stabilizer -- tore off because the pilot put too much stress on the rudder by flipping it from side to side as he fishtailed in the wake of another plane. A half-dozen other flights have suffered problems with rudder movement causing high stress on tails, but without catastrophic results.

The board blamed the crash on the pilot's ""unnecessary and excessive rudder"" movement, which is controlled by foot pedals. But American pilots were trained at the time to use the rudder to deal with wake turbulence, so training changed across the industry in the years after the crash.

Now, the FAA has worked with the counterparts at the European Aviation Safety Agency and Airbus to install a flashing light and sound in the cockpit to warn against excessive rudder movement on A300 and A310 planes.

The FAA estimates the update will cost $72,720 to $107,720 per plane. Another option the FAA approved, which would cost $198,500 per plane, is to install equipment limiting movement of the rudder pedal.

Airbus has warned there's ""no realistic"" way to design and install the pedal equipment within the four years that FAA has ordered. But Airbus won FAA certification of its warning system in March.

""Airbus already has service bulletins available for airplane operators to incorporate this new warning system into their fleet,"" the FAA said.

Airbus says the goal of the warnings is to stop a pilot from making the wrong movements rather than trying to minimize the consequences. A spokeswoman denies that cost came first in making decisions about safety.

""We believe it is more appropriate to stop wrong inputs rather than counter them mechanically,"" says the spokeswoman, Mary Anne Greczyn.

NTSB Chairman Deborah Hersman has said ""a warning light alone will not rectify the unsafe condition."" She also says ""it is unfortunate"" that no design changes are available for airlines for more than a decade.

Wil Angelley, a former six-year Navy pilot and now a Dallas aviation lawyer, compares the pedal device to the anti-lock brakes in a car that prevent a driver from stomping down too hard. Airlines will have to decide whether to install that as the safest course or the warning light at one-third the cost, he says.

""What's a little exasperating for me is that it took 11 years,"" Angelley says.

The FAA says development of the warning system followed years of other actions from the agency, its European counterparts and the industry. Other steps included improving flight manuals, increasing training and updating FAA rules about misconceptions with rudder use.

Two of the plane's bigger customers, delivery companies FedEx and UPS, each plan to comply with the rule by installing warning lights, but they disagreed about the need for the rule.

""FedEx continues to believe that proper rudder control in response to wake turbulence is most effectively addressed through pilot education and training,"" says Maury Donahue, a spokeswoman for the company with 106 of the targeted planes.

UPS, which has 53 of the planes, initially expressed concern about the cost of installing pedal equipment. But the company says installing a flashing light and its software could be done within the four years that the FAA allows.

""UPS Airlines places the utmost value on safety and takes regulatory compliance very seriously,"" says spokesman Mike Mangeot.

The Air Line Pilots Association also supported the rule, focusing on better rudder training for pilots while continuing to evaluate pedal sensitivity.

The plane wasn't blamed in the crash because the NTSB found stress on the tail was almost twice as much as it was certified to endure. Airbus had warned that ""only a small amount of rudder is needed"" and that ""too much rudder applied too quickly or held too long"" could result in ""structural failure.""

""The airplane was put in a position well beyond what it was designed and required by the FAA to do,"" says John Cox, a former commercial pilot who is an aviation-safety expert as president of Safety Operating Systems. ""This is not a first-time event. It is not specific to Airbus.""

Cox says, however, that he would like to see FAA safety rules developed faster.

The NTSB investigation of the American crash found three other incidents involving A300-600 planes and three involving A310 aircraft in which excessive stress on the tails was blamed on use of the rudder pedal. The board singled out two that featured enough rudder movement to break the tail:

-- One passenger was seriously injured in May 1997, when an American Airlines flight stalled while banking to land at Miami airport. The crew ultimately stabilized the flight.

--Nobody was injured in February 1991, when a German Interflug flight aborted a landing in Moscow because of a blocked runway, then stalled repeatedly as it circled before landing safely.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.884417712688446}",negative,0.884417712688446,-1

Globally, by 2031 some 28,200 new aircraft valued at $4 trillion will be required to satisfy future robust market demand.

With GDP currently growing above the world average, socio-economic indicators predict Latin America’s middle class will double between 2012 and 2031. Additionally, Latin America has become the second most urbanised region worldwide after North America, and by 2031, 10 out of the 92 mega-cities with more than 10,000 daily long-haul passengers will be in the region.

As a result of this region’s dynamic economic growth, Latin America’s air traffic will rise 5.3 percent per year over the next 20 years, well above the world average of 4.7 percent. Benefiting from this, the region’s airlines will grow their own traffic by almost 6 percent per year, the second highest growth globally, only exceeded by those airlines based in the Middle East. Additionally, Latin American airlines’ market share on long-haul routes increased by 8 percent between 2005 and 2011, to reach 21 percent today, showing that they have significant development potential for intercontinental networks.

Increased aircraft demand is also leading Latin American airlines to ordering larger aircraft. Between 2000 and 2012, average aircraft seat capacity increased by more than 13 percent, while the average age of Latin America’s fleet in service decreased below the world average to 10 years of age.

“The Latin American market has become smarter, seeking out highly-efficient, cost-effective and versatile aircraft,” said Rafael Alonso, Executive Vice President of Airbus for Latin America and the Caribbean. “Airbus is perfectly positioned to serve the market’s requirements and future aviation demand with its A320, A330 and A350 Families, as well as the A380.”

Another important trend in Latin America is the rise of low cost carriers throughout the region. Brazil and Mexico have become leaders of the low-cost-carrier segment in the region, with the two countries combined contributing to 95 percent of the market.

With more than 700 aircraft sold and a backlog of almost 350, over 450 Airbus aircraft are in operation throughout Latin America and the Caribbean. In the last 10 years, Airbus has tripled its in-service fleet, while delivering more than 60 percent of all aircraft operating in the region.

Airbus to raise A330 take-off weight and fuel capacity - Flightglobal,"Thu, 29 Nov 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYWlyYnVzLXRvLXJhaXNlLWEzMzAtdGFrZS1vZmYtd2VpZ2h0LWFuZC1mdWVsLWNhcGFjaXR5LzEwODAzNC5hcnRpY2xl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus is further hiking the maximum take-off weight of the A330, raising it to 242t, and will offer a higher fuel capacity option for the larger A330-300 variant.

The airframer had previously disclosed plans to increase the twinjet's take-off weight to 240t.

Airbus's latest enhancements will extend the range of the A330-300 by 500nm (930km) over the 235t model, and by 350nm for the 238t A330-200 at full passenger load.

It will give operators of the -300 the option of activating the centre wing fuel tank, a standard feature on the longer-range -200 but one which has remained unused on the larger aircraft.

This will increase the -300's fuel capacity from 97,500 litres to more than 139,000 litres. The modification will include tank inerting.

Airbus hopes the improvements will extend the A330-300's range to 6,100nm by 2015, enabling it to perform westbound flights from south-east Asia to Europe.

A330 programme chief Patrick Piedrafita says the airframer has ""taken it as our duty"" to maximise the capability of the twinjet.

Airbus took gross orders for 76 of the type over the first 10 months of this year, and delivered 80 - including six freighters - over the same period.

""We are currently delivering more A330s per month than ever before, and this is set to continue,"" adds Piedrafita.

Airbus's formal technical documentation for the A330 lists 21 weight variants for both the -200 and -300. The new weight increase and fuel-capacity improvements will become available to carriers in 2015.

The airframer is aiming to achieve the enhancements by refining the A330's aerodynamics - shortening flap-track fairings and reshaping inner slats - and capitalising on the aircraft's load-alleviation function. The aircraft will also undergo partial wing and fuselage reinforcement.

Airbus expects to reduce the -300's fuel burn by 2%, half of which will derive from the aerodynamic tweaks and the rest from higher engine efficiency.

No customer for the 242t variant has been disclosed but lessor CIT had signed up to take the 240t version shortly after it was unveiled in July this year.

Airbus reveals new A330 jet that’s able to fly further and carry more cargo - Skift Travel News,"Fri, 30 Nov 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vc2tpZnQuY29tLzIwMTIvMTEvMzAvYWlyYnVzLXJldmVhbHMtc3BpZmZ5LW5ldy1hMzMwLWpldC10aGF0cy1hYmxlLXRvLWZseS1mdXJ0aGVyLWFuZC1jYXJyeS1tb3JlLWNhcmdvL9IBc2h0dHBzOi8vc2tpZnQuY29tLzIwMTIvMTEvMzAvYWlyYnVzLXJldmVhbHMtc3BpZmZ5LW5ldy1hMzMwLWpldC10aGF0cy1hYmxlLXRvLWZseS1mdXJ0aGVyLWFuZC1jYXJyeS1tb3JlLWNhcmdvL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has improved the A330-300 and A330-200 even further by providing operators both with a 242 metric tonne maximum take-off weight (MTOW) capability and, for the larger A330-300, an increased fuel capacity option. These enhancements build on the capability announced earlier this year for an increased 240 tonne MTOW, and will be available for operators in 2015.

The new take-off weight capability combined with the fuel capacity increase enables operators of these new A330-300s to carry additional payload on longer missions. Overall, the full payload range now increases by around 500nm over today’s 235 tonne A330-300, and by around 350nm over today’s 238 tonne A330-200.

The A330-300’s optional fuel capacity increase will be achieved by activating the centre wing tank for the first time on this model. The centre tank and its associated systems have always been present as standard on its longer-range sibling – the A330-200. The additional fuel capacity for the A330-300 allows operators to fly new longer distance routes, such as direct flights between South-East Asia and Europe. For example, it will permit westbound direct flights such as Kuala Lumpur to Frankfurt or Paris, with the ability to carry additional cargo on the eastbound return flight.

Head of the A330 programme Patrick Piedrafita commented: “The A330 is already a highly efficient and reliable airliner and we have taken it as our duty to maximise this even further, along with range and payload increases.” He added: “We are currently delivering more A330s per month than ever before, and this is set to continue, especially given the ongoing improvements we are introducing to the airframe, cabin interior, and engines.”","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999979734420776}",positive,0.9999979734420776,1
Virgin America slows expansion plans and cuts Airbus order by two thirds - Skift Travel News,"Fri, 16 Nov 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vc2tpZnQuY29tLzIwMTIvMTEvMTYvdmlyZ2luLWFtZXJpY2Etc2xvd3MtZXhwYW5zaW9uLXBsYW5zLWFuZC1jdXRzLWFpcmJ1cy1vcmRlci1ieS10d28tdGhpcmRzL9IBamh0dHBzOi8vc2tpZnQuY29tLzIwMTIvMTEvMTYvdmlyZ2luLWFtZXJpY2Etc2xvd3MtZXhwYW5zaW9uLXBsYW5zLWFuZC1jdXRzLWFpcmJ1cy1vcmRlci1ieS10d28tdGhpcmRzL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Both Virgin and the consumers and experts that keep giving the airlines awards are bemoaning the airlines' challenges, but even with it's troubles Virgin has led other airlines to copy some of its more user-centric designs and products.

Virgin America Inc., the low-fare airline partly owned by Richard Branson, will cut an order for Airbus SAS jets by two-thirds and delay the delivery dates of newer models as it curbs expansion plans.

The carrier will now take delivery of 10 Airbus A320 planes, down from its original order for 30, in 2015 and 2016, according to a statement today. Those 10 aircraft are the last of the original batch, as the first 20 were to be handed over to the Burlingame, California-based airline from 2013 through 2015.

Virgin America also deferred the delivery range for 30 A320neo-model jets to 2020 through 2022 from the original dates of 2016 through 2019. The moves followed last month’s disclosure of a capacity reduction from January through March, the first cut in available seats since the airline started flying in 2007.

“During the summer we started looking at whether it still made sense to grow as fast as we were planning on, given fuel prices and what I’ll say is a modest economic growth climate in the U.S.,” Chief Executive Officer David Cush said in a telephone interview. “You don’t invest the capital if you can’t earn an adequate return.” There were no financial penalties associated with the cancellation, he said.

Virgin America projected annual growth in available seat miles to be a mid-single-digit percentage for the “next several years,” down from the 28 percent rate of the past three years.

The airline now flies 52 single-aisle A320s. The A320neo model is Airbus’s latest variant of the plane and is due to enter service in late 2015. Carriers typically buy at a discount to list prices, which are $88.3 million for the A320 and $96.7 million for the neo, according to Airbus.

Wider loss

Virgin America also reported that its third-quarter net loss widened to $12.6 million from $3.3 million a year earlier. Revenue jumped 27 percent to $368 million. The closely held company ended the period with $75 million in unrestricted cash.

“That’s a sign of rapid expansion, and you can expand yourself into oblivion,” George Hamlin, president of Hamlin Transportation Consulting in Fairfax, Virginia, said in an interview. “If you’ve been around for five years and you’re still losing money at a time when a lot of other carriers are reporting improved results, it suggests you might not be able to make that up in volume.”

Capacity trimmed

Capacity will be trimmed by about 3 percent in the first quarter to cut costs, Cush told employees in an October memo in which he also offered voluntary short-term leave to employees.

A surplus of employees took the voluntary leave offer for the first quarter and will return to work in April, Cush said in the interview. He declined to specify the number of employees.

The company sought voluntary reductions through short-term leave and flex scheduling because of an anticipated drop in traffic in the first three months of 2013, Cush wrote earlier in a letter to employees. The company has about 2,400 employees, according to today’s statement.

Virgin America will eliminate some flights that are traditionally unprofitable during the first three months of the year such as overnight and midweek flights, and will restore that service in April when demand typically improves, Cush said.

Large markets

The airline doesn’t plan to drop any cities, though it will reduce the number of departures in cities including Boston, Cush said in the interview. Virgin America flies to cities including San Francisco, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, New York’s John F. Kennedy airport and Boston.

“They went into large markets because of the traffic, but that also meant there were numerous other participants,” Hamlin said. “They had gotten to the party very late.”

Looking ahead to 2013, the airline expects capacity to be unchanged to slightly larger than in 2012, Cush said. Virgin America will end this year with capacity up 28 percent from 2011.

“The simple math out of that is we think we’re big enough right now for the time being,” Cush said. “The rapid growth we’ve had for the last few years is going to come to a stop.”

Virgin America may need to pursue a “major restructuring” to survive in the long term, according to Hunter Keay, an analyst at Wolfe Trahan & Co. in New York. Virgin America has competition on every route, such as San Francisco to New York. Each of the 11 other airlines Keay follows has a monopoly on at least 25 percent of their routes.

‘Network missteps’

“A combination of cash burn and network missteps into highly trafficked markets” is hurting Virgin America, Keay said in an October telephone interview. “They had an assumption that consumers would choose product quality over price and convenience, and network carriers responded with force.”

In an Oct. 17 note to clients, the analyst questioned Virgin America’s ability to survive and said its failure would benefit Alaska Air Group Inc. and JetBlue Airways Corp. the most.

Cush disagreed with Keay’s report, specifically the idea of a flawed business model and poor performance compared with Virgin America’s established competitors, he said.

Keay “came to the wrong conclusions,” Cush said. “We will prove that over time.”

Up to 6 November, Boeing has reported 1,009 net new orders, driven mainly by demand for its narrow body 737 aircraft, while Airbus received 382 net new orders at the end of September.

Out of the total orders, 990 were for 737s, with 938 of those being for the upgraded MAX model.

The 737 MAX builds on the strengths of twin-engine narrow-body 737 aeroplane and is scheduled to be delivered to US-based Southwest Airlines in 2017.

As the demand for more fuel-efficient aircraft is increasing, the Chicago-based manufacturer is boosting production and revamping its existing variants.



As well as planning to redesign its 777 variant, the Boeing is set to expand the Dreamliner range with a proposed larger 787-10 model and is holding talks with potential customers, reports the Wall Street Journal.

The 787-10 would be the third Dreamliner variant and is expected to accommodate up to 323 passengers, nearly 13% more than the 787-9 version. Deliveries to the first customer are scheduled for 2014.

""As the demand for more fuel-efficient aircraft is increasing, the Chicago-based manufacturer is boosting production and revamping its existing variants.""

Expected to compete with the medium-range A330-300 of Airbus, the proposed third model was approved by the company’s commercial-airplane division on 12 October 2012 as a part of a final assessment before placing it to the board for approval.

Earlier, talks were held with customers to identify their requirements for the 787-10 model, but now discussions are focused primarily on securing deals.

The Dreamliner is the first aeroplane model to be built mainly of lighter weight plastic composites instead of heavier aluminum. The first 787-8 version debuted in late-2011 following more than three years of production delays and supplier issues.

In October, the company said that work on the 787-9 model was underway; the aircraft can accommodate 16% more passengers than the first version.

To date, Boeing has received 838 orders for the existing 787 variants.

To date, the carrier has placed orders for 29 Airbus single aisle aircraft, with 11 having been delivered, including a backlog of 12 A321neo and six sharklet-equipped A321ceo.

TransAsia Airways chairman Vincent Lin said the A321neo plane fitted the company’s strategy to strengthen its footprint in the domestic and regional markets and offer a solution to its fleet requirements.

""With its wide cabin and outstanding fuel performance, the A321neo will bring new levels of comfort to our passengers, whilst minimising our environmental footprint,"" Lin added.

""The combination of low fuel burn and extended flying range from Taipei will position the airline well to meet its expansion plans across the fast-growing Asian market.""

Powered by Pratt and Whitney’s PW1100G engines, the A321neo is the largest variant in the A320neo line. According to Airbus, it offers 15% fuel savings and a double digit reduction in NOx emissions.



Airbus COO – customers John Leahy said that with the latest version of the A321, TransAsia Airways fleet would have the most fuel-efficient aircraft in the 185-200 seat segment.

""The combination of low fuel burn and extended flying range from Taipei will position the airline well to meet its expansion plans across the fast-growing Asian market,"" Leahy added.

Airbus has received 8,600 orders for the A320 aircraft to date, with 5,200 having been delivered to some 374 customers and operators worldwide.

Meanwhile, the Taiwanese carrier also placed a separate order for two wide-body A330-300s and the first airplane is expected to be delivered later this year.

Hawker's demise hits Airbus | News | Flight Global - Flightglobal,"Tue, 13 Nov 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vaGF3a2Vycy1kZW1pc2UtaGl0cy1haXJidXMvMTA3ODE3LmFydGljbGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Hawker Beechcraft's decision to axe its struggling Hawker business jet brand has taken a bite out of Airbus, which supplied fuselages and wing sections from its factory in Broughton in the UK.

Parent EADS says it tried and failed to help find a buyer for Hawker Beechcraft, and was forced to take a third-quarter charge of €76 million ($97 million) against lost sales. However, no Airbus jobs have been put at risk, as staff working on Hawker aerostructures will be redeployed as Airbus ramps up A320 production and gets ready to begin serial production of its in-development A350 twinjet. And the charge against Hawker had little impact on a solid third-quarter and nine-month financial performance. Airbus commercial Q3 revenue gained 22% to €8.14 billion and earnings before interest and taxes more than trebled to €268 million.

Hawker Beechcraft Staff previously working on HBC business jets will be redeployed

For the nine months to end-September, 403 aircraft were delivered for revenue recognition plus another two to operating lease, taking revenue up 17% to more than €24.7 billion and EBIT up 167% to €816 million.

For the full year, Airbus expects to deliver about 580 aircraft - including the 30 A380s it has been targeting - and will retain its book-to-build ratio above one, with anticipated orders in the 600-650 range.

EADS as a whole is continuing a trend to increased profitability: net income more than doubled to €903 million, or 2.4% of €37.3 billion revenue, up from just 1.9% a year ago.

The Eurocopter and Astrium divisions posted good revenue and profit growth, but the Cassidian defence unit slipped further behind, losing ground in the profit column. Addressing market analysts, EADS chief financial officer Harald Wilhelm readily admitted that last month's abandonment, owing to German government resistance, of the proposed merger with BAE Systems, ended an opportunity to achieve ""in one go"" EADS's long-standing Vision 2020 strategic objective of matching its defence and civil businesses.

However, he also quashed speculation that the merger failure had kicked off a major strategic review at EADS. The idea of a 50-50 civil-defence split is ""not dogma"", he stressed. There will be no major merger and acquisition activity in the foreseeable future, he adds.

Comparing the 747-8I and the A380 after the advertising battle commenced - Leeham News and Analysis,"Wed, 28 Nov 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxMi8xMS8yOC9jb21wYXJpbmctdGhlLTc0Ny04aS1hbmQtdGhlLWEzODAtYWZ0ZXItdGhlLWFkdmVydGlzaW5nLWJhdHRsZS1jb21tZW5jZWQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Notation: Aeroturbopower weighs in on the controversy with his usual data-driven analysis.

With the commencement of the advertising battle between Boeing and Airbus, it is useful to make some additional comparisons prepared by AirInsight.

Here is the offending Boeing ad that set off the ad wars. It’s a two-page spread and sorry, we couldn’t scan it into one advert. Click each image to englarge.

From AirInsight:

The 747-8I and A380 are quite different aircraft, and while some view them as direct competitors, they are more properly lone players in different segments of the VLA market. Nonetheless, an airline will likely evaluate both aircraft as it maps its growth strategy, and two carriers, Lufthansa and Korean Air, have chosen to fly both aircraft types for different route structures. Each of those airlines have indicated that the 747-8I fills a gap between their 300 seat aircraft and 525 seat A380 aircraft, and will deploy the aircraft appropriately to traffic demand and traffic growth in different markets.

While the two aircraft are quite different, they are still compared to each other and both aircraft mile and seat mile economics. Of course, in comparing these aircraft, seating configurations make quite a difference, and the two aircraft manufacturers utilize markedly different assumptions in that regard. Boeing indicates that standard 3-class seating configuration for its 747-8I is 467 seats, but Lufthansa is currently using 362 in its aircraft, compared with 334 in a 747-400, and 526 for its A380. Each of these layouts is oriented heavily towards premium class seating, an essential element for many carriers these days.

The Boeing layout for the 747-8I shows 467 seats configured in a layout that has somewhat tight seat pitch in business class and does not accommodate today’s sleeper seats. The Boeing configuration offers 26 first class seats at 61” pitch, 89 business class seats at 39” pitch, and 352 economy seats at 32” pitch. However, those pitch standards, from the 1980s, are more equivalent to business, premium economy and economy rather than first, business and economy. Boeing also computes a 555 seat capacity for A380, using similar pitch, except for 48” rather than 39” in business for their seating standard.

Airbus, by contrast, utilizes more realistic three-class standards of 81” first class, 61” business class for sleeper seats, and 32” for economy passengers, yielding a capacity of 525 on the A380. If these standards, which are more reflective of today’s capacity, are applied to the 747-8I, the passenger count would drop to 405 seats.

Each says their airplane is better than the other in various metrics, but in our view there is a fair amount of apples and orange comparison going on. While both aircraft fall within the VLA market segment, in reality they serve somewhat different market segments—and at one time, Boeing conceded the point.

The A380 nominally carries 525 passengers in three classes. The 747-8I nominally carries 467 passengers in three classes, 60 fewer. Traffic requirements mean the airplanes will serve somewhat different airline missions. There is room for both airplanes, although we believe the need for the 748-8I is in our view less than for the larger A380.

An analogy may be drawn to the single-aisle market segment. The A321 seats 189 in two classes and the 737-700 seats 125, a difference of 64 seats. The two aircraft serve different missions. Comparing these two in fuel burn, seat-mile cost and other metrics makes as little sense as comparing the differently-sized VLAs. If the 747-8I and the A380 were the same size, the comparisons would have meaning. But they aren’t and they don’t.

The actual seating configuration of the A380 and the 747-8I varies widely from manufacturer advertisements. Lufthansa configured its A380 with 526 seats vs. Airbus’ assumed 525. Lufthansa, at this writing the only operator of the 747-8I, configured its 747-8I with fewer than 400 seats (technically taking it out of the VLA category) vs 467 assumed by Boeing. Korean Air Lines configured its A380 with 405 seats, barely within the VLA market. It has not yet received the 747-8I it has on order.

The Airbus A380, the highest capacity passenger aircraft in the world, takes advantage of this feature to generate the lowest seat-mile economics in the class. However, cost per aircraft mile is lower with the 747-8I. In examining between these two aircraft, the key determinant will be traffic – if you can fill the A380, it will provide higher profits, but if you cannot, the 747-8I could be a viable alternative.

Developing 3D Printed Aerospace Applications - 3D Printing Industry,"Thu, 01 Nov 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vM2RwcmludGluZ2luZHVzdHJ5LmNvbS9uZXdzL2RldmVsb3BpbmctM2QtcHJpbnRlZC1hZXJvc3BhY2UtYXBwbGljYXRpb25zLTI1NDQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus, a leading international aircraft manufacturer has been bullish about its future plans around using 3D printing as part of their manufacturing processes with a goal of making the entire aircraft from ground up with giant 3D printers by 2050. In the interim, they focus on 3D printing as a manufacturing process for individual components that results in lighter and stronger aircrafts.

The recent announcement from Airbus about its partnership with the South African aviation company Aerosud and the local R&D implementation organisation CSIR is a further building block in this strategy for the 3D printed future of aviation. The three companies have now signed an agreement whereby they will collaboratively explore the application of titanium powder-based additive layer manufacturing for constructing large scale complex components. CSIR serves as the ‘in-country’ laser capability for South African industry, backed by its state-of-the-art suite of modern laser technologies and applications. Experienced scientific and engineering staff provide a critical core of laser technology knowledge and expertise benefiting local industry.

According to Dale King at Airbus, CSIR and Aerosud are currently the only organisations in the world working on high-speed, large-volume additive layer manufacturing. “That is why we have decided to forge a partnership with them,” commented King. “We came to South Africa for this project because we believe the country has the necessary skills and competencies in the field of ALM.”

Assuming that the partnership between the three companies is successful in its implementation, the project outcomes will flow into Airbus’ supply chain where the parts, once tested and evaluated, will be assembled in Airbus’ aircrafts.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9996523857116699}",positive,0.9996523857116699,1
Airbus offers Jat twelve jets - EX-YU Aviation News,"Tue, 06 Nov 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4eXVhdmlhdGlvbi5jb20vMjAxMi8xMS9haXJidXMtb2ZmZXJzLWphdC10d2VsdmUtamV0cy5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Solution to Jat’s Airbus saga on the horizon?

A high ranking delegation from Airbus will begin talks with the Serbian government today in an attempt to sell twelve of its jets to the Serbian national carrier Jat Airways. According to media reports the deal is too good to be refused by the Serbian government. The European plane manufacturer is offering twelve jets from the A320 family. The potential purchase of the aircraft would end Jat’s aircraft shortage and substantially modernise its fleet.In 1998, the Yugoslav government ordered eight Airbus A319s for its national carrier, a highly unfavourable and politically motivated deal worth 560 million dollars at the time. Despite a deposit of 23.5 million dollars, the aircraft were never delivered. Airbus is now offering Jat to pay up another 20 million dollars, after which it will begin delivering the aircraft. The Serbian government is then expected to give state guarantees for Jat to take out a 140 million euro loan with which it will finance its new Airbus fleet. The deal includes the training of at least five groups of cabin crew lasting up to 41 days, engine selection as well as spare parts. Earlier this year, Jat’s maintenance division, Tehnika, and Airbus announced the creation of a joint regional training centre in Belgrade. Jat Tehnika is expected to be granted necessary permits next month to maintain Airbus jets.Jat Airways currently has a fleet of ten Boeing 737-300s and four ATR72s. The oldest aircraft in its fleet is Europe’s first passenger 737-300, which arrived in Belgrade on August 8, 1985. However, its fleet’s flying time is still relatively low compared to its age, since most of Jat’s aircraft were grounded during the 1990s. Officially, Jat has operated Airbus jets in its long history. In 2005, during the airline’s biggest industrial action in history, the carrier scrambled to lease aircraft, flight crew and aircraft mechanics. Through the one month strike, several Airbus aircraft operated on behalf of Jat Airways.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999457597732544}",neutral,0.9999457597732544,0
Libya's Afriqiyah Airways Beefs up its Airbus Fleet – The North Africa Post - The North Africa Post,"Thu, 29 Nov 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vbm9ydGhhZnJpY2Fwb3N0LmNvbS8xNTc1LWxpYnlhcy1hZnJpcWl5YWgtYWlyd2F5cy1iZWVmcy11cC1pdHMtYWlyYnVzLWZsZWV0Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Libya’s Afriqiyah Airways has ordered four more Airbus A350-900s planes worth over $1.4 billion as the company prepares its international and regional comeback with competitive services. The carrier has also converted its original order for six Airbus A350-800s into six of the larger A350-900 model bringing up its total order to 10 jets.

Afriqiyah Airline, which operates eleven aircrafts of the airbus family, looks forward to reinforcing and overhauling its fleet ahead of launching new routes and destinations in the United States, the Middle East and Asia. These new orders show the company unshaking resolve and strong determination to resume activities with high hopes in the future despite difficult international juncture.

The state-owned Afriqiyah airways was founded in 2001. It started its operations the same year with leased Aircrafts. During the Paris Air Show in 2006 the Libyan carrier signed a contract with Airbus Industries for the purchase of 21 aircrafts.

The A350-900 is the cornerstone member of Airbus’ all-new A350 XWB family, which is tailored to meet airlines’ future market requirements in medium-to-long haul operations. This jetliner can accommodate over 310 passengers and has the same optimized cabin cross-section as the other A350 XWB versions (A350-800 and A350-1000) – which ensures maximum comfort for both passengers and crew while guaranteeing operators optimum safety.

Over 70 pc of its weight-efficient airframe is made from advanced materials that combine composites (53 pc), titanium and advanced aluminum alloys. The innovative carbon fiber reinforced plastic fuselage results in lower fuel burn as well as easier maintenance. With this new fuselage – along with the latest systems and engines, as well as an advanced wing optimized for Mach 0.85 cruise speed – the A350-900 beats its competitors, offering operators a 25 pc lower fuel burn, 25 pc lower operating costs, and 25 pc lower CO2 emissions, besides additional seats for greater revenue.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9004803895950317}",positive,0.9004803895950317,1

Excitement is mounting on both sides of the Channel as all the elements come together for the first high-composite content Airbus jet

Just a few years ago, using more than 50% composite to make the airframe for a wide-body jet would have seemed improbable. Yet this is the proportion being used in the new Airbus A350 XWB, with the opening of the final assembly line for the aircraft in Toulouse late last month representing a seminal moment in the development of composites for aerospace applications.

Airbus claims that the high composite content will deliver huge operator benefits: the A350’s carbon fibre-reinforced plastic fuselage will result in lower fuel burn than existing similar-sized aircraft, while maintenance will prove far easier.

The success of the A350 XWB is crucial to the future fortunes of Airbus. The aircraft will go head-to-head with the Boeing 787 Dreamliner which, after launch delays related to weight and parts supply problems, is being produced at two separate plants and continues to sell well. Boeing has now delivered 30 of its 787s and will increase final assembly production at Everett in Washington and North Charleston in South Carolina to a total of five aircraft per month by the end of 2013.

The programmes act as two high-profile showcases for Boeing and Airbus’s composites capabilities. The challenge for Airbus is to move towards a drumbeat of production in a smoother manner than Boeing managed. Indeed, slowly but surely, the A350 XWB is coming to life, with the first two aircraft – the static version and the first flyable model, MSN1 – at different stages of final assembly.

The static aircraft, which will be used solely for ground tests, has nearly completed assembly, with a full fuselage, two wings and the vertical tailplane joined. The aircraft will be transferred to the static test hangar in Toulouse, where tests will start next spring.

The first flyable A350 XWB (MSN1) is also progressing well, with the fuselage already joined. The wing and vertical and horizontal tailplane for MSN1 are inside the final assembly facility and will be joined to the fuselage this month.

It’s not just Airbus that will be hoping that the A350 XWB takes off – the programme is also an important one for the UK aerospace supply chain. The wings for the aircraft are made at Airbus’s Broughton plant in North Wales, while dozens of other systems, sub-assemblies and components are designed and built by engineering firms located across the UK. So there’s a lot riding on the success of this composite newcomer.

That’s particularly the case at GKN Aerospace, the tier-one supplier that bought the Filton manufacturing facility from Airbus several years ago. GKN has invested a total of £170 million at Filton, which will be the base for the manufacture of the aircraft’s rear wing spar and assembly of the fixed trailing edge.

In the production of the wing spar, GKN has developed an automated fibre-placement process that uses a robotic head to lay down 16 tows of material at a rate of 7-10kg of material an hour. The spars could not be made using traditional hand lay-up processes for two reasons: speed and consistency of quality. Hand lay-up is achieved at a rate of only around 1kg of material per hour – just one-eighth of the speed of the automated fibre-placement process – and cannot achieve the production consistency and fine tolerances required for the structure.

In the assembly of the fixed trailing edge, GKN has also created an innovative, fully automated “moving line” assembly process where automated guided vehicles move A350 XWB wing structures through dedicated workstations that carry out complex tasks including five-axis machining, robotic drilling and laser scanning. GKN then delivers the complete fixed trailing edge/rear spar to the Airbus facility at Broughton.

GKN is also manufacturing structures for the Trent XWB engine. The engine thrust struts are manufactured in high-temperature nickel alloy, with chemical milling used to create a lighter, stronger structure. The blisks will also be manufactured using chemical machining, to produce a component to fine tolerances and an excellent surface finish. Meanwhile, the inner core fairings incorporate proprietary all-welded titanium honeycomb technology, which gives excellent sound suppression along with a lighter, more durable and more easily repaired structure.

UK firms continue down the supply chain. PFW Aerospace, in Farnborough, is supplying fuel and bleed air tubing systems and PEEK polymer-based pipe systems for cargo drainage, while Eaton, in Hampshire, is providing the main engine fuel pump and engine build-up sub-systems for the Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engine.

So it’s all eyes on Toulouse as Airbus builds towards the first flight of the A350 XWB. Indeed, on both sides of the Channel, it’s hard to think of a more anticipated maiden journey in modern aviation history.

Countdown to final assembly

The A350 XWB final assembly line in Toulouse will employ around 1,500 people who will build up to 10 aircraft a month from 2018. It covers an area equivalent to almost 300 tennis courts. The roof is partially covered in 22,000m2 of photovoltaic solar panelling, which produces more than half the building’s energy needs.

At full production, the Toulouse plant will make three versions of the plane, each capable of flying non-stop for up to 8,500nm/15,580km. In a typical three-class configuration, the A350-800 will be equipped with 270 seats, while the A350-900 and the A350-1000 will offer 314 and 350 seats, respectively.

Accent on aerospace structures

Composite and metallic aerospace structures will come under the spotlight at an event in Birmingham this month.

Aero Engineering 2012 – incorporating the Composite Engineering show – will take place at the NEC on 7-8 November. The event brings together the UK’s production, design, test and inspection supply chains. It’s a chance for smaller firms to meet with global OEMs, primes and tier-one producers spanning structures, propulsion systems, components and sub-assemblies.

There’s also a strong line-up in the open forum technical sessions, where speakers will discuss topics including 3D printing of metals and nanoparticles in surface coatings.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999145269393921}",positive,0.9999145269393921,1

"PHOTOS: business class on Airbus' A350, the Boeing 787 rival - Executive Traveller","Mon, 12 Nov 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4ZWN1dGl2ZXRyYXZlbGxlci5jb20vcGhvdG9zLWJ1c2luZXNzLWNsYXNzLW9uLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzUwLXRoZS1ib2VpbmctNzg3LXJpdmFs0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Boeing's 787 Dreamliner has been getting plenty of press lately, but not far behind is Airbus' own next-generation jet, the A350.

Many airlines serving Australia have orders for the A350 XWB (which stands for extra-widebody), including the big three Middle Eastern carriers (Emirates, Qatar and Etihad), Air China, Cathay Pacific, Singapore Airlines, Thai Airways and United.

So it's a fair bet you'll have the chance to jet around on one before the decade is out, with first delivery to the first customers in 2014.

What the A350 means for you

Airbus plans for the twinjet A350 to join the mighty A380 superjumbo as its two long-range options for airlines.

Cleverly, the A350 slots in as a potential competitor against Boeing's popular 777 as well as the 787 Dreamliner. The A350 is also wider than the 787, which means more seats on board.

But the A350 still has that twin-engine efficiency, two decades of improvements over Airbus' older A330s, and the lightness of composite materials instead of metal.

That may sound a bit geeky, but the long and the short of it for the business traveller is this: more comfortable cabins with less dehydrating air, better lighting and bigger windows, on new direct routes that become cost-effective for airlines with more efficient aircraft.

Many of those are the same reasons why business travellers will love the Boeing 787, of course.

Airbus has put together some mockups of what you'll find on board, and the trends that are shown in the planemaker's video are great news for business travellers.

Welcome aboard...

As you board your A350, the first thing you'll probably notice is the scuplted overhead lighting and spacious feel.

While lighting might seem to be a small thing, it's surprising how much more pleasant a modern aircraft with colour and dimmer switches is when compared with an older ""off or on"" interior lighting option.

The first business class outfit that Airbus is showing off bears a striking resemblance to the staggered business class cabin favoured by Gulf carriers, which you'll find upstairs on Emirates' A380 or on Etihad's A340.

The Middle Eastern airline esthetic is not entirely surprising given that launch customer Qatar has ordered 80 planes, Emirates has 70 on the books (plus 50 options) and Etihad is picking up 25.

Middle Eastern airlines pushed for the A350 to open up ""long and thin"" routes to their megahubs. These are routes that don't have enough passenger demand for a larger or less-efficient plane (like an Airbus A380 or even a Boeing 777) but can profitably be served by a smaller jet.

We think seat layouts like these are among the best business class options in the sky: everyone has direct access to the aisle, a fully flat bed, useful side table space, heaps of elbow room and space to keep your work bag by your feet for easy access.

If you're thinking that the interior of the A350 looks rather like the upstairs business class cabin on an A380 (especially that staggered seating on Emirates' superjumbos), we'd agree.

Obviously, it's beneficial to airlines and Airbus if there are commonalities between the two types of plane that form Airbus' future long-distance package.

Interestingly, there's no first class shots of the A350, just like the 787 is likely to have business class as its top offering. Numerous airlines have declared their intentions -- if they're keeping first class at all -- to restrict it to their biggest planes on only the most demanding routes.

The second staggered business class cabin that Airbus brings us feels more like a Japanese or European airline: ANA, Swiss and Finnair all have cabins similar to this on current or planned planes.

Boeing's narrower 787 will take one fewer seat across, but the ANA long-haul 787 business class cabin still feels similar.

No matter where you're sitting, the larger windows will mean more natural light in the cabin on day flights, which is a real plus.

We think this is a great advantage for modern planes -- the A380 started the trend, and the 787 has continued it while adding electronic window tinting instead of windowshades.

These novel technologies are aimed towards improving performance (reduced fuel burn and emissions) and reducing the risk and cost in the aircraft design and certification process.

‘Current aircraft designs have arguably been optimised as far as possible,’ said Professor Cooper. ‘Any major step changes in performance are likely to be achieved through radical new configurations, such as joined wings or blended wing bodies, integrated with advanced technologies in aerodynamics, structures, propulsion and multi-disciplinary design optimisation of the entire aircraft design process.’

Gulf Air Restructures Fleet To Save $2.5bn - Gulf Business,"Mon, 12 Nov 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vZ3VsZmJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9ndWxmLWFpci1yZXN0cnVjdHVyZXMtZmxlZXQtdG8tc2F2ZS01Ym4v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Bahrain’s Gulf Air has signed amendment agreements with aircraft manufacturers Boeing ad Airbus to realign its original orders in light of tough economic conditions.

The state-owned airline was pushed to renegotiate its order book in light of high fuel prices and a slump in air traffic as well as the regional unrest over the last fifteen months resulting in the forced suspension of a number of destinations.

The revised agreement with Airbus permits the conversion of the existing wide-body obligation into eight A320ceo Family aircraft, all of which will have be delivered by year-end, plus up to sixteen A320neo Family aircraft.

Gulf Air, which flew around six million passengers last year, had previously ordered seven Airbus A320s and 20 Airbus A330s.

The revised Boeing agreement, allows the airline to reduce its wide-body 787s Dreamliner requirement to 12 – 16 aircraft depending on Gulf Air’s strategic requirements, down from 24 as previously agreed. These aircraft are scheduled for delivery towards the end of the decade and will replace Gulf Air’s current wide-body fleet.

Saj Ahmad, chief analyst at StrategicAero Research said: “Gulf Air is clearly cutting back its exposure to capital spending and it is a blow to Airbus that 20 A330-300s have been swapped for lower value A320s, while the majority of the 787 order remains intact.

“The real issue now is how does Gulf Air expand with no new wide-body airplanes over the coming years to better compete with other GCC rivals?

“Unless they lease jets, they’re stuck. Gulf Air will have to demonstrate some sort of tangible turnaround and they will have to start strengthening their financials or they’ll forever play catch up.”

Gulf Air CEO Samer Majali said: “The revised orders reduce our long-term financial liability of approximately $5 billion by over 50 per cent and the remaining liability more effectively meets Gulf Air’s future fleet replacement and growth requirement.”

Last month Bahrain’s king Hamad Bin Eisa Al Khalifa issued a decree to inject additional capital of 400 million dinars ($1.1 billion) into its national airline.

Gulf Air’s need for additional support was the result of recent unprecedented developments at the local, regional and global levels, including soaring fuel prices in 2011, Majali told Bahrain reporters.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.8620136976242065}",neutral,0.8620136976242065,0
