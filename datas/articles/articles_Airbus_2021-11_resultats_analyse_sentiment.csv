Airbus and its partners demonstrate how sharing the skies can save airlines fuel and reduce CO2 emissions - Airbus,"Tue, 09 Nov 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMS0xMS1haXJidXMtYW5kLWl0cy1wYXJ0bmVycy1kZW1vbnN0cmF0ZS1ob3ctc2hhcmluZy10aGUtc2tpZXMtY2FuLXNhdmXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Toulouse/Montreal, 09 November 2021 – Airbus has performed the first long-haul demonstration of formation flight in general air traffic (GAT) regulated transatlantic airspace with two A350 aircraft flying at three kilometers apart from Toulouse, France to Montreal, Canada. The aircraft were greeted at Montreal-Trudeau International Airport. Over 6 tons of CO2 emissions were saved on the trip, confirming the potential for more than a 5% fuel saving on long-haul flights.

The “final demonstration” test flight took place on 9 November 2021 involving two A350 test aircraft, MSN1 and MSN59, the former as the leader aircraft and the latter as the follower. This was made possible with flight control systems developed by Airbus which position the follower aircraft safely in the wake updraft of the leader aircraft allowing it to reduce engine thrust and reduce fuel consumption. A similar principle can be observed with large migrating birds such as geese, which fly together in a distinct V-shaped formation.

Sabine Klauke, Chief Technical Officer at Airbus declared: “This demonstration flightis a concrete example of our commitment to making our decarbonisation roadmap a reality. It also speaks to how collaboration across the industry will be key to making this happen. We have received a strong level of support for this project from our airline and air traffic partners, plus regulators. The opportunity to get this deployed for passenger aircraft around the middle of this decade is very promising. Imagine the potential if fello’fly was deployed across the industry!”

Pilots from Airbus partner airlines SAS Scandinavian Airlines and Frenchbee witnessed the transatlantic flight onboard as observers. The flight was made possible by Airbus and its air traffic management partners and navigation service providers (DSNA, NATS, NAV CANADA, Eurocontrol and IAA), with the support of the DGAC, who together proved that wake energy retrieval flight technology leveraged in a fello’fly flight can be achieved without compromising safety. The demonstration also shows how fello’fly operations could significantly boost environmental performance of commercial aircraft and contribute to the aviation industry’s decarbonisation targets in the immediate term.

The next step is to get the support of the authorities so that this new operational concept can be certified, and ultimately enable airlines to reduce their fuel burn and CO2 emissions.

The Airbus pioneering fello’fly flight was welcomed upon its arrival in Montreal by the Council President and Secretary General of the UN aviation agency, ICAO. Council President Salvatore Sciacchitano said the demonstration represented “an inspiring example of the level of current commitment to reduce aviation emissions,” while ICAO Secretary General Juan Carlos Salazar remarked on how it reflected “the incredible diversity of air transport innovations now being realized to meet the sector’s targets and ensure flying becomes more and more sustainable.”

Launched in 2019, fello’fly is a flight demonstrator project hosted within Airbus UpNext using biomimicry (the design and production of materials, structures and systems inspired by nature). Airbus UpNext is a wholly-owned Airbus subsidiary and part of the Airbus innovation ecosystem, created to give future technologies a development fast-track by building demonstrators at speed and scale, in order to evaluate, mature and validate potential new products and services that encompass radical technological breakthroughs.

Airbus foresees demand for 39000 new passenger & freighter aircraft by 2040 - Airbus,"Sat, 13 Nov 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMS0xMS1haXJidXMtZm9yZXNlZXMtZGVtYW5kLWZvci0zOTAwMC1uZXctcGFzc2VuZ2VyLWZyZWlnaHRlci1haXJjcmFmdNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Retirement of older aircraft to accelerate, demand progressively more driven by replacement, supporting the industry’s decarbonisation objectives

Demand for air transport will continue to grow, driven by GDP, rising middle class and desire to explore and connect

Continued improvements in fleet efficiency, sustainable fuels, operations and propulsion technologies will enable the sector’s 2050 net-zero objective

Need for over 550,000 new pilots and over 710,000 highly skilled technicians over the next 20 years

Dubai, 13 November 2021 – In the next 20 years, Airbus forecasts demand for air transport to progressively shift from fleet growth to the accelerated retirement of older, less fuel-efficient aircraft, resulting in a need for some 39,000 new-build passenger and freighter aircraft, 15,250 of these for replacement. As a consequence, by 2040 the vast majority of commercial aircraft in operation will be of the latest generation, up from some 13% today, considerably improving the CO2 efficiency of the world’s commercial aircraft fleets. The economic benefits of aviation extend beyond the sector, contributing around 4% to annual global GDP and sustaining some 90 million jobs worldwide.

While having lost nearly two years of growth over the COVID period, passenger traffic has demonstrated its resilience and is set to reconnect to an annual growth of 3.9% per year, driven by expanding economies and commerce around the globe including tourism. The middle classes, who are the likeliest to fly, will grow in number by two billion people to 63% of the world’s population. The fastest traffic growth will be in Asia with domestic China becoming the largest market.

The demand for new aircraft will include around 29,700 Small aircraft like the A220 and A320 Families, as well as about 5,300 in the Medium aircraft category such as the A321XLR and the A330neo. In the Large segment, covered by the A350, a need for some 4,000 deliveries is expected by 2040.

Cargo demand, boosted by e-commerce, is driven by an expected growth in express freight of 4.7% per year and a general cargo (representing about 75% of the market) growth of 2.7%. Overall, over the next 20 years there will be a need for some 2,440 freighters, of which 880 will be new-build.

In line with growth, ever more efficient aircraft operations globally increase the need for commercial aviation services - including maintenance, training, upgrades, flight operations, dismantling and recycling. This growth is on track at Airbus’ pre-pandemic forecast levels reaching a cumulative value of around $4.8Tn in the next 20 years. While continuing through a COVID-related downdip of some 20% over the 2020-2025 period, the services market is rebounding, triggering a need for some 550,000+ new pilots and 710,000+ highly skilled technicians over the next 20 years. While maintenance will remain the leading services segment, flight, ground operations and sustainable services are also expected to grow significantly.

“As economies and air transport mature, we see demand increasingly driven by replacement rather than growth. Replacement being today’s most significant driver for decarbonisation. The world is expecting more sustainable flying and this will be made possible in the short-term by the introduction of most modern airplanes,” said Christian Scherer, Chief Commercial Officer and Head of Airbus International. “Powering these new, efficient aircraft with Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) is the next big lever. We pride ourselves that all our aircraft - the A220, A320neo Family, the A330neo and the A350 - are already certified to fly with a blend of 50% SAF, set to rise to 100% by 2030 - before making ZEROe our next reality from 2035 onwards.”

The global aviation industry has already achieved huge efficiency gains, as shown by the 53% decline in aviation’s CO2 emissions per revenue passenger kilometre since 1990. Airbus’ product range supports at least a 20% CO2 efficiency gain over previous-generation aircraft. In view of further ongoing innovations, product developments, operational improvements as well as market based options, Airbus is supporting the air transport sector’s target to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

Once approved and certified, the aircraft is cleared for service.

Ensuring airworthiness

To ensure the reliability and maturity of the A350 from the moment it entered into service, Airbus implemented one of the most thorough test programmes ever developed for an aircraft. Lasting just over 14 months – an industry record for the completion time – the A350-900 version’s flight test and certification programme comprised a five-aircraft fleet that performed over 2,600 flight hours in total – with Type Certification subsequently received from the world’s two primary airworthiness authorities: the European Union Aviation Safety Agency for (EASA) Europe, and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). For Airbus’ A320neo Family, the testing and certification process involved all six versions, with the A319neo, A320neo and A321neo undergoing validation of their airframe, systems and the two powerplant options offered on each aircraft type: CFM International’s LEAP-1A and Pratt & Whitney GTF™ engine. These campaigns also confirmed the aircraft met their performance targets in terms of fuel burn and range – based on the latest-generation engine choices and large Sharklet wingtip devices.

Ground-based

structural tests

In preparation for clearance to perform the milestone first flight, an aircraft undergoes structural static tests that include a re-creation of aerodynamic loads the airplane will experience during its lifetime. The tests typically involve maximum bending of the wings, aileron and spoiler functional testing during wing bend and fuselage pressure tests, along with fatigue tests and the simulation of flight cycles encountered from take-off to landing. The next steps are certification tests to cover limit loads and ultimate loads in various situations like maximum wing deflection, fuselage loads – all to obtain a full understanding of the aircraft behaviour in extreme conditions. Fatigue testing examines how the aircraft’s structure responds to loads in conditions that occur in repeated flight cycles – from takeoff, climb-out and cruise, to the descent and landing. The fatigue testing’s purpose is to understand the structural behaviour during the aircraft’s life, along with the inspection methods to be applied in identifying potential fatigue critical areas while the aircraft is in service. The A350 certification tests covered an equivalent of three times the aircraft’s design lifetime, to include a large safety factor for the fatigue behaviour.

Flight test campaign

An aircraft’s flight test campaign is designed to assess general handling qualities, operational performance, airfield noise levels and systems operation in normal flight modes, along with failure scenarios and extreme conditions – culminating with certification by airworthiness authorities. Extreme weather trials for the A350 included cold weather testing in Iqaluit, Canada; high altitude evaluations in La Paz, Bolivia and a hot weather campaign in the United Arab Emirates at Al Ain. In addition, the A350 was the first Airbus aircraft to visit the McKinley Climatic Laboratory in the U.S. state of Florida. At this unique location, the aircraft was subjected to a range of climatic conditions ranging from +40 degrees Celcius to -40 degrees. Celcius in a climate-controlled hangar. Further certification flight testing for a new aircraft is dedicated to water ingestion trials (when a significant amount of water accumulates on a runway), low speed take-off tests, as well as flutter and rejected take-offs and landings. In addition, wake vortex trials – to measure air turbulence created behind the aircraft at take-off – are included in the steps required for certification. With the A320neo Family, certification flight testing included validation of the aircraft's new-generation LEAP-1A and Pratt & Whitney GTF™ engines – including their lower fuel burn, environmental footprint, NOx emissions, and engine noise – along with aircraft handling qualities and performance, as well as operation of systems such as the autopilot.

Certification

Certification is a regulatory obligation for all aircraft and their engines, and is issued by the EASA and FAA airworthiness authorities. The Type Certificate – issued to signify the airworthiness of an aircraft’s initial design – is followed by an “Individual Certificate of Airworthiness,” which authorises aircraft to be registered in the country where they operate. The certification procedure covers the complete development process of a new aircraft and all its subsequent evolutions. It includes various phases: Design familiarisation;

Definition of certification programme (including proposed means of compliance);

Independent check of compliance demonstration (including test reviews laboratory work; and in-flight validation; and statement of compliance). All the above is ensured with support from suppliers and operators. The authorities are involved in all phases of the project according to the certification programme. The airworthiness authorities in their jurisdiction oversee the certification process. Today, the main aircraft certification systems are: For the European Union, the EASA (European Union Aviation Safety Agency);

For the United States, the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration). The appropriate authority for each Airbus operator validates an aircraft’s operation by releasing the Certificate of Airworthiness according to their legislation.

A proven

international

system

The production of Airbus aircraft benefits from a truly international industrial system with cooperation across the company’s global footprint, partnered with a worldwide supply chain.



Airbus has evolved how its airplanes are built. New digital technologies help to deliver on time while maintaining quality, keep flexibility to adjust aircraft production, and reduce the impact of manufacturing activities on the environment for improved sustainability.

Transforming how

an aircraft is built

Looking to the future, Airbus is undertaking a major transformation called DDMS (Digital Design Manufacturing & Services), responding to the increasingly competitive marketplace, while also preparing for the next generation of aircraft – particularly to meet the company’s goal of being the first major manufacturer to offer climate-neutral commercial aircraft by 2035. To achieve this ambition aircraft manufacturing and assembly is evolving to bring in new processes, tools and jobs for a different way to design and build aircraft, while also offering an improved workspace for employees.



With increased modular design and customisation capabilities the next industrial system will leverage higher levels of standardisation and commonality of parts and major components, enabling new Build-To-Stock and Build-to-Order decoupled approaches. In the factories, teams will benefit from even more digital and connected processes, tools and devices. This will enable just-in-time operations and flexibility to produce and assemble aircraft faster, in a cleaner, more efficient and even safer environment. They will perform activities with more added value, supported by robots and using lighter-weight tooling.



This ambitious makeover will enable Airbus to adapt production rates more rapidly to meet customer demand, further enhance quality, increase flexibility in the delivery of aircraft, lower the environmental impact by decarbonising manufacturing activities, and reduce costs.

The central flight control system of CityAirbus NextGen, the electric vertical take-off and landing vehicle (eVTOL) being developed by Airbus, will combine extraordinary computing power with lightweight design and highest safety standards.

Diehl and Thales are joining Airbus in investing into the emerging eVTOL market. Both partners are developing their own system that will be integrated into a dissimilar architecture to comply with the new EASA regulation for eVTOL. This architecture is essential to ensuring the redundancy of the computers and the vehicle’s safety. The developments will be supported with public funding from the German and French governments, respectively.

Thales is responsible for the primary computing system, while Diehl is developing the secondary flight control computer. The system ensures that the second, independent flight control computer monitors the data of the primary computer system permanently, and it can also take over the flight control itself.

“I'm delighted to announce today the first system partnership for the development of our CityAirbus NextGen” said Jörg Müller, Head of Urban Air Mobility (UAM) at Airbus. “UAM is a joint effort. Nobody can do it alone. Airbus is reaching out to potential partners from the industry to design and build an optimised vehicle for safe and efficient air transport in urban environments. With Thales and Diehl, we are proud to have two excellent partners with a lot of expertise on board.”

“In the future, eVTOLs will be a key part of mobility and will enormously enrich it – in our cities but also beyond. For this, the safe operation of the innovative aircraft, of course, plays an essential role”, said Josef Köcher, CEO at Diehl Aviation. “We see a trend-setting partnership in the close collaboration with Airbus and Thales for the reliability and safety of the CityAirbus. We are proud to be on board with our expertise, and we are looking forward to seeing the CityAirbus in the skies soon.”

""We are thrilled to see that our close cooperation with Airbus and Diehl is once again delivering concrete results through an agreement that will add a whole new dimension to air mobility,"" said Yannick Assouad, Thales Executive Vice President, Avionics. ""With this safe and innovative flight control solution, we are working together to build an airspace environment we can all trust.""

Thales has more than 40 years of experience in electrical flight controls, having supplied the systems for the first ever fly-by-wire commercial airliner, the Airbus A310. Diehl Aerospace, a joint venture of the French partner Thales and Diehl Aviation, has many decades of experience in avionics for civil and military aircraft and helicopters.

The fully electric CityAirbus NextGen was revealed in September 2021 at the Airbus Summit. It is equipped with fixed wings, a V-shaped tail, and eight electrically powered propellers as part of its distributed propulsion system. It is designed to carry up to four passengers in a zero emissions flight in multiple applications. CityAirbus is being developed to fly with a 80 km range and to reach a cruise speed of 120 km/h, making it perfectly suited for operations in major cities for a variety of missions. It is optimized for hover and cruise efficiency, while not requiring moving surfaces or tilting parts during transition. Designed with simplicity in mind, CityAirbus NextGen will offer best-in-class economic performance in operations and support. The first flight of a prototype is planned for 2023. Airbus is developing a UAM solution with eVTOLS not only to offer a new mobility service for urban areas but also as a first step in its quest to reduce emissions in aviation all over its product range.

Early days (1967) - Airbus,"Tue, 09 Nov 2021 10:54:36 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vd2hvLXdlLWFyZS9vdXItaGlzdG9yeS9jb21tZXJjaWFsLWFpcmNyYWZ0LWhpc3RvcnkvZWFybHktZGF5cy0xOTY30gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The A300 programme was launched with a milestone agreement signed by French Transport Minister Jean Chamant and German Economics Minister Karl Schiller at the 1969 Paris Air Show. At a meeting in July 1967, ministers from France, Germany and Britain agreed “for the purpose of strengthening European co-operation in the field of aviation technology and thereby promoting economic and technological progress in Europe, to take appropriate measures for the joint development and production of an airbus.”

European consolidation - Concorde The weighty language of the declaration concealed the economic reality behind the decision. In reaching this agreement, the three nations were acknowledging a simple truth: that without a joint programme of aircraft development and production, Europe would be left trailing in the wake of the Americans, who dominated the industry – and, with the planned long-range 747 “jumbo” on the horizon, looked set to consolidate their supremacy. The proud European firms which had produced some of the world’s best passenger aircraft and pioneered commercial jet travel would become little more than sub-contractors to American manufacturers. Hundreds of thousands of jobs could be at risk and European airlines would be dependent on the United States for new aircraft. Until this point Europe’s aviation industry had remained strongly rooted in nationality. The British had built the Comet, the BAC1-11 and the Trident, among others. The French had produced the Caravelle. Together the two countries had built the world’s first supersonic airliner, Concorde. But Concorde was the product of a political dream. It was never going to be the saviour of the European aircraft industry because it was highly expensive to build and operate and catered for relatively few people. The idea behind the short-haul European airbus, on the other hand, was to capitalise on the dawning of a boom in popular air travel. More people wanted to fly, and for less.

Airbus leveraged its operational experience with the Concorde for development of the A300B.

The ""fathers"" of Airbus Throughout the 1960s, firms like France’s Sud Aviation and the British Aircraft Corporation planned new aircraft with the aim of catering for the growth in demand for air travel. Sud Aviation’s Galion was to be a 200-seat wide-body, while BAC talked of a similar-capacity BAC 2-11. Britain’s Hawker Siddeley Aviation planned a twin-engine stretch version of the Trident. Hawker Siddeley Aviation also carried out joint studies with French firms Nord Aviation and Breguet for a wide-body named the HBN 100. Yet it was becoming clear that if all these aircraft were built, none of them would sell enough to make it viable. They would be competing against one another in the same market. Only if Europe combined the considerable talents and expertise which existed in individual companies and nations and put them into one aircraft to compete directly against the Americans – who held more than 80 per cent of the world market - could there be any hope of success. Within days of the July 1967 meeting, a brilliant French engineer, Roger Béteille, was appointed technical director of the A300 programme. Henri Ziegler, president of Sud Aviation, was later named general manager of what would become Airbus Industrie and a German politician, Franz-Josef Strauss, was made chairman of the supervisory board. These men were to become known as the “fathers” of Airbus, along with a man whose skills Béteille recognised at once: Felix Kracht, a young German engineer, who had been working for Nord Aviation but was about to join the German Airbus group as head of sales and marketing. Kracht, who later described himself more as the “midwife” of the Airbus manufacturing system than as a father of the company, took on the role of production director: overseeing and co-ordinating the job of building the A300.

Roger Béteille was appointed technical director of the milestone A300 programe in 1967, and is considered one of the “fathers” of Airbus.

This takes operational experience into account, drawing lessons learned and implementing necessary changes – extending beyond the products themselves into the training provided for flight, cabin, and maintenance crews, along with the worldwide services delivered in support of aircraft operations. Beyond this, we are in constant contact with other aircraft manufacturers, airlines, and air safety organisations around the world to find new ways of improving safety standards. We believe that industry-wide cooperation is crucial to making further safety enhancements.

Our safety culture Product safety drives us to raise standards and prevent accidents. Our dedication to product safety is demonstrated through our common value of always putting safety first. We are committed to reinforcing our safety culture with our people through safety promotion and training. We foster an open reporting culture where employees are encouraged to speak up about any potential safety concerns in an atmosphere of trust and empowerment. This is reflected in the Airbus Commitment to Just & Fair Culture, which is signed by the Airbus CEO, Executive Committee members, and top managers. It includes the commitment to ensure the appropriate reporting channels are available and known to all employees to report product safety and quality related matters in an atmosphere of trust and empowerment.

Safety in design Product safety drives us to raise standards and prevent accidents. We ensure safety in the design of aircraft and the quality of manufacturing and support, the materials and manuals supplied to customers to operate and maintain the aircraft, the training provided to flight, cabin, and maintenance crews, and the worldwide services delivered in support of aircraft operations. We go beyond airworthiness requirements to also focus on safety enhancement activities in our products and services and implementing safety enhancements when appropriate.

Safety in technology The air transport industry has achieved step changes in safety, underlining the significant contribution of technology to make flying safer than ever before. This is demonstrated by the continual decrease in the overall accident rate for commercial air transport. Each new generation of aircraft has introduced technology that helps to prevent the main causes of accidents. One example of an Airbus technological breakthrough is digital fly-by-wire (FBW) technology. Introduced in 1988 with the A320 Family, fly-by-wire flight controls bring improved handling and enhanced safety – including protection that prevents an aircraft from exceeding its approved flight envelope, helping to reduce loss of control in-flight accidents. An additional benefit is operational commonality for pilots across the Airbus range of aircraft products, from the single-aisle A320 Family to the widebody A330, A340, A350 and A380. The flight management systems and electronic navigation displays introduced in cockpits in the 1980s significantly improved navigation performance and position awareness. The Terrain Awareness and Warning System (TAWS) is another example of a technology that has significantly enhanced safety. These technological advances have been key to reducing controlled flight into terrain accidents. We support Airbus Operators in their efforts to reduce the risk of runway excursion accidents. Runway Overrun Prevention System (ROPS) is an avionic alerting system designed to prevent runway overrun during the landing phase. ROPS was introduced on the A380 aircraft in 2009 and is now standard on all new Airbus aircraft. RunwaySense is another technology that improves runway safety. This web-based platform enables airlines and airports to assess and report runway conditions in real-time, using the aircraft as a sensor.

Airbus Safety Promotion Centre The number one priority of Airbus is the continued safe transport of everyone and everything that flies aboard an Airbus product. Learn how the Safety Promotion Centre encourages a deeper personal engagement of our employees with safety and cultivates an accident prevention mindset. Learn more

Safety Risk Management As a key component of the Airbus Corporate SMS, the management of risks associated with identified hazards from collected safety data enables data-driven decision making and supports a proactive approach to manage safe operations of products and services. Applying proactive risk management principles has contributed to significant improvements for the safety of flight in recent decades. This risk management approach drives our Corporate Safety Process, which has been in place for more than 15 years. It supports the principles of the Airbus safety enhancement culture, going beyond compliance with certification and airworthiness duties.

Safety compliance Product certifications are provided by aviation authorities. We work to ensure compliance through design and certification of products under EASA Part 21 Design Organisation Approvals (DOA), manufacturing under Production Organisation Approvals (POA), monitoring of in-service safety through approved EASA Part-M Continuing Airworthiness Management Organisations (CAMO); aircraft maintenance and retrofit operations conducted in line with civil and military EASA Part 145 regulations; and training provided to flight crews, cabin crews and maintenance crews through EASA Part 147 Approved Training Organisations (ATO). The certified organisations within Airbus where specific approvals are granted by the aviation authorities, are audited and monitored by these authorities to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. Additional audits are conducted by third parties as part of the quality certifications including EN9100, EN9001, EN9110, AQAP 2110, AQAP 2210 and AQAP 2310.

Outside the ISS is also where Airbus’ Bartolomeo platform can be found: offering new opportunities for science and research in space. With an eye to the future, Airbus and the space start-up Voyager Space founded a transatlantic joint venture paving the way to develop, build, and operate Starlab, a commercial space station planned to succeed the ISS. The European Space Agency has signed with Voyager and Airbus a trilateral Memorandum of Understanding, outlining their collaboration for the Starlab space station in the post-ISS era.

Focus on Friedrichshafen

Knowing what’s happening with the weather matters to us all and it is Airbus expertise that helps make this possible. In Friedrichshafen, our engineers are currently developing the second generation of Europe’s MetOp weather satellites – following on from the first MetOps, made by Airbus, which have significantly improved the accuracy of 1 day forecasts. As a key player in the European Union's Copernicus Earth observation programme, the multispectral satellites for the Sentinel-2 mission, the oceanographic satellites for Sentinel-6 and the radar instrument for Sentinel-1 were all crafted at our site on the banks of Lake Constance. While our lead on the joint European-Japanese BepiColombo mission, currently on its way to Mercury, puts the site at the leading edge of space exploration.

Recognised as a world leader in radar satellite technology, the TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X satellites made in Friedrichshafen can see through clouds and all-weathers to provide round-the-clock monitoring which are delivered as services to customers globally. And, their successors are in the making! The site is also the birthplace for many unique, zero-gravity research facilities used by astronauts on the ISS. Full production has begun on the six Galileo Second Generation (G2) satellites at Airbus’ site in Friedrichshafen with the arrival of the first satellite Flight Model structure from Beyond Gravity in Zurich. After initial preparation the panels will be dispatched to other Airbus sites before final integration and testing at Friedrichshafen. The Galileo G2 satellites are scheduled for launch in the coming years to support the initial deployment and validation of the G2 System.

Arrival of Galileo to the Friedrichshafen cleanroom

Satellite imagery and data can help to detect and monitor environmental changes such as floods, droughts or fires. Those satellite imagery and data provided by Airbus’ satellites are being processed, monitored and mapped at our sites in Friedrichshafen and Potsdam.

Focus on Ottobrunn/Taufkirchen

Our aerospace site in Ottobrunn/Taufkirchen, near Munich, has not only shaped the history of cutting-edge technology over the last 60 years, it is also actively shaping the future. Today, our solar array production for satellites marks our entry into the age of Industry 4.0, with the site now boasting the largest clean room for optical satellite integration in Germany. Airbus’s centre of competence for solar arrays has been equipping spacecraft of every class – for weather observation, environmental monitoring, disaster management, navigation, telecommunications satellites - with these highly efficient ‘power plants’ and delivered more than 300 solar arrays worldwide. Some impressive facts: output from a few hundred watts up to 26 kilowatts, 20,000 solar cells per array, wingspan up to 40 meters, maximum weight 145 kilograms. We also supportcutting-edge research, especially on science satellites, such as the Jupiter mission (JUICE) or missions to the Sun (Solar Orbiter) and Mercury (BepiColombo).

Our Bavarian site is also home to theOptical Instruments clean room where the MERLIN emissions monitoring instrument is being built. This vital Franco-German satellite will measure the methane concentration in Earth’s atmosphere, helping to improve understanding of climate change.

We are also reaching from the stars with the Near Infrared Spectrograph NIRSpec, an instrument capable of detecting the faintest radiation from distant galaxies – made here for use on the U.S. Hubble follow-on, the James Webb Space Telescope. The SpaceDataHighway provides high-volume data transfer via ultra-broadband laser communications.

Zephyr High Altitude Platform Station (HAPS) achieves connectivity in trial conducted by Airbus and NTT DOCOMO - Airbus,"Mon, 15 Nov 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMS0xMS16ZXBoeXItaGlnaC1hbHRpdHVkZS1wbGF0Zm9ybS1zdGF0aW9uLWhhcHMtYWNoaWV2ZXMtY29ubmVjdGl2aXR5LWlu0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The companies demonstrated the feasibility of providing communication services from the stratosphere to smartphones

Data transmissions across various speeds up to a distance of 140km were successfully demonstrated

TOKYO, JAPAN, November 15, 2021 – Airbus and NTT DOCOMO, INC. have demonstrated the ability to use its solar-powered Zephyr High Altitude Platform Station (HAPS) to deliver future wireless broadband connectivity. The trial took place in the United States in August, when the Zephyr S aircraft undertook approx. 18-day stratospheric flights to test various capabilities.

Carrying an onboard radio transmitter, the Zephyr S provided an agile datalink during a stratospheric flight to simulate future direct-to-device connectivity. Test data was captured at different altitudes and at different times of day and night, focusing on assessing how connectivity is affected in the stratosphere by factors including weather conditions, different elevation angles and aircraft flight patterns.

Tests included various bandwidths to simulate direct-to-device service from the HAPS to end users using low, nominal and high throughput. The demonstration confirmed the viability and versatility of the 2GHz spectrum for HAPS-based services and also the use of a narrow (450MHz) band to provide connectivity in a range of up to 140km.

The measurement and analysis of the propagation of radio waves transmitted from Zephyr demonstrated the feasibility of stratospheric communications to devices such as smartphones. Based on the results of this experiment, Airbus and NTT DOCOMO aims to provide communication services to mountainous areas, remote islands, and maritime areas where radio waves are difficult to reach.

""DOCOMO believes that HAPS will be a promising solution for coverage expansion in 5G evolution and 6G,” said Takehiro Nakamura, General Manager of DOCOMO's 6G-IOWN Promotion Department. “In this measurement experiment, we were able to demonstrate the effectiveness of HAPS, especially for direct communication to smartphones, through long-term propagation measurements using actual HAPS equipment. Based on these results, we would like to further study the practical application of HAPS in 5G evolution and 6G with Airbus.”

As part of efforts to further advance 5G and prepare for 6G, ""coverage expansion"" to expand communication networks to any location, including air and sea, is being studied worldwide. To achieve this, non-terrestrial network (NTN) technology is expected to be used. In addition to coverage of the air and sea, stratospheric HAPS networking will be useful for disaster preparedness and many industrial use cases, for example, to increase communication capacity in densely populated areas such as event venues, and remotely controlling heavy equipment at construction sites.

The test data will be used to inform future LTE direct-to-device services that are expected to be provided via the Airbus Zephyr HAPS solution.

“Billions of people across the world suffer from poor or no connectivity. These tests show us the viability of the stratosphere to bridge this divide and provide direct to device connectivity via Zephyr without the need for base stations or extra infrastructure,” Stephane Ginoux, Head of North Asia region for Airbus and President of Airbus Japan K.K.

Test details

The trial involved a radio propagation experiment from the stratosphere at an altitude of approximately 20 kilometers to a receiving antenna on the ground. Tests involved a direct connection between the radio equipment on board a Zephyr S HAPS aircraft flying in the stratosphere and the ground antenna under conditions of ever-changing altitude and day/night time.

The trial tested the stability of the connection between the Zephyr S HAPS and the ground antenna and how it was affected by factors such as weather conditions, differences in reception distance, and the flight pattern of the HAPS aircraft. As a result, under three specific scenarios: clear, rainy and cloudy conditions, and in a multitude of flight patterns, data transmissions across various speeds were successfully demonstrated, up to a distance of 140km.

Airbus inaugurates new Training Centre in Chile - Airbus Aircraft,"Tue, 09 Nov 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vYWlyY3JhZnQuYWlyYnVzLmNvbS9lbi9uZXdzcm9vbS9wcmVzcy1yZWxlYXNlcy8yMDIxLTExLWFpcmJ1cy1pbmF1Z3VyYXRlcy1uZXctdHJhaW5pbmctY2VudHJlLWluLWNoaWxl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Santiago, 09 November, 2021 – Airbus, in the company of SKY, officially celebrated the inauguration of its newest training centre located in Santiago, Chile, becoming the fourth training centre in Latin America. The Airbus Chile Training Centre (ACTC) is located within the facilities of Airbus Chile, in the Tobalaba Airfield in Santiago.

The 1,700-square-meter facility offers training to Airbus operators in Chile and houses a full-suite of A320 pilot training equipment and has the capacity for 1,800 trainees a year. SKY, an all-Airbus low cost carrier based in Chile and Peru, selected Airbus in 2019 as its flight training provider, with the aim of delivering the best safety conditions for its passengers.

The centre was inaugurated with the presence of the Chilean Minister of Transportation and Telecommunications, Gloria Hutt, SKY’s Executive President, Holger Paulmann and Arturo Barreira, President of Airbus Latin America and the Caribbean.

The A320 Family is the world’s most popular single-aisle aircraft family as it is the preferred choice with airlines, from the low cost carriers, to new business models taking benefits of new levels of performance and comfort, and with passengers. As air traffic in Latin America is progressively ramping up, Airbus predicts that this will call for more than 5,500 pilots to be trained over the next few years in the region, so the new training center will support the actual and the future growth of Airbus customers.

The ACTC is part of the Airbus global flight training network, which has 20 training locations around the world. This extensive and growing global network enables Airbus to offer a complete flight training package, allowing its customers to benefit from its training expertise closer to their home base.

Airbus has sold over 1,100 aircraft and has a backlog of close to 430 and more than 685 in operation throughout Latin America and the Caribbean, representing almost 60% market share of the in-service fleet. Since 1994, Airbus has secured approximately 70 percent of net orders in the region.

What Went Wrong With The Airbus A380? - Aviation Week,"Sat, 13 Nov 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9zaG93bmV3cy9kdWJhaS1haXJzaG93L3doYXQtd2VudC13cm9uZy1haXJidXMtYTM4MNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The last Airbus A380 ever produced is slated to be handed over to Emirates imminently. The delivery will close one of the most spectacular chapters in European aerospace history.

It was spectacular in many ways: The A380 was the largest commercial aircraft ever produced, intended to eclipse Boeing’s 747; passengers and pilots loved its comfort and ease of flying, even if airline finance departments were less enamored with it. The aircraft’s production run, spanning just 14 years, was drama-filled, including the expensive redesign of its wings and increasingly desperate campaigns to sell more of the giant aircraft and extend its life. They were full of negotiations about even larger versions and Neos, after the reengining concept had worked so well for the A320 family.

But after Emirates finally pulled the plug on a large follow-up order that would have saved the program in the winter of 2018, it was up to departing Airbus CEO Tom Enders to finally decide the ending for the A380. It had become clear that Airbus would never recover the €25 billon ($30 billion) or so in research and development costs sunk into the program over the years. And with no new orders keeping production open even at minimal rates, it became unsustainable. Europe’s most ambitious commercial aircraft program post-Concorde had become a gigantic failure and a prime example of management reading the market improperly.

Was it a misreading, though? Was there ever a chance of it continuing until demand recovery?

In the weeks before that final delivery, Aviation Week ShowNews spoke with many insiders who shared their views and memories. Among them were Enders and former Airbus sales chief John Leahy as well as Nico Buchholz, himself a former Airbus sales executive who later ordered the aircraft for Lufthansa as its head of fleet strategy. Some still think the program could have been rescued. But the look back into its history also shows that industry doubts about the A380’s viability had begun even before first delivery.

Paradigm Shift

Enders was head of strategy at Airbus’ German shareholder DASA in the 1990s—the manufacturer was still a loose economic interest group (French acronym GIE), a consortium of shareholders that was nowhere near being integrated. Much later, of course, the A380 was the key factor in fundamentally changing that. In the 1990s, discussions about the risks and opportunities of building an A3XX were intensifying after years of studies. “Airbus did not stumble into [building] the A380; we were very aware of the project’s risks,” Enders says. “But then, technology and the market changed faster than everyone had thought.”

In hindsight, the writing may have been on the wall for the A380 even before its own entry into service—even as early as four years before. In December 2003, Boeing decided to launch the 787, a revolutionary aircraft in many ways, particularly in its use of lightweight composites for structural weight savings. By contrast, “Airbus’ achievement in the A380 was mainly to be able to build something that big,” says Buchholz. Other than that, the A380 was structurally fairly conventional.

Of equal importance was engine manufacturers’ commitment to build powerplants for the Boeing 787 that were significantly better than those of the A380.

The consequences were fundamental: Suddenly, the paradigm of building larger aircraft to cut unit costs was broken. The unit costs of 787—and later the A350—were comparable to or even better than those of the much larger A380, but with a considerably lower risk of not being able to fill the aircraft. Unit revenues were the other side of the coin: There was greater pressure on yields, with literally hundreds of additional seats to fill on every flight. Once Lufthansa started flying the A380 across the Atlantic, the airline found that the yield on its Frankfurt-New York route fell by almost as much as unit costs.

Looking back, Leahy has harsh words for Rolls-Royce and GE Aviation. “Airbus was blindsided by the engine manufacturers in 2000, when we were getting ready to launch it,” he says. “Our program people had assurances [from] the engine OEMs that there was nothing on the horizon with better specific fuel consumption [SFC] for years to come. And three years later, when we had not even delivered the first aircraft, GE and Rolls had engines with 15% better SFCs that they were bringing out for the 787. That left Airbus at a commercial disadvantage that was very unfortunate.”

The aircraft’s most important customer, Emirates Airline President Tim Clark, agrees to an extent. “I regret that it was not reengined, that the weight was not taken out,” he says. However, he also points to the many problems the A350and the 787 have had since the market introductions of the next generation of engines, issues the A380 has not faced to the same degree. He asks whether the A380 may have had the same reliability issues, which are hard enough to handle on a 150-seat narrowbody but could require large sums for passenger compensation and handling for just one canceled A380 flight. The tradeoff between efficiency and reliability was a big consideration.

When Airbus decided to launch the A380, it was still chasing another idea, and therefore the wrong target. “In the 1990s, not only Airbus but also many airlines were still very focused on four engines when it came to widebodies,” Enders recalls. And Airbus thought it had to build an aircraft that would compete with the 747 and break into the Boeing monopoly on very large jets. In 2015, in the midst of increasingly desperate struggles to find new customers, then-CEO Fabrice Bregier conceded that the A380 had been launched “at least 10 years too soon.”

Perhaps it was not launched too soon but too late: In 1990, Boeing received orders for 122 747-400s and delivered 70. Ten years later, when Airbuscommitted to building the A380, 747 orders were down to 26 and deliveries to 25. And with few exceptions since, 747 production has continuously declined.

Airbus’ growing problem was not just the 787, or later its own A350, which further deepened the market shift. In April 2004, it was none other than Air France, in Airbus’ backyard, that took delivery of the first two Boeing 777-300ERs. That aircraft, and not the A380, replaced the 747 as the reference on long-haul trunk routes before slowly being superseded by even more efficient twins.

“We all have misjudged the future of the twins, and that led to the efficiency problem of the A380,” Enders says. “I only admit this reluctantly, but Boeinghas largely been right with its point-to-point argument.” He is referencing the idea that passengers, when having the choice, prefer nonstop flights over hub connections. Both Leahy and Clark disagree with the idea that the hub concept has weakened. “I don’t share the view that the days of the superhub are over at all,” Clark says.

Missed Opportunities

The two-year phase from 2005 to 2007 was crucial to the A380’s early demise, not only because of the growing threat from more efficient twins. In those years, billions of euros in extra costs were added to the program, and important decisions that could have been made were not.

The aircraft had performed its first flight at the end of April 2005, a milestone for the entire aviation industry. Airbus garnered applause from around the world for the achievement. But a little over a month later, the company was forced to announce the first (six-month) delay in the program. As it turned out, different parts of the consortium had used different versions of the CATIA design software and, infamously, as a result many of the cables inside the fuselage were too short.

An almost incomprehensible struggle followed. Airbus threw literally thousands of technicians and engineers at the problem. Many in charge burned out—and many left, but those who stayed learned tough lessons that were incredibly valuable for their later careers. Airbus had to announce two more delays before finally regaining control of the situation toward the end of 2006.

The crisis was so deep that management considered the most radical moves. “We asked ourselves whether we should terminate the program,” Enders reveals. “But that would not have been right back then. Development was very far advanced, and the reputational damage would have been huge.”

There were still consequences. EADS had been formed in 2000 along with the launch of the A380. The former Airbus GIE was converted into a real company a year later. But in 2006, EADS acquired the remaining 20% in Airbus SAS previously held by BAE Systems and proceeded with much deeper integration. “We pushed through relatively brutal integration in 2006-07,” Enders says. “Before that there had been a lot of talk about it but no real action.”

Airlines had their own perspective, which changed substantially between the 2000 launch and entry into service seven years later. “In 2000, you could not predict what crystallized in 2005—that the aircraft was technically outdated,” says Buchholz, who ordered the A380s for Lufthansa. After all, the aircraft’s unit costs were advertised to be 13% better than those of the 747-400. But then things started to move.

Japan opened up Tokyo Haneda Airport for international flights, weakening the argument that the A380 was needed for slot-constrained Narita International Airport. China built new international airports at a record pace and encouraged long-haul service to them. “You could get a feeling that the A380 was going to be too large,” remembers Buchholz. “But you could not really prove it.”

Buchholz contends that it might have been possible to rescue the A380, but it would have required early, decisive and painful action. When the program was delayed bya cabin installation disaster, Airbus should have used the opportunity to modernize the aircraft with a better engine based on ongoing development programs for the 787 and later the A350. “With a better engine, the A380 would have had a longer life,” he says.

“With new engines, it would have been an unbeatable aircraft in the marketplace,” Leahy asserts. “We came close to pulling it off. Had we had the right engines, we would probably have rewritten history.”

But he does not think Buchholz’s idea of pushing for an early reengining then would have been possible. “There were commitments made; the engines were being developed. It would have pushed back the thing a couple of years, [and] there would have been big fights with the engine manufacturers. They had invested a lot of money into that generation of engines.”

On Oct. 15, 2007, Airbus finally delivered the first A380 to Singapore Airlines. A little over a week later, the aircraft flew its first commercial service from Singapore to Sydney. It was a major milestone that, Airbus hoped, would pave the way for a less eventful future and a ramp-up of production to 45 aircraft a year, a rate of just under four aircraft per month. Of course, Airbus never reached rate 45. Production peaked at 30 aircraft in both 2012 and 2014. The last relatively big year for the type was 2016, when Airbus again managed to deliver 28. However, the turning point that likely sealed the aircraft’s fate also occurred in 2016 and led to the end of production five years later.

Weighty Issues

The nine years between 2007 and 2016 continued to be drama-filled. Emirates, by far the type’s most important and loyal operator, had just taken delivery of its first aircraft in early 2008 when the U.S. subprime and global financial crisis unfolded and heavily affected demand for international air travel. Airbus delivered 12 A380s in 2008 and only 10 a year later, a step in the wrong direction. It was not able to expand production in a significant manner until 2010, when it decided to shelve plans for the A380-900 in light of the huge financial burdens accumulated and development work on the A350, A320neoand A400M.

The stretched A380 version was what the Airbus designers really had in mind when they built a wing much larger than necessary for the baseline A380-800. It made that version heavier and so significantly less efficient than would have been possible with a smaller wing optimized for its fuselage size. “The [A380-800] was not the aircraft that we actually wanted to build,” Enders says.

“The design was optimized for larger variants,” Buchholz says. Airlines knew that, of course. But some, like Lufthansa, decided right from the beginning that the -900 would have been too large. The problem with the -800—“you can’t send the upper deck somewhere else when a route does not perform as planned,” as Bucholz puts it—would only have become worse with a larger aircraft, he says. The lack of flexibility was frightening airline planners.

On the other hand, Emirates was foremost of a number of airlines that were very much in favor of the -900. They pointed out that the larger version would be much more efficient and could reinstate the unit-cost advantage over smaller long-haul aircraft, including the A350 and 787. They also saw a market for it on their busiest routes. “We wanted the -900, not the -800,” Clark says. “The aircraft would have had another 120 seats. But when the idea was discussed, there was a slowing down in appetite [at other airlines]. We did not share [their] view.”

The real problem with the A380-900 plan was not that the stretch was never built, it was that it made the -800 a much worse version. “The fact that from the very beginning they built weight into the airplane so they could do the -900 was a program mistake,” Leahy points out. “You just don’t build extra weight into the airplane so you can stretch it. You optimize the aircraft, and then you figure out how to stretch it by taking some of the margin that you did not need. When you build in the capacity for another 100 seats from Day 1, you are going to build a heavy airplane.”

Clark says it still worked well for Emirates. “In the years after the financial crisis, 80% of our profits came from the A380,” he notes. “The A380 is still a hugely efficient aircraft, even though it has old-technology engines.” According to his calculations, a two-class A380 has 4% lower fuel burn per seat than a 787-9 at equivalent space allocation, which would mean putting 670 seats onto the aircraft. Emirates’ two-class A380s currently have 617 seats.

The airline went above and beyond anyone else in the industry to make the aircraft the core of its brand. “It was a wonderful, exciting challenge to deal with this enormous amount of space,” Clark remembers somewhat wistfully. “We put in the bars and the showers. We created a Ritz Carlton.”

But that Ritz Carlton was hugely complex to build. “The showers caused a lot of issues,” Clark says. Pumping hot water up to the upper deck with sufficient pressure was just one of them.

‘A Brick Wall’

One of the biggest misunderstandings in the history of the A380 was its true market potential in China. “If small Dubai can take more than 100 aircraft, we should be able to place a lot more of them into China,” a senior Airbusexecutive recalls thinking. But in the entire production run of the aircraft, only five were actually delivered to a Chinese airline, China Southern, the first of which arrived in October 2011. So why did China not work out?

When Airbus tried to sell the A380 to the nation’s big three—Air China, China Eastern and China Southern—some factors worked against them. Given their relatively poor reputation for customer service and product quality, the carriers lacked confidence that they could compete with their U.S. and European rivals on long-haul routes, let alone with an aircraft that big.

Long-haul flying was also a much smaller part of their business at the time, as opposed to the late 2010s. Being very conservative, the Chinese airlines also disliked launching a new aircraft, or even taking delivery of one, until performance was proven well after market introduction. The odds for Chinese business were always much lower than some in Toulouse had imagined.

“The obvious target [for A380s] should have been Air China,” says one insider. Of the three airlines, it was the one with a base in the country’s capital, and in many ways it was perceived as the flag carrier. But, unfortunately, the airline always had been close to Boeing and ended up being one of the few carriers around the world that ordered the 747-8.

For Leahy, the case is clear. “There was an enormous amount of politics involved in this from the U.S. and Boeing,” he says. “There was a lot of pressure on Beijing to not go with the airplane and stay with the 747. There was a lot of ingrained inertia with the old team in Beijing. That’s where we hit a brick wall.”

Some China experts believe it was still possible at some stage to have placed the A380 with Air China. “If Cathay Pacific had gone for the A380, Air Chinawould have followed,” says a source with knowledge of past talks.“ Cathay certainly would have helped,” Leahy agrees.

Although the carrier’s former CEO Tony Tyler has always been skeptical about the aircraft, Cathay was nonetheless close to an order at various points, particularly in 2010. One time, according to an insider, a deal failed only because Toulouse was not willing to accept some last-minute concessions demanded by the airline.The Hong Kong-based carrier was perceived as a role model for strategy, fleet and product quality by Air China, which has since also become a big shareholder. But Cathay did not jump.

The only order for the A380 ever placed by a Chinese carrier also played a role, notes one executive. “You could argue that selling to China Southern was a mistake,” he says. “It really enraged Air China, because they viewed themselves as the flag carrier. There was also a lot of personal rivalry between the CEOs, and when China Southern went for [the A380], Air China had to show it was the wrong move.”

A fleet of just five aircraft was also suboptimal and a compromise that did not work, particularly from China Southern’s main base in Guangzhou. The airline always planned to base the aircraft at Beijing but was not allowed to deploy them on routes from Air China’s hub. The two carriers tried to negotiate a joint A380 operation but in the end could not come to an agreement.

At one point, Hong Kong Airlines placed an order for 10 A380s, but insiders say the commitment was “never very credible.”

Had Airbus succeeded in breaking into the Chinese market, would it really have been literally with hundreds of aircraft, as some hoped? One executive with deep knowledge of the situation says Air China could have taken no more than 15 A380s and China Eastern and China Southern possibly 10 each. Even if the Hong Kong Airlines deal had gone through, only about 50 aircraft across all Chinese and Hong Kong-based airlines seemed feasible, the executive says. “Two-hundred was never going to be realistic,” he asserts.

In the meantime, the A380 went through its first safety and second industrial crisis. On Nov. 4, 2010, Qantas Flight 32 (QF32), an A380 registered VH-OQA, took off from Singapore Changi Airport bound for Sydney, just like the type’s first commercial flight three years earlier. But this time, the flight did not go smoothly. VH-OQA suffered an uncontained failure of engine No. 2, a Rolls-Royce Trent 900, 4 min. after takeoff, causing extensive damage to the airframe, wings, tanks and one hydraulic system. Two other engines continued to operate, but only in degraded mode.

QF32 landed back in Singapore and no one was hurt, but both Qantas and Singapore Airlines temporarily grounded their A380 fleets. According to a 2011 preliminary report by the Australian Transport Safety Board, 55 Trent 900 engines had to be replaced across the world fleet.

As dramatic as the incident was, the type’s most serious since commercial service had begun also demonstrated the resilency of the aircraft—and the flight’s crew. Redundancy had paid off.

VH-OQA was repaired in Singapore and returned to Australia in April 2012. During the repairs, tiny cracks in the wings were discovered. They turned out to be the start of the next industrial crisis: Airbus had to strengthen certain areas of the wings for in-service aircraft and use a new aluminum alloy for some parts going forward. The problem was eventually fixed, and it is not among the main causes of the premature end of production. But it made the program’s economics even worse. It was becoming increasingly clear that Airbus would never make a profit on the A380.

The Last Stand

But the airframer was still a long way from giving up. About a year after the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) had made mandatory checks for wing cracks, Airbus delivered the 100th A380 to Malaysia Airlines. With the industry now fully out of the global financial crisis, the air transport sector entered an unprecedented period of strong growth, helped by expanding global trade, low interest rates and—for the most part--—relatively low fuel prices. Those in charge in Toulouse were still hopeful the A380 could benefit and somehow turn the corner.

In November 2013, Emirates gave the program another boost: With 39 of the aircraft in service and another 51 on firm order, the airline bought 50 more at the Dubai Airshow. The three big Gulf carriers were peaking—they also placed massive commitments for the new Boeing 777X at the time. The Emirates deal was for the existing aircraft, but the A380neo concept was also discussed. After all, Airbus had launched the A320neo in 2010 and had received much better market feedback than expected.

A year after that Dubai Airshow, Airbus’ then-CEO Fabrice Bregier said the company would “one day” launch an A380neo and a stretch—and the bigger aircraft would get new engines. Six months later, he talked about an A380neo that would enter service around 2020. But in June 2016, Clark announced that the talks about an A380neo had “lapsed.”

“It was becoming apparent that we weren’t getting a customer on board for a Neo or a stretch,” Leahy says. “They were looking at some strong commitments from the engine manufacturers, as well as Airbus, about what the capability was going to be of a reengined airplane.”

Potential customers did not get what they wanted. Only one month later, in July 2016, Airbus made a U-turn by announcing a massive production cut from 28 aircraft that year to just 12 in 2018. The company was trying to buy time, as well as looking for alternatives.

In June 2017, Airbus presented the A380plus concept—the same airframe as before but with a more efficient cabin, around 80 more seats. Space was going to be made available, among other ways, by eliminating the rear staircase that was taking up a lot of room. But, again, customer response was lukewarm. Notably, Emirates did not like the idea since the A380’s luxury—the first-class shower and the bar at the back of the upper deck—had become part of its iconic brand.

Emirates stuck with the aircraft nonetheless. With the A380 deep in crisis mode and questions about its viability (and residual value) swirling, the airline agreed to buy another 36 aircraft at the beginning of 2018. The decision was preceded by months of tense negotiations with both Airbus and Rolls-Royce. The Engine Alliance of General Electric and Pratt & Whitney had long lost interest in further A380 business.

The deal, Airbus hoped, would enable it to sustain production at low but justifiable levels long enough for demand from other airlines to kick in eventually. It was also Leahy’s last marquee deal, a final exclamation point at the end of a very successful decades-spanning career as an aircraft salesman. Almost exactly one year after Leahy returned from the contract talks in Dubai, though, Enders pulled the plug on the project, announcing that production would cease in 2022, a date that would later be pulled forward to November 2021.

When Enders decided to end the program, Leahy had already retired, and the CEO had also announced his own departure. “Tom was leaving the company. He felt the A380 was not selling well, and he wanted to clear the deck for the new team and shut down the program,” the former sales chief says. “That is just the way Tom is.”

Leahy saw things differently. “I fully expected the A380 program to continue with Emirates’ support after I retired,” he says. “I left around February, handed over to a new commercial director and expected to have that deal finalized.”

So why didn’t that happen? “I never really managed to get to the bottom of why they were not able to do it,” he says. “I think it was a combination of Airbus and Rolls-Royce factors. Emirates still wanted to do the deal. I still believe it to this day.”

The case may be more nuanced. Clark remembers that Emirates was going through another round of fleet strategy planning in late 2018 and was coming to the conclusion that a fleet of 120 A380s was going to be “optimal.” At least a large part of that fleet is to be flown “well into the 2030s,” Clark notes.

However, in the end, even Emirates found that it did not want more of the aircraft and instead decided that a supplemental fleet of smaller A350s and 787-9s made more sense.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9959068298339844}",neutral,0.9959068298339844,0

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Airbus kicked off the 2021 Dubai Air Show with a bang, landing massive deals from day one. The French aerospace manufacturer had amassed 408 announced orders and commitments by the end of the show's fourth day, Wednesday, while its American counterpart Boeing trailed with 101. Airbus and Boeing are the world's two largest aerospace companies by revenue. The order numbers so far from the first major air show since the Covid-19 pandemic began are a positive sign for aviation and travel, which suffered devastating losses for much of the last 18 months. ""We view orders for new aircraft as positive for the recovery of the commercial aerospace industry,"" Morgan Stanley said in a research note Wednesday. Airbus scored its first big win on day one of the air show, with an order for 255 of its narrow-body A321neo and A321XLR jets from American private equity firm Indigo Partners, which buys planes for low-cost carriers like Frontier, Wizz Air, Jetsmart and Volaris. It then notched a letter of intent from Air Lease Corp, set to be finalized in the coming months, for 111 aircraft across the Airbus product range: 55 A321neos, 25 A220-300s, 20 A321XLRs, seven A350F freighters and four A330neos.

The deal from Indigo Partners, the first major aircraft order since the pandemic began, was a ""very positive signal that we [are starting] to be on the front foot again,"" Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury told CNBC during the show. Kuwaiti airline Jazeera Airways committed to 28 Airbus A321neos, and Nigeria's Ibom Air committed to its first Airbus purchase with an order for 10 A220s. The popularity of narrow-body jets at this year's air show came as a surprise to some analysts, who say the Middle East event is more known for orders of wide-body planes used for longer-haul flights. On the military side, Airbus also sold two A330 Multi Role Tanker Transports, an aerial refueling tanker aircraft, to the UAE Air Force and Air Defense, and clinched a new export order for two A400M airlifters from the Indonesian Ministry of Defense. Boeing saw some relief on Tuesday with a large order of 72 of its 737 Max from new Indian airline Akasa Air. It also had success with freighters, with orders for 11 of its 737-800BCF cargo planes from aircraft leasing company Icelease, nine converted 767-300BCF freighters from DHL, and orders for two of its long-range 777F freighters from Emirates SkyCargo. The American aerospace giant also received four orders of passenger planes and freighters from Air Tanzania and three of its widebody 777-300 passenger jets from UAE-based aviation services provider Sky One FZE.

Cargo planes and converted freighters are a hot sub-sector of the aviation industry as e-commerce booms and air shipment grows. Cargo is the only air traffic segment that has gone above 2019 levels. For Dubai's flagship carried Emirates Airline alone, cargo operations in its latest half-year earnings were robust, seeing a 39% increase and bringing the business to 90% of the volume it had pre-pandemic. ""The freighter markets are on fire right now. That's where we see real growth,"" Stan Deal, executive vice president of Boeing, told CNBC in Dubai on Sunday. The company plans to add three conversion lines — facilities that convert aircraft to freighters — for its 737-800BCF across North America and Europe. Boeing has long dominated the air cargo market, but its French rival Airbus could threaten that with its A350F, a cargo version of its widebody passenger A350-1000, ordered for the first time in Dubai this week.

Pilot report: an Airbus H145 pilot evaluates the 5-blade upgrade - Vertical Magazine,"Mon, 08 Nov 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvcGlsb3QtcmVwb3J0LWFpcmJ1cy1oMTQ1LWZpdmUtYmxhZGUtdXBncmFkZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"While there are plenty of great reasons to have an intuitive and expeditious quick-start procedure, getting the air conditioning up and running on a mid-August day in Mississippi is as good as any I’ve heard. Fortunately our helicopter of choice for the day was an Airbus H145 D3, the first example of the five-bladed helicopter in North America and configured as a demonstrator for the UH-72B Lakota. With one of the quickest starts of any twin on the market, we were ready to go skids up in remarkably short order.

Departing from the ramp at the Airbus Helicopters final assembly line in Columbus, Mississippi, the primary purpose of our flight was to evaluate the UH-72B Lakota’s suitability and performance as the National Guard’s newest utility helicopter — stay tuned for that report in an upcoming issue of Vertical Valor. However, given the nature of the Lakota program as a commercial-off-the-shelf helicopter, the aircraft we flew also doubled as a demonstrator for the commercial market. As a part-time Guardsman whose civilian employment coincidentally involves flying both the H145 (BK117 D2) and EC145 (BK117 C2), I was equally as intrigued to see how the new five-bladed H145 D3 would perform for traditional civil aviation roles.

It would be impossible to properly discuss the H145 D3 without first addressing the initial jump from the EC145 to the H145 D2. To the casual observer it’s easy to dismiss the upgrades as a mild improvement or simply a name change for the sake of branding from “EC” to “H,” with the addition of a Fenestron tail rotor often being viewed as the only noteworthy difference. This perception has contributed to the popularity of the EC145e in the North American market for budget-conscious operators who view the H145 D2 as an unnecessary upgrade.

While budgetary constraints are an unavoidable reality for many operators, the view of the H145 D2 as simply a minor upgrade doesn’t comport with the reality of operating the aircraft. As a pilot who flies both types on a daily basis, it’s hard to overstate how drastically the workload and stress are reduced when flying the H145 D2 vs. the EC145 — from the full authority digital engine control (FADEC) quick start procedure, to the twin Garmin GTN 750 touchscreen flight navigators, synthetic vision, better visibility, Helionix multi-function displays, and four-axis autopilot, not to mention the vastly increased performance and range.

The improvement is drastic for even visual flight rules (VFR) operations, but it’s beyond compare when it comes to single-pilot instrument flight rules (SPIFR), making those operations not only safer, but exponentially more feasible for pilots with minimal actual instrument time making the transition to an IFR operator. After becoming accustomed to the ease of SPIFR operations in the H145 D2, it feels almost risky to step back into legacy airframes.

While the large list of changes revolutionized the aircraft, some of them led to what many operators perceive as a significant increase in felt vibrations, notably in the cabin. For the civil market — particularly helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS) and VIP operations, where ride quality is of the utmost importance — this was especially detrimental.

By developing the five-bladed H145 (BK117 D3), Airbus set out to radically improve the ride quality and performance of the legacy BK117 rotor system. The new system is based off that of the H135, scaled up, with an additional blade. The blades are mounted directly to the mast, making the system simpler, lighter, and easier to maintain than the original rotor system.

There have been several pieces written detailing the process and engineering behind this, but put simply from a pilot’s perspective, the changes most decidedly worked. The H145 D3 is in fact a helicopter, which is to say some vibrations are still apparent, particularly when passing through effective translational lift (ETL), but they are drastically reduced and mostly noticeable only when actively focusing on them. For those accustomed to flying in the H145 D2, it’s a surreal experience on initial pickup and it feels glassy smooth through all regimes of flight. If it’s not outright the smoothest helicopter I’ve flown, it’s certainly close. Additionally and arguably even more importantly, the ride quality in the cabin is a marked improvement over the H145 D2, even more so than in the cockpit area.

With less componentry associated with the rotor system and the elimination of the anti-vibration system, the helicopter has also gained an additional 330 pounds (150 kilograms) of useful load. You won’t often hear this from a helicopter pilot, but I’ve always felt the H145 D2 has more than enough power, particularly when compared to the EC145 and its other competitors. Admittedly, this is in part due to my operating near to sea level, but even at low density altitudes, many helicopters lack sufficient power to operate anywhere near the advertised max gross weight with out of ground effect (OGE) power.

Following the author’s test flight, the H145 departed on a North American demo tour, where it showed off its high-altitude performance. Dirk Collins Photo

The D2 regularly has no issue being flown right up to max gross weight without running into power limitations for vertical takeoffs or Cat A profiles. Even more impressively, it maintains single-engine out of ground effect hover capabilities throughout a substantial portion of the flight, leaving a tremendous margin in terms of safety. With the improved performance of the five-bladed H145 D3, any concerns about power go from being rare, to almost a non-factor for all but high-altitude mountain operations. Even there, the H145 D3 is capable of operating in many areas that were previously only accessible in high-performance single-engine helicopters.

During our flight, Airbus instructor pilot Aaron Hupp demonstrated several engine failures in varying regimes of flight, using the training button which presents a remarkably accurate simulation of a single-engine failure. At all but the highest of gross weights while in an OGE hover, this is very much a non-event, and even then, it’s much less of an emotional moment than in many other twins. As someone who regularly conducts rooftop helipad operations in heavily congested metropolitan areas with limited escapes, this type of performance is comforting, to say the least.

While these changes have built off and improved an already impressive base, they unfortunately haven’t impacted the cruise speed. Much like the D2, it still maintains right around 120 knots in level flight, leaving this as the sole noteworthy area left for improvement on the type when it comes to performance.

From the author’s perspective, the upgrades made to the H145 D3 “most decidedly worked.” Michael Tosi Photo

Outside of the rotor system, the H145 D2 to D3 is very much an evolutionary upgrade, but it’s still clear Airbus has listened intently to operators during the development process. The list of issues or changes I would have made to the H145 D2 was fairly short to start with and remarkably, Airbus has managed to address quite literally all of them. These included improvements to the air conditioning system (very noticeable on an August day in Mississippi), upping mast moment limits, some minor autopilot adjustments, automatic flight control system tweaks to address yaw oscillations while on steep approaches descending through ETL, and the addition of an auxiliary hydraulic pump for the flight control check.

The H145 D2 is an excellent helicopter and truly revolutionary when compared to its predecessor, but the persistent issues with vibrations have kept it from being truly great, particularly for its primary markets where ride quality is paramount. This combined with budgetary concerns has led to slower adoption of the H145 D2 in the North American market than in Europe.

While the five-bladed H145 D3 is a progressive improvement to the type, when combined with the drastic advances made with the D2, it brings together the whole package and puts the aircraft into a class of its own. As performance, safety, and capabilities of the type continue to improve at such a drastic clip, it will become increasingly difficult for operators to stick with legacy models.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9996397495269775}",neutral,0.9996397495269775,0

Cements Position as America’s Greenest Airline with New A321s Achieving 119MPG Per Seat

DENVER, Nov. 14, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Frontier Airlines (NASDAQ: ULCC) today announced a major fleet expansion with an order for 91 additional A321neo aircraft from leading aircraft manufacturer Airbus as part of a larger joint aircraft order across the Indigo Partners portfolio.



“These additional A321neo aircraft will enable us to triple the size of the airline by 2029,” said Barry Biffle, president and CEO, Frontier Airlines. “We are already America’s Greenest Airline with an existing fleet that is 43 percent more fuel efficient, on average per seat, than other U.S. carriers. The A321neo is expected to deliver nearly 120 ASMs per gallon, further advancing our industry-leading environmental efforts while debunking the myth that being green is an expensive investment only achievable in the future.”

The new aircraft are scheduled for delivery between 2023 and 2029. They are in addition to Frontier’s existing orderbook of 143 aircraft to be delivered between 2022 and 2028, bringing the airline’s total aircraft on order to 234. By the end of 2029, Frontier’s total fleet size is expected to include 272 aircraft.

""Frontier has truly capitalized on the efficiency of the A321neo to offer passengers a flying experience that is both affordable and also kinder to the environment,"" said C. Jeffrey Knittel, chairman and CEO of Airbus Americas.

Frontier currently has 112 aircraft in its fleet. Of the 234 new aircraft on order, 76 are A320neo aircraft and 158 are A321neo aircraft. Eighteen of the A320neo aircraft include conversion rights to A321XLR aircraft. The Company currently flies to more than 100 destinations within the U.S., Mexico, Caribbean and Latin America and is undergoing significant expansion within both its domestic and international route networks.

About Frontier Airlines:

Frontier Airlines (NASDAQ: ULCC) is committed to “Low Fares Done Right.” Headquartered in Denver, Colorado, the company operates more than 100 A320 family aircraft and has the largest A320neo fleet in the U.S. The use of these aircraft, Frontier’s seating configuration, weight-saving tactics and baggage process have all contributed to the airline’s average of 43 percent fuel savings compared to other U.S. airlines (fuel savings is based on Frontier Airlines’ 2019 fuel consumption per seat-mile compared to the weighted average of major U.S. airlines), which makes Frontier the most fuel-efficient U.S. airline. Frontier is also committed to families enabling children 14 years and younger to fly free through the airline’s Discount Den travel club on qualifying flights. With more than 230 new Airbus planes on order, Frontier will continue to grow to deliver on the mission of providing affordable travel across America.

Release Date November 14, 2021 Airbus tees up early A350 freighter orders with Air Lease Purchase a PDF of this article

Dubai — Airbus is nearing the announcement of its first A350 freighter orders, anchored by lessor Air Lease Corp. and one other yet-to-be determined cargo carrier, according to people familiar with the company’s planning. The leasing giant is said to be in advanced discussions with the European plane maker to provide the company its first orders for the new freighter.

Air Lease has been at the forefront of Airbus’s two most recent new single-aisle aircraft development programs, including its A321XLR in 2019 and its A321LR in 2015.

Both Boeing and Airbus are riding a wave of demand for dedicated and converted freighter aircraft as the pandemic has sidelined the ample bellies of large twin-aisle passengers used for carrying cargo and a long-term boom in global e-commerce.

Airbus is said to also be in talks with UPS, FedEx Express, and the cargo units of Singapore Airlines, Cathay Pacific and Lufthansa, the latter three being existing A350 passenger operators. The plane maker formally launched the freighter variant of its latest twin-aisle aircraft earlier this year.

Further, Etihad, based in nearby Abu Dhabi, is currently working with Airbus to renegotiate its order of single-aisle A320neo family aircraft, potentially swapping the 26 aircraft for an undetermined number of A350 freighters, the person said. Other possible candidates for launch could be the new merged Korean Air and Asiana Airlines. The latter has 21 existing A350-900 and -1000 passenger aircraft on order and those could be converted to freighters.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999995231628418}",neutral,0.999995231628418,0

Airbus details A350F specifications - Leeham News and Analysis,"Thu, 11 Nov 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMS8xMS8xMS9haXJidXMtZGV0YWlscy1hMzUwZi1zcGVjaWZpY2F0aW9ucy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Scott Hamilton and Bjorn Fehrm

November 11, 2021, © Leeham News: Airbus has given more information about what led to their new freighter, the A350F, and its data. Scott Hamilton talked to Airbus Chief Commercial Officer Christian Scherer at the IATA AGM on Oct. 3-5 in Boston, and Bjorn Fehrm spoke to Head of Freighter marketing, Crawford Hamilton, about the technical details. (The two Hamiltons are not related.)

The A350F is the most capable new-build freighter Airbus has designed, posing the most serious threat to Boeing’s dominance of jet freighters since the dawn of the jet age. Some expect Boeing to respond next week with a program launch of the 777XF, but LNA understands this won’t be the case.

“The market has asked us to produce it,” said Scherer of the A350F. “So we launched the program based on our own belief of the strength of the business case.”

“The A350F beats the competing production freighter (Boeing’s 777F, our note) on payload, volume, and economics,” says Crawford Hamilton. “We have taken extra care to make the door larger and the floor extra sturdy to ease loading planning and execution. The A350F will be the freight forwarder’s preferred machine.”

The background to the A350F

Airbus launched the A350F without firm launch customers, an unusual move. “We have launched this program on the basis of our own belief of the strength of the business case,” Scherer said in an interview with LNA during the IATA AGM Oct. 3-5 in Boston. “The market has asked us to produce it. The market dynamic that has given birth to this program is one, the very fact, and I think that’s the most important one, that it is some of our customers who came to us and said, this looks like a really good idea. This wasn’t a bunch of guys somewhere in an office in Toulouse saying, ‘Oh, let’s do a freighter.’ This was a market-generated demand stimulated by the fact that I think the market felt it needed competition.”

“The other thing is the ICAO edict that Boeing 777s and 767s will not meet emissions standards,” Scherer said. The 777-200LRF and 767, with designs dating to the 1990s and 1980s, can’t be produced after 2027 under ICAO standards. The A350F and the prospective 777XF will.

Getting it right this time

Scherer said that the A350 with its structure, in particular the A350-1000 version, “which is the world’s longest-range airplane, has a structural capability that previous Airbus airplanes did not have to receive the density of heavy cargo and not just packaged freight.”

Airbus’ previous freighters fell short on structure. “The A300 is a very good package freighter. It’s not a heavy-duty freighter,” Scherer said. “The mistake Airbus made [with the A330-200F] was to say, ‘Look, we don’t have an airplane that is really capable of that having density, but we want that range.’ We developed the 330 freighter on the basis of the -200, and that was the mistake. We should have done it on the -300, because the 200, even though it’s got a little better structural capability than the -300 still doesn’t have the structural capability for the heavy freight. We should’ve gone for volumetric payload, as opposed to trying to compromise between structural payload and volume. We’re not making that same mistake [with the A350] because we’re starting with the bigger module.”

Yet, making the A350 a freighter was nevertheless an afterthought when designing the airplane.

The 787 doesn’t lend itself well to a freighter. Boeing has a challenge with doing a cargo door in a barrel composite airplane. Airbus chose the panel approach for the A350. Was Airbus thinking about a cargo version of the airplane, or did it just happen to work out that way?

“It’s tempting to say it was all part of a grand plan,” Scherer said candidly.

The A350F, larger and more capable

The A350F is based on the A350-1000 in its highest Maximum TakeOff Weight (MTOW) variant, the 319t model. The A350-1000 is shortened with five frames ahead of the wing, so the center of gravity is kept in an optimal place for the freighter (Figure 2).

The A350F is still 6.9m longer than the Boeing 777F, which is based on the shorter 777-200LR. This gives the A350F a 10% larger freighter volume at 695m3 compared with 633m3 for the 777F. The A350F volume is the same as the main deck volume of the Boeing 747-8F.

The A350F also takes a higher payload at 109t versus 103.7t, a 4.5% increase over the 777F. The design freight density is 157kg/m3 (9.8lb/ft3) versus 164kg/m3 (10.2lb/ft3) for the 777F.

The A350-1000 is reinforced to take this higher payload (the max payload for a standard A350-1000 is 63t). The reinforcements are in the main deck aluminum floor beams which are made extra strong so that the loadmaster doesn’t have to place heavy pallets at specific positions in the aircraft.

The extra-large maindeck cargo door is placed behind the wing so that the loading of cargo can’t make the aircraft sit on its tail (pallets are moved to the front before the rear is filled up).

A big portion of the 46t increase in payload over the A350-1000 comes from a lighter aircraft. When the passenger cabin is removed, and the aircraft is shortened, a whopping 30t is removed from the empty weight of the A350-1000. This makes the A350F 20t lighter than the 777F.

Airbus claims this difference in empty weight and the more modern engines (Rolls-Royce Trent XWB 97k) give the A350F a clear advantage in operating cost. We will do our checks of the economics of the competitors using our airliner performance model in a coming article.

2025 EIS—and Boeing’s response

Airbus targets late 2025 for entry-into-service. If it meets this target, or even if it slips into 2026, EIS could be years ahead of the still-to-be-launched Boeing next generation freighter, the 777XF.

The 777XF, based on the 777X, was based on the ultra-long-range 777-8. But following the 737 MAX grounding and COVID crisis, Boeing put the development of the -8 on hold, and by it, the 777XF. The original business plan for the 777X program called for EIS of the 777-9, followed by two years of the 777-8 passenger model and two years later by the 777XF, which was to be based largely on the -8. The original timeline was the first quarter of 2020 (with some hope for 4Q2019), 2022, and 2024, respectively.

EIS for the 777-9 has slipped nearly four years. The target is now late 2023. Technical issues with the giant GE9X engines caused an initial delay of about nine months. Then, the MAX grounding and certification issues caused a knock-on effect to the 777X certification. The COVID pandemic wiped out international passenger demand for which the 777X was designed. The best estimates for demand recovery are 2023, though most see full recovery not occurring until 2024 or even 2025.

The strong freighter market and the upcoming ICAO recommendations about engine emissions have moved the plans for a 777X freighter ahead of the 777-8. Boeing recognizes that with the ICAO standards looming, it must go forward with a new freighter. CEO David Calhoun, on the Oct. 26 3Q earnings call and in previous events, said Boeing is likely to launch the XF program.

He gave no timeline, but Bloomberg News suggests a program launch could come at the Dubai Air Show Nov. 14-18. This timeline seems aggressive. Market intelligence suggests Boeing won’t have an XF EIS ready until 2029, more than a year after the production of the 777LRF and 767F must end—and up to four years after the targeted EIS for the A350F. LNA is told the 777XF program launch is unlikely before 2022.
