Airbus workers to disrupt production in France - FRANCE 24 English,"Mon, 26 Apr 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyYW5jZTI0LmNvbS9lbi8yMDEwMDQyNi1haXJidXMtd29ya2Vycy1oYWx0LXByb2R1Y3Rpb24tZnJhbmNlLXN0cmlrZS11bmlvbi1hZXJvc3BhY2XSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"AEROSPACE

AFP - Airbus workers decided to disrupt plane production across France on Monday to press demands for better pay and new hires, union officials said.

Starting at noon, thousands of workers at the main Toulouse plant and in factories in Nantes and Saint-Nazaire in western France were to halt work on some assembly lines and block parts deliveries.

The protest action came amid tough negotiations over pay rises and resistance to moves to shift production to Germany.

""It is the first time that the five unions have mobilised together on the issue of salaries, work conditions and jobs,"" said Alain Milhau, from the CGT union.

Union officials said production of A330 and A340 long-haul planes would be disrupted on Monday and that rotating strikes would affect the A320 assembly lines on Tuesday before moving to the A380 on Wednesday.

In Toulouse, unions called on workers to block deliveries of plane parts on Monday and a full strike was planned for Friday.

Airbus workers downed tools for 90 minutes last Friday and vowed then to step up their action if no better offer from management was made.

Management is offering a 1.9 percent salary increase for 2010 but the unions are seeking 3.5 percent, a pay hike comparable to the 2009 level.

Unions argue production has suffered from the massive Power 8 restructuring plan in 2007 that led to 10,000 job cuts, and are calling for new hires.

Airbus has countered that it has added 1,700 employees to its payroll in 2009, half of whom work in France and that 1,500 more will be hired this year.

Worries among Airbus employees have been heightened with the recent decision to move production of the medium-haul A320 to Germany.

""The A320 programme is the company's lifeblood and while German workers have the right to earn a living, so do the French workers,"" said union official Jean-Francois Knepper.

""If Airbus wants to keep all of the ailing programmes in Toulouse, we can see that France will be getting that part of the industry that is doomed,"" he said.

Airbus plans A320 life-extension - Asian Aviation,"Sun, 11 Apr 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vYXNpYW5hdmlhdGlvbi5jb20vYWlyYnVzLXBsYW5zLWEzMjAtbGlmZS1leHRlbnNpb24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Having overseen reductions in required maintenance frequency for the A320 single-aisle twinjet family, Airbus is now working to understand the design’s ultimate service potential. The goal is to extend the type’s operational life beyond its nominal 48,000 flight cycles (FC) and 60,000 flight hours (FH).

“Customers’ in-service experience, along with [our] own fleet-monitoring data supports extending the service goal,” says ESG programme head Clemens Hermann.

More than 20 years after delivering the first A320, and with over 4,000 examples of the model and its variants in service, Airbus has analysed the type’s operational and maintenance experience and established an “extended service goal (ESG)” development programme that includes major full-scale fatigue tests.

If its targets are achieved, the programme will permit operators to fly their fleets for longer, increasing revenue and benefiting from enhanced residual value, according to the manufacturer. The move follows a general reduction in the frequency of regular in-service maintenance tasks, based on feedback from operators’ experience.

The 4,110-strong A320-family fleet includes about 50 variants and sub-variants of the basic design, including A318, A319, A320, A321 and Airbus Corporate Jet models powered variously by CFM International CFM56-5, International Aero Engines (IAE) V2500 or Pratt & Whitney (P&W) PW6000 turbofan engines. Under a common maintenance programme, principal maintenance tasks are governed by configuration (including service-bulletin and modification status), annual utilisation, and operator policy.

Airbus’s overall intention is to extend the scheduled maintenance programme up to 90,000FC and 180,000FH through two steps, dubbed “ESG1” and “ESG2”. The initial step, planned for introduction this year, is aimed at providing operators with a service goal of 60,000FC/120,000FH.

The manufacturer says the programme will “achieve a balanced development of [airframe] structural potential and optimised maintenance activities” for the A320 family. ESG1 development tests conducted at the company’s headquarters in Toulouse, France, and its German base in Munich have involved some 120,000 simulated flights, each characterised by monitored operational data that Airbus has collected from operators. These development tests have been followed in the ESG programme by detailed inspection, preparation, and decision phases.

Airbus has run four major fatigue tests as part of the overall A320 aircraft programme. These are focussed on the forward fuselage, engine pylon, rear fuselage, centre fuselage and wings. Subsequent testing, which simulates up to 180,000FC and 360,000FH and is planned to continue until next year, aims to validate the higher 90,000FC/180,000FH ESG2 service goal.

“These aircraft have impressive reliability,” says Clemens Hermann, Airbus’s A320-family life-extension programme project leader. “Customers’ in-service experience, along with [our] own fleet-monitoring data supports extending the service goal. A huge number of A320-family aircraft have experienced no major fatigue findings, [which] has encouraged Airbus to do these tests.”

A320s are subject to industry-standard MSG-3 provisions, under which historic ‘A’ and ‘C’ maintenance check intervals have become flexible. Tasks now carry FC, FH, or calendar-time maximum intervals that permit operators to optimise MRO planning, with the A- and C-check labels still used generically.

According to Airbus, A320 operators adjust maintenance intervals to suit their own schedules. For example, one has adopted a 20-month C-check cycle, distributing six-year tasks between 60- and 80-month checks to ensure maximum aircraft availability, while another operator uses 24- month C checks to save one heavy-maintenance shop visit every six years.

Good “in-service experience feedback” from operators has contributed to the introduction of extended A320 scheduled-task intervals that Airbus says have reduced maintenance costs by up to 70 percent since service entry in 1988. For example, FH intervals for C-check equivalent work have grown by a third, while the frequency of heavy-maintenance shop visits has fallen by half and the typical period between A-check equivalent jobs has increased by 70 percent.

Specifically, maintenance tasks scheduled in the original 350-FH A-check may now be performed at any time up to maximum intervals of 600 FH, 750 FC, or 100 days. Likewise, the 15-month C-check interval has become a 20-month, 6,000-FH, or 4,500-FC minimum frequency and permitted intervals between heavy checks have grown from four and eight years to six and 12 years.

A further 25 percent increase in A-check intervals (to 750 FH, 750 FC, or 120 days, or a combination) has been agreed by the A320 Industry Steering Committee (ISC), while airworthiness authorities – led by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) – have approved the Maintenance Review Board Report (MRBR) adopting the longer intervals, which now appear in the A320 maintenance-planning document.

The ISC launched “an evolution exercise” in 2009 under which it might extend C-check intervals by a further 20 percent this year. The resulting 24-month/7,500-FH/5,000-FC interval, if subsequently approved, would enable maintenance planners to synchronise such activity with the existing six- and 12-year heavy-check intervals.

In response to demand from operators in Asia, especially from low-cost carriers, Lufthansa Technik Philippines has established A320 maintenance capacity to accommodate two aircraft simultaneously. This work has begun with the provision of A and C checks for local customer Philippine Airlines."
Airbus makes headway on A350 catalogue | News | Flight Global - Flightglobal,"Thu, 29 Apr 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYWlyYnVzLW1ha2VzLWhlYWR3YXktb24tYTM1MC1jYXRhbG9ndWUvOTMxNTYuYXJ0aWNsZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus's catalogue for the A350 XWB is taking shape, with the airframer having completed the selection on the majority of suppliers for its initial book.

""Most of the work packages for the cabin are on board and we are in the middle of the joint definition phase. Most of them are even being finalised so they start the detailed design by the end of this year,"" says head of A350 XWB product offering Alexander Herkner.

For supplier furnished equipment, such as lavatories and galleys, Airbus is taking a modular customisation approach. Galley inserts follow Arinc standards for flexibility and ease in exchanging equipment.

For in-flight entertainment and connectivity, the airframer is largely forgoing a traditional buyer furnished equipment (BFE) approach. Instead, it has designated an ""Airbus contracted supplier"" (ACS) category for these items to ensure suppliers participate in the joint definition phase of the programme and understand the design language of the cabin early on.

To date, Airbus has signed ACS deals with B/E Aerospace, Recaro and Zodiac Group unit Weber Aircraft for the provision of economy-class seats and with EADS Sogerma for premium-class seats.

""The initial offering should be three economy-class products and three business-class products,"" says Herkner, noting that the airframer ""intends to add two more products"" to the premium segment.

Additionally, he says, to offer ""more differentiation"" in the premium cabin, airlines are permitted to ""go for a classical BFE approach"". However, this can only be arranged with one of the ACS suppliers and is limited to premium seats.

For in-flight entertainment, airlines can choose hardware from Panasonic Avionics or Thales. An ACS agreement has already been signed with the former, and Herkner says a deal with Thales is being finalised.

Carriers that select Panasonic IFE hardware will be offered a choice of two in-flight connectivity solutions. The first comprises Panasonic's own connectivity platform for Ku-band satellite-based high-speed internet plus mobile connectivity courtesy of partner AeroMobile. The second entails Airbus's Airline Network Architecture version 2 (ALNA V2), a modular connectivity platform that uses the Inmarsat SwiftBroadband aeronautical service over L-band satellites and supports mobile connectivity and wi-fi services from Airbus/Sita joint venture OnAir.

Theoretically, says Herkner, additional in-flight entertainment and connectivity solutions could be offered in the future. He notes that Airbus is also looking for more standardisation on the integration of IFE into seats, and this can be optimised under the ACS process.

By employing a more modular approach in the cabin, and avoiding a lot of complex engineering work after an airline has placed its order, Airbus believes it can shave at least four months off the lead time that an airline needs to decide on customising its A350s.

On current programmes, airlines need to make catalogue choices about a year before delivery and then face a lot of engineering work. ""We want to shorten this time. We have a vision to go to something like eight months,"" says Herkner.

If airlines freeze their configurations at a later point, it also means less working capital for Airbus, adds A350 programme manager Didier Evrard.

The A350 is due to enter into service in mid-2013 with Qatar Airways.

From Boeing to Airbus - EX-YU Aviation News,"Sat, 10 Apr 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4eXVhdmlhdGlvbi5jb20vMjAxMC8wNC9mcm9tLWJvZWluZy10by1haXJidXMuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"B&H’s Boeing B737-700 in doubt

B&H Airlines is never short of being confusing and events this week have only confirmed this even further. For the past few months the management at Bosnia and Herzegovina’s national carrier has claimed that the airline will receive 1 Boeing B737-700 this summer, to replace the Boeing B737-400. Now however, Government officials say that B&H will receive an Airbus A319.

During the week, Turkish Airlines and the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina signed an agreement which will see both sides fork out 8 million Covertable Marks (4 million Euros) for the national carrier. A Government official told the “Dnevni avaz” newspaper that the airline will receive a new aircraft during the summer season, most probably an Airbus A319. He also mentioned that the Bosnian Government gave an advance payment to Airbus years ago for the purchase of a new plane for B&H. However, the money is still with Airbus and further payments were never made. He hopes that this issue will also be resolved soon. No mention was made of Boeing.

The Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina last week also announced that B&H Airlines is 1 of 2 publicly owned companies to record financial losses in 2009 although it did not specify how big of a loss the airline recorded."
Aircraft wing worker for the world - Reinforced Plastics,"Tue, 20 Apr 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlaW5mb3JjZWRwbGFzdGljcy5jb20vY29udGVudC9mZWF0dXJlcy9haXJjcmFmdC13aW5nLXdvcmtlci1mb3ItdGhlLXdvcmxkL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"GKN Aerospace is heavily involved in the manufacture of the composite wings for the new Airbus A350 aircraft. George Marsh visited the company's Filton, UK, site to see the composites technologies involved.

Boeing has established a new level of composites penetration in civil airliners with its 50% reinforced plastic B787 Dreamliner. However, Europe’s Airbus Industrie looks set to trump even this, albeit by a narrow margin, since its new A350 XWB (extra wide body), now in gestation, is advertised as being some 53% plastic. Practically all of the A350’s visible airframe – wings, fuselage, empennage, nacelles and control surfaces – will be very largely of carbon composite.

This is good news for the aerospace composites supply chain and good news for UK industry which, as long-time builder of Airbus wings, is to construct the extensively composite wings for all three variants of the A350, the -800, -900 and -1000. A major player in the wing build programme is GKN Aerospace, now installed on the site at Filton, near Bristol, that it acquired from Airbus in January 2009, with the aim of making it an acknowledged global centre for designing and building advanced wings for new-generation passenger jets.

Airbus was already building primarily metal wings for the full range of Airbus commercial aircraft in the UK. With the acquisition of the Airbus manufacturing operation at Filton, GKN Aerospace has inherited this work for the lives of the aircraft programmes concerned, and is adding the ability to produce composite wing assemblies.

Wing ambitions

GKN Aerospace needed new Europe-based facilities in order to achieve its wing ambitions. The chance to co-locate itself with Airbus UK (which retains the rest of the site) in a refurbished facility at Filton not only offered the space needed to assemble large A350 wing sections in parallel production streams able to turn out anything up to 14 aircraft sets per month, but also fitted in with its wider aim to produce wings for other new aircraft as well.

In line with the expected high composite content of those new-generation wings, the company is commissioning about now (early Spring), a new advanced composites production facility at Weston Approach, close to its major Filton site. This features the latest in production automation to meet airframer requirements for a continuous stream of wings that meet ever more stringent standards for aerodynamic efficiency, low weight and affordability.

Together, these two sites, along with its original facility at Cowes, Isle of Wight, UK, underpin GKN Aerospace’s drive to become an ‘advanced wing maker for the world,’ as Frank Bamford, senior vice president business development and strategy, puts it.

Bamford explains that the company is investing some $280 million over five years in its risk sharing partnership with Airbus to design and build the fixed trailing edge (FTE) section of the A350 wing. This comprises the fixed internal wing structure aft of the main wing box, but excluding the carbon wing skins, for which Airbus plants in Germany and Spain are responsible. The most significant part of the GKN Aerospace contribution is the rear spar, the crucial longitudinal strength member that forms the after edge of the central wing box and supports all the fixed sub-structures that carry the movable surfaces and, in the inboard portion, landing gear fixtures. The spar is subject to high loadings and stresses, a situation that favours composites with their high strength/low weight characteristics, tailorability and high fatigue tolerance.

Thorough material characterisation and painstaking design are pre-requisites for an optimum structure, of course, and GKN Aerospace can call on its extensive experience in engineering a wide range of composite items for aircraft including nacelles, flight control surfaces, cowls, ducts, engine fan blades and containment casings. It produces the primary composite wing spar for the Airbus A400M military airlifter and wing trailing edge sections for the world’s largest airliner, the Airbus A380. Not that its wing work is entirely Airbus focussed; it also produces the wing leading edge ice protection system for the B787, recently won a contract to build performance-enhancing composite winglets for Bombardier’s new C-Series airliner and also produces winglet structures for Aviation Partners-Boeing. Its sites in the USA manufacture wing spars for the Lockheed F22 fighter, airframe structures for unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) and parts for various business and light jets. All these components have substantial or majority composite content.

A350 wing

The Airbus-designed wing for the A350 wing is a largely composite assembly, though with ribs, internal frames and certain other sub-structures of metal. The wing’s beam strength derives from a central wing box in which two full-span spars form the forward and rear faces of the box. The spars have to be of carbon composite, both for weight saving and so that their coefficient of thermal expansion matches that of the wing’s carbon composite outer envelope.

GKN Aerospace is responsible for the rear spar and assembling it to all the fixed structure that attaches to it, these together comprising the fixed trailing edge (FTE). The composite spar, along with its attached structures, is produced in three 10 m sections that are joined for final checks before the full FTE is disassembled again for transportation to Airbus UK’s wing final assembly facility at Broughton, North Wales, where the complete wing is integrated.

The most substantial, inboard, FTE spar section weighs some 500 kg and includes the tough spar root with composite laminates up to some 25-30 mm thick. The mid-section, which has many attachment points, weighs about 150 kg, while the outboard section weighs 100 kg. Each spar section is produced by laying composite tows onto a large rotating mandrel, the formed part subsequently being autoclave cured under slight pressure. The spar tool is of Inconel metal and the mandrel for laying up spar sections is of carbon, in high modulus grade so that deflection is minimised. The mandrel concept contrasts with traditional metallic tooling philosophies, resulting in lighter, more affordable tooling.

Hexcel’s M21E pre-impregnated carbon/epoxy composite material, as specified by Airbus, is used throughout. Comprising a toughened epoxy resin reinforced with unidirectional carbon fibres, this system confers superior mechanical properties, in particular high impact resistance. Advanced 5-axis automated fibre placement (AFP) machines, purpose-designed and built by M. Torres in Spain, each wind 0.25-inch-wide tapes from up to 16 bobbins via a pulley system onto the rotating mandrel. Machines can be programmed to lay varying thicknesses of material onto the mandrels and can, for instance, build up thickness locally to provide integral pads for rib attachment points along the spar.

“AFP is part of our drive for a high level of automation so that we can efficiently produce wing sections to a consistent high quality while requiring as little manual work as possible,” comments chief engineer Chris Gear. “It will enable us to achieve high production rates so that we can meet our commitments as A350 production builds to a possible 14 aircraft a month. We’re also incorporating robotic drilling and machining and assembly.”

Interestingly, GKN Aerospace developed automatic tape laying (ATL) technology for its previous similar project, the spar for the A400M. (This is claimed to be the first major primary structure to be produced in carbon composite for the wing of a large transport aircraft).

ATL machinery at Cowes can lay up composite tapes 150 mm or 300 mm wide at the rate of about 18 kg (40 lb) of material per hour compared to hand lay-up rates of just 1-3 lb/hr for a similar item. For the A400M spar, the resulting flat laminate is then formed to the required ’C’ section spar shape over a heated tool, using a double-diaphragm press forming technique. The part is then put into an autoclave for final cure.

For the A350, however, automated fibre placement (AFP) is the preferred lay-up method. This is partly because the toughened resin used in the Hexcel M21E prepreg flows less readily than that in Cytec’s 977-2 used for the A400M spar, and partly because of the ability of AFP to produce more complex shapes. The A350 wing has significant curvature, particularly in the inboard sections where the profile is distinctly gull-winged. While ATL is viewed as excellent at producing large, reasonably flat structures, it can cause composite fibre buckling in more highly shaped components. AFP, on the other hand, while no better at laying up large flat surfaces, is accurate over more extreme curves and changes in direction because it uses narrower, independently controlled separate tapes to make up varying laminate thicknesses, including three-dimensional features.

Both methods enhance quality consistency and accuracy. ATL, for example, can produce the 14 m (45.9 ft) spars for the A400M wing to a dimensional tolerance of 0.5 mm. The metallic equivalent usually has to be adjusted during the build process. The method also enables the company to achieve void content as little as 1-1.5%, compared with 4% considered a more normal value for hand lay-up. AFP results in similar dimensional precision and laminate quality, while being potentially faster.

Essentially, each A350 spar section is layed on the mandrel, which is a long four-sided box, with cross-section, profile and wall thickness all varying according to location along the span. The AFP machine can lay two 10 m spars at one time, these subsequently being removed and placed onto a metal mould tool for curing in an autoclave.

Composite work takes place at the new Weston Approach facility near Filton in a 5000 m2 clean area. Two M. Torres winding machines are at one end of this space while a number of autoclaves plus ultrasonic testing and finishing facilities occupy the remainder. As production rate increases, more machines will be added in the clean room to cope with the volume.

At the time of a recent visit by Reinforced Plastics to Filton, GKN Aerospace had produced and evaluated a prototype composite spar for Airbus’ A350 wing box demonstrator and was preparing to embark on series production. The prototype milestone was achieved by a collaborative team comprising engineers from GKN Aerospace sites in Munich in Germany, Cowes and Filton, and utilised expertise gained at Cowes in manufacturing the A400M spars. Completed A350 production spars will be moved from the composites centre to the Filton assembly facility where they will be integrated with other fixed trailing edge components. Each FTE is assembled on a fixture, the spar section being placed therein hollow face up so that it can be drilled and machined as necessary, and the various ‘A’ frames, fitments and other structures can be attached.

Evolution

Chris Gear emphasises that the pace of composite manufacturing evolution is rapid, with significant changes being evident between successive generations of wing manufacture. Resin film infusion was developed for the Airbus A380 ‘superjumbo’ FTEs, designed by the company at the start of the millenium and in build from that time. ATL technology followed and went into production on the A400M spar in 2004. AFP is making its debut on the A350 FTE production line this year.

On the assembly side, another sign of evolution is the difference between the A380 and A350 programmes over the basic assembly method. In the A380 shop, the wing FTE remains fixed in position, on static jigs, requiring personnel and machines to move around the structure. On the more highly automated A350 line, however, there are no static jigs. Instead, FTE sections are moved on assembly jigs through a sequence of workstations where assembly, drilling, reaming and other machining operations are carried out robotically, to extremely tight tolerances. Flow line movement takes place on automatically guided vehicles (AGV), under the precise positional control needed to maintain overall wing geometry.

This change permits the faster assembly process needed to meet anticipated high production rates for the A350 wings. As Frank Bamford points out, both the A380 and A350 are remarkable for their large scale, but in the A380’s case this is in terms of sheer structure size, whereas for the A330 the scale is related to fabrication volume.

To win the A350 FTE work package, GKN Aerospace has had to develop its new fibre placement manufacturing process for a wing that is 50% greater in span, has the main landing gear attached to it and is much heavier than that of the A400M. Meeting production commitments called for high rates of material deposition onto the rotating spar mandrel along with further development of automated machining, spar and trailing edge tooling, flexible assembly, waterjet cutting of composites, single-step drilling and reaming of composites and inspection techniques. Methods for laying up, forming and processing the primary M21E composite material at speed had to be devised and refined. Modular tooling concepts had to be engineered so that tooling can adapt to the different component sizes required for the three aircraft variants.

Much of this technology has been developed at GKN Aerospace’s Composites Research Centre at Cowes on the Isle of Wight, though not without external assistance. Evolution has benefited from collaborative research, often supported by external funding.

“We are a builder and integrator of aerospace assemblies and have limited resources for research,” Chris Gear explains. “The R&D that we carry out is generally part-funded by GKN with support from the Government and other partners. We have engaged with a number of projects funded by the European Union and aimed at enhancing Europe’s competitive position in aerospace.”

For example, the Advanced Low-Cost Aircraft Structures (ALCAS) programme, funded as part of the EU’s sixth framework (FP6) research platform, helped the company to move on from the ‘black metal’ syndrome, characterised by designers simply substituting existing metal parts with carbon copies of the same thing, towards fully integral composite structures with much reduced part counts.

“Ideally, one would like to see a large composite structure infused as a single integrated whole in one hit,” declares Gear. “We‘re moving progressively towards this ideal.”

ALCAS, which resulted in a full-scale partial wing and some representative spars, itself built on the earlier FP5 Technology Application to the Near term business Goals and Objectives (TANGO) programme, which helped pave the way for more integrated airframe structures to be built in reinforced plastic materials. ALCAS supported development of technology underpinning the design and build of the complex composite spar for the A350.

The company has also taken part in the EU’s Aircraft Wing with Advanced Technology Operation (AWIATOR) research and is active on the Next-Generation Composite Wing (NGCW) programme, a £103 million UK initiative designed to keep Britain at the cutting edge of wing innovation and development. GKNA brings its composites manufacturing and ice protection capabilities to this latter programme, which is targeting high manufacturing rates and standards for future composite wings. Extending over three years from 2008, NGCW has helped the company optimise its factory layout for high-volume production and investigate new tooling developments.

Technology drive

As A350 production gets into its stride and progresses through the variants, GKN Aerospace will further refine its methods and processes. While it looks forward to a long continuation of its close partnership with Airbus, GKN Aerospace sees Filton as key also to opening doors into other future wing projects. In particular, it is targeting a share of the glittering prizes associated with next-generation single aisle (NGSA) aircraft, especially the yet-to-be designed types which, sometime late in this or early in the next decade, will start to replace the thousands of Boeing B737 and Airbus 320 jets that are the backbone of air transport today. GKN Aerospace aims to be airframer agnostic and hopes that its technology will appeal to both the established giants as well as regional aircraft builders like Bombardier and Embraer, plus up and coming aspirants like China’s Comarc.

To do this, it knows it will have to maintain the intensity of its technology drive, developing wings that improve still further on the state of the art represented by the A350 wing, itself the most efficient ever designed by Airbus. Wing design is likely, for instance, to benefit from laminar flow, an extremely smooth flow of air closely over the wing surface promoting maximum aerodynamic efficiency and lift. This will require the engineering of ultra-smooth composite wing skins, a fresh challenge for composite engineers. Future wings may evolve more towards a closed-cell, fully composite type of structure.

Efforts are on-going to achieve shorter composite manufacturing cycle times and cost reduction. One focus already yielding promising results is the use of microwave curing, with a view to reducing reliance on expensive and wasteful autoclaving methods. Such methods can also help bring about increased melding of parts by co-curing, so reducing part counts substantially. Further robotisation of machining and assembly operations should bring down the costs of volume production. Other developments will centre on effective integration of metals with composites since trends suggest that reinforced plastics will never entirely supersede metals and that the future lies in a creative partnership between the two.

Inclusion of sensing elements within composite laminates could assist the development of the ‘all-electric wing’, in which control surfaces are moved electrically rather than hydraulically. For example, sensors able to detect the formation of ice on leading edges could trigger de-ice heater mats.

GKN Aerospace is intimately involved with these and many other developments in its strategy, greatly facilitated by the Filton acquisition and the A350 FTE partnership, to be a very special Tier 1 supplier, a wing worker for the world in fact.

Accident: Cathay A333 at Hong Kong on Apr 13th 2010, engine stuck at high thrust

By Simon Hradecky, created Tuesday, Apr 13th 2010 11:00Z, last updated Saturday, Apr 24th 2010 13:26Z

B-HLL being evacuated (Photo: AP) A Cathay Pacific Airbus A330-300, registration B-HLL performing flight CX-780 from Surabaya (Indonesia) to Hong Kong (China) with 309 passengers and 13 crew, was on approach to Hong Kong, when the crew reported a left hand engine (Trent 772) failure and declared emergency. During roll out on the northern runway 07L brakes overheated resulting in a small fire and 6 main gear tyres deflating. The occupants of the airplane evacuated after standstill. 7 people received injuries in the evacuation.



The airline reported, that 5 people were taken to a hospital.



The runway was closed for about 2.5 hours.



Hong Kong's Civil Aviation Authority said, that one engine had been shut down countering rumours in Hong Kong, that the airplane may have lost both engines on short final.



Cathay Pacific reported on Apr 13th, that the airplane touched down on one engine (in response to media reports in Hong Kong, that the second engine had failed on short final 10 minutes after the first was shut down).



In an updated press release on Apr 14th Cathay Pacific said, that the left hand engine was delivering 70% N1 stuck at that level, while the right hand engine was delivering idle thrust throughout the approach. The excess thrust delivered by the left hand engine forced a higher than normal approach speed without the usual flap settings. The airplane touched down at 230 KIAS (usual approach speed 135 KIAS), the high speed overheating the brakes and leading to the deflated tyres (all 4 on the left, 2 on the right hand main gear). After landing the crew was informed about smoke and flames at the undercarriage and initiated the evacuation as a reaction to that information.



Aviation sources in Hong Kong said on Apr 13th, that both engines got stuck at a setting of about 70% N1 delivering high power. The crew shut the left hand engine down to reduce excess thrust and performed an emergency landing with the other engine still operating at 70% N1. Touch down speed is reported at around 200 KIAS causing the brakes to overheat.



Airbus reported later, that both engines were stalled and thrust control was lost for both engines. The right hand engine was delivering thrust below flight idle, the left hand engine thrust above flight idle. The crew received ECAM stall messages for both engines, those messages being usually associated with engine compressor surges. During landing the engine #1 (left hand) cowling scraped the runway.



Cathay detailed further, that the aircraft experienced minor EPR oscillations shortly before reaching Top of Climb on departure out of Surabaya. These oscillation had an according indication of fuel flow, an ECAM message was produced for engine #2 (right hand). The crew consulted Cathay's dispatch and it was decided that the EPR oscillations did not warrant a diversion. On initial descent, when the airplane was descending through FL310, the right hand engine experienced a surge and stalled, the engine remained below flight idle for the remainder of the flight. When the airplane levelled off at an intermediate altitude in the latter part of the approach, thrust control over the left hand engine was gradually lost resulting in an uncontrolled thrust increase to 70% N1. The airplane was able to maintain speed and altitude. The crew conducted an ILS approach with flaps reaching stage 1 (selected were flaps 2) and an approach speed of 230 KIAS, the airspeed reduced to 220 KIAS during flare and touch down. Reverse thrust was successfully selected, the crew managed to stop the airplane about 1000 feet before the end of runway 07L (before the threshold runway 25R). Both engines were shut down after the airplane came to a stop, rescue services advised of tyre deflation and presence of smoke and fire around the wheels. An investigation has been initiated that also includes fuel system fault and fuel contamination.

The EASA argues:



There have been several events of engine power fluctuations or other occurrences as described in the reference publications that were caused by deposits of Super Absorbent Polymers (SAP) in the aircraft/engine fuel system.



These problems are assumed to be caused by a migration of SAP out of filtration devices (filter monitors) that are used in the fuel supply chain to the aircraft. Aircraft and engine type certificate holders consider the presence of SAP in fuel to be a potential flight safety issue and cannot endorse a level of SAP that is acceptable in fuel.



The aim of this SIB is to enhance awareness of aircraft and aerodrome operators of the risks associated with SAP in jet fuel, to inform about on-going industry actions on the matter and to provide recommendations for the purpose of mitigating the associated risks.



At this time EASA does not regard the issue a safety issue, that would warrant an airworthiness directive or similiar measures.



EASA bases the Safety Information Bulletin on findings by the Joint Investigation Group (JIG) about fuel filter monitors of Dec 11th 2017, the findings by IATA's special interest group, a FAA Safety Information Bulletin of Oct 9th 2020 as well as further JIG findings up to Oct 9th 2020.

In October 2020 the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) released their Safety Information Bulletin SIB 2018-10R1 addressing the events on board of B-HLL of April 2010 as well as at least 7 other similiar events known since 2010.The EASA argues:At this time EASA does not regard the issue a safety issue, that would warrant an airworthiness directive or similiar measures.EASA bases the Safety Information Bulletin on findings by the Joint Investigation Group (JIG) about fuel filter monitors of Dec 11th 2017, the findings by IATA's special interest group, a FAA Safety Information Bulletin of Oct 9th 2020 as well as further JIG findings up to Oct 9th 2020.

The accident was caused by fuel contamination. The contaminated fuel, which contained SAP (Super Absorbent Polymer) spheres, uplifted at WARR (Surabaya) subsequently caused the loss of thrust control on both engines of the aircraft during approach to VHHH (Hong Kong).



The following chain of events and circumstances had led to the uplift of contaminated fuel to CPA780:



- The re-commissioning of the hydrant refuelling system after the hydrant extension work in WARR had not completely removed all contaminants in the affected hydrant refuelling circuit. Salt water remained in the affected hydrant refuelling circuit.



- The re-commissioning of the hydrant refuelling system after the hydrant extension work in WARR was not properly coordinated which led to the premature resumption of the hydrant refuelling operations while the hydrant system still contained contaminant.



- The refuelling operation in WARR, in particular low flow-rate refuelling, DP recording and monitoring, did not fully comply with the international fuel industry latest guidance.



- A number of unscheduled filter monitors replacements after the premature resumption of hydrant refuelling operation were not investigated by the fuel supplier and hydrant operator at WARR.



- The unusual vibration observed during the refuelling of CPA780 was not stopped immediately and properly investigated by the fuel supplier personnel.



The investigation also identified the following deficiencies and contributing factors that may cause possible fuel contamination:



- There were no established international civil aviation requirements for oversight and quality control on aviation fuel supply at airports.



- There were no established international civil aviation requirements for refuel operational procedures and associated training for aviation fuel supply personnel.



- The manual monitoring of DP changes in a fuelling dispenser during refuelling was not effective.



The CAD analyzed that following the indication that both engines had stalled about 45nm from the aerodrome the aircraft was left with insufficient power to reach Hong Kong Airport until the crew worked the all engines flame out checklist, which resulted in the left hand engine's thrust to increase sufficiently to be able to reach Hong Kong.



The CAD wrote:



""On descent to FL230 at 0519 hrs, the flight crew received the ECAM messages of ENG 1 CTL SYS FAULT and ENG 2 STALL within a short period of time. The flight crew handled the abnormal situation in accordance with the Airbus and the company procedures for the A330 aircraft. The crew appropriately declared a PAN call to ATC and also briefed the cabin crew of the situation. The abnormal landing to VHHH was planned in accordance with the company procedures.



At 0530 hrs, when the aircraft was approximately 45 nm southeast of VHHH, the ECAM message ENG 1 STALL annunciated. This became an emergency situation and the workload in the cockpit had understandably increased significantly. The crew again handled the emergency situation in accordance with the Airbus and the company procedures for the A330. They also appropriately declared a MAYDAY to ATC.



Owing to the control problem of the engine thrust and the limited power produced by the engines during descent, the flight crew had attempted to clear the faults from No. 2 engine by conducting the ALL ENG FLAME OUT  FUEL REMAINING checklist. This crew action is considered reasonable under the circumstances as that checklist provides the necessary procedures for restarting the engine(s) and also provides information on configuring the aircraft for an emergency landing should the engines fail. After the N1 of No. 1 engine had increased, it became apparent to the flight crew that CPA780 could reach VHHH for an emergency landing.""



The CAD went on to write:



""During the visual approach to Runway 07L, the Commander manoeuvred the aircraft in order to manage altitude and airspeed. It was not until the aircraft on the final descent for landing that the Commander realised they could not reduce the thrust on the number 1 engine. The speed was not controllable and from that point, there was no time for the crew to consider other strategy nor procedure to cope with such emergency situation. The Commander operated the aircraft as close as possible to VLS for landing at whatever configuration they could achieve. High drag devices such as speedbrakes and landing gears were deployed. However, due to the high thrust from the No. 1 engine, it was clear to the Commander that they would be landing at high speed, and he manoeuvred the aircraft visually as required to achieve a touchdown as close as possible to the normal touchdown zone. The crew did not inform ATC of the abnormal high speed landing, very likely due to high workload and limited time available.



At the time of the landing there was a crosswind of about 13 kt from the right. The aircraft touched down at about 231 kt (the configuration full approach speed with landing weight of 173,600 kg was 135 kt), and at a position between abeam Taxiways A4 and A5 and with a distance of around 680 metres from the beginning of the runway threshold, and bounced. The aircraft rolled left to seven degrees and pitched down to -2.5 degrees at second touchdown. Eventually the lower cowling of No. 1 engine contacted the runway surface. The very high speed landing combined with the strong wind could have led to the bounce of the aircraft after landing. This, combined with the necessary directional control of the aircraft, could have subsequently caused the lower cowling of No. 1 engine contacting the runway.



Although the autobrake remained at LO (i.e. the lowest autobrake setting) due to time constraint and workload, the Commander applied full manual braking force after the touchdown. As a result of the high landing speed and abnormal landing configurations, the aircraft came to a stop near the runway centreline in the vicinity of the threshold area of the opposite Runway 25R, about 309m from the end of the landing Runway 07L. Landing distance for such abnormal configurations and speed was not provided, nor was it required to be provided, by the Airbus or the CPA documentations. The heat generated from the high energy braking also caused the thermal relief plug to deflate three of the left main gear tyres and two of the right main gear tyres, and the subsequent hot brakes and fire observed by the AFC.""



The CAD further analysed that after bringing the aircraft to a stop the crew worked the evacuation checklist until the point where the decision whether to commence evacuation or not was to be made. The crew inquired with tower whether fire or smoke was visible, the tower replied in the negative and instructed the crew to switch to the fire chief's frequency, the fire chief subsequently reported fire and smoke from one of the aircraft wheels. Upon that information the commander decided to go ahead with the evacuation. The CAD annotated: ""This decision of evacuation was considered reasonable.""



The CAD praised the crew: ""The crew, as a whole, had demonstrated good crew resource management throughout the flight.""



The CAD was not satisfied with the performance of Hong Kong ATC stating: ""At 0532 hrs, CPA780 called MAYDAY and advised HK Approach of the dual engine stall situation. Under the circumstance where a twin-engine aircraft encountered dual engine stall, ATC would, according to standing instructions, upgrade the emergency category to a Full Emergency. However, on this occasion ATC did not upgrade the emergency category. The investigation tried to establish why a MAYDAY call associated with a dual engine stall situation had not triggered ATC upgrading the Local Standby to a Full Emergency."" and further down commented: ""Nevertheless, given the limited time of 11 minutes available from the moment CPA780 declared MAYDAY to the time it landed at the airport, there is no evidence suggesting a different emergency category declared by ATC during the accident would have any bearing on the emergency resources attending to CPA780 and the subsequent emergency evacuation.""



The CAD analysed with respect to the contaminated fuel, that after finding of SAP spheres in the fuel further checks at the fuel metering unit, variable stator vanes control unit and main metering valve found stiction of SAP spheres in the fuel metering unit and variable stator vanes control unit and accumulation of SAP spheres at the main metering valves of both fuel metering units that seized both valves.



The CAD analyzed that during the uplift of 24,400kg of fuel the fuelling hose vibrated a number of times, which was abnormal. SAP spheres were found in the filters, hose and dispensers of the fuelling vehicle used to uplift the fuel to the aircraft. The CAD commented: ""It was apparent that the contaminated fuel had been supplied to the aircraft.""



The CAD analyzed that with Surabaya being located close to the seashore it was quite likely that water puddles at the aerodrome contained salt and stated with respect to the ongoing upgrade work on the aerodrome's fuel distribution system: ""When there was shortfall in adherence to the tie-in procedures, such salt water could have entered the main distribution pipe of the fuel hydrant circuit."" The CAD continued that theoretic considerations verified by a practical test had indicated the possibility that salt water in the fuel could compromise the fuel monitoring system permitting the uplift of fuel despite the presence of contamination: ""When the SAP was fully activated with the salt water left inside the fuel hydrant system, the performance of filter monitors was compromised and could not completely shut down the flow. This allowed continuous refuelling through the filter monitors. With such degraded performance of the filter monitors, fuel contamination was not detected by the dispenser operator unless the fuel flow was so restricted that warrant a filter change.""



13 immediate safety actions were taken by Surabaya Airport, DGAC Indonesia, CAD and Cathay Pacific, the investigation released four more safety recommendations, two to the airport authority of Surabaya with respect to fuel distribution system and two to ICAO to introduce monitoring of fuel quality, fuel uplift procedures and personnel training at aerodromes as well as the introduction of devices which would stop the uplift of fuel ""when the differential pressure across the equipment filtration system is outside the equipment designed value or range.""

Hong Kong's Civil Aviation Department (CAD) released their final report concluding the probable cause of the accident was:The CAD analyzed that following the indication that both engines had stalled about 45nm from the aerodrome the aircraft was left with insufficient power to reach Hong Kong Airport until the crew worked the all engines flame out checklist, which resulted in the left hand engine's thrust to increase sufficiently to be able to reach Hong Kong.The CAD wrote:""On descent to FL230 at 0519 hrs, the flight crew received the ECAM messages of ENG 1 CTL SYS FAULT and ENG 2 STALL within a short period of time.

These spheres were present in the hose end strainer of Surabaya's fuel dispenser JUA06 used for refueling B-HLL before the accident flight.



The investigation is still working to determine how those spheres were created and how they entered the aircraft.



Following the extension work it was noted that between April 10th and April 15th four fuel dispensers had unscheduled fuel filter monitor replacements due to high differential pressure readings of the monitor vessel, which is indicative of a filter monitor clogging.



Further tests have been conducted on Surabaya's airport fuel supply system. A fuel sample taking from the supply for stands 5 to 10 showed sodium chloride and water in the sample, the source of the contamination could not be determined however.



Another Airbus A330-300 registration B-HLM performing flight CX-780 departing Surabaya on April 12th 2010 had been refueled by dispenser JUA06. During the flight the crew experienced engine #1 (Trent 700, outer left) parameter fluctuations however without associated ECAM messages. The #1 FMU (fuel metering unit) was replaced following the flight. In the light of the accident flight the following day the FMU of B-HLM was also examined and showed contamination with spheres consistent with those found on the accident aircraft. Those spheres were also found in the low pressure fuel filter of the #1 engine of B-HLM.

Hongkong's Civil Aviation Department (CAD) said in their third preliminary report that the spheres found seizing both engines' variable stator vane controllers were identified to mainly consist of sodium polyacrylate ""consistent with the super absorbent polymer (SAP) material used in the filter monitors on a fuelling dispenser"".These spheres were present in the hose end strainer of Surabaya's fuel dispenser JUA06 used for refueling B-HLL before the accident flight.The investigation is still working to determine how those spheres were created and how they entered the aircraft.Following the extension work it was noted that between April 10th and April 15th four fuel dispensers had unscheduled fuel filter monitor replacements due to high differential pressure readings of the monitor vessel, which is indicative of a filter monitor clogging.Further tests have been conducted on Surabaya's airport fuel supply system.

An examination of the engine fuel components showed, that the main metering valves (MMV) of the fuel metering units (FMU) were seized, the left at a position consistent with the 70% N1 of the left hand engine, the right hand at a position consistent with the 17% N1 achieved by the right hand engine. The right hand engine's variable stator vane controller (VSVC) was also found seized.



Fine spherical particles (spheres) were found in the FMU, VSVC and variable stator vane actuator (VSVA) of both engines. No fault has been observed to any component other than those associated with the contamination by spheres. The spheres could not be generated from within the airframe or engine systems under normal operating conditions and environment.



The fuel samples also showed contaminations with such spheres.



The monitor fuel filters from the dispenser also showed traces of such spheres, spheres were also found in fuel samples taken downstream of the monitor filters. The spheres appeared similiar to those found on the aircraft.



The exact nature of the spheres is still under investigation.



The flight data recorders and quick access recorders as well as aircraft monitoring system showed no abnormal commands sent from the electronic engine control or autothrust system. The abnormal engine condition therefore is believed to be the result of the contamination with spheres leading to the seizure of the MMVs.



The aircraft had loaded 24400 kg of fuel from Surabaya's hydrant refuelling at stand 8, which was part of a circuit refuelling stands 1 to 10. Prior to the event there had been extensive work on that circuit as part of the Surabaya Airport extension project. The refueling circuit was isolated for the investigation.



Inspection of the refuelling circuit revealed, that some of the re-commissioning procedures were not in line with guidelines and practises commonly used in the aviation industry. The re-commissioning had not been completed when B-HLL and other aircraft were already being refueled from that circuit.



On Aug 16th Indonesia's NTSC contested the findings of the CAD stating, that those statements only represent the Hong Kong side of things. Many Indonesian Aircraft have been refuelled from that circuit and have not suffered any problems. A new investigation is to be carried out by the NTSC to verify the quality of the fuel supplied at the Surabaya Airport.





In a new preliminary report Hong Kong's Civil Aviation Department (CAD) said, that the engine fuel components, relevant fuel samples and monitor filters in the vessel of the dispenser refueling the aircraft in Surabaya were collected and sent to the UK for analysis. Flight data and cockpit voice recorders were read out.An examination of the engine fuel components showed, that the main metering valves (MMV) of the fuel metering units (FMU) were seized, the left at a position consistent with the 70% N1 of the left hand engine, the right hand at a position consistent with the 17% N1 achieved by the right hand engine.

Prior to the event there had been extensive work on that circuit as part of the Surabaya Airport extension project. The refueling circuit was isolated for the investigation.Inspection of the refuelling circuit revealed, that some of the re-commissioning procedures were not in line with guidelines and practises commonly used in the aviation industry. The re-commissioning had not been completed when B-HLL and other aircraft were already being refueled from that circuit.On Aug 16th Indonesia's NTSC contested the findings of the CAD stating, that those statements only represent the Hong Kong side of things. Many Indonesian Aircraft have been refuelled from that circuit and have not suffered any problems. A new investigation is to be carried out by the NTSC to verify the quality of the fuel supplied at the Surabaya Airport.

During the climb the crew noticed an EPR fluctuation of the right hand engine, the left engine also showed fluctuations however within a narrower range.



After levelling off at FL390 the crew received an ECAM message ""ENG 2 CTL SYS FAULT"", the according checklists were executed and the crew contacted their maintenance department. As all parameters of the engines were normal except the slight EPR fluctuations, it was decided to continue the flight.



100 minutes later the ""ENG 2 CTL SYS FAULT"" message reappeared, all parameters still remained normal, crew consulted maintenance again and it was decided to carry on.



During the descent towards Hong Kong while descending through FL230 the crew received two ECAM messages: ""ENG 1 CTL SYS FAULT"" and ""ENG 2 STALL"" within a short period of time. The flight crew advanced the number 1 lever to the max continuous thrust position and pulled the number 2 lever to idle. The crew requested a priority landing and track shortening, air traffic control facilitated the request and sent the airport's emergency services on stand by.



11 minutes later while descending through 8000 feet the crew received an ""ENG 1 STALL"" ECAM message and declared emergency and actioned the according checklists. The captain attempted to move both thrust levers, during these movements the engine #1 increased thrust to 74% N1 while engine #2 remained at 17% N1 (below idle).



The captain flew a visual approach for runway 07L, with both thrust levers at idle the left hand engine #1 showed an N1 of 74% and the right hand engine 17% N1. The left hand engine reduced to 70% N1 during touch down.



The airplane touched down at 230 KIAS at a landing weight of 173600 kg, during touch down the left hand engine's underside of the cowling briefly touched the runway. Spoilers deployed automatically, the left hand reverser was deployed, the captain applied maximum manual braking. When the airplane stopped the left hand engine was still running at 76-79% N1. Both engines were shut down, 5 main gear tyres deflated.



Emergency services reported smoke and fire from the main gear prompting the crew to initiate an emergency evacuation via the slides, while emergency services sprayed the main gear to battle the fire and cool the brakes down.



The CAD does not expect the investigation to conclude in less than a year.

Hong Kong's Civil Aviation Department (CAD) have released their preliminary report saying, that the airplane had no observations in the maintenance logs regarding fuel system and engines prior to the accident flight. The airplane took at at 198700 kg takeoff weight, thereof 33400 kg of fuel.During the climb the crew noticed an EPR fluctuation of the right hand engine, the left engine also showed fluctuations however within a narrower range.After levelling off at FL390 the crew received an ECAM message ""ENG 2 CTL SYS FAULT"", the according checklists were executed and the crew contacted their maintenance department.

Airbus names new Japan chief - Times of Malta,"Thu, 15 Apr 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vdGltZXNvZm1hbHRhLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2FpcmJ1cy1uYW1lcy1uZXctamFwYW4tY2hpZWYuMzAyNzYz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"European aircraft maker Airbus yesterday named French businessman Stephane Ginoux to head its Japanese operations.

The France-based firm, part of European aerospace corporation EADS, said in a statement that Mr Ginoux would succeed American Glen Fukushima as chief executive officer at the next board meeting, before the summer.

Mr Fukushima will be appointed chairman of Airbus Japan, the statement said, typically an honorary non-executive position in corporate Japan.

The pair will ""pursue our goal of convincing airlines in Japan that they really have a choice: our modern, eco-efficient Airbus aircraft and all the benefits they offer,"" Airbus CEO Tom Enders said in the statement.

Airbus has less than five per cent market share in Japan, compared with what it says is around half in other markets worldwide. Since Mr Fukushima became head of Airbus in Japan in 2005, the company has sold only eight aircraft there, including three leasing contracts, a spokesman said.

Mr Ginoux's appointment ""will further strengthen our ties with Japan's aviation industry,"" the statement added.

Mr Ginoux, 42, who has 18 years' experience working in Japan, will also continue to head Eurocopter Japan, another EADS affiliate, in charge of selling civil and military range helicopters."
Airbus focuses on family commonality as it begins A350-800 detailed design - Flightglobal,"Wed, 28 Apr 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYWlyYnVzLWZvY3VzZXMtb24tZmFtaWx5LWNvbW1vbmFsaXR5LWFzLWl0LWJlZ2lucy1hMzUwLTgwMC1kZXRhaWxlZC1kZXNpZ24vOTMxNTMuYXJ0aWNsZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus is about to begin the detailed design effort of the next XWB iteration, the A350-800 shrink, in parallel with its efforts to begin the industrial ramp-up for the initial -900 variant.

The second member of the A350 family is due to enter service in the third quarter of 2014, around a year after the baseline -900. A stretched variant, the -1000, will follow at the end of 2015. Launch customer for all three variants is Qatar Airways.

The -800's concept was revamped in 2009 to be developed as a simple shrink of the -900, incorporating minor changes to the systems and structure, rather than as an optimised variant.

""We had been planning to optimise the -800 design a lot for its lower take-off weight with a different structure, landing gear and so on,"" says A350 chief engineer Gordon McConnell. ""We were chasing economics to provide the lightest possible aircraft.""

However, McConnell says that there was pressure from airlines to rethink this plan because of commonality concerns and the wish for additional range - the original A350-800 was designed to fly around 15,360km (8,300nm).

""The airlines said that the optimisation wasn't good for their cost of ownership if they operated both -800 and -900 variants. Some airlines also asked if we could use the -900's structural capability to give the -800 more range. Industrially, it also wasn't very good for us to optimise it.""

Airbus is going forward with the revamped -800 plan, based around the -900, having reached the design freeze late last year. ""We've issued the design loads for the -800 and we'll start the detailed design this year with improved payload/range performance,"" says McConnell.

The new -800 has a common wing with the -900 in terms of size, configuration and high-lift devices, while much of the structure is also identical. The A350-1000, now being defined, will have a wing around 4% bigger than the -800/900's, through a trailing-edge extension.

The -800's fuselage is shortened by 10 frames (six forward and four aft), which McConnell says requires changes to the geometry of section 13/14 (forward), section 16/18 (rear) and the upper shell of section 15 (centre fuselage).

""We're only changing systems where we need to because we're shortening the fuselage - for example there'll be some adaptation of the flight-control software because the aircraft will handle slightly differently.""

McConnell says some equipment has been altered and relocated as a result of the fuselage being shorter, specifically the crew and fire-extinguishing oxygen bottles.

""The basic weights of the -800 are unchanged [the 248t maximum take-off weight, for example], but we have increased weights available as an option,"" says McConnell.

An optional 11t increase in MTOW, to 259t, gives up to 460km more range than the old -800 variant. ""We have two max zero fuel/max landing weights, which allows us to offer 3t more payload capability as an option,"" McConnell says.

The -800 engine will be common to the 84,000lb-thrust (374kN) Rolls-Royce Trent XWB that powers the -900, but offered at various deratings as a result of its lower operating weights.

The basic 248t MTOW -800 will be offered with a 75,000lb sea level thrust rating, while the 279t MTOW option will have 79,000lb thrust. ""We'll also offer a 'hot and high' rating option flat-rated at 79,000lb at higher altitudes and temperatures which uses the full capability of the -900's 84,000lb-thrust engine,"" says McConnell. ""Typically this might be used by someone operating to Mexico City, for example.""

The A350-900 is due to fly in mid-2012 - three months later than previously planned due to a hold-up in the completion of some of the structural design. Airbus does not expect this to impact the delivery schedule or the development timetable of the other variants.

Their livery is quite simple with a tree on the tail (which is their trade mark symbol — check out this old Boeing 707) with MEA on the front.

They are known for their good safety record and high customer service. Their flight attendants are required to speak three languages: Arabic, English and French.

The tree on the tail is a Cedar of Lebanon which is a native species in the Mediterranean Mountains in Lebanon.

PICTURE: Airbus builds 'physical mock-up' of XWB fuselage to avoid A380 mistakes - Flightglobal,"Fri, 30 Apr 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vcGljdHVyZS1haXJidXMtYnVpbGRzLXBoeXNpY2FsLW1vY2stdXAtb2YteHdiLWZ1c2VsYWdlLXRvLWF2b2lkLWEzODAtbWlzdGFrZXMvOTMyMTEuYXJ0aWNsZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus aims to avoid a repeat of the A380 production dramas caused by over-reliance on the digital mock-up (DMU), by building a physical mock-up of the A350's fuselage.

""The DMU is a fantastic tool, but the lesson learned from the A380 was that we needed to go further to anticipate system installation problems,"" says A350 programme manager Didier Evrard. ""This was a large burden we carried on the A380 programme and this is why we've built this physical mock-up.""

On the A380, Airbus relied solely on digital mock-up software to test the installation of wiring and other systems, which it found to its cost was inadequate at replicating the reality of the actual assembly effort. The airframer was forced to redesign and reinstall wiring looms and re-invent its assembly process, leading to the major production delays suffered by the programme.

The A350's fuselage and cabin physical mock-up is being assembled at Airbus's Hamburg plant, with the front fuselage so far having been constructed. ""In the coming months the whole fuselage will be built - we have already used it a lot last year for testing design, assembly processes, tools and jigs,"" adds Evrard.

Next year the physical mock-up will be used for a dry run of the systems installation into the entire fuselage before this is attempted on A350-900 MSN001, says Evrard. ""This will be a very strong de-risking measure for the MSN001 final assembly.""

Airbus opts for larger wing on A350-1000 through trailing edge extension - Flightglobal,"Thu, 22 Apr 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYWlyYnVzLW9wdHMtZm9yLWxhcmdlci13aW5nLW9uLWEzNTAtMTAwMC10aHJvdWdoLXRyYWlsaW5nLWVkZ2UtZXh0ZW5zaW9uLzkzMTA3LmFydGljbGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus is working to reach the design freeze for the largest A350 variant, the -1000, in the middle of this year and has revealed that the stretched aircraft will feature a slightly larger wing the -800/900 models.

The 369-seat -1000, which has an 11-frame stretch over the -900, is due to enter service at the end of 2015. A separate A350-1000 design team was set up in 2009, headed by the XWB programme's deputy engineer Alain De-Zotti, which is examining trade-offs for the design, says chief engineer Gordon McConnell. Detailed definition is due to be completed at the end of 2011.

Airbus's operational requirement targets for the -1000 include keeping the approach speed to 150kt (277km/h) at maximum landing weight, compliance with London's QC1 noise requirements for arrival and QC2 for departures, and the capability to reach an initial cruise altitude of 33,000ft (10,000m) in less than 30min.

""With these parameters we were able to do the work to design the wing, and we found that with some changes to the trailing edge we can meet all these requirements,"" says McConnell.

The wing will feature a trailing-edge extension increasing its area by 4%, which McConnell describes as ""quite a big change because it extends the high-lift devices and the ailerons, making the chord bigger by around 400mm. We've been able to optimise the flap lift performance as well as gain more performance in the cruise.""

The -1000 design team will work this year to finalise the changes over the -800/900, with some other less significant trade-offs to be completed on the configuration. Windtunnel tests will be run this year based on the enlarged wing, covering both performance and loads. ""This will allow us to size the structure properly, which will give us a good idea on the weight delta of the aircraft,"" says McConnell.

Airbus devises plan to compress A350 flight-testing by three months - Flightglobal,"Fri, 23 Apr 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYWlyYnVzLWRldmlzZXMtcGxhbi10by1jb21wcmVzcy1hMzUwLWZsaWdodC10ZXN0aW5nLWJ5LXRocmVlLW1vbnRocy85MzEwMS5hcnRpY2xl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus aims to meet the A350's mid-2013 service-entry target by compressing the flight-test programme into 12 months, after revealing that it has burnt up some of the development programme's "" buffer"".

The A350-900's 12-month, 2,600h flight-test programme will begin in mid-2012 with the maiden flight of the first of five development aircraft.

The date for the first flight has slipped by three months because of development delays in the aircraft's structural design, but Airbus is confident it can meet the mid-2013 service entry target for launch customer Qatar Airways by reducing the original 15-month test programme by three months.

""We've got five aircraft in the flight-test programme - which is more than we usually have,"" says A350 chief engineer Gordon McConnell.

He says that the original 15-month plan had been generous - some customers had questioned why it would take Airbus so long - and the airframer has been running projects with its flight-test and engineering teams to devise ways of compressing it.

One example is the flight manual process, says McConnell: ""In the past we've done the aerodynamic testing to freeze the configuration, then the performance testing, and then built the flight manual. We've been working to make that a more concurrent effort.""

The flight manual will now be built ahead of flight testing and will then be checked during flight-testing, with adjustments being made when necessary. ""We've been able to save quite a lot of time on that critical path,"" he says.

The first two A350s to fly (MSN001 and 003) will be heavily instrumented. MSN001 will undertake all of the flight-envelope opening at the beginning of programme, to enable the aerodynamic and flight-control configurations to be frozen.

""MSN003 will be more devoted to performance and systems testing, but the two aircraft will be interchangeable because they have the same instrumentation,"" says McConnell.

The third A350 to fly will be MSN002, which will have a cabin installed. ""We'll fly that early in the programme so we can do proper operational testing on the cabin and deliver a mature aircraft to customers,"" says McConnell.

MSN004 and 005 will undertake operational tests and extended twin-engine operations trials towards the end of the programme, with Airbus planning to have up to four of the first five aircraft airborne before end-2012.

Airbus to flight-test XWB carbonfibre skin panel on A340 this year - Flightglobal,"Wed, 28 Apr 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYWlyYnVzLXRvLWZsaWdodC10ZXN0LXh3Yi1jYXJib25maWJyZS1za2luLXBhbmVsLW9uLWEzNDAtdGhpcy15ZWFyLzkzMTY2LmFydGljbGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus will fly a carbonfibre fuselage panel on its A340-300 testbed this year as part of its investigation of acoustic transmission within the A350 XWB's composite cabin.

The new twinjet is Airbus's first design with a carbonfibre fuselage skin instead of aluminium. Acoustic ground tests to compare the material's behaviour with a metallic skin have already been carried out. ""The question is what that means for noise inside the aircraft when in a flight environment,"" says A350 chief engineer Gordon McConnell. ""So to be able to get that correlation correct, we'll test-fly a carbon panel inserted into A340 MSN001.""

This aircraft, which is the 19-year-old original A340-300 development testbed, will be modified this summer with a 4.3m (14ft)-long section of its aluminium fuselage skin aft of the wing replaced with a 14m² (151ft²) carbonfibre panel. It is due to begin testing later this year with different types of acoustic insulation material to understand the effect in a real flight environment, to help Airbus ""de-risk"" the A350's production and flight-test programmes.

""We'll measure the noise transmission through this panel,"" says McConnell. ""This will allow us to freeze the design with a good level of confidence that we've got the acoustic treatments right to provide a good environment inside the aircraft and avoid having to play with the material later on during the A350 flight-test programme.

"Update: TMA delivers first Airbus. Sammak : ""we want to complement the services of MEA"" - Lebanon - Businessnews.com.lb","Tue, 06 Apr 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHA6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3NuZXdzLmNvbS5sYi9jbXMvU3RvcnkvU3RvcnlEZXRhaWxzLzU4Ny9VcGRhdGU6LVRNQS1kZWxpdmVycy1maXJzdC1BaXJidXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"“The aircraft was leased from Airbus- the European airline manufacturer,” said Mazen Sammak, one of the company’s shareholders.

The aircraft is an Airbus 300-600 and it has a capacity of 50-tons. TMA chose the 300-600 series in particular because it is a plane initially designed to act as a cargo freighter. It also has an encouraging fuel consumption option.

TMA benefited from the misfortune of the global financial crisis in the past one and a half year. It took advantage of the lower valuations and pricings “to finance the whole restructuring plan at lower costs- and thus lease the Airbus at a competitive price,” said Sammak.

Throughout the period, TMA was teaming up with a global consulting partner to offer training for its team. The company was updating its manuals, re-setting the offices, and re-building its contacts.



In 1953, TMA was founded. It owned permits to fly to all worldwide countries. But in 2004, it halted its entire operations when its fleet became relatively old and as it struggled with a $60 million debt.

Despite this, businessman Mazen Bissat, also owner of the Mazen chain of pharmacies bought the debt-plagued company in late 2008 from Farid Raphael, Chairman and General Manager of Banque Libano-Francaise for only one dollar. He pledged to restructure the company and take it back to its earlier era of success.

Today, TMA is owned by Bissat, and two other shareholders. Bissat owns the largest share of the company. Mazen Sammak, and Adolph Naim, who also acts as the company’s lawyer also own part of it.

Sammak expects the newly leased Airbus to be operational very soon at the Rafik Hariri International Airport. The company is still awaiting to receive all permits from the Airport’s Authority before it operates the aircraft, he said.

Sammak said that TMA might consider expanding its fleet by one or two airplanes in the future. However, “it is still too early to consider this option… we want to successfully resume operations first,” he said.

TMA does not rule out the competition factor despite being the only pure cargo airline among the 268 airlines that currently operate at the Airport, according to Sammak. ""There is competition but it is minor, we as TMA can carry larger volumes than others,"" he said.

Sammak said TMA is also looking forward to complement its services with that of the national carrier, the Middle East Airlines. “MEA cannot offer the services we can offer, and we cannot deliver MEA’s services.. We want both services to complete each other,” he said.

As the company gears up to resume its operations, 150 TMA employees in Lebanon, Milano, India, and Paris continue to do their tasks. Sammak is optimistic. “We will fare better than many would expect ... We are believers, we own a history and the trust of our financing partners,” he said."

But I guess it's a buff thing. If you guys are airplane buffs or whatever, and that's what you like, then that's fine. For me, airplanes are just tools to be used to ferry people from place to place. Also to be used in war.
