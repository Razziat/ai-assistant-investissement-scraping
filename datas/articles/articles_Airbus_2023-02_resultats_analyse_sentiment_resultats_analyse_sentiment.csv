2023 guidance issued

Amsterdam, 16 February 2023 – Airbus SE (stock exchange symbol: AIR) reported consolidated Full-Year (FY) 2022 financial results and provided guidance for 2023.

""The industry continued its recovery during 2022, with air traffic increasing and airlines turning to their long-term fleet planning. We delivered solid financials despite an adverse operating environment that prevented our supply chain from recovering at the pace we expected. The Company had to adjust its operations accordingly, which led to lower commercial aircraft deliveries than originally planned. We are adapting our production to match supply,” said Guillaume Faury, Airbus Chief Executive Officer. “As we move forward in 2023 we are focused on our industrial activities and the longer-term transformation of the Company. The solid 2022 financial performance and our confidence in the future lead us to propose a higher dividend payment this year.”

Gross commercial aircraft orders increased to 1,078 (2021: 771 aircraft), with net orders of 820 aircraft after cancellations (2021: 507 aircraft) corresponding to a net book-to-bill ratio significantly above 1. The order backlog amounted to 7,239 commercial aircraft at the end of 2022. Airbus Helicopters registered 362 net orders (2021: 414 units), with a book-to-bill above 1 both in units and value. Helicopter orders were well spread across programmes and included 12 H160s. Airbus Defence and Space’s order intake by value was € 13.7 billion (2021: € 13.7 billion), corresponding to a book-to-bill of around 1.2. Key orders included Demonstrator Phase 1B of the Future Combat Air System, the Eurodrone unmanned aerial system and 20 latest-generation Eurofighters for the Spanish Air Force.

Consolidated order intake by value increased to € 82.5 billion (2021: € 62.0 billion) with the consolidated order book valued at € 449 billion at the end of 2022 (year-end 2021: € 398 billion). The increase in the consolidated backlog value mainly reflects the book-to-bill above 1 and the strengthening of the US dollar.

Consolidated revenues increased 13 percent to € 58.8 billion (2021: € 52.1 billion). A total of 661(1) commercial aircraft were delivered (2021: 611(2) aircraft), comprising 53 A220s, 516 A320 Family, 32 A330s and 60 A350s. Revenues generated by Airbus’ commercial aircraft activities increased 15 percent year-on-year, mainly reflecting the higher deliveries and the strengthening of the US dollar. Airbus Helicopters delivered 344 units (2021: 338 units), with revenues rising by 8 percent, mainly reflecting growth in services and a favourable mix in programmes. Revenues at Airbus Defence and Space increased 11 percent, mainly driven by higher volume in Military Aircraft and Eurodrone. A total of 10 A400M airlifters were delivered in 2022, compared to 8 in 2021.

Consolidated EBIT Adjusted – an alternative performance measure and key indicator capturing the underlying business margin by excluding material charges or profits caused by movements in provisions related to programmes, restructuring or foreign exchange impacts as well as capital gains/losses from the disposal and acquisition of businesses – increased to € 5,627 million (2021: € 4,865 million).

EBIT Adjusted related to Airbus’ commercial aircraft activities increased to € 4,600 million (2021: € 3,570 million). The increase reflects the higher deliveries and is supported by some non-recurring elements – mainly the positive impacts from retirement obligations and from the progress made on compliance related topics – partly offset by a less favourable hedge rate compared to FY 2021.

On the A320 Family programme, the ramp-up trajectory has been adapted with suppliers. The Company is now progressing towards a monthly production rate of 65 aircraft by the end of 2024 and 75 in 2026. Entry-into-service for the A321XLR is expected to take place in Q2 2024.

The A330 monthly production rate increased to around 3 at the end of 2022 as planned and the Company now targets to reach rate 4 in 2024. The A350 monthly rate is now around 6 aircraft. In order to meet growing demand for widebody aircraft as international air travel recovers, and following a feasibility study with the supply chain, the Company is now targeting a monthly production rate of 9 A350s at the end of 2025.

Airbus Helicopters’ EBIT Adjusted increased to € 639 million (2021: € 535 million), reflecting higher services and programme execution. Non-recurring elements included the positive impact related to retirement obligations booked in Q1.

EBIT Adjusted at Airbus Defence and Space decreased to € 384 million (2021: € 696 million), mainly reflecting the impairment related to the loss of two Pleiades Neo satellites in December and to delays on the Ariane 6 launcher, as well as the impact of rising inflation. This was partly offset by higher volume in Military Aircraft, the ramp-up in Eurodrone and the positive impact related to retirement obligations booked in Q1.

On the A400M programme, development activities continue towards achieving the revised capability roadmap. Retrofit activities are progressing in close alignment with the customer. In 2022, an update of the contract “Estimate at Completion” was performed and an additional charge of € 0.5 billion recorded. This mainly reflects updated assumptions, including inflation and risks related to the remaining SOC3 contractual development milestones to be achieved. Risks remain on the qualification of technical capabilities and associated costs, on aircraft operational reliability, on cost reductions and on securing export orders in time as per the revised baseline.

Consolidated self-financed R&D expenses totalled € 3,079 million (2021: € 2,746 million).

Consolidated EBIT (reported) amounted to € 5,325 million (2021: € 5,342 million), including net Adjustments of € -302 million.

These Adjustments comprised:

€ +308 million related to the dollar pre-delivery payment mismatch and balance sheet revaluation, of which € -41 million were in Q4;

€ +28 million related to the A380 programme, of which € -5 million were in Q4;

€ -477 million related to the A400M programme, of which € -258 million were in Q4;

€ -82 million related to the Aerostructures transformation in France and Germany, of which € -34 million were in Q4;

€ -79 million of other costs including compliance, of which € -35 million were in Q4.

The financial result was € -250 million (2021: € -315 million). It mainly reflects the net interest result of € -232 million. It also includes a negative impact from the revaluation of financial instruments and a positive impact from the revaluation of certain equity investments. Consolidated net income(3) was € 4,247 million (2021: € 4,213 million) with consolidated reported earnings per share of € 5.40 (2021: € 5.36).

Consolidated free cash flow before M&A and customer financing was € 4,680 million (2021: € 3,515 million), supported by the favourable foreign exchange environment and a strong positive phasing impact from working capital. Consolidated free cash flow was € 4,324 million (2021: € 3,511 million). The 2021 dividend of € 1.50 per share, or € 1.2 billion in total, was paid in Q2 2022 while pension contributions totalled € 0.6 billion during the year. The gross cash position stood at € 23.6 billion at the end of 2022 (year-end 2021: € 22.7 billion), with a consolidated net cash position(4) of € 9.4 billion (year-end 2021: € 7.7 billion).

The Board of Directors will propose the payment of a 2022 dividend of € 1.80 per share (2021: € 1.50 per share) to the 2023 Annual General Meeting taking place on 19 April 2023. The proposed payment date is 27 April 2023.

Outlook

As the basis for its 2023 guidance, the Company assumes no additional disruptions to the world economy, air traffic, the supply chain, the Company’s internal operations, and its ability to deliver products and services.

The Company’s 2023 guidance is before M&A.

On that basis, the Company targets to achieve in 2023 around:

720 commercial aircraft deliveries;

EBIT Adjusted of € 6.0 billion;

Free Cash Flow before M&A and Customer Financing of € 3.0 billion.

The Company has received approval from the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) for its greenhouse gas emission reduction near-term targets. These targets, in line with the Paris agreement’s objectives, are based on climate science and cover the full set of the Company’s emissions. Airbus intends to reduce its Scope 1 and Scope 2 industrial emissions by up to 63% by 2030, in line with a 1.5°C pathway. The Company also committed to reducing by 46% the greenhouse gas emissions intensity generated by its commercial aircraft in service (Scope 3 - Use of Sold Product) by 2035.

Glossary

KPI DEFINITION EBIT The Company continues to use the term EBIT (Earnings before interest and taxes). It is identical to Profit before finance cost and income taxes as defined by IFRS Rules. Adjustment Adjustment, an alternative performance measure, is a term used by the Company which includes material charges or profits caused by movements in provisions related to programmes, restructuring or foreign exchange impacts as well as capital gains/losses from the disposal and acquisition of businesses. EBIT Adjusted The Company uses an alternative performance measure, EBIT Adjusted, as a key indicator capturing the underlying business margin by excluding material charges or profits caused by movements in provisions related to programmes, restructuring or foreign exchange impacts as well as capital gains/losses from the disposal and acquisition of businesses. EPS Adjusted EPS Adjusted is an alternative performance measure of basic earnings per share as reported whereby the net income as the numerator does include Adjustments. For reconciliation, see the Analyst presentation. Gross cash position The Company defines its consolidated gross cash position as the sum of (i) cash and cash equivalents and (ii) securities (all as recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position). Net cash position The Company defines its consolidated net cash position as the sum of (i) cash and cash equivalents and (ii) securities, minus (iii) financing liabilities, plus or minus (iiii) interest rate contracts related to fair value hedges (all as recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position). FCF For the definition of the alternative performance measure free cash flow, see the Universal Registration Document, MD&A section 2.1.6.1. It is a key indicator which allows the Company to measure the amount of cash flow generated from operations after cash used in investing activities. FCF before M&A Free cash flow before mergers and acquisitions refers to free cash flow as defined in the Universal Registration Document, MD&A section 2.1.6.1 adjusted for net proceeds from disposals and acquisitions. It is an alternative performance measure and key indicator that reflects free cash flow excluding those cash flows resulting from acquisitions and disposals of businesses. FCF before M&A and customer financing Free cash flow before M&A and customer financing refers to free cash flow before mergers and acquisitions adjusted for cash flow related to aircraft financing activities. It is an alternative performance measure and indicator that may be used occasionally by the Company in its financial guidance, especially when there is higher uncertainty around customer financing activities.

Footnotes:

After a reduction of two aircraft previously recorded as sold in December 2021 for which a transfer was not possible due to international sanctions against Russia. Two A330s delivered on operating lease in FY 2021. Airbus SE continues to use the term Net Income/Loss. It is identical to Profit/Loss for the period attributable to equity owners of the parent as defined by IFRS Rules. The Company has decided to refine the net cash definition to include interest rate contracts related to fair value hedges, which is also reflected in the FY 2022 balance.

"Boeing lands massive Air India order, but still loses out to Airbus - CNN","Tue, 14 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMy8wMi8xNC9idXNpbmVzcy9iaWRlbi1ib2VpbmctYWlyLWluZGlhLWFncmVlbWVudC9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFMaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyMy8wMi8xNC9idXNpbmVzcy9iaWRlbi1ib2VpbmctYWlyLWluZGlhLWFncmVlbWVudA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"New York CNN —

Boeing announced one of the largest orders in its history Tuesday. But it was still topped by rival Airbus.

Both aircraft makers announced massive orders from Air India, which is gearing up its own expansion plans.

Boeing’s order, which was announced by President Joe Biden after a call with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, was for 220 firm jet orders: 190 of Boeing 737 Max single-aisle planes, 20 of 787 Dreamliners widebodies and 10 of 777X, the newest version of its widebody now undergoing the certification process.

It’s the third biggest sale of all time for Boeing.

But Airbus announced orders for 250 jets, including 140 A320neo and 70 A321neo single-aisle planes, along with 34 A350-1000 and six A350-900 widebodies.

It’s a sign of the competitive disadvantage that Boeing still finds itself facing, especially in selling narrow-body, single-aisle jets, a segment of the market that Airbus continues to dominate.

Boeing has been narrowing the gap with Airbus in orders, helped especially by an even larger order from United late last year. For all of 2022, Boeing announced a total of 808 net commercial aircraft orders, up from 535 a year earlier. But Airbus edged it out with 820 orders.

Boeing has had a particularly hard couple of years. It experienced a 20-month grounding of its best-selling 737 Max following two fatal crashes, with rising trade tensions between China and the United States leading to a virtual halt in sales to China, the world’s largest market for plane sales, and of course the pandemic.

But even in 2018, when Boeing reported record sales revenue, it trailed Airbus by about 200 net jet orders for the year.

Outlook for aircraft orders improving

The good news for Boeing is that aircraft manufacturing is essentially split between the two companies, and there’s a long backlog of orders at both. Boeing had a backlog of nearly 4,600 jets on its books at the end of January.

And as the Air India order demonstrates, global airlines are starting to gear up to make new purchases as they climb out of years of losses caused by the plunge in demand during the pandemic.

Global air traffic is expected to boom this year, returning to pre-pandemic levels in June, according to a new report from aircraft leasing company Avolon.

And the global airline industry is expected to return to profitability this year for the first time since 2019, according to the International Air Transport Association. The US industry already returned to profitability in 2022.

Boeing’s Air India order was valued at a list price of $34 billion. Airbus no longer publishes a list price for its aircraft, but its most recent list price from 2018 would have valued its Air India order at nearly $38 billion.

Airlines do not pay full list prices for commercial jets, especially when placing an order this large. But even at a discount of 50%, which is not unusual, Boeing’s Air India order would mean a sale valued at $17 billion.

That’s an important lift to a company still struggling to recover from the plunge in revenue and financial losses it suffered over the last four years.

Boeing’s 2022 revenue came in at $66.6 billion, up $8 billion from the trough in sales in 2020, but far lower than its record 2018 revenue of $101 billion before the grounding. Boeing gets most of its sales revenue once a plane is delivered, and the 777X has yet to be built. The planes in this order are years away from delivery.

The Air India purchase also includes an option that allows it to buy an additional 50 Boeing 737 Max’s and 20 Boeing 787s, totaling 290 airplanes. At list price, that order would be valued at $45.9 billion.

Biden touts order

In a statement, Biden said the sale would “support over one million American jobs across 44 states, and many will not require a four-year college degree.”

“This announcement also reflects the strength of the U.S.-India economic partnership,” Biden wrote. “Together with Prime Minister Modi, I look forward to deepening our partnership even further as we continue to confront shared global challenges — creating a more secure and prosperous future for all of our citizens.”

Production will support three separate U.S.-based manufacturing lines, have a total economic impact of $70 billion across the United States and support an estimated 1.47 million direct and indirect jobs, a White House official said Tuesday.

India’s growing economic might

India has been gaining some manufacturing business as Western tensions flare with China, including major companies that traditionally rely heavily on Chinese production. Apple is one such company, with Minister of Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal saying the tech giant was already making between 5% and 7% of its products in India.

India is set to overtake China this year to become the world’s most populous country. The country’s massive and cheap labor force, which includes workers with key technical skills, is a big draw for manufacturers. Asia’s third-largest economy also offers a growing domestic market. In 2023, as global recession fears persist, India is expected to remain the fastest growing major economy in the world.

If it can sustain that momentum, India could become only the third country with GDP worth $10 trillion by 2035, according to the Centre for Economics and Business Research, after the US and China.

Boeing woes

Boeing’s (BA) 737 Max has been plagued with problems, but production and orders for the troubled aircraft has picked up, boosted by an even larger order from United late last year. In June, Ethiopian Airlines took delivery of a 737 Max from Boeing for the first time since the March 2019 crash that killed all 157 people on board, and led to a 20-month grounding of the jet.

The company has plenty of other troubles in China, the world’s largest aviation market. It has been on the verge of being virtually shut out of the region as trade tensions between the United States and China have basically halted Boeing sales in the country for the last four years.

The company has not announced any sales to a Chinese passenger airline since November 2017, and the country banned the Boeing 737 Max for much longer than most countries. In January, a Boeing 737 Max took off in China for the first time since 2019.

Boeing has faced myriad problems in recent years, beyond the drop in demand for passenger planes that occurred during the pandemic. Delivery of the 787 Dreamliner widebody jets resumed last year after they were halted due to quality control issues.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9995571970939636}",positive,0.9995571970939636,1

"Air India reveals orders for 470 Boeing, Airbus jets - The Associated Press","Tue, 14 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL21hY3Jvbi1tb2RpLWluZGlhLWJ1c2luZXNzLTU0N2E2YmNiZmMxMDFiZjNmMjg3MDI1OGMxMzE1Nzhi0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LONDON (AP) — Air India unveiled orders Tuesday for 470 Boeing and Airbus passenger jets as it races to tap surging demand for increasingly affordable air travel from the nation’s growing ranks of middle-class consumers.

India’s largest international airline and second-largest domestic carrier is buying 220 Boeing aircraft valued at $34 billion. It marks the U.S. plane maker’s third-largest sale of all time, in dollar value, and its second of all time in quantity.

Air India is also buying 250 passenger jets from European plane manufacturer Airbus, with the orders championed by the leaders of the U.S., France and India.

The Boeing “purchase will support over 1 million American jobs across 44 states, and many will not require a four-year college degree,” U.S. President Joe Biden said. “This announcement also reflects the strength of the U.S.-India economic partnership.”

Air India is seeking to reinvent itself by expanding its operations and modernizing its fleet. The new jets will help the airline’s owner, Tata Sons, compete against upstart discount rivals including India’s dominant carrier, IndiGo.

“India is going to be the world’s third-largest market in the aviation sector,” Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a videoconference. Over the next 15 years, it’s estimated that India will need more than 2,000 aircraft, and “today’s historic announcement will help in meeting this growing demand.”

The Boeing order includes 190 737 Max aircraft, 20 of its 787s, and 10 of its 777Xs. The purchase includes customer options for an additional 50 737 MAXs and 20 of its 787s, which would make it 290 airplanes for a total of $45.9 billion at list price.

Toulouse, France-based Airbus will provide Air India 40 wide-body A350 Airbus aircraft and another 210 narrow-body A320neo planes, Tata Sons Chairman Natarajan Chandrasekaran said in the call with Modi and French President Emmanuel Macron.

Airbus did not disclose financial terms of the deal, which could be worth tens of billions of dollars.

“Today is a historic moment for India, for Air India and for Airbus,” Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury said in the call. The size of the order “demonstrates the appetite for growth in the Indian aviation industry. It’s the fastest growing in the world.”

Chandrasekaran said the A350s will be used to “fly all ultra long distance across the globe.” Single-aisle A320s are typically used on short-haul routes. He said the airline has “significant options” to increase its order.

“The order’s massive, but a lot of it is long overdue replacement. Air India is way behind in modernizing their fleet,” said Brendan Sobie, a Singapore-based independent aviation analyst.

Demand for air travel in India and elsewhere in Asia has boomed over the past decade, fueled by fast-growing economies that have raised incomes and made travel more affordable for many millions of people.

For Air India, “there’s a lot of catch up to do,” Sobie said. It’s competing with newer budget airlines that moved faster to tap demand on domestic services as well as foreign carriers that are formidable competitors on international routes, he added.

Tata Sons, India’s oldest and largest conglomerate, regained ownership of the debt-laden national carrier last year. The Tata Group pioneered commercial aviation in India when it launched the airline in 1932. It was taken over by the government in 1953.

Modi and Macron applauded the Airbus deal, with both saying it’s a sign of the strengthening “strategic partnership” between their countries.

Macron called the deal a “new success” and an opportunity to “develop new areas of cooperation with India.”

Tata is integrating Air India with Vistara, which it jointly runs with Singapore Airlines, and with Air Asia India, which it runs with Malaysian discount operator Air Asia.

"Airbus Aims for 720 Deliveries in 2023, Eases A320 Production Rate - Aviation Pros","Fri, 17 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hdmlhdGlvbnByb3MuY29tL2FpcmNyYWZ0L2NvbW1lcmNpYWwtYWlybGluZS9uZXdzLzIxMjk2MTQyL2FpcmJ1cy1haW1zLWZvci03MjAtZGVsaXZlcmllcy1pbi0yMDIzLWVhc2VzLWEzMjAtcHJvZHVjdGlvbi1yYXRl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Frankfurt — Airbus is postponing the expansion of its medium-haul jet production in view of supply chain issues, the group announced when presenting its annual financial results on Thursday.

The planned record output per month of 75 models of the A320neo family will probably not be reached until 2026 instead of 2025, the European aircraft giant said.

The interim target of 65 aircraft per month will be postponed to the end of 2024.

On the other hand, the world's largest aircraft manufacturer intends to slightly increase the production of its A330neo wide-body jets, from three per month to four in 2024.

For this year, Airbus chief executive Guillaume Faury is targeting the delivery of a total of 720 commercial aircraft - the same as was planned for 2022. In the end, Airbus handed over 661 jets last year.

""The industry continued its recovery during 2022, with air traffic increasing and airlines turning to their long-term fleet planning,"" Faury said in the results statement.

""We delivered solid financials despite an adverse operating environment that prevented our supply chain from recovering at the pace we expected. The vompany had to adjust its operations accordingly, which led to lower commercial aircraft deliveries than originally planned. We are adapting our production to match supply.""

Last year, Airbus increased its revenue by 13% to just under €58.8 billion ($62.9 billion). Earnings before interest and taxes adjusted for special items rose by 16% to €5.6 billion, exceeding the expectations of analysts.

The earnings statement pointed to strong performances by Airbus Defence and Space and Airbus Helicopters, and said the group benefited from a firm dollar.

For the last three-month period of the year, the company recorded a net income of €1.679 billion ($1.796 billion), or €2.13 per share, up from €1.578 billion, or €2.01 per share, in the last quarter of the prior year.

Underlying earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), however, dropped to €1.773 billion from last year's €1.905 billion in the period.

However, adjusted EBIT rose to €2.146 billion from the previous year's €1.496 billion.

In the fourth quarter, the company generated revenue of €20.644 billion, up from €16.994 billion in the same period the year before.

For the 2022 full-year, the board will pay a dividend of €1.80 per share, higher than last year's €1.50 per share.

Looking ahead, for the fiscal 2023, Airbus expects adjusted EBIT of €6 billion.

"Airbus, Boeing Production Delays Will Hold Back Airline Growth in 2023 - airlineweekly.skift.com","Fri, 17 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vYWlybGluZXdlZWtseS5za2lmdC5jb20vMjAyMy8wMi9haXJidXMtYm9laW5nLXByb2R1Y3Rpb24tZGVsYXlzLXdpbGwtaG9sZC1iYWNrLWFpcmxpbmUtZ3Jvd3RoLWluLTIwMjMv0gF0aHR0cHM6Ly9haXJsaW5ld2Vla2x5LnNraWZ0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzAyL2FpcmJ1cy1ib2VpbmctcHJvZHVjdGlvbi1kZWxheXMtd2lsbC1ob2xkLWJhY2stYWlybGluZS1ncm93dGgtaW4tMjAyMy8_YW1wPTE?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The aircraft production issues that Airbus and Boeing have faced through the pandemic recovery are not getting any worse. But they are also not yet getting better, which has forced airlines to accept that the industry’s recovery and growth will remain constrained for at least another year.

Delivery delays for new Airbus A220 and A320 family aircraft, and Boeing 737 Maxes are “certainly worse than three months, and it’s not getting any better,” Air Lease Corp. Executive Chairman Steven Udvar-Hazy said during the lessor’s fourth-quarter earnings call Thursday.

And it was not only Udvar-Hazy indicating the situation is not improving. Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury, speaking during the Toulouse-based airframer’s own earnings call on Thursday, said supply chain issues had “stopped degrading” but were not yet getting better. This prompted Airbus’ target of just 720 commercial aircraft deliveries in 2023, essentially equal to the goal set for last year of just over 700 deliveries. The planemaker delivered only 661 planes in 2022.

Airlines are feeling a very real pinch from these delays. United Airlines disclosed Thursday that, of 147 new A321neos and 737 Maxes due this year, an estimated 51 aircraft will not arrive until at least 2024. As a result, the Chicago-based carrier has “delayed a portion of our previously planned capacity increases for full year 2023” due to the aircraft delays, as well as other macro uncertainties. United plans to grow capacity in the “high teens” compared to 2022 this year.

Southwest Airlines anticipates around 36 of the 136 737 Maxes it is due to take this year will slide into 2024, and Norwegian Air has said 10 of its 737 Max deliveries are delayed until next year. And Alaska Airlines and Delta Air Lines have both said that Airbus and Boeing have notified them of likely delays to their aircraft deliveries in 2023.

Just how much airline capacity will not fly this year due to the delivery delays is unclear. The industry faces numerous other constraints on its growth, including staffing issues — both a lack of staff and new staff that are less productive than before the pandemic — air traffic control constraints and infrastructure limits. But there is widespread agreement that limited availability of new aircraft will have an impact.

“Supply chain constraints in our industry … will limit the addition of capacity in global aviation probably for years to come,” Lufthansa Group CEO Carsten Spohr said in October. Lufthansa will temporarily bring back its superjumbo Airbus A380s this summer due to delays to new aircraft it has on order, including to the A350, 787, and 777X.

Even as Airbus and Boeing struggle to deliver aircraft, airlines are desperate for them. ALC CEO John Pleuger Thursday described the current market as a “high-demand environment” for new planes. The lessor has placed 90 percent of its new deliveries through 2024, and lease renewals remain at historic highs of around 90 percent. Airlines historically renewed leases on roughly 60 percent of aircraft.

This market has Airbus eager to build more planes where it can. The planemaker will increase production of its two widebody jets in coming years. The A330neo will go to four-aircraft per month next year, and the A350 to nine-aircraft a month in 2025 from six today. These bumps are in response to what Faury described as “growing demand for widebody aircraft.”

Air India on Tuesday signed letters of intent for 470 Airbus and Boeing aircraft in the largest order in the airline’s history. And, in December, United placed a mega order for up to 300 new 737 Maxes and 787s.

Where Airbus is struggling is with producing narrowbody planes. The airframer has delayed a planned production increase for its popular A320 family to 75 aircraft per month by a year to 2026. And engine supply issues continue to constrain deliveries of new A220 aircraft.

“We really believe that’s feasible in the current environment,” Faury said of the planemaker’s production goal for this year and planned rate hikes.

Boeing said in January that 737 Max production rates had “stabilized” at 31 aircraft per month, and it targets 787 rates of five per month by the end of the year. The Arlington, Virginia-based planemaker plans to raise rates to 50 737s and 10 787s a month in 2025-26.

“We remain skeptical that Airbus and Boeing will meet their aspirational production rate goals over the next two to three years,” Pleuger said.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9993422627449036}",negative,0.9993422627449036,-1

A350 aircraft of choice for Air India’s renaissance in long haul travel

A320 Family to be the cornerstone of Air India’s domestic and regional fleet

Mumbai, 14 February 2023 – The Tata Group-owned Air India has announced its commitment to order 250 Airbus aircraft to boost its domestic and international operations. The commitment includes 140 A320neo and 70 A321neo single-aisle aircraft as well as 34 A350-1000 and six A350-900 wide-body jets that will mark a new era for the country as the all-new, long-range aircraft celebrates its debut in the Indian market.

The order aims to both modernise and expand the airline’s fleet with the objective of creating a larger and premium full-service carrier that will cater to the growing travel demand in the region. Deliveries are set to commence with the first A350-900 arriving by late-2023.

“Airbus has been a longstanding partner of Air India, and these new aircraft will play an important part in delivering Vihaan.AI, Air India’s comprehensive transformation and growth strategy,” said Campbell Wilson, CEO and MD, Air India. “A core element of this transformation is the significant expansion of our network, both domestically and internationally, coupled with the elevation of our on-ground and onboard product to world-class standards. This order marks the start of a new chapter for both Airbus and Air India.”

“This is a historic moment for Airbus and for Air India. India is on the verge of an international air travel revolution and we are honoured that our partnership with the Tatas and our aircraft solutions will write that new chapter for the country’s air-connectivity,” says Christian Scherer, Airbus Chief Commercial Officer and Head of International. “The A350’s unique capability will unlock the pent-up potential of India’s long-haul market, its technology, long reach and second to none comfort will enable new routes and passenger experience with better economics and enhanced sustainability. Alongside the A350s, the A320 Family fleets will be the efficient, versatile asset to continue democratising and decarbonising air travel in the country – from domestic, regional, up to international levels.”

Christian Scherer adds: “We salute Air India for its visionary strategy, picking the two reference aircraft types in each of their categories. We are thrilled and humbled to see these aircraft become the cornerstones of Air India’s renaissance. This fleet will propel the airline globally where it deserves to be - with the best.

Over the next decade, India will grow to have the largest population in the world, its economy will expand the fastest among the G20 nations, and a burgeoning middle class will spend more on air travel. As a result, passenger traffic in India will grow fast, including on the long-range markets in the U.S., Europe and Asia-Pacific that the A350 is well positioned to serve.

The A350 is the world’s most modern and efficient wide-body aircraft in the 300-410 seater category. The A350’s clean sheet design includes state-of-the-art technologies and aerodynamics delivering unmatched standards of efficiency and comfort. Its new generation engines and use of lightweight materials bring a 25 per cent advantage in fuel burn, operating costs and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions, compared to previous generation competitor aircraft.

The aircraft offers a 3-class configuration cabin that is the quietest of any twin-aisle and offers passengers and crew the most modern in-flight products for the most comfortable long-range flying experience.

The A321neo is the longest-fuselage member of Airbus’ best-selling, single-aisle A320 Family, comfortably seating 180 to 220 passengers in a typical two-class layout, and as many as 244 in a higher-density arrangement. The A320neo has already set the standards as the world’s most comfortable short-to-medium-haul aircraft that typically accommodates from 140 to 170 passengers, with a maximum capacity of up to 180 travellers. Its environmental performance allows for at least 20 per cent less fuel burn and CO 2 emissions as well as 50 per cent noise reduction, compared to previous generation aircraft.

One year of operations – great expectations for Airbus Beluga Transport in 2023… - Airbus Aircraft,"Wed, 08 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL2FpcmNyYWZ0LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIzLTAyLW9uZS15ZWFyLW9mLW9wZXJhdGlvbnMtZ3JlYXQtZXhwZWN0YXRpb25zLWZvci1haXJidXMtYmVsdWdhLXRyYW5zcG9ydC1pbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"One year after the inaugural mission of Airbus’ new Beluga transport service, the operation has been gathering pace – with its first two A300-600STs now traversing the globe delivering special payloads for its customers. The third aircraft will join the fleet later this year, and by the end of 2025 all five BelugaST airframes should be in operation, raising the combined capacity up to 200 missions per year.

New dedicated subsidiary

In July 2022 Airbus created a new dedicated subsidiary company – “Airbus Beluga Transport” (AiBT) – which will in the near future be responsible for operating the fleet of Belugas under its own Air Operator Certificate (AOC). Currently, all the Beluga missions continue to be operated by teams from Airbus Transport International (ATI) – on behalf of AiBT. In particular, ATI provides the load certification for each flight, the flight crews, the ground personnel and ATI is in charge of managing the Operations Control Centre (OCC).

Operational highlights in 2022

Benoit Lemonnier, AIBT’s recently appointed managing director brings us up to speed on the notable achievements and highlights in 2022: “Together with ATI we've made great progress in the first year of operations: We performed six real missions with payload which means we could really convince Airbus Helicopters and Airbus Defence and Space (ADS) about the confidence they can place in our solution to deliver their outsized cargo to their customers anywhere in the world.”

The first mission – to deliver a new Airbus H225 helicopter from Marseille, France to Kobe, Japan – was followed by four more H225 deliveries to Singapore and one ACH160 to Sao Paulo in Brazil.

The year also saw the first delivery by the new service of a space vehicle: an Airbus-produced Hotbird 13G telecommunications satellite to Cape Canaveral in the USA. Following-up on this milestone, at the time of writing a second Airbus-made satellite, this time for Inmarsat, had just been delivered by Beluga to the Kennedy Space Center, in preparation for its launch on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.

“For this year we have an ambitious plan to deliver more than 30 missions. So we have great expectations,” says Benoit.

Expanding the external customer base

While up to now introductory operations have focused on other Airbus divisions, the aim of course is to take on an increasing proportion of external customers.

Reza Fazlollahi, Head of Sales at AiBT provides an update: “Today we have already filled almost 50% of our slots for the year. While most of these are for helicopters plus some space satellites for Airbus group, we also have additional customers for various types of cargo as well, including 20-foot and 40-foot containers. This year we also aim at transporting aircraft engines and more helicopter types – including those from other manufacturers.”

He adds: “During this year we will deliver space modules for external customers. 2023 will also be the first year when we'll be using the BelugaXL to transport outsized cargo from Europe to North America.”

“Every day we receive requests for quotations from customers all around the world, and they're very excited to be able to charter the Beluga,” he observes. “Many of these requests are for transporting voluminous cargo, such as large containers for machinery production equipment – for which the Beluga is the perfect solution. Eventually, most of the customers will be from outside the Airbus group.”

Enhancing sustainability in operation

Reza identifies additional opportunities: “We aim to maximise revenue while being more environmentally sustainable on our pre-positioning and back-to-base post-positioning flights (ie not flying empty on these sectors) by allocating some general cargo, such as the standard 20-foot containers and transporting them at the market price. This will also contribute to amortising our costs.”

He notes: “The Beluga is already certified to fly with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), so whenever we can source fuel we will try to use that as well.”

Becoming an independent new airline

Aside from ramping-up business from new customers world-wide, the big goal for this year is for AiBT to become a new airline with its own Air Operator Certificate (AOC) – thus becoming fully independent from ATI and Airbus Operations. Concurrently, work is underway to on-board full time AiBT staff to be fit for entry-into-service, either from internal or external hirings. By the end of the year it aims to have around 80 staff.

Meanwhile a taskforce is intensively engaged in authoring the operating manuals, preparing the safety management system and IT tools for the new airline – while applying the best practices of 25 years’ experience from ATI.

""We aim to build trust with the authorities that AiBT will safely start operations with the new company in all aspects,"" says Benoit.

“It's a ‘masterpiece’ of work by all the teams at ATI and AiBT to implement all airline procedures,” he enthuses. “With the fruits of our joint efforts, we plan to be ready to submit our AOC application to the French DGAC national airworthiness authority by latest April, and hopefully it will be granted over the summer.”

Aircraft systems and cargo loading upgrades

Various capability upgrades to enhance flexibility for the aircraft’s loading capability are also being phased-in over the next couple of years to match the service’s new external customer-oriented missions.

“We've recently received our first On-Board-Cargo-Loader (OBCL) equipment. We also plan to install a new flight management system (FMS) with a worldwide navigation database, an on board heater (to protect sensitive cargo from rapid temperature changes and related condensation during ascent and descent), as well as a Class-E cargo hold fire-suppression system.”

The Class-E capability will confer added flexibility and enable shorter approval lead times for transporting new types of non-inert cargo – such as items containing Li-Ion batteries for example. Whereas up to now the Beluga has typically been tasked to carry inert metallic and composite aircraft structures between Airbus sites only.

“The OBCL is the most prominent enabler at least in the short term since it will facilitate self-embarking and self-loading/unloading capability for payloads of up to 20 tonnes. This will allow us to perform autonomous operations at the airport, for example by not having to bring in an external fixed platform and a crane,” highlights Benoit.

The first OBCL is already being tested at a secondary airport near Toulouse. For these initial trials the team is deploying and retracting the OBCL from the Beluga without payload. Later this year they will progress to tests with actual payloads.

“Once the OBCL is operational it will be a game changer for some missions if we can go there with the OBCL because it will allow us to be much more reactive to serve more routes,” he stresses.

AiBT already has around six of the specially developed Outboard Platforms (OPs), and is manufacturing up to another 10 to be ready by the end of this year. OPs, which can handle the Beluga’s largest and heaviest loads, will be pre-positioned around the world to be as close as possible to the customers.

Another enabler is the Multi-Purpose-Pallet (MPP). This is an artificial floor to which cargo is attached and which interfaces to the load-bearing attachment points inside the aircraft.

New dedicated airport and maintenance bases

In order to become fully independent from Airbus Operations at Blagnac, AiBT is already developing a presence at a new main base: Francazal Aéroport situated south-west of Toulouse.

“Today, we are still operating out of the Saint Martin site and Toulouse Blagnac airport, which is competing with Airbus as an OEM, and this is not sustainable. Therefore we will secure our new base at Francazal and start and finish our missions there. We are already renting a building as well as several parking places. Moreover, for maintenance, the aircraft would be positioned at an aerodrome facility in Bordeaux,” he reveals.

The way ahead in 2023

Benoit is confident for the year to come: “There’s a growing demand for our Beluga service and we have demonstrated last year our ability to perform more missions, so we have a correspondingly ambitious plan to create and grow our airline industrial system.”

“Full success will come also with simplification and flexibility in our Beluga operations,” he predicts. “A prerequisite for maximising utilisation of the aircraft will be that we can take new payloads. So that we are working towards a simplified certification process with a shorter lead time and this is still ongoing. And in parallel we are building the second airline which should come to birth in the summer.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9401834011077881}",neutral,0.9401834011077881,0
New consortium to enable zero emission aviation to take off in Aotearoa New Zealand - Airbus,"Fri, 10 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMy0wMi1uZXctY29uc29ydGl1bS10by1lbmFibGUtemVyby1lbWlzc2lvbi1hdmlhdGlvbi10by10YWtlLW9mZi1pbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Six international businesses have launched a new consortium to bring zero-emission aviation to life in New Zealand.

Christchurch, NZ, 10 February 2023 - The Hydrogen Consortium’s vision is to support the country to pioneer the commercial deployment of green hydrogen-powered aircraft.

The partners are international aerospace leader Airbus, global green energy company Fortescue Future Industries (FFI), leading world airline Air New Zealand, next generation energy company Hiringa Energy, liquid hydrogen solution pioneers Fabrum and New Zealand’s Christchurch Airport.

The Hydrogen Consortium was launched at Christchurch Airport, which is developing a 400-hectare renewable energy precinct called Kowhai Park.

Speaking at the launch, Christchurch Airport chief executive Justin Watson said climate change has further strengthened the international aviation sector’s resolve to decarbonise.

“Major progress is being made,” Watson says. “There have been successful test flights of zero emission aircraft already. There are new sustainable aviation fuels that can cut emissions by up to 80% and a huge amount of research is going into how to commercialise these solutions.

“The Hydrogen Consortium will see some of the world’s best experts collaborate on one of the most promising zero emission fuels – green hydrogen.”

Airbus is working to develop and put into service the world’s first hydrogen-powered commercial passenger aircraft by 2035.

In close cooperation with its partners, Airbus will factor in aviation's requirement for hydrogen in New Zealand. Using its hydrogen hubs at airports concept, Airbus will engage with aviation and non-aviation players to perform a complete assessment of energy supply needs to enable the operation of hydrogen powered aircraft.

Airbus’ Vice President of the ZEROe Ecosystem Karine Guenan says the journey to sustainable aviation requires an entire ecosystem to be put into place – one that will involve key players from a variety of sectors.

""The consortium we are building brings together a number of pioneering partners with a common interest: to make hydrogen-powered aviation in New Zealand a reality.""

Christchurch liquid hydrogen solutions company Fabrum recently designed the hydrogen-powered technology for the Emirates Team New Zealand chase boat (Chase Zero) and has developed lightweight liquid hydrogen fuel tank technology for aviation use.

Co-founder Christopher Boyle is in no doubt the future of clean aviation rests on the shoulders of green hydrogen.

“The consortium pulls together some of world’s best experts in green hydrogen – having all of these organisations around the same table will turbocharge what we all learn. Together we’ll make a big difference in taking zero emission aviation forward which is good news to anyone who wants to fly sustainably in the future,” said Christopher Boyle.

Hiringa Energy is a pioneering green hydrogen developer, producer and supplier.

It’s constructing key infrastructure to support New Zealand’s transition to green hydrogen in multiple transport sectors including aviation, marine and heavy road transport. Hiringa’s first four production and high-capacity refuelling stations are coming online in 2023, with nationwide expansion planned from 2024.

Its chief executive Andrew Clennett said green hydrogen adoption is accelerating around the world, and New Zealand is well positioned to be a leader in this space.

“There are green hydrogen-fuelled buses, trucks, trains and boats already in service - some of them we have been refuelling here in New Zealand, including the Emirates Team New Zealand chase boat. Aircraft are a key next step, and this consortium has formed to ensure these planes have the infrastructure and hydrogen supply they will need to take off here. Our team is very motivated to leverage our hands-on experience bringing green hydrogen to market to make this transition happen”

A focus on research; the potential for trial flights in New Zealand

Over the next six months the partners will work together to design a hydrogen ecosystem for aviation in New Zealand.

The first phase will focus on research, which will be completed by the end of 2023.

The consortium will develop a vision for hydrogen aviation in New Zealand, examine the hydrogen supply chain and its challenges, assess the local aviation market’s projected hydrogen needs to 2050, and develop a pathway of policies, regulations and incentives to promote the development of hydrogen aviation.

The second phase will focus on whether hydrogen aircraft test flights can be held in New Zealand.

Air New Zealand has two ambitious goals – to fly its first commercial demonstrator flight from 2026 and begin replacing its Q300 Turboprop fleet from 2030 with low emission aircraft.

The airline’s Chief Sustainability Officer Kiri Hannifin said the consortium’s work will be important to Air New Zealand achieving those ambitions.

“To fly hydrogen-powered aircraft in New Zealand we will need an aviation ecosystem that can support it. The Hydrogen Consortium brings together energy, aircraft, airline operator and airport expertise with the aim of bringing this to life. We can’t wait to see what we can achieve together,” said Ms Hannifin.

Fortescue Future Industries (FFI) CEO Mark Hutchinson said the coming together of such innovative organisations marked a significant moment in the pursuit of fossil fuel-free air travel.

“Fortescue Future Industries is a global green energy and technology business that will bring to the consortium its knowhow in mega-scale renewables and zero-emissions green hydrogen production and delivery,” Mr Hutchinson said. “We are on a mission to eliminate fossil fuels, including from the aviation industry, and green hydrogen is the key to achieving this.

“Green hydrogen and green energy is the practical, implementable solution we all need now and we must race to deliver it at scale. The consortium members all have extraordinary expertise in and commitment to the decarbonisation of air travel and together we believe we can develop a pathway to New Zealand becoming a global trailblazer in this pursuit,” concluded Mark Hutchinson.

Christchurch Airport

christchurchairport.co.nz/about-us/

Christchurch Airport has been recognised as global leader in sustainability.

In 2020 it became the first airport in the world to reach the highest level of decarbonisation under the Airports Council’s International’s carbon accreditation programme.

Its greenhouse gas emissions have been independently audited every year since 2006 with Scope 1 emissions (those under its direct control) now nearly 90% lower than 2015 levels.

The airport’s sustainability approach is science-based with targets set to ensure it decarbonises at a rate that will keep global warming to 1.5 degrees (the target enshrined in the Paris Agreement). It is currently 14 years ahead of where it needs to be.

Enabling other businesses, particularly its airline partners, to decarbonise is a key focus and the airport is developing a renewable energy precinct, Kōwhai Park, to provide the green energy the new generations of electric and hydrogen aircraft will require.

The Transall Turns 60 - Airbus,"Thu, 23 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIzLTAyLXRoZS10cmFuc2FsbC10dXJucy02MNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"On January 22, 1963, French President Charles de Gaulle and German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer signed the Elysée Treaty, a bilateral agreement establishing close ties between the two countries in the areas of security, diplomacy, and education.

On February 25, 1963, the prototype of the C160 Transall (TRANSport ALLiance), a military cargo aircraft resulting from French-German cooperation, made its first flight at Melun-Villaroche.

Both of these anniversaries deserve to be celebrated for their significance in highlighting how aviation, and space technology, have been major instruments in the construction of a united Europe, and for recognizing the fruitful cooperation between France and Germany as one of the seeds of Airbus's creation and success.

The Franco-German Military Cargo Plane and Its Legacy

The Transall project began in 1957 when Nord-Aviation proposed a cargo aircraft to replace the ageing Noratlas for the French Air Force. As French needs alone were not sufficient to ensure the program's viability, a partner had to be found, and Germany became interested in the project. On December 15, 1958, three aircraft manufacturers were selected to study and produce the aircraft: Nord-Aviation on the French side, and Weser Flugzeugbau (VFW) and Hamburger Flugzeugbau (HFB) on the German side.

In 1959, the aircraft’s design was defined, starting with the choice of Rolls Royce Tyne engines. On December 16, 1959, an intergovernmental agreement launched the program, and production was split between the three cooperating countries' factories. Assembly lines were established in Bourges, Bremen, and Hamburg.

Finally, on November 22, 1967, the first C160 was delivered to the French Air Force, followed by its German counterpart in April 1968. Production continued until 1973, resulting in a total of 169 aircraft, including three prototypes, six pre-production models, and 160 serial aircraft, 50 for the French Air Force and 110 for the Luftwaffe.



In addition to the standard version, two variants were added: one for South Africa (Z) and another for the French postal service (P). Other planned developments never materialised, such as the C161, equipped with an elevated cockpit and front access to the cargo hold, a twin-engine (C161J Jet), and even a quad-engine Transall.

However, the Transall NG (New Generation) announced by Aerospatiale, MBB, and VFW on May 7, 1976, did come to fruition. The aircraft was equipped with modern avionics and an in-flight refuelling boom. This time, a single assembly line was established in Toulouse, as only France ordered 25 units. The C160 NG made its first flight on April 9, 1981, and deliveries began in 1982.

The Transall's silhouette is well-known to the public for having been featured on the news many times. Robust and reliable, the Transall has been involved in all military and humanitarian operations from the 1970s to 2020.



The Transall's operational history in France and Germany concluded in two stages. The Luftwaffe bid farewell to it on October 11, 2021, and on April 3, 2022, the last flight of a C160 under French colours took place. The aircraft, registered as 212, joined the Aeroscopia Museum in Blagnac, not far from the factory where it was born. In 2023 two C160s remain in service with the Turkish Air Force.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999915361404419}",neutral,0.9999915361404419,0

As passengers' favourite around the world, the A380 has also transformed passengers’ idea of air travel and continues to do so 15 years after the aircraft's first commercial flight.

As the biggest A380 operator in the world with 120 aircraft, the story of the A380 is closely linked to Emirates. The airline has flown more than 100 million passengers to over 60 destinations around the globe on this aircraft. And with the launch of its new premium economy cabin, Emirates continues to push the boundaries of innovation and cabin design. Indeed the first of 120 Emirates aircraft to have completed its refurbishment has been deployed this month on the Dubai-London service.

The fully refreshed A380 features Emirates airline’s latest products and interiors across all cabins, including 56 Premium Economy class seats on the main deck, and new colour palettes evident in the carpeting and wall panels. On the upper deck, First and Business Class seats sport Emirates airline’s latest cream-coloured leather upholstery and lighter-toned wood finishing.

This major A380 cabin upgrade is a meaningful example of the additional value that Airbus Services can bring to in-service aircraft and illustrates how the A380 will continue to fly our skies for years to come, with new revenue schemes and an enhanced passenger experience. The A380 fleet is very actively returned to service by our customers - and Emirates is no exception - confirming the market need and appetite for this product.

Airbus demonstrated its expertise in managing refurbishment programmes

Teams of engineers and technicians have worked round the clock, taking apart the entire interior of the A380 and refitting the parts again in a carefully planned and tested sequence. This project presented a very challenging timeline that Airbus helped to deliver on time, with flexibility and agility, adapting the technical scope to meet Emirates’ needs.

What was expected to be an 18-month retrofit programme was delivered in less than 12 months from signature to delivery. This included the qualification of new suppliers, while successfully overcoming supply chain disruptions due to the COVID pandemic.

Airbus adapted its engineering capabilities and other services to meet the evolving requirements of Emirates. This encompassed providing all the Services Bulletins (including engineering drawings) and kits to install 56 additional Premium Economy seats in the main deck of the A380, in a 2-4-2 configuration similar to the latest A380s delivered. In addition, Airbus supplied the kits required to install a new satcom antenna that will provide passengers with enhanced inflight entertainment and connectivity on the flagship aircraft. Through this retrofit project, Airbus Services has demonstrated its ability to deliver an optimised combination of modifications approved through both Airbus Type Certification and Supplemental Type Certification.

Airbus is also supporting Emirates airline’s sustainability journey by improving the number of re-used parts and thus, reducing the environmental impact of the retrofit.

The ambitious refurbishment programme will be carried out on 67 A380s by 2024.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.739233136177063}",positive,0.739233136177063,1
Airbus receives SBTi validation for its near-term greenhouse gas emission reduction targets - Airbus,"Thu, 16 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIzLTAyLWFpcmJ1cy1yZWNlaXZlcy1zYnRpLXZhbGlkYXRpb24tZm9yLWl0cy1uZWFyLXRlcm0tZ3JlZW5ob3VzZS1nYXMtZW1pc3Npb27SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has now received approval from the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) for its greenhouse gas emission reduction targets between now and the next 5-10 years.

These targets are based on climate science and cover the full set of its emissions: Scope 1, 2 and 3.

By now, we are all very familiar with the Paris Agreement and the long-term goals that were set in 2015 in relation to climate change. We know that globally, greenhouse gas emissions need to be substantially reduced and the global temperature increase must be limited to less than 1.5 °C if we are to avoid crossing an irreversible ‘tipping point’.

These recommendations were based on climate science, so it makes sense that we continue to use climate science to guide the targets we set and the actions we take.

In 2022, Airbus officially committed to defining science-based targets for the entire set of its emissions. We submitted these targets to the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), an independent organisation that helps companies to define and promote best practice in emissions reductions and targets in line with climate science.

The SBTi has independently assessed and verified these targets, and Airbus has now received approval for its near-term greenhouse gas emission reduction targets.

What are the targets Airbus has committed to?

Airbus intends to reduce its Scope 1 and Scope 2 industrial emissions by up to 63% by 2030, in line with a 1.5 °C pathway.

We already have several projects in place to help us achieve this.

For example, we are securing 100% renewable and low-carbon electricity supply to all sites in Europe by 2024. We are exploring similar opportunities in other regions such as the United States and China following this approach.

We are also replacing lighting, heating and steam systems with biomass and geothermal solutions on our sites.

And we have been improving our internal logistics by using sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in our Beluga transport aircraft since 2019. In 2022, we also began to use SAF in our flight testing. We have also made a commitment to increase the share of SAF used in these activities progressively up to at least 30% by 2030.

Beyond this, we have committed to reducing by 46% the greenhouse gas emissions intensity generated by its commercial aircraft in service (Scope 3 - Use of Sold Product) by 2035.

There are a wide range of decarbonisation levers that will contribute to this goal, but we are focusing on making operational improvements, replacing older and less efficient aircraft and ramping up the use of SAF (supporting the wider SAF ecosystem).

Both targets are based on the 2015 year as a baseline and in line with the Paris Agreement goals.

show more show less You may have heard that greenhouse gas emissions are either Scope 1, 2 or 3. But what does this mean?

What happens now?

The approval of our targets by the SBTi represents a milestone on our journey; another step towards being more transparent and more accountable.

Our priority is to deliver on the commitments that we have made.

At Airbus we are committed to leading the decarbonisation of the aerospace sector. The independent assessment and validation of SBTi demonstrates our willingness to define meaningful climate targets aligned with science. Together with our partners and customers, we are determined to achieve these targets and invest in the solutions that will help decarbonise our industry and ensure aviation can continue to play its precious role in society.

Airbus European Service Modules - Three in a row! - Airbus,"Thu, 09 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMy0wMi1haXJidXMtZXVyb3BlYW4tc2VydmljZS1tb2R1bGVzLXRocmVlLWluLWEtcm930gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Bremen, 9 February 2023 – Three European Service Modules (ESMs) are being integrated in parallel in Airbus’ Bremen cleanrooms. Integration of ESM-3 is almost complete and ESM-4 is well under way, and the newly arrived ESM-5 structure is now the focus of initial integration steps.

Each ESM requires the integration of more than 22,000 elements. This is the first time ever that NASA has entrusted a non-US prime, Airbus through ESA, to build a mission-critical element for an American human spaceflight mission.

“Together with the European Space Agency, Airbus is providing half the spacecraft that willreturn humans to the Moon - taking them further than ever before into space and of course returning them safely to Earth,” said Marc Steckling, Head of Space Exploration at Airbus. “We have already delivered the first two ESMs, with ESM-2 currently being integrated in Orion at Kennedy Space Center. With the arrival of the ESM-4 structure last summer and that of ESM-5 just before Christmas, we have now started the serial production phase. Our cleanroom facilities have been optimised to accommodate three ESMs at the same time, and we are on track to meet NASA’s requirement to deliver one ESM per year going forward.”

The ESM is a critical element of NASA's crewed Orion spaceship as it provides the spacecraft’s main propulsion system while also enabling orbital manoeuvring and positioning control. Electrical power generation and distribution are also provided by the ESM along with supplying the crew with the central elements of life support such as water and oxygen. The ESM also regulates thermal control while it is connected to the crew module. In addition, the unpressurised service module can be used to carry additional payloads. ESA has invested about €2 billion in the Orion programme and contracted Airbus to lead the European consortium and build six ESMs to date.

2022 saw the first Artemis mission with the first Orion spacecraft powered by the ESM-1. The spacecraft travelled more than 2 million kilometres, was exposed to a temperature range wider than 200°C and flew at a maximum speed of 40,000 km/h (or 11 km/s). All systems were tested and performed well and reliable, some even better than expected.

ESM-2 was delivered to Florida in October 2021. It is now being tested and integrated at the Kennedy Space Center. It will be part of the crewed Artemis II Mission, which will fly the first astronauts around the Moon and back to Earth since 1972. The Artemis II launch is currently planned for 2024.

ESM-3, undergoing final integration, will power the Artemis III Mission, set to see the first woman and first person of colour setting foot on the Moon. The delivery of ESM-3 is planned for the second half of 2023. This mission is envisaged for no earlier than 2025.

The ESM-4 structure arrived at Airbus’ Bremen cleanroom in June 2022 and is currently being integrated. The recently arrived ESM-5 structure is already being worked on.

ESMs 4, 5 and 6 will be used for the Artemis IV to VI missions, the first two of which are part of the European contribution to the international Gateway, a space station planned to be assembled in lunar orbit. ESA and NASA are aiming to establish a Moon ecosystem (Gateway, Argonaut) to better understand and explore all the Moon has to offer and in the longer-term to prepare for crewed missions to Mars.

Further ESMs 7, 8 and 9 were authorised at the ESA ministerial council in November 2022, and Airbus is currently finalising its offer to provide them.

The Orion ESM is cylindrical in shape and approximately four metres in diameter and height. At launch, it weighs just over 13 tonnes, making up roughly 60% of the Orion spacecraft’s total mass. Its 8.6 tonnes of fuel power the main engine, eight auxiliary thrusters and 24 smaller thrusters used for attitude control. The European Service Module is installed underneath the crew module at Kennedy Space Center in the USA. Together, they form the Orion spacecraft.

Airbus engineers produce the ESMs together with ESA and industry partners, including suppliers from 10 countries. ESM manufacturing builds on Airbus’ experience gained on the Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV), which flew five times to the ISS between 2008 and 2015.

Artemis I complete success

Artemis I was the first in a series of increasingly complex missions to provide a foundation for human exploration in deep space and a major step toward returning astronauts to the Moon with Europe as a leading player in humankind’s greatest space adventure to date.

This first flight was a huge source of information and all mission objectives linked to the ESM were fully achieved. Initial evaluation of the test data has confirmed that the Orion spacecraft consumed much less propellant and electrical power, while producing much more power than calculated. The propulsion subsystem performed as expected delivering the thrust for precise orbital manoeuvres and vehicle attitude control. The good performance of the propulsion system allowed the execution of additional flight test objectives to better characterise the vehicle. The ESM main engine was fired multiple times with an accumulated total burn duration of 10 minutes, as planned. NASA has confirmed that the overall mission performance achieved was above expectations with almost 2 tonnes of propellant remaining at the end of mission. This will allow future missions of longer duration or higher mass (e.g. Gateway modules being transported by ESM). Most impressively, the solar arrays generated 15% more electrical power than specified. At the same time, the spacecraft consumed less electricity due to smaller fluctuations in temperature than expected.

Airbus joins forces with New Zealand's hydrogen ecosystem partners - Airbus,"Fri, 10 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIzLTAyLWFpcmJ1cy1qb2lucy1mb3JjZXMtd2l0aC1uZXctemVhbGFuZHMtaHlkcm9nZW4tZWNvc3lzdGVtLXBhcnRuZXJz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus and Air New Zealand’s partnership on hydrogen-fuelled aviation is entering a new phase by welcoming the country’s key “hydrogen ecosystem” players. The resulting consortium will pave the way to further act upon New Zealand’s – and also the wider aviation industry’s – collective ambition towards decarbonisation.

Ultimately, the partners will evaluate the means of deploying hydrogen hubs at airports, starting with the case study at Christchurch. If successful, commercial hydrogen-powered aviation could be extended to cover the entirety of New Zealand’s domestic network. The additional participants to the consortium include Christchurch International Airport, Fortescue Future Industries (FFI), Hiringa, and Fabrum.

New Zealand, with its large share of renewable energy sources in its energy mix, is a model for a proactive, forward-looking ecosystem with a huge potential for low-carbon hydrogen production. To complement this, the consortium partners have a shared vision to support New Zealand to pioneer the commercial deployment of hydrogen-powered aircraft.



Collaboration aims and partner contributions

Overall, the collaboration will widen and affirm the consortium’s understanding of hydrogen-powered aircraft concepts and operations, hydrogen supply, hydrogen infrastructure and fuelling requirements at airports, in order to support the development of this hydrogen aviation ecosystem in New Zealand. The work will also identify the pathways to viable and sustainable commercialisation of hydrogen powered aircraft technologies in New Zealand as well as the accompanying regulatory framework.

As well as their shared vision, the partners in the consortium contribute their own extensive know-how, thanks to the independent strides they have each made towards the prospect of a decarbonised, hydrogen-based aviation industry:

Air New Zealand is actively investigating the role of low-emission aircraft technologies to support the decarbonisation of its network;

Christchurch International Airport (CIAL) has reduced airport emissions by 90% since 2016 and is mentoring airports globally on how to decarbonise their operations;

Hiringa Energy (Hiringa) is focussing on the commercial development and operation of hydrogen production, storage, distribution, and supply infrastructure;

FFI (Fortescue Future Industries) is promoting the use of hydrogen and ammonia produced from 100% renewable energy sources;

Fabrum, a global leader in the design and manufacture of full ground infrastructure for hydrogen production, liquefaction, storage, fuel transfer, on-board flight fuel systems and architecture, motors, and certification support;

Karine Guenan, Vice President ZEROe Ecosystem at Airbus says: “New Zealand is a perfect aviation network, in terms of traffic, flight distances and airport network, for the deployment of regional to medium-haul hydrogen aircraft, to be developed within Airbus’ ZEROe project. This is fully in line with the ZEROe strategy to first study and deploy Hydrogen aviation ecosystems in the most suitable parts of the world. New Zealand has a great potential for hydrogen production from renewable electricity sources.”

Karine adds: “The consortium is built with a great synergy in the respective partners’ expertise combining: airline, airport, hydrogen technology providers, hydrogen facilities developers, and hydrogen aircraft and airframe developer. This unique combination of skills in the end-to-end hydrogen value chain promises very high learnings and a successful study and roadmap for aviation and non-aviation hydrogen usage at airports.”

Airbus’ role

On the technical side, Airbus will contribute the learnings from its “ZEROe” hydrogen aircraft features and concept of operations, for in-flight as well as on-ground operations. It will also make available its own researched assumptions into liquid-hydrogen needs in the future hydrogen aircraft deployments. Moreover, benefitting from its global role as an aircraft manufacturer and integrator, Airbus will bring on board its experience and learnings on the development and its study of “Hydrogen Hubs at Airports”, from similar case studies on-going in other parts of the world.

Indeed, Airbus has been an early leading advocate for hydrogen, identifying it as the most promising option for decarbonisation of commercial aviation and to meet the environmental challenge. Low-carbon hydrogen can be used directly on-board aircraft for propulsion through combustion in a turbine and for on-board power generation through fuel cells, or indirectly as a feedstock for synthetic aviation fuel (Power-to-Liquid, or PtL). It is therefore Airbus’ ambition to develop and put in service a new generation of commercial passenger transport aircraft using low-carbon hydrogen by 2035.



New Zealand – a unique opportunity for decarbonised aviation

New Zealand presents a unique opportunity for new energy sources for several reasons: It has a high proportion of renewable energy, with over 80% of New Zealand’s electricity supplied from renewable energy sources, including hydropower, wind, and solar. The New Zealand economy is also highly reliant on short-haul domestic flights, with over 60% of flights connecting regional centres under 350 km in length. Both of these factors make New Zealand an ideal test environment as we explore the potential for new energy sources for our industry, including hydrogen.

Moreover, Airbus and Air New Zealand share a common goal to lead the way in achieving decarbonised aviation. Under our existing agreement, we have already determined that New Zealand offers a suitable demonstration environment to develop the ecosystems necessary to support hydrogen-powered aircraft operations. In the next phase of this joint undertaking, we will delve into much greater detail on potential aircraft design and performance that could meet Air New Zealand’s requirements, building upon the long-standing relationships.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9798214435577393}",neutral,0.9798214435577393,0
You are now free to roam about the cabin - Cisco Newsroom,"Mon, 20 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3c3Jvb20uY2lzY28uY29tL2Mvci9uZXdzcm9vbS9lbi91cy9hL3kyMDIzL20wMi95b3UtYXJlLW5vdy1mcmVlLXRvLXJvYW0tYWJvdXQtdGhlLWNhYmluLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This is a post by Christine Johansen

On your last ﬂight, did you pass the time surﬁng or streaming? Time on a plane tends to mean time on our devices. Great inﬂight Wi-Fi is as important as delicious food and a friendly crew, and Martin Schirrmacher plays a key role in making sure you have it. As a cabin wireless systems hardware architect for Airbus, he helps keep your devices connected at 30,000 feet.

KID-Systeme, Airbus and Cisco have been working together for nearly two decades, outﬁtting hundreds of planes with Wi-Fi in that time.

The Cisco Newsroom recently spoke with Martin about the unique challenges he faces in his role and how Cisco technology helps him keep us all securely connected when we ﬂy.

Tell us about the collaboration between Airbus, KID-Systeme and Cisco.

KID-Systeme (KID) is a 100% subsidiary of Airbus. It provides a wide range of smart digital solutions for the modern digital aircraft cabin, such as in-seat power, USB power, Wi-Fi, and video surveillance.

As part of KID’s strategy, Cisco's Wi-Fi access points (e.g. C9120ax, CW9166i) are used to secure on-board connectivity and successfully sell the connected cabin experience to aircraft customers. In other words, these products are provided to various airlines around the world to deliver high performance in-ﬂight connectivity.

To meet speciﬁc aircraft requirements, the access points are optimally adapted and tested in KID’s production facilities and aircraft environments to become a certiﬁed product for installation in the aircraft cabin. Airbus is supporting KID by conducting the Wi-Fi performance testing in the cabin environment.

We all know how important good inﬂight Wi-Fi is. Is it hard to achieve and if so, why?

Yes! There are many challenges.

Density is a big one. Every square meter of the aircraft cabin holds 1.5 passengers and three connected devices. This is the highest density you’ll likely ever encounter—not even Cisco Live has that type of density! This requires quite a lot of throughput, and with three or four access points very close together in the airplane it creates unique management challenges involving radio resources, intrusion, protection, security, domain segmentation, and user group diﬀerentiation.

The access point must be quite small. It has to operate within the cabin temperature and vibration range, which is a lot larger than the range in a home or even in an industrial setting. Plus, it has to live with a limited power dissipation budget—we can't blow out the heat because it is installed behind the cabin ceiling where there's no air circulation. It also must be very easy to use because the cabin crew are not Wi-Fi or IT experts.

The wireless access point must have innovative technology, since passengers bring onboard the latest devices—they are typically no older than three years. Legacy equipment can't handle these new devices, and yet airplanes are long-lasting and there are long lead times; buy an aircraft today and it will be delivered in ﬁve or six years.

Another big challenge is that the airlines are very price sensitive, so we need to ﬁnd a good compromise between functionality and cost.

Last but not least this radio device must be globally certiﬁed. This is extremely complex. Airplanes cross lots of borders, and every nation and local telecom authority requires that their rules be followed when that aircraft lands and opens its doors. Some countries accept FCC or EU test results, but others request local retesting. Getting certiﬁcations from all those entities requires a lot of eﬀort.

What does Airbus/KID consider when selecting a Wi-Fi solution provider?

We are looking for a supplier that delivers all the features and functionality we need but is also mature, robust, and ﬁeld proven.

But it's not only the hardware that we consider; the other side of the medal is the management solution. We need a powerful and ﬂexible Wi-Fi controller solution that gives us many parameters to optimize the uniquely dense cabin environment. Very few suppliers of equipment oﬀer as large an amount of functionality.

How do you test performance before the Wi-Fi gear gets into a plane?

We have two plane mock-ups where we conduct Wi-Fi performance testing. One is an A321 and the other is an A380 – basically half of the plane with the lining and the seating and a bit of the metal “skin”.

We test diﬀerent scenarios. What happens when passengers board? Do all of their devices lock onto the ﬁrst access point they “see”? Or does the controller push clients to the best possible access point? What happens when someone moves about the cabin? We share the results with Cisco and discuss how the wireless manager could be optimized for user group segmentation, audio/video throughput and quality of service.

What types of issues do you identify and work together with Cisco to ﬁx after these tests?

In the last test campaign, we focused a lot on load balancing. We worked on how to distribute 180 devices to the access points evenly and allow for some movement throughout the cabin without degrading performance. Based on this Cisco honed the traﬃc load controller.

Why is a close relationship with Cisco so important?

A close partnership between Cisco, KID and Airbus is the basis for our success in delivering high performance Wi-Fi access points to the market. Trust, regular communication, and excellent support are key components in a good relationship.

How will the new Cisco access point help you better serve customers, and when will it be in planes?

The new access point can serve about 100 streaming clients while the last generation served 60 - that’s a big step ahead. At the same time, the throughput has more than doubled, which is important since we expect within three years up to 90 percent of passenger devices will be Wi-Fi 6 or 6E, which require higher throughput.

The airlines want a solution to stream HD content to 200 passengers. To meet those demands, we need the latest technologies—like multi-user MIMO and OFDMA—that are behind the Cisco product.

We will ramp up the production of the third-generation access point in Q2 of this year and the ﬁrst aircraft with it will ship in Q3 or Q4 2023.

Troubleshooting at 30,000 feet is a challenge. Do you have any thoughts on how that might be handled in the future?

Today, when there is a problem a crew member reboots the device. If that doesn’t solve the issue, we need to send an expert on the next ﬂight to troubleshoot. That costs a lot of money and time. In the future, remote monitoring and control from an IT expert on the ground will solve many problems. Plus, the airline will get valuable data in real time: what movies are people watching? What food do they enjoy? What duty free items are selling fastest? You could even provide the duty-free item at the gate upon arrival, instead of shipping it.

An optimized cabin Wi-Fi system leads to a better user experience, lower operating costs (lower number of WAPs per aircraft) and thus brings higher customer satisfaction. This goal can only be achieved on the basis of a reliable partnership.

Its pan-European Airbus adventure is over

Toulouse, 09 February 2023 - Today the Airbus-built JUICE (JUpiter ICy moons Explorer mission) spacecraft took off from Toulouse, France, for the European spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana, on board of an Antonov aircraft ahead of its launch on an Ariane 5 in April 2023.

The start of the launch campaign brings to a close a nearly decade-long technological and industrial adventure for Airbus, which began even before being selected as prime contractor by ESA in 2015, and has involved more than 80 companies and research centres across Europe. The unprecedented JUICE mission will last for more than a decade, managed by ESA, and will study Jupiter’s magnetic fields as well as looking for life-bearing conditions through the ice on the main Jovian moons.

Pacific region to require 920 new aircraft over next 20 years - Airbus,"Mon, 27 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMy0wMi1wYWNpZmljLXJlZ2lvbi10by1yZXF1aXJlLTkyMC1uZXctYWlyY3JhZnQtb3Zlci1uZXh0LTIwLXllYXJz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Avalon, 27 February 2023 – Airlines based in the Pacific region will take delivery of 920 new aircraft over the next 20 years, generated by an average growth in passenger traffic in the region of 3.2% per annum, according to the latest Airbus Global Market Forecast.

The forecast for new aircraft includes around 750 single aisle aircraft like the A220 and A320 Families and around 170 widebodies like the A330neo and A350. Around 55% of this demand will be for growth and 45% will be to replace aircraft currently in service.

The forecast was presented by Stephen Forshaw, Airbus Chief Representative for Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific, on the eve of the Avalon Airshow taking place between 28 February and 5 March 2023, in Melbourne.

“We are already seeing steady recovery in global air traffic and a renewed confidence in the growth of the industry. This is particularly evident in the Pacific region, where we are seeing a surge in travel demand and an increase in flights to and from key destinations,” he said.

“A priority for airlines in this region is ensuring that the air transport sector can grow in a sustainable way. This has become an increasingly important factor when airlines make fleet decisions and Airbus is well-placed with the modern and comprehensive product line available today, offering a reduction in fuel consumption and emissions of up to 25%.”

He added that the replacement of older generation aircraft was just a first step on the journey to decarbonise the aviation sector.

“Looking to the future, we need to increase the production and availability of sustainable aviation fuels in this region and explore new sources of energy, including hydrogen and synthetic fuels. This requires a new level of collaboration between all the stakeholders involved.”

In the Pacific region Airbus has entered into significant partnerships over the past year to advance its ambitions. These include a joint fund with Qantas to encourage industry to develop the necessary ecosystem in Australia and a project with Air New Zealand to study applications for hydrogen powered aircraft on its domestic network.

Airbus is also involved in studies with Australia’s Fortescue Future Industries (FFI) and most recently announced its participation in a new hydrogen consortium in New Zealand alongside Christchurch Airport, Air New Zealand, FFI and several start-ups.



Stephen Forshaw added: “All our focus today ultimately converges on one objective and that is the decarbonisation of our industry. We have a duty to ensure that generations to come will be able to experience the joy of travel in the way we have done, to discover the world, to connect with others and experience new cultures. All this while protecting our environment.”

The Pacific region is a key market, with 170 Airbus aircraft currently in service with airlines in Australia, Fiji, New Caledonia, New Zealand, and the Solomon Islands. Another 166 aircraft are currently on order for future delivery to Pacific carriers. This represents 75% of the total backlog of orders from airlines in the region for all manufacturers.

Globally Airbus forecasts demand for 39,490 new aircraft over the next 20 years, including 17,620 in the wider Asia-Pacific region.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.6873345971107483}",neutral,0.6873345971107483,0
Airbus prepares to begin assembly of CityAirbus NextGen demonstrator - Vertical Magazine,"Thu, 23 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLXByZXBhcmVzLXRvLWJlZ2luLWFzc2VtYmx5LW9mLWNpdHlhaXJidXMtbmV4dGdlbi1kZW1vbnN0cmF0b3Iv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Urban Air Mobility is planning a year of “build, build, build” as it prepares its CityAirbus NextGen demonstrator for a first flight in 2024, while creating an ecosystem testbed for the aircraft in Germany.

CityAirbus NextGen will be capable of carrying one pilot and three passengers. Airbus UAM Image

“This year is all about assembly,” Balkiz Sarihan, head of urban air mobility (UAM) at Airbus, told reporters during recent briefing at Airbus Helicopters in Marignane, France. “The pieces [for CityAirbus NextGen] are coming in. This year our mantra is build, build, build.”

CityAirbus NextGen was launched in 2021, and is the third eVTOL vehicle developed by the manufacturer, following its CityAirbus and Vahana demonstrators. It incorporates lessons learned from each of its predecessor’s designs.

The aircraft is powered by eight propellers and 16 electrical power units, with dual systems for redundancy, and will carry one pilot with three passengers in a banked seat at the rear of the cabin.

Airbus UAM announced the last of its suppliers for the demonstrator at the end of January: Eaton and Crouzet will supply the aircraft’s electrical power distribution system (EPDS) and the human-machine interface, respectively. Other suppliers include Magicall (electrical power units), KLK (the aircraft’s tail), Spirit Aerosystems (wings), and Thales (primary computing system).

Airbus UAM broke ground on a dedicated test center for the aircraft in Donauworth, Germany, last year, with the demonstrator due to begin test flights in 2024. The first flights will have a pilot on board, Sarihan confirmed.

While Airbus has not disclosed how the pilot will control the aircraft, a press release announcing the selection of Crouzet as a supplier noted “the pilot will manage the trajectory of the vehicle rather than the attitude of the aircraft.”

Sarihan confirmed the design of the controls included “a stick” (rather than two).

“The operation should be simpler, the interface should be simpler,” she said. “Therefore, when we’re imagining and designing what the cockpit will look like, all of this will be simpler as well.”

The company will also bring the aircraft to market as a piloted machine, with potential autonomous operation further down the road.

“We really believe that the entry point is with a pilot first,” said Sarihan. “There is a lot of automation from a technology perspective that has already been built into the aircraft systems, but [it’s] pilot first, for us.”

The aircraft will likely evolve as the technology in it evolves, she added, noting that it is scalable.

“We are now having a product vision based on what we project to be the evolution of technology,” she said. “We’re not designing for huge leaps and bounds in battery technology [for example]. But it will come — which will also mean a lot more flexibility.”

This could mean a larger cabin or different configuration.

Hydrogen fuel cells could also be intergrated into future generations of eVTOLs, said Sarihan.

Building an ecosystem

At the same time as building the demonstrator, Airbus UAM is working on the ecosystem in which the aircraft will operate.

“It’s not enough just to build the vehicle,” said Sarihan. “We have to think about the regulations, we have to think about how these vehicles and this technology will be incorporated into our cities and our communities.”

This includes topics ranging from public acceptance to community engagement and first-use cases, she said.

The UAM industry will develop at a different pace and in a different way in different places, she added. With this in mind, the manufacturer has agreed a range of partnerships with operators in various locations, including ITA Airways in Italy, Ecocopter in Chile, The Helicopter and Jet Company in Saudi Arabia, and Hiratagakuen in Japan.

The partnership with Hiratagakuen is already involving flights with helicopters to test the airspace.

“We really want to plant the seeds beyond [Airbus’s] home countries [France, Germany and Spain],” said Sarihan. These operator partners are also adding their input on their requirements for UAM technology, how it could be incorporated into their operations, and maintenance considerations.

In terms of the latter, she said the maintenance burden should be lower than with helicopters due to NextGen’s simplified design, with distributed electric propulsion.

“Also, we’re thinking about the uptime and operability of this aircraft,” she said. “What then becomes a line maintenance activity, versus what becomes a service center activity, versus what needs to be repaired? What can we repair? What are we replacing? All of this goes into the thinking as well.”

The company’s Air Mobility Initiative is perhaps the most dramatic example of its desire to test the UAM ecosystem. Along with 28 partners — including the local government, infrastructure companies, use space designers and transport companies — it plans to build fully functioning vertiports to fly the first UAM missions in Bavaria, Germany.

“Let’s see how [a UAM aircraft] actually interacts when we’re dealing with the public,” said Sarihan. “What’s going to be their first reaction? What’s going to be their expectation? How are we managing the passenger and user experience?”

Together with its partners, Airbus is in the process of selecting the sites for the vertiports. It will begin with two sites, with further expansion possible after operations begin.

Considerations include the possible routes and distances between the sites, the missions the aircraft will fly, the overall system design — and the public consultation process.

“[We want] to make sure that we are choosing locations that are meaningful and representative, but also something that will be acceptable,” said Sarihan. This consideration of public acceptability will also be applied to the routes chosen — they will be predefined, over water, railways, or on the periphery of a city.

The hope is that lessons learned from the ecosystem will provide a blueprint that can be replicated elsewhere.

A ‘step-by-step’ approach

Sarihan said the urban air mobility (UAM) industry is now entering a stage of “execution,” with much of the exploratory work completed and concepts matured. “Now we’re seeing a level of maturation, and this is when it starts to get quite serious as well.”

Airbus UAM’s development pace is behind that of some of its competitors in the eVTOL field — such as Joby Aviation and Beta Technologies (with both performing flight tests last year) — but Sarihan said the company wouldn’t be rushed.

“We are not the first, we are not the fastest — nor do we try to be,” she said. The company’s very deliberate “step by step” approach is reflective of its belief that the UAM industry will develop slowly — at least to begin with.

“We’re not going to go from zero to tens of thousands of vehicles flying in the skies in our communities,” said Sarihan. She said such scale of growth “is just not feasible” from airspace management, infrastructure, and public acceptance perspectives. “We need to have [the public] with us to excite them, to entice them — but also to have them have access to a service that is 100 percent trustable.”

Airbus believes the first feeder cases for CityAirbus NextGen will be in medical applications, connecting remote communities, and eco-tourism.

As the industry develops, Sarihan believes we’ll see greater cooperation. Currently, regulation and charging infrastructure are the two main areas where the sector has worked closely together. Looking ahead, she said batteries could be another area where there is cooperation.

Sarihan said she doesn’t see the UAM industry competing directly with the helicopter industry, with the latter’s performance capabilities starkly different to those of eVTOLs.

This move is in response to new flight training requirements by the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC).

“Expanding its flight training footprint in China not only reflects Airbus’ commitment to supporting the efficient and safe operation of all its aircraft, but also enables Airbus to accompany its airline customers, in both anticipating and preparing the future,” said George Xu, EVP of Airbus and CEO of Airbus China. “Airbus is pleased to be partnering with the Civil Aviation Flight University of China and to be further strengthening the working relationship it has with the many Chinese stakeholders within the civil aviation industry in China.”

Ab-initio flight training is the crucial first step towards becoming an operationally ready professional pilot, involving the study of basic flight theory and techniques. The Civil Aviation Flight University of China (CAFUC) is the largest ab-initio flight training institution globally and a key training ground for Chinese pilots. CAFUC’s comprehensive ab-initio flight training techniques and management represent the highest standards of flight training in China.

In 2020, the CAAC launched a 10 year flight training reform called the Pilot Professionalism Lifecycle Management System (PLM) based on the new training concept of Competency Based Training and Assessment (CBTA).This innovative training approach places a greater emphasis on the pilots’ ability to handle unexpected events and integrates a deeper focus on the non-technical skills, compared to traditional flight training methods.

Airbus will integrate its advanced training concept and CBTA training techniques, while CAFUC will bring its training experience and knowledge of China’s civil aviation operating conditions.

In 2022, Airbus successfully collaborated with Chinese airlines on an Evidence Based Training (EBT) programme, based on the CBTA concept, which has already received positive feedback.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9978164434432983}",positive,0.9978164434432983,1
Airbus DisruptiveLab demonstrator progressing through flight test campaign - Vertical Magazine,"Wed, 15 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLWRpc3J1cHRpdmVsYWItZGVtb25zdHJhdG9yLXByb2dyZXNzaW5nLXRocm91Z2gtZmxpZ2h0LXRlc3QtY2FtcGFpZ24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters is now performing weekly flight tests of its DisruptiveLab demonstrator, as it works to confirm the improved performance and reduction in emissions the aircraft has been designed to achieve.

Unveiled in November 2022 during its parent company’s annual summit in Toulouse, France, the aircraft targets a 50 percent reduction in fuel consumption through a new aerodynamic architecture, a modified thermal engine, and use of a 250 kW electric motor for a hybrid propulsion system.

The aircraft first flew in January 2022, and has since completed five flights. The most recent, flown on Feb. 14, lasted just over an hour.

“The target is not to fly too often, but to fly in the clever way to draw the [right] conclusions,” Tomasz Krysinski, the company’s head of research and technology, told reporters during a briefing at Airbus Helicopters’ headquarters in Marignane, France. “We fly it every week, we then process the data, we have always the meeting with the crew after the flight, [and] after processing the data, we fix what we do for the next flight.”

Krysinski said the company believed the demonstrator’s aerodynamic design could mean the aircraft requires up to 15 percent less power in forward flight. That design was arrived at after Airbus completed 40 wind tunnel campaigns, and Krysinski said the integration of the main rotor is key.

This is achieved with a specific inter-blade damper concept that allows the hub to be very compact and close to the aircraft’s body. The result is 40 percent less drag than previous generations of helicopters, said Krysinski.

“Really the integration of the hub with this integrated concept is key to help the low-drag design, and here is the most, I would say, clever way to reduce the CO2 emissions,” he said. ”We don’t need any specific other devices — it’s just done by the design.”

In addition to being a more efficient aircraft, Krysinski said DisruptiveLab is much quieter. One of the reasons for this is the design of its three main rotor blades. They have a thin profile on the tip, and a lower rotation tip speed.

They also have a bigger chord and are longer in relation to the size of the demonstrator than a typical aircraft in Airbus’s fleet. DisruptiveLab’s rotor disc has a diameter of 38 feet (11.6 meters), which represents a 7 to 8 percent increase in size over previous generation aircraft. “More radius means less power required,” explained Krysinski.

The blades also provide a reduction in vibrations, he added. ”Already our crew notices it — it is a very smooth flight. [DisruptiveLab] will make the breakthrough . . . in terms of vibrations.”

Behind the main cabin, a “simplified” tail cone leads to a heavily modified Fenestron tail rotor. The number of pieces in the Fenestron was halved, with the integration of parts allowing for a smaller hub and reduction in the system’s overall diameter.

Finally, the landing gear has been integrated into the aircraft’s body through just three points — two either side at the front, and one in the rear in the middle.

The fuselage is made from aluminum and composite materials (from Airbus Atlantic and Rexiaa, respectively), and everything on the aircraft is scalable, said Krysinski.

A modified powertrain

The second element in the system’s drive to efficiency is its thermal engine, which has been provided by Safran Helicopter Engines, with a target of a 25 percent reduction in fuel burn.

“It’s a bit of a revolution,” said Krysinski, without providing further details. “It’s a completely new design, and we really want to make a disruption.”

Finally, the aircraft has been built for hybridization — which has the potential to provide a reduction of 10 percent in fuel burn.

The motor will allow “reversable hybridization” said Krysinski. Much like the electric motor in a hybrid car, it will be capable of being charged through a plug-in port or by the turbine engine during some flight conditions. In other flight conditions, energy can be taken from the electric motor and put into the powertrain.

The 250 kW motor will be capable of powering the rotors for three minutes in horizontal flight, said Krysinski. But while safety is clearly one benefit in case of engine loss, he said there the use of the electric motor “opens the doors to many subjects” — such as perhaps the potential to enter urban areas with a single-engine aircraft.

He also highlighted the potential for the motor to provide a performance boost for high altitude operations.

While the electric motor has not been installed yet (and a manufacturer has not been chosen), the aircraft is ready to receive it — no further customization is required. The company expects to test the hybridization aspects in 2024.

“[Because] everything is really integrated, you can reduce [the] number of interfaces and you can reduce the weight of the system,” said Krysinski.

The global 50 percent reduction in fuel burn “opens the doors” to wide use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), he added, as it offsets the fuel’s increased expense.

It also serves as a further step towards making the use of hydrogen fuel cells a possibility.

“Everything we are doing is really to prepare sustainable aviation fuels and prepare also the new world of [the] ‘hydrogen revolution,’ ” he said.

The speed of the DisruptiveLab’s development has been impressive, and Krysinski paid tribute to the funding the company has received from the French civil aviation authority as part of the French stimulus plan.

“There was a strong acceleration from 2020 with this stimulus plan,” he said.

The aircraft is one of two technology demonstrators at Airbus Helicopters. Its FlightLab demonstrator, launched in 2020, is researching “technobricks” related to enhanced autonomy and safety using an H130 as the base platform.

“On FlightLab, we tested a lot of things that . . . we can retrofit on the current fleet,” said Krysinski. “DisruptiveLab was designed to test new architectures as a demonstrator and concept helicopter.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9986900687217712}",neutral,0.9986900687217712,0
Airbus to continue fello'fly flight tests via SESAR-backed Geese project - Flightglobal,"Thu, 16 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mbGlnaHRnbG9iYWwuY29tL2Fpci10cmFuc3BvcnQvYWlyYnVzLXRvLWNvbnRpbnVlLWZlbGxvZmx5LWZsaWdodC10ZXN0cy12aWEtc2VzYXItYmFja2VkLWdlZXNlLXByb2plY3QvMTUyMDQ5LmFydGljbGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus is pressing ahead with plans to bring its fello’fly vortex recovery system (VRS) into commercial service later this decade and will further refine the concept – and its integration into airline operations – with another round of flight tests conducted through a European research project.

Carriers Air France and French Bee will supply A350 widebodies for the effort – known as Geese – which is being part funded by the EU’s SESAR air traffic management research body.

In addition to the test flights, the carriers will also analyse the integration of the aircraft pairing process in their operations centres.

Geese also involves Eurocontrol and air navigation service providers from Bulgaria (BULATSA), France (DNSA), Ireland (IAA), Lithuania (ON) and the UK (NATS), alongside ATM technology providers Indra and Frequentis.

Fello’fly sees a pair of aircraft flying in formation, one around 1.56nm (3km) behind the other, allowing the trailing jet to benefit from the lift generated by the preceding aircraft’s vortices, reducing the thrust required from its engines.

A flight trial carried out in November 2021 using a pair of Airbus-owned A350s on a route between Toulouse and Montreal in Canada validated the concept, which the airframer says could generate fuel savings of around 5%.

But in order to achieve an end-decade service-entry goal, the airframer must thoroughly validate the concept of operations for fello’fly, detailing how aircraft will be paired, their optimum rendezvous point, their routing and other considerations, says project leader Jonathan Beck.

“We have to progress on the operation and seek alignment of the industry as a whole,” he says.

Under the three-year Geese initiative – its name is a nod to the wildfowl formations that inspired fello’fly – Airbus and its partners will initially build what Beck calls a “common simulation platform” allowing early testing of operational concepts.

“By plugging into that simulator more and more data – and more and more live data – at some point we will be able to mimic the operation until we are confident enough that we can do some dry runs,” he says.

This will see Air France’s control centre supplied with updated flight plans for a rendezvous as though one of its jets had been paired with a suitable partner.

“It will be a very step-by-step approach, gaining confidence at each step,” says Beck.

He hopes that flight trials will be able to begin within two to three years of the project’s official mid-2023 start date. Although Air France and French Bee are the only disclosed airline participants so far, Beck is hopeful that others will sign up before the start of flights to ensure a wider geographic spread.

However, there are plenty of practical considerations to be hammered out before Geese reaches that point.

For example, where is the ideal point during the cruise phase for the two aircraft to join? “We want it to be as soon as possible to save as much energy as possible, but we have to account for the delays that will happen for operational reasons,” he says. In other words, there will be a natural lag caused by all the steps – the pairing, transmission of the changed flight-plan to crews, its validation by ATC – required before the jets link up.

“When we did the transatlantic flight [in November 2021] both aircraft departed from Toulouse with little separation between them so achieving the rendezvous was relatively easy; now we want to see how fello’fly is deployable at a large scale,” adds Beck.

There is also the thorny question of how to decide which aircraft is the leader and which is the follower. While a heavier aircraft would arguably benefit the most from being in the trail, it also generates bigger vortices, creating more lift for its partner, and so would be better positioned in front.

While the decision in some cases may come down to a commercial agreement between carriers, Beck says other factors may also come into play, such as whether both crews are trained to fly in either position.

Crucially, Boeing has been recruited to the project to ensure “we align the concept of operations across OEMs,” says Beck.

“Part of the discussion we want to have is around the interoperability of different aircraft types for formation flying.”

A suitable fello’fly partner should have a similar cruising speed and altitude, says Beck, with the basic rule that one aircraft works well with another of the same type. But some “cross-combinations” also work, he says, such as the A350 and A380, and sees “some potential” for co-ordination between the former and the Boeing 787.

Launch of the system will be with the A350, because “it’s our most recent aircraft with the best connectivity and best avionics system architecture,” but in the longer term there is “no reason” it could not be extended to the A330neo or even A321XLR.

Theoretically, the benefits of fello’fly could extend to any number of aircraft in a suitable formation but in practice this will be confined initially to just a pair “because operationally it is already very complex,” says Beck.

In addition to the fuel-saving – and therefore carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions reduction – benefits of the VRS, it could also have a positive impact on contrail formation, says Beck, which will be assessed by Germany’s DLR aerospace research institute.

Outside of the Geese project, Airbus is evaluating what changes, if any, will be required to the aircraft themselves, along with certification assessment, to enable a commercial roll-out of fello’fly.

“It will take a few more years to assess whether it fits with the A350 system with as little modification as possible,” he says. Airbus will also work with European, and later US, regulators on the certification aspects of the project.

Beck is hopeful that changes can be confined to a software update rather than any retrofit programme.

As tested, the flight-control and auto-thrust systems on the trailing aircraft maintain its position laterally and vertically relative to the vortex and between the jet in front. “We are able to maintain a globally constant separation between the two aircraft,” he says.

Initially developed by the airframer’s UpNext innovation arm, responsibility for fello’fly has since transferred to Airbus’s commercial aircraft unit.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9990492463111877}",neutral,0.9990492463111877,0

Airbus 'nearing end of the process' for FAA H160 approval - Vertical Magazine,"Wed, 15 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLW5lYXJpbmctZW5kLW9mLXRoZS1wcm9jZXNzLWZvci1mYWEtaDE2MC1hcHByb3ZhbCVFRiVCRiVCQy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus believes it is “nearing the end of the process” to gain Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) approval of its new medium H160, aiming to finally gain certification of the type from the regulator this year.

PHI will become the first operator to fly the H160 in North America — once FAA approval is secured. Airbus Helicopters Photo

The H160 was certified by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) on July 1, 2020, and Airbus had originally hoped FAA approval would follow soon afterwards. While the timeline for the certification — and entry into service in the U.S. — has continued to be pushed to the right, Airbus is confident it will be secured this year.

“We managed to have our first face-to-face meeting [with the FAA in 2022], which was very important,” Gilles Armstrong, head of the H160 program, told reporters during a media event at the manufacturer’s headquarters in Marignane, France. “We wanted that and the FAA has been very helpful in being available for that. . . . We have to springboard on from that to make sure we complete the process.”

He said an issue affecting the screens of the type’s Helionix avionics system — the subject of a European Union Aviation Safety Agency airworthiness directive (AD) — was one of the topics the company still has to resolve with the FAA.

“If you’ve seen the AD, it’s a very simple task to do in continued airworthiness,” said Armstrong. “In initial certification, it’s something where we need to keep working on the path to certification with the FAA, and that means effectively managing the corrective solution to that in the short term. So that’s what we’re working on with them at the moment.”

An H160 in PHI livery has been at the manufacturer’s facility in Dallas, Texas, for much of the last year, after first arrived there following HAI Heli-Expo 2022.

Armstrong said it had been “very useful” to have an aircraft physically based in the U.S. for Airbus’s discussions with the FAA.

“We’ve done the aircraft maintenance evaluation with the FAA, for example,” he said. “[It’s] been very beneficial to the aircraft there, to try out the tech data, to try out the maintenance tasks, to use the tools — all of those aspects which I think demystify it a bit.”

FAA certification will allow the type to begin service in a new sector — oil-and-gas — as part of a route-proving program in partnership with Shell and PHI. Armstrong said the two companies had been “incredibly understanding” about the ongoing certification process.

“I think we’re very fortunate with our first [U.S.] customers that they understand the process,” he said. “We were very, very transparent with them about what’s going on . . . and they’ve been very understanding with us and we’re very appreciative.”

1,000 hours in its first year

The new medium-lift aircraft has now recorded over 1,000 flight hours since its entry into service with All Nippon Helicopter in December 2021.

The type is now operating in three different continents: in South America (with a private customer in Brazil), Asia (All Nippon in Japan), and Europe (French navy). Other aircraft have been delivered to undisclosed private customers, for a total of “five/six” different customers with “just short of 10” aircraft now in service, Armstrong said.

“Now we’re following this initial phase where we get to see the maturity of the product and how it’s handling and how the customers are living with it,” said Armstrong. “The initial feedback is very positive.”

The first year in operation has also seen it enter a variety of operating segments — newsgathering with All Nippon, VIP operations, and search-and-rescue (SAR) with the French navy.

“They’re having good availability, they’re having good maintenance, as expected,” said Armstrong. “All the parameters are as expected or better. So, at the moment, it’s a particularly good entry into service.”

Airbus took 12 orders for the H160 in 2022, bringing the order book to over 100 aircraft, which includes all mission segments targeted for the type.

The French navy took delivery of the first of an order of six H160s in September. The service is operating them for land-based SAR missions as a stop-gap solution until the H160M Guepard is fielded. The current aircraft are provided through a partnership with Babcock, which sees the company complete the H160s into a SAR configuration, and provide the maintenance for the aircraft once they’re in operation. They are flown by navy pilots.

The first navy aircraft is currently completing operational trials to allow them to enter service “before the summer.”

Next up in terms of configurations is the public services variant, which is being first completed to meet a French Gendarmerie order for 10 H160s.

“It’s a very complete public service configuration with a mission system, sensors, a lot of communications equipment,” said Armstrong. “It can do troop transport, SWAT deployment, and also a forward command center with communications elements.”

Entry into service for this configuration is targeted for 2024, in time for the Paris Olympics. Final assembly has begun on the first two Gendarmerie aircraft, with a third aircraft in production. Airbus has a mission test bench running in parallel, which brings the different mission and communication systems together on a ground testbed.

An air medical configuration will be the next to be developed, after the public services variant is completed, said Armstrong.

The speed with which aircraft are moving through the production line increased threefold across 2022, as the program begins to hit its stride in terms of deliveries.

“The [ramp up] plan is very aggressive, so we have to deliver those sorts of improvements,” said Armstrong.

Meanwhile, the company continues to build hours on its “dynamic helicopter zero” — a representative aircraft housed in a test rig for maturity testing. Launched last year, the aircraft will soon reach 1,000 hours of representative “flight,” with 3,000 hours being the ultimate target.

“It gives us advanced learning on how the aircraft’s going to behave in service,” said Armstrong. “We get to learn anything that there is to learn before the [in-service] fleet reaches it.”

Finally, the manufacturer is working on the first prototypes of the H160M Guepard for the French military. It plans to have a civilian prototype flying with military equipment this year. The French army variant will be the first developed and delivered, followed by the navy variant.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9984747767448425}",neutral,0.9984747767448425,0

Key Takeaways Air India said it would buy 470 Boeing and Airbus planes Tuesday, the largest order in commercial aviation history.

The airline committed to buy 250 Airbus and 220 Boeing planes and received purchase options for 50 more from Boeing.

Air travel has surged after a virtual halt at the outset of the pandemic and plane makers have struggled to meet the demand for new planes.

Deliveries are expected to start in earnest by mid-2025, while a few of the planes are due to arrive by the end of this year.



Air India, owned by the Tata conglomerate since last year's privatization, committed to buying 220 Boeing jets, including 190 midrange, single-aisle 737 Max planes, 20 widebody 787 Dreamliners, and 10 widebody, long-range 777X planes. The carrier also acquired options to purchase 50 additional 737 Max planes and 20 787-9's, the larger version of the Dreamliner, according to Boeing. The order will support more than 1 million U.S. jobs across 44 states, according to the White House.

Boeing's European rival, Airbus, said it landed an order for 250 planes from Air India, including 140 A320neo and 70 A321neo single-aisle jets as well as 40 A350 widebodies.

Air India's order is the largest order of planes by a single carrier, topping a 2011 deal for 460 planes by American Airlines, according to Bloomberg. Boeing's contract based on the planes' list prices is valued at almost $46 billion, according to The Wall Street Journal, though bulk purchasers typically receive large undisclosed discounts.

Air India currently operates a fleet of approximately 100 mostly leased passenger planes including Boeings as well as Airbuses. The airline said deliveries of most of the planes it ordered would start in mid-2025.

Boeing and Airbus have struggled to ramp up production to meet unprecedented demand. Boeing delivered 38 planes to customers in January and had more than 5,400 unfilled orders as of month-end. The company said it would add Air India's order to its backlog once the deal is finalized. Airbus is to deliver six A350s originally earmarked for Aeroflot, the sanctioned Russian airline, this year under its deal with Air India. The airline also acquired purchase options for an undisclosed number of Airbus aircraft.

Boeing and Airbus both estimate India will need more than 2,200 new planes over the next two decades. If 1% of the country's 23 million daily rail passengers upgraded to commercial flights, the size of India's commercial aviation market would double, according to a Boeing executive quoted by Bloomberg. The number of flights in the country has already surpassed pre-COVID levels, while global air departures are still at 77% of their level before the pandemic, according to the same executive.

Boeing shares gained 1.5% by the afternoon in New York, while Airbus was up less than 1% in Paris trading.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9626317620277405}",negative,0.9626317620277405,-1
"Unpacking Air India’s mega Airbus, Boeing order: The details and its significance - The Indian Express","Thu, 16 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL2luZGlhbmV4cHJlc3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvZXhwbGFpbmVkL2V4cGxhaW5lZC1lY29ub21pY3MvYWlyLWluZGlhcy1vcmRlci11bnBhY2tlZC1iaWdnZXN0LW9yZGVyLWZvci1wYXNzZW5nZXItYWlyY3JhZnQtaW4taGlzdG9yeS04NDQ3NjY1L9IBlwFodHRwczovL2luZGlhbmV4cHJlc3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvZXhwbGFpbmVkL2V4cGxhaW5lZC1lY29ub21pY3MvYWlyLWluZGlhcy1vcmRlci11bnBhY2tlZC1iaWdnZXN0LW9yZGVyLWZvci1wYXNzZW5nZXItYWlyY3JhZnQtaW4taGlzdG9yeS04NDQ3NjY1L2xpdGUv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Tata Group-owned Air India (AI) placed two mega orders on Tuesday, adding up to a staggering 470 aircraft — for 250 planes with Europe’s Airbus consortium, and 220 with Boeing Co. of the United States. This is the largest order placed by an airline in one go anywhere in the world, beating the 2011 order by American Airlines for a combined 460 aircraft. The biggest order by an Indian carrier before this was IndiGo’s 300-aircraft order in 2019.

Going by the list price, the AI order value is estimated between $70 billion and $80 billion. However, manufacturers usually offer heavy discounts on such large orders, so the actual deal size is likely to be considerably smaller.

Seventy of the 470 aircraft are wide-body or twin-aisle planes for long-haul flights. Airbus has got the bigger order, but the Boeing order includes an option for a 70-plane top-up, taking the possible order size to 540 aircraft. It is not clear if there is a similar option with Airbus.

Of the 400 single-aisle or narrow-body planes — used for domestic flights and to nearby countries — 210 are of the Airbus A320 family (140 A320neo and 70 A321neo aircraft), and 190 are of the Boeing 737 MAX family (a mix of 737 MAX 8 and 737 MAX 10). The Boeing order includes the option for an additional 50 737 MAXs.

In AI’s wide-body aircraft order are 40 Airbus A350s (34 A350-1000s and six A350-900s), 20 Boeing Dreamliners (787-9), and 10 Boeing 777X (777-9). The Boeing wide-body aircraft order includes the option for another 20 787-9s.

AI’s current fleet is estimated at 140-strong, with the majority being narrow-body planes. AI largely depends on Airbus planes for domestic operations, while its wide-body fleet comprises Boeing aircraft. Air India Express operates only Boeing narrow-body planes.

The erstwhile Indian Airlines and Air India had placed an order for a total 111 single-aisle Airbus and twin-aisle Boeing planes more than 17 years ago. The two government-owned carriers of the time were later merged under the Air India brand.

Global significance

The significance of the order goes far beyond Air India and India’s aviation sector. This was underscored by the lead taken by global leaders Prime Minister Narendra Modi, French President Emmanuel Macron, and US President Joe Biden in making the announcement. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak also weighed in.

Biden said the order to Boeing will support “over one million jobs across 44 [US] states”, and the British government said the order to Airbus is worth “billions of pounds to the UK”. The Airbus deal means big business for engine maker Rolls-Royce, and will create jobs in the UK where parts of the aircraft are expected to be manufactured.

Major Western economies are in the midst of an economic slowdown, and are looking to spur economic activity and support employment. After irking the West by ramping up its purchase of Russian crude, it is good optics for India to be seen as creating jobs in Europe and the US through the AI order. The message seems to be that India and Indian companies are open to business with the world, irrespective of the region and geopolitics. The fact that the announcement has come in the year of India’s G20 presidency adds strategic value to the order.

The biggest aircraft orders The biggest aircraft orders

Air India and Indian aviation

Ever since Air India returned to the Tata Group a little more than a year ago, its new owners have been focused on sprucing up the product offering, while also planning an extensive expansion for the airline. A five-year roadmap — Vihaan.AI — was prepared with the aim of substantially growing the network and fleet and putting it on a “path to sustained growth, profitability, and market leadership”.

Advertisement

The twin orders are a key element in that strategy. Air India is also in the process of refurbishing its existing planes and trying to get a few grounded ones back in the air. In addition, it is leasing aircraft to expand its network and offering till the time the new planes join its fleet.

“The first aircraft to arrive will be 25 brand new Boeing B737-800s and six Airbus A350-900s in the second half of 2023, with deliveries really ramping up in 2025 and beyond. In the meantime, our capacity growth will continue to be supported by the previously announced lease-in of additional narrow-body and wide-body aircraft and the restoration-to-service of the remainder of our grounded fleet,” Air India CEO Campbell Wilson said in a communication to staff following the announcement of the order.

In the domestic aviation segment, Air India currently has a market share of a little more than 9 per cent, a fraction of market leader IndiGo’s 55 per cent. The Tata Group wants AI to quickly gain market share and the mega order is part of the action plan.

The company is also working to consolidate and realign its airline business by merging AI with Vistara (a joint venture between the Tata Group and Singapore Airlines) to create a full-service carrier under the Air India brand, and is merging Air India Express and AIX Connect (formerly AirAsia India) to create a large low-cost carrier that could be a potential rival to IndiGo.

The order is also significant in terms of the international traffic from and to India, the fastest growing aviation market in the world. While AI is the leader among Indian airlines in international traffic and the only one operating trans-Atlantic flights, it has not been able to effectively compete against major network carriers that offer flights to Europe and the Americas via their home countries. The new wide-body fleet especially, is expected to boost Air India’s competitiveness in the long-haul flight segment and help it emerge as a formidable global network carrier.

However, an expansion of airport infrastructure is critical to meet that objective — only fleet expansion and refurbishment will not be enough. India will have to develop one or more of its airports as large hubs like Singapore or Dubai for Air India — or indeed, any Indian carrier — to become a truly global network carrier.

Splitting up the order

In orders of this size, airlines often split the order between the two major aircraft makers. This is done with a view to expedite deliveries, particularly when the airline is targeting rapid capacity expansion, as Air India wants to do. Had the entire order been placed with either Airbus or Boeing, delivery timelines would have been pushed back considerably.

It also makes sense to have a mix of the two manufacturers as a hedge against supply chain disruptions and the possible grounding of an aircraft type due to safety or technical concerns.

Another factor to consider is the existing fleets of the Air India group, particularly in the narrow-body segment that constitutes the bulk of the combined order. Air India’s entire narrow-body fleet comprises Airbus aircraft, while Air India Express operates only Boeing single-aisle planes.

Although there is no clarity yet on how the new planes will be deployed, there is a high likelihood that Air India, the full-service carrier, would continue to rely on the Airbus A320 family, while low-cost carrier Air India Express would continue with the Boeing 737 family. Such streamlining helps airlines keep costs and other technical overheads, which can balloon in case of mixed aircraft configurations, in check.

I thank my friend @EmmanuelMacron for joining me at the launch of an important partnership between @airindiain and @Airbus that will further strengthen the Indian aviation sector and create opportunities in both nations. This reflects the robust Indo-French Strategic Partnership. — Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) February 14, 2023

Airbus vs Boeing in India

Over the years, Airbus has emerged as the undisputed leader in India’s domestic aviation space, with the lion’s share of narrow-body planes coming from its stable — specifically, the A320 family. With the exceptions of SpiceJet and new entrant Akasa Air, all major airlines in India — IndiGo, Air India, Vistara, Go First, AIX Connect — depend almost entirely on Airbus for narrow-body operations. Together, these five carriers account for almost 90 per cent of India’s domestic air travel market.

Boeing had started making inroads a few years ago with large orders for its 737 MAX aircraft from Jet Airways and SpiceJet. However, a combination of factors — the bankruptcy of Jet Airways, financial troubles at SpiceJet, and the grounding of 737 MAX planes globally for an extended period over safety issues — delivered a blow to Boeing’s ambitions in India.

Glad to speak with @POTUS @JoeBiden. Excellent discussion to review the ongoing and new initiatives to further deepen India-US Comprehensive and Global Partnership. We welcome the landmark @airindiain–@Boeing agreement which will help create new opportunities in both countries. — Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) February 14, 2023

With the 737 MAXs now back in service globally and Boeing offering faster deliveries, the US-based manufacturer would be looking to give tough competition to Airbus in India.

Among wide-body aircraft, of which there aren’t too many in India, Boeing is the leader — both Air India and Vistara have all-Boeing wide-body fleets. In fact, the Air India order for 40 Airbus A350s is being seen as a win for Airbus, which has been pitching its wide-body products to Indian carriers for some years now, but had been unable to make inroads into the Boeing-dominated segment. The last Indian carrier to deploy Airbus wide-body planes was Jet Airways.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999969005584717}",neutral,0.9999969005584717,0
Airbus plans to boost production of biggest jets amid rebounding demand - Fox Business,"Tue, 14 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9tYXJrZXRzL2FpcmJ1cy1wbGFucy1ib29zdC1wcm9kdWN0aW9uLWJpZ2dlc3QtamV0cy1hbWlkLXJlYm91bmRpbmctZGVtYW5k0gFpaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm94YnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL21hcmtldHMvYWlyYnVzLXBsYW5zLWJvb3N0LXByb2R1Y3Rpb24tYmlnZ2VzdC1qZXRzLWFtaWQtcmVib3VuZGluZy1kZW1hbmQuYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus SE, buoyed by its latest deal to sell wide-bodies to Air India Ltd., is planning to boost production rates of its two biggest models as it tries to capitalize on resurgent demand for long-haul travel, according to people familiar with the matter.

The European plane maker is planning to increase its so-called build rate for both of its currently produced wide-body aircraft, the A350 and the A330neo, according to these people. An announcement could come as early as this week, the people said, cautioning that a decision has yet to be finalized.

Airbus slashed production of its wide-body planes at the onset of the pandemic, when travel restrictions and border closures brought international traffic to a near standstill and airlines were clamoring to cancel and defer aircraft orders.

With the relaxation of most Covid-19 travel protocols, airlines are now facing a dearth of available wide-body jets, leaving carriers trying to bring back into service previously mothballed models. Those include the Airbus A380, the world’s biggest passenger plane. Carriers are also trying to snatch up rentals from aircraft-leasing firms.

AIRBUS CEO DETAILS BROAD POST-CRISIS INDUSTRIAL HURDLES

In October, Airbus Chief Executive Guillaume Faury said that the company’s bigger A350 model would move to a monthly production rate of six from five from early this year. Production of its slightly smaller A330neo is shifting to three a month from two. Those rates are still down from prepandemic rates of around 10 and about four a month, respectively.

It couldn’t be learned what new rates Airbus is targeting for the two jets. Airbus’s megadeal on Tuesday with Air India, which forms part of a record-setting aircraft purchase, includes 40 A350s.

""On wide-body aircraft, Airbus is exploring, together with its supply chain, the feasibility of further rate increases to meet growing market demand as international air travel recovers,"" a spokesman said.

AIRBUS WIDENS A350 CABIN IN MILE-HIGH REAL ESTATE WAR

The plane maker’s order book has also been buoyed by a settlement with Qatar Airways in a long-running dispute over paint defects on the model. As part of the agreement, Airbus and Qatar reinstated a previously canceled deal for the A350, adding an additional 23 planes to Airbus’s backlog.

""The fact is that the absolutely obvious increased demand in wide-bodies is causing us to study rate increases for the A330 and the A350,"" Airbus Chief Commercial Officer Christian Scherer said.

Mr. Scherer said he wants to avoid the supply constraints that Airbus is currently suffering on its narrow-body models. Those delays have held back potential sales. Airbus spent much of 2021 trying to convince its biggest suppliers that air traffic would rebound and lead to a surge in orders.

The flurry of orders has since materialized with Airbus now finding itself battling to meet its own commitments, leaving airlines and lessors frustrated by monthslong delays.

""The demand on the wide-bodies is solidifying very quickly,"" Mr. Scherer said. ""I just hope we don’t find ourselves in a similar situation before too long where we’re severely supply-constrained.""

Airbus is currently aiming to lift narrow-body production to 75 aircraft a month in the next few years after cutting production to 40 a month in early 2020. The company doesn’t currently have availability for its A320 model until 2029.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9656568765640259}",neutral,0.9656568765640259,0

The Airbus Foundation will provide access to products and services such as Earth observation satellite data, as well as offering additional capabilities for reliable high-speed telecommunications.

The maritime expedition, driven by renowned French explorer and scientist Jean-Louis Etienne’s non-profit organisation “Océan Polaire”, aims to better understand global environmental and climate dynamics. Running for several years, it will achieve this by monitoring the Southern Ocean using an innovative inhabited low-carbon vessel: the Polar POD. It has no engine and will be propelled by the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, sails and wind power.

The aim of the Polar POD initiative is to measure air-sea exchanges to improve climate studies, detect man-made impacts (such as microplastics, pesticides, etc.), and analyse the ocean’s weather, waves, winds and colour to improve satellite calibration.

“We are honoured to support this major oceanographic initiative by providing access to Airbus’ products and services. The research being undertaken by the Polar POD expedition aims to help mitigate the impact of climate change and to restore damaged ecosystems. This mission is well-matched with our priorities and perfectly complements other projects supported by the Airbus Foundation, which have until now focused on land-based activities, such as wildlife and ecosystem protection and reforestation monitoring,” said Rachel Schroeder, Managing Director, Airbus Foundation. “The Foundation and Polar POD teams will work side-by-side to successfully implement this extraordinary mission and tackle the important scientific and technological challenge together.”

“Polar POD will explore the Southern Ocean, which has the world's largest ocean data gap. Severely under-sampled by traditional methods, we have designed the Polar POD: a floating inhabited laboratory that can withstand the severe conditions of the ‘Furious Fifties’ all year round. This huge circumpolar ocean is the largest oceanic carbon sink on Earth; climate models have an urgent need for this uptake of CO2. The Southern Ocean, which links the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific waters, is an immense reservoir of marine biodiversity. Polar POD, a silent platform, is a unique opportunity to make an acoustic census of marine life. The resulting data will be shared by scientific institutions worldwide, and available for collaborative educational projects. Thank you to the Airbus Foundation for contributing to this unprecedented and long-awaited maritime exploration,” said Jean-Louis Etienne.

Airbus optical and radar satellite constellations will support the scientific studies of the Polar POD initiative, offering better resolution than public satellites. All images acquired by Airbus satellites will support the communication and educational impact of the initiative.

The Airbus Foundation will also provide access to additional Airbus services such as telecommunication services for high-speed data transmissions, in this remote part of the world, far from commercial maritime routes. These services will also enable live transmissions during television broadcasts with a higher resolution.

China’s goal for C919

China’s state-run aviation industry is working toward self-sufficiency because of sanctions. But it is these same sanctions that will make it difficult to achieve.

Beijing wants to shift to supplying its single-aisle jet needs to the COMAC C919 by the end of this decade, according to a person familiar with the situation. But ramping production up to meet future demand is difficult under the best of circumstances.

With Western-built suppliers a key to the development of the C919, including the CFM LEAP 1C engines, there is little chance the domestic industry can shift exclusively to domestic suppliers on the scale required in the time desired.

Regardless of the feasibilities, these goals are bad news for Boeing—and most likely for Airbus, too.

Boeing’s dilemma with China is well known. Aside from the geopolitical challenges between China and the US and the well-known slow return to service of the in-country 737 MAXes, Boeing can’t deliver 138 new-build MAXes to China.

Deliveries are blocked for the aforementioned geopolitical considerations. Beijing’s three-year-long zero-COVID policies cratered domestic demand. With the policies recently lifted, passenger traffic is building but it is still well below pre-pandemic levels.

But that’s not all.

Airline viability

The viability of many airlines within China is iffy. The Big Three Airlines—Air China, China Eastern, and China Southern—are on solid financial footing. But smaller, independent, or locally supported airlines are not. Beijing requires them to prove they can financially support previously placed orders and prove they can successfully support taking airplanes on a one-by-one basis. If not, Beijing blocks delivery.

This is another reason Boeing is sitting on its inventory of 138 airplanes. But Airbus is increasingly affected, too. There are A320neo family members in storage that are undelivered. And, according to one person familiar with the situation, Airbus faces delivery refusals of up to 100 airplanes in the near term. One Chinese airline is rejecting nearly a dozen A320neos from Airbus and lessors, some already built in its specifications.

Airbus last year won an order from China for 292 aircraft. The fate of some of these orders may be up in the air, given Beijing’s prove-you-can-use-it approach. Airbus has an A320 assembly plant in Tianjin capable of building eight A320s a month. Just how this fits into China’s goal of self-sufficiency remains to be seen.

But toward the end of this decade, there might be a major shift in China’s procurement. Boeing already appears a loser in this. Airbus may see its position seriously undermined. Skepticism about shifting to the C919 is huge. But a major shift is coming and there’s little Boeing or Airbus will be able to do about it.

Russia’s plans for confiscated airliners

Russia wants to use the confiscated Western airliners until 2030, reports Russian media.

“Russian carriers Western-made airliners may ‘easily fly’ until 2030 provided that work is done to maintain their flight worthiness, Head of the Federal Agency for Air Transport Alexander Neradko said,” reports the news outlet Russian Aviation.

Airbus Profits Rose More Than €30 Million Amid 'Complex' 2022 - FLYING,"Fri, 17 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZseWluZ21hZy5jb20vYWlyYnVzLXByb2ZpdHMtcm9zZS1tb3JlLXRoYW4tZTMwLW1pbGxpb24tYW1pZC1jb21wbGV4LTIwMjIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus reported its fiscal year 2022 consolidated earnings this week, revealing net income for 2022 of €4.25 billion, €34 million over its reported 2021 net income of €4.21 billion—a 1 percent increase.

The aerospace manufacturer reported an order backlog of 7,239 commercial aircraft at the end of the year.

Net order intake across Airbus was 820 aircraft units (after cancellations) in 2022, up from 507 units in 2021, a 62 percent overall increase. However, Airbus Helicopters reported a net order intake of 362, down from 414 in 2021, a 13 percent decrease, but with a revenue increase of 8 percent, according to its release. All other segments reported increases or held steady.

Stockholders are likely to receive increased dividends this year, the company said in a statement. “The Board of Directors will propose the payment of a 2022 dividend of €1.80 per share (2021: €1.50 per share) to the 2023 Annual General Meeting,’’ taking place on April 19, 2023. The proposed payment date is April 27, 2023, Airbus said.

Airbus Consolidated’s revenues in 2022 were €58.8 billion, an increase of 13 percent over €52.1 billion in 2021. Airbus delivered 50 more commercial aircraft in 2022 than it did in 2021. Its commercial aircraft include the A220, A320, and A350s. The company reported commercial aircraft revenues were up 15 percent from 2021.

“2022 was indeed a complex year,” said Guillaume Faury, Airbus CEO, in his opening remarks at a press conference Thursday morning. “We faced an adverse operating environment… Almost one year ago to the day, Russia invaded Ukraine. Furthermore, we had to adapt to a complex operating environment, and in particular, an adverse supply backdrop which eventually led to fewer commercial aircraft deliveries than originally planned. This means it will take us two years to achieve what we had planned to do in one.”

Faury cautiously but optimistically predicted continued growth for Airbus in 2023, adding that, “looking beyond the numbers, what will our priorities be in 2023? This year more than ever, the main priority is to ramp up commercial aircraft productions [sic]. In the persisting adverse environment we’re facing, we will closely work with our suppliers in order to adapt our production to match supply.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.8866643309593201}",neutral,0.8866643309593201,0
Airbus earns record net profit of 4.2 bn euros in 2022 - Tech Xplore,"Thu, 16 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vdGVjaHhwbG9yZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIzLTAyLWFpcmJ1cy1uZXQtcHJvZml0LWJuLWV1cm9zLmh0bWzSAUJodHRwczovL3RlY2h4cGxvcmUuY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMy0wMi1haXJidXMtbmV0LXByb2ZpdC1ibi1ldXJvcy5hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies .

Airbus' profits climbed to a record level despite supply chain problems.

European aircraft manufacturer Airbus said on Thursday profits soared to a record level in 2022 despite supply chain problems limiting its ability to raise production.

Net profit rose one percent to 4.2 billion euros ($4.5 billion) last year, when Airbus delivered 661 aircraft, despite original plans to hand over 720 to clients.

Airbus had chopped production during the COVID pandemic, when airlines were forced to halt most operations due to travel restrictions.

It was hoping to quickly scale back up now that traffic is recovering and airlines are looking to step up purchases of fuel-efficient aircraft, given high fuel prices.

""We delivered solid financials despite an adverse operating environment that prevented our supply chain from recovering at the pace we expected,"" Airbus chief executive Guillaume Faury said.

Airbus has over 10,000 suppliers, some of which had problems boosting production after having reduced staff numbers during the pandemic.

Obtaining raw materials hampered others and the Russian invasion of Ukraine complicated sourcing certain parts.

Sales rose 13 percent to 58.9 billion euros.

That reflected the increase in the number of aircraft delivered last year and also the strength of the US dollar, the currency in which sales are made.

""The company had to adjust its operations accordingly, which led to lower commercial aircraft deliveries than originally planned,"" Faury added.

Airbus is targeting 720 deliveries for 2023.

It hopes to step up production of the various models of its A320 medium-haul aircraft to 65 per month by the end of next year and to 75 per month in 2026.

It aims to increase production of its new long-haul A350 by a third to nine per month by 2024 and that of the A330 from three to four by next year.

Its order book rose by 820 aircraft in 2022 to stand at 7,239 at the end of that year.

Despite the continuing supply chain problem, the general outlook for the sector looks promising. Air traffic is expected to return to pre-pandemic levels this year and double by 2050.

Airbus said it expects adjusted operating profits—that exclude restructuring charges and changes in provisions—should rise to 6.0 billion euros in 2023, up from 5.3 billion in 2022.

Airbus proposed a higher dividend payment of 1.80 euros per share.

The company's shares rose three percent when trading got underway.

Next-gen police configuration in works for Airbus H145 - Vertical Magazine,"Mon, 27 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvbmV4dC1nZW4tcG9saWNlLWNvbmZpZ3VyYXRpb24taW4td29ya3MtZm9yLWFpcmJ1cy1oMTQ1L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters is developing a new Law Enforcement Mission System configuration for its H145 light twin, including a foldable mission operator station, a mission system with artificial intelligence, a next-generation hoist, and illuminated blade tips.

The blade tip illumination will help enhance situational awareness for pilots when near obstacles, said Airbus. Airbus Helicopters Photo

The configuration is to be launched with the Bavarian police force in Germany.

“We have challenged ourselves to bring the best of technology into their new police helicopters, gathering their needs, [and] identifying the possible techniques to enable this,” Axel Humpert, senior vice president and head of H145 program, told reporters during a recent briefing on the type.

The system includes a 17-inch display as part of a mission operator station, which can be installed on either side of the aircraft’s cabin. When not in use, it can be folded and moved out of the way to free up cabin space. The system operator can also work from the left seat in the cockpit, if desired, from another 17-inch display — leaving eight passenger seats available in the cabin.

Data will be able to be downloaded from and uploaded to the aircraft at “a very high speed,” said Humpert.

Meanwhile, the next-generation hoist will provide new safety enhancements while offering an increased load capacity and faster reel in/out time.

The hoist, developed by Vincoriun to Airbus’s specifications, will have a load capacity of 668 pounds (303 kilograms), and be capable of reeling in and out 30 percent fast than current hoists, said Humpert.

“The time we spend in the hover zone or in the danger zone above the sea or a mountainous area is [therefore] reduced,” he said.

The hoist’s development was in response to a request from the European Union Aviation Safety Agency for enhanced hoist safety, said Humpert. One aspect was ensuring that the cable, if cut, could not jump into the aircraft’s rotor blades, while another was the provision of a dual clutch on the system.

He added that Airbus is also focusing on the maintenance aspect of the hoist, with “significantly increased” time between overhaul and reduced direct maintenance costs targeted.

The company has begun installation trials with the hoist and hopes to have it certified by the middle of 2024.

The aircraft’s illuminated blade tips will be compatible with night vision goggles (NVGs), said Humpert, and will serve to enhance situational awareness for pilots when they are flying close to obstacles.

The manufacturer has begun assembly of the first aircraft with the new configuration. Some will be used for police training flights, while one will be kept for qualification and certification of the system. Delivery of the aircraft in full configuration will begin next year.

Upgrades in Development

Other major programs in development for the H145 include a new cockpit video flight data recorder, which includes a tail rotor video/live feed, and a required navigation performance (RPN) system from Garmin for Swiss operator Rega and another customer. The latter will allow precision navigation down to 0.1 nautical miles without the use of GPS satellites, and will enter operation in fall 2024.

The H145 is also expected to receive the next evolution (V10) of Airbus’s in-house Helionix avionics system in the second quarter of 2023. The new version will have a vortex protection system incorporated into the autopilot, said Humpert.

Other upcoming upgrades include an ADS-B In capability with a Lynx transponder, the incorporation of the RDR7000 search-and-rescue radar, and new AFCS modes allowing for assisted takeoffs or landings.

“[The pilot] pre-selects on ground the kind of takeoff he wants to have, then brings the helicopter into hover, pushes the button, and the rest is done automatically by the helicopter,” said Humpert. “It’s either continuing the takeoff, or, in [the] case of engine failure before the takeoff decision point, is bringing the helicopter back to the safe landing, where only in the final phase the pilot has to lower the collective.”

The aim is reduced workload for the pilot, he said.

Finally, Airbus hopes to deliver the first blade folding kit for the H145 “rather soon,” said Humpert. The kit, first announced when Airbus unveiled the five-bladed upgrade to the type in 2019, allows the aircraft’s blades to be folded rearwards towards the aircraft’s tail. The idea is to reduce the H145’s footprint and minimize its storage requirements.

The first kit will be delivered to a customer who will use the aircraft on board a ship.

Airbus recorded 83 orders for the H145 in 2022, which it said represented 43 percent of the global light twin orders in the year. Over 1,600 H145s are now in service with 330 operators in 70 countries, and the global fleet passed the landmark of seven million flight hours in 2022.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9936246871948242}",neutral,0.9936246871948242,0

The European planemaker outlined how production rates will increase between now and the end of 2026.

Without further ado, let’s get into it…

Production Rates…

For the A320 Family program, Airbus is looking to increase the production rate to 65 aircraft per month by the end of 2024 and 75 in 2026.

Such increases on this side of the program are in preparation for the entry-into-service of the A321XLR, which is due to take place in the second quarter of next year.

As for the Airbus A330 program, the production rate already increased to three per month at the end of last year, with the new target being four per month in 2024.

Finally, to the A350: The current rate of production is around six airframes per month, but Airbus wants to increase this to nine per month by the end of 2025, as demand for widebody aircraft continues to intensify.

This figure of 720 deliveries to be achieved within 2023 would represent a near-10% increase compared to 2022.

Last year, the European planemaker announced 1,000 new orders and 661 deliveries in a single year.

Airbus won 1,078 new orders, which converted to 820 net across all programs.

Below, you can see the breakdown in terms of orders unveiled by Airbus:

A220 – 127 firm gross new orders.

A320neo Family – 888 gross new orders.

A330 Family – 19 gross new orders.

A350 Family – 44 gross new orders.

In terms of deliveries, you can see the breakdown below;

Aircraft 2022 2021 A220 Family 53 50 A320 Family 516 483 A330 Family 32 18 A350 Family 60* 55 A380 – 5 Total 661* 611 * After a reduction of two aircraft (2 A350-900 AEROFLOT) previously recorded as sold in December 2021, for which a transfer was not possible due to international sanctions against Russia.

Commenting on 2022 performance in this respect was Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury, who said the following:

“In 2022, we served 84 customers with 661 deliveries, an increase of 8 percent compared to 2021.”

“That’s obviously less than we were targeting, but given the complexity of the operating environment, I want to thank the teams and our partners for the hard work and the ultimate result”.

“The significant order intake covering all our aircraft families, including freighters, reflects the strength and competitiveness of our product line.”

“We continue our ramp-up trajectory to deliver on our backlog.”

Considering Airbus failed to meet its delivery targets last year amid supply chain issues and COVID, the European planemaker does seem optimistic that it can achieve the 720 aircraft target. And they will.

Travel demand continues to rise in intensity, which is going to require a further need for production rates to increase in the short and medium term.

If 2023 goes a lot smoother for Airbus and they can combat the problems they experienced last year, then this will definitely be a realistic target to beat moving forward.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9931240677833557}",neutral,0.9931240677833557,0

Air India is ordering 220 Boeing aircraft valued at $34 billion. The orders include 190 737 Max aircraft, 20 of Boeing's 787s, and 10 of its 777Xs. The purchase also includes customer options for an additional 50 737 Maxs and 20 of its 787s, totaling 290 airplanes for a total of $45.9 billion at list price.

It is Boeing's third-largest sale of all time, in dollar value, and its second of all time in quantity.

""This purchase will support over 1 million American jobs across 44 states, and many will not require a four-year college degree, said President Joe Biden. ""This announcement also reflects the strength of the U.S.-India economic partnership. Together with Prime Minister Modi, I look forward to deepening our partnership even further as we continue to confront shared global challenges—creating a more secure and prosperous future for all of our citizens.""

Air India on Tuesday put in an order for 250 Airbus passenger jets.

The airline is buying 40 wide-body A350 Airbus aircraft and another 210 narrow-body A320neo planes, Tata Sons Chairman Natarajan Chandrasekaran said in a videoconference with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and French President Emmanuel Macron.

The Toulouse, France-based plane maker did not disclose financial terms of the deal, which could be worth tens of billions of dollars.

""Today is a historic moment for India, for Air India and for Airbus,"" Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury said in the video call. The size of the order ""demonstrates the appetite for growth in the Indian aviation industry. It's the fastest growing in the world.""

Air India, India's largest international carrier and second-largest domestic carrier, is seeking to reinvent itself by expanding its operations and modernizing its fleet. The new jets will help Tata compete against India's dominant carrier, IndiGo.

Chandrasekaran said the A350s will be used to ""fly all ultra-long distance across the globe."" Single-aisle A320s are typically used on short-haul routes. He said the airline has ""significant options"" to increase its order.

Tata Sons, India's oldest and largest conglomerate, regained ownership of the debt-laden national carrier last year. The Tata Group pioneered commercial aviation in India when it launched the airline in 1932. It was taken over by the government in 1953.

Modi and Macron applauded the deal, with both saying it's a sign of the strengthening ""strategic partnership"" between their countries.

""India is going to be the world's third-largest market in the aviation sector,"" Modi said. Over the next 15 years, it's estimated that India will need more than 2,000 aircraft and ""today's historic announcement will help in meeting this growing demand,"" he said.

Macron called the deal a ""new success"" in the strategic partnership between India and France and an opportunity to ""develop new areas of cooperation with India.""

Tata is integrating Air India with Vistara, which it jointly runs with Singapore Airlines, and with Air Asia India, which it runs with Malaysian discount operator Air Asia.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9965649247169495}",neutral,0.9965649247169495,0
EU investment rules will greenwash 90% of Airbus’ polluting planes - Transport & Environment,"Fri, 17 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYW5zcG9ydGVudmlyb25tZW50Lm9yZy9kaXNjb3Zlci9ldS1pbnZlc3RtZW50LXJ1bGVzLXdpbGwtZ3JlZW53YXNoLTkwLW9mLWFpcmJ1cy1wb2xsdXRpbmctcGxhbmVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The EU taxonomy for sustainable investments could greenwash over 7,000 Airbus aircraft, new data by T&E finds. This represents over 90% of Airbus’ future aircraft orders. Planes qualify for the criteria if they meet weak fuel efficiency standards, even though they still rely almost exclusively on fossil fuels.

The European Commission is currently discussing criteria for aviation to be included in EU taxonomy rules. Under the draft criteria recommended in 2022 by the Platform on Sustainable Finance, traditional aircraft qualify as “best in class” if they are more efficient[1] than older generation aircraft. These aircraft then meet the EU Taxonomy’s criteria only if they are replacing, not expanding an airline’s fleet.

Even though more fuel efficient planes emit less, these emissions savings are only around 15-20%. Critically, this has not stopped CO 2 emissions from the sector from growing exponentially in recent decades. CO 2 emissions increased by 129%[2] between 1990 and 2017 despite fuel efficiency of new aircraft improving by 18%[3] over the same period.

Jo Dardenne, aviation director at T&E, says: “Sticking a green investment label on thousands of highly polluting planes is an act of pure greenwashing. The European Commission must reverse course. Unsurprisingly, Airbus is lobbying relentlessly to ensure aviation stays in the taxonomy. But this would be a mere smokescreen that allows them to sell dirty planes for years to come. Instead, they should focus efforts and investments in zero-emission aircraft that are truly green.”

Airlines will also be affected by the EU taxonomy. For the time being, the majority of Europe’s airlines’ fleets don’t qualify as “best in class”. But their future planes will. 100% of order books by Ryanair, easyJet and Wizz Air could be considered “best in class”, as they plan to buy new generation, more efficient aircraft in the years to come. If these planes replace older aircraft, they will be compliant with the taxonomy. As a result, up to 58% of easyJet’s fleet could be taxonomy compliant, despite exclusively relying on fossil fuel to operate in the next decade.

Airlines will not only see part of their investments into future fleets rubber stamped as green, but the revenues generated from flights on these planes will also carry the same label. In practice, this means that a flight from Paris to New York, on board a slightly more efficient aircraft, could be considered green in the eyes of investors.

Transport & Environment is calling on the European Commission to amend the criteria for aviation in the EU Taxonomy. These should strictly endorse new technologies with true emissions reduction potential, such as zero-emission aircraft and high quality sustainable aviation fuels.

Note to editors: Transport & Environment (T&E) was part of the Platform on Sustainable Finance until 14th of September 2022 and left the group over a lack of independence. T&E does not support the criteria under consideration for aviation, as it greenwashes the aircraft manufacturing’s legacy business and provides no incentives for genuinely green investments. Airbus, the EU’s main aircraft manufacturer, was co-drafting criteria for its own products.

[1] Aircraft are best in class if they meet a certain percentage of improvement to ICAO’s CO2 efficiency standards. Research has shown the most advanced new aircraft delivered in recent years are already ahead of ICAO’s standard by 10%–20% on average. https://theicct.org/news/epa-co2-standard-aircraft-fuel-efficiency-jul2020

Air India Seals $34 Billion in Aircraft Orders With Airbus and Boeing - airlineweekly.skift.com,"Tue, 14 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vYWlybGluZXdlZWtseS5za2lmdC5jb20vMjAyMy8wMi9haXItaW5kaWEtc2VhbHMtMzQtYmlsbGlvbi1pbi1haXJjcmFmdC1vcmRlcnMtd2l0aC1haXJidXMtYW5kLWJvZWluZy_SAXNodHRwczovL2FpcmxpbmV3ZWVrbHkuc2tpZnQuY29tLzIwMjMvMDIvYWlyLWluZGlhLXNlYWxzLTM0LWJpbGxpb24taW4tYWlyY3JhZnQtb3JkZXJzLXdpdGgtYWlyYnVzLWFuZC1ib2VpbmcvP2FtcD0x?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Air India has committed to at least 470 aircraft from Airbus and Boeing worth an estimated $34 billion as part of the Tata Group’s effort to remake the long-ailing Indian flag carrier into a global aviation leader.

The deals were unveiled Tuesday at the highest levels of government. Tata Chairman Natarajan Chandrasekaran and Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury were joined by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and French President Emmanuel Macron to unveil the order for 250 Airbus planes. And the White House was the first to confirm the commitment for 220 Boeing aircraft. Both deals are letters of intent pending finalization.

Air India will take 140 A320neos, 70 A321neos, 34 A350-1000s, and six A350-900s, plus “significant options,” from Airbus, Chandrasekaran said. The Airbus commitments are worth an estimated $19 billion based on Cirium’s full-life base values.

And from Boeing, the carrier will take 190 737-8s and -10s, 20 787-9s, and 10 777-9s, plus another 70 737 and 787 options, the airframer said. The Boeing commitments, not including the options, are worth an estimated $15 billion, according to Cirium.

The dual aircraft orders are a big part of Tata’s aim to remake Air India. The company bought the long-ailing airline from the Indian government last year and has wasted no time in working to turn it around. Campbell Wilson was brought in from Singapore Airlines’ subsidiary Scoot to lead the carrier. And deals were reached in November with Malaysia’s Capital A to acquire its share of AirAsia India, and with Singapore Airlines for its stake in Vistara. AirAsia India is to be merged with Air India Express, and Vistara with Air India itself.

The blockbuster dual orders, which has parallels to American Airlines’ split order for 460 A320neos and 737 Maxes in 2011, will allow Air India to renew its fleet as well as grow. It could potentially even reclaim the unofficial crown as India’s national airline, which Emirates has long held by moving more Indian overseas travelers than any other airline.

“We are going through a massive transformation because we are committed to building a world-class airline known for safety, on-time performance, the best of Indian hospitality, and modern fleet,” Chandrasekaran said.

Of course, remaking Air India into a global leader will take more than just new aircraft. As Chandrasekaran pointed out, the airline needs to improve its operational performance and provide a customer experience that is on par with the likes of Emirates and Singapore Airlines. In short, Air India needs to become an airline people want to fly, not just have to fly.

“India is on the verge of an international air travel revolution,” Airbus’ Faury said Tuesday. Faury added that it was time to turn India into an “international hub” for global aviation.

In addition to Air India’s turnaround and expected growth, the country’s largest airline, IndiGo, is expanding at a rapid clip. Its international ambitions are somewhat smaller, given its preference for an all-narrowbody fleet, with an aim to “connect China to Africa,” as former CEO Ronojoy Dutta put it in August. IndiGo has orders for 488 A320neo family aircraft, including for the long-range A321XLR, Airbus data show.

And demographically, India surpassed China as the world’s most populous country with 1.4 billion people at the end of 2022.

Both Airbus and Boeing, in their separate comments on the Air India deal, touted their investments in India. Faury touted the European planemaker’s engineering center in Bengaluru in his prepared remarks. And Boeing on Monday unveiled plans for a new $24 million logistics center India.

Deliveries of the first A350s are scheduled for late 2023, barring any delays from Airbus’ well known supply chain issues. The delivery timeline for the rest of the order was not disclosed.

Air India and Air India Express operate 131 aircraft, including the A320 and 737 families, as well as 777 and 787 models, Cirium Fleets Analyzer shows. AirAsia India operates another 28 A320s, and Vistara 53 A320, 737, and 787 family aircraft.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999352753162384}",neutral,0.999352753162384,0
"Air India unveils record plane order with Airbus, Boeing - FRANCE 24 English","Tue, 14 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyYW5jZTI0LmNvbS9lbi9saXZlLW5ld3MvMjAyMzAyMTQtYWlyLWluZGlhLXVudmVpbHMtcmVjb3JkLXBsYW5lLW9yZGVyLXdpdGgtYWlyYnVzLWJvZWluZ9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Bengaluru (India) (AFP) – Air India will purchase 470 planes from Airbus and Boeing under an historic pair of mega agreements announced Tuesday, transforming the former national carrier as it prepares for scorching growth.

Advertising Read more

The airline, which is owned by the Tata Group, announced a contract to purchase 250 Airbus planes at an AeroIndia salon in Bangalore at a ceremony attended virtually by French President Emmanuel Macron and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

That was followed by a White House announcement that Air India also agreed to a firm order of 220 Boeing aircraft in a contract that US President Joe Biden touted as a sign of American manufacturing might.

Combined, the two deals constitute the largest unveiled at the same time by a commercial carrier, overtaking a 2011 announcement by American Airlines to purchase 460 planes.

While there was no official value in Tuesday's announcements, a calculation of the list price for the jets suggests the orders are worth more than $70 billion total.

After a brutal downturn during the worst days of Covid-19, major carriers have been unveiling massive new jet orders amid rising travel demand in a boon for Airbus and Boeing, while also challenging supply chains.

""We are going through a massive transformation,"" Air India chairman N. Chandrasekaran said at the ceremony in India.

""One of the most important things is a modern fleet which can perform for all routes.""

Modi has described strengthening civil aviation as an important aspect of national infrastructure, citing estimates that India will need more than 2,000 aircraft in the next 15 years.

Options for more

Under the deal with Airbus, Air India signed a letter of intent to buy 210 narrow-body A320neo jets and 40 long-haul A350 aircraft -- with an unspecified number of options for more -- as it plots to capture domestic market share and turn Indian airports into global travel hubs.

""Today is a historic moment for India, for Air India and for Airbus,"" said Airbus chief executive Guillaume Faury, saying the size of the order ""demonstrates the appetite for growth in the Indian aviation industry"".

The European aircraft manufacturer already has an engineering centre in the country and sources some components from Indian suppliers.

Macron said the deal highlighted the bond between Paris and New Delhi.

""Today is one of the milestones of the in-depth strategic and friendly partnership we have between India and France,"" he said.

The carrier's agreement with Boeing includes a firm order of 190 narrow-body 737 MAX aircraft, along with 20 Boeing 787s and 10 Boeing 777X. The deal also has an option for an additional 50 MAX planes and 20 787s, the White House official said.

The White House noted the contract in the context of a US-India initiative on critical and emerging technology unveiled between Biden and Modi in May 2022 and expanded last month.

""This purchase will support over one million American jobs across 44 states,"" Biden said, adding that the announcement shows that ""the United States can and will lead the world in manufacturing.""

A statement released by Modi's office said the two leaders had a ""warm and productive"" call during which they characterized the agreement between Air India and Boeing ""as a shining example of mutually beneficial cooperation that will help create new employment opportunities in both countries.""

Stan Deal, head of Boeing's commercial airplane division, said the contract showed Air India's ""confidence in our products and services in the world's fastest growing aviation market.""

Revival

The airline's first new aircraft purchase since 2006 is part of an ambitious plan to return to profitability in the world's third-biggest air transport market.

Air India was founded by tea-to-steel conglomerate Tata Group in 1932 and the Indian government bought a majority stake after independence.

But by the end of the century, the venture was struggling to compete with Gulf carriers and no-frills airlines, starved of investment and racking up billions of dollars in losses that dragged on the public purse.

Tata -- also chaired by Chandrasekaran -- finally bought it back in a $2.4 billion deal a year ago.

Air India remains the country's largest international carrier, but its domestic market share stood at only 8.6 percent in September.

It is aiming to take a 30 percent domestic share by the end of 2027 while expanding its fleet to cover more international routes.

Tata Group is well-positioned to capitalize on the burgeoning market despite the conglomerate's six-decade absence from the air travel industry, aviation consultant Mark Martin told AFP.

""They will have to recruit talent and return to the warm Indian hospitality that made it one of the top five airlines in the world in the 1960s and 1970s,"" he said.

Avealto Launches Trademark Dispute Against Airbus HAPS Venture - Via Satellite,"Mon, 13 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhdGVsbGl0ZXRvZGF5LmNvbS9maW5hbmNlLzIwMjMvMDIvMTMvYXZlYWx0by1sYXVuY2hlcy10cmFkZW1hcmstZGlzcHV0ZS1hZ2FpbnN0LWFpcmJ1cy1oYXBzLXZlbnR1cmUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"HAPS company Avealto recently launched a trademark dispute against Airbus for renaming its HAPS venture Aalto HAPS Ltd, which it argues is too similar to its own name.

The two companies are targeting service with HAPS — high altitude platform stations, or high altitude pseudo satellites. HAPS operate in the stratosphere, much closer to Earth than satellites, and can provide connectivity.

Airbus launched the new connectivity service business in July 2022 led by Samer Halawi to commercialize its Zephyr HAPS platform, and rebranded the company in January to Aalto HAPS, or Aalto. Explaining the new name, the company said the “A” reflects the Airbus heritage of the company; the “alt” reflects the high-altitude nature of the operation; and the “O” highlights Zephyr’s “limitless flight capabilities.”

Avealto, established in 2013 and based in the United Kingdom, said infringement of its trademarked name will threaten its ability to raise funds and market its services. The company announced on Monday that it sent Aalto a cease and desist letter, and said that if Airbus does not stop using the similar name by April 13, it will take formal action against the company.

Avealto also sent a letter to the U.K. Secretary of State for Business and Trade Kemi Badenoch asking for a legal review of the rebranding.

“The actions by Airbus and its subsidiary, Aalto HAPS Ltd, are disappointing. Their actions demonstrate a clear infringement of our trademark and have left us with no choice but to take legal action,” Avealto Managing Director Walt Anderson said. “I am calling directly on the leadership of Airbus to take action to correct this wrongdoing.”

“This appears to be a rather cynical attempt by Airbus to restrict our ability to raise funds and market our services and to stifle its competition. This would be detrimental to consumers and jeopardize the hundreds of direct and indirect jobs we are set to contribute to Britain’s post-Brexit economy once we are fully operational,” Anderson added.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9982722997665405}",neutral,0.9982722997665405,0
Airbus Bids for 30% Stake in Atos' Evidian Security Business - BankInfoSecurity.com,"Fri, 17 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJhbmtpbmZvc2VjdXJpdHkuY29tL2FpcmJ1cy1iaWRzLWZvci0zMC1zdGFrZS1pbi1hdG9zLWV2aWRpYW4tc2VjdXJpdHktYnVzaW5lc3MtYS0yMTIzONIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Big Data Security Analytics , Cloud Security , Next-Generation Technologies & Secure Development

Airbus Bids for 30% Stake in Atos' Evidian Security Business

Deal Would Strengthen Evidian's Hand in Cloud, Advanced Computing, Digital Security

Airbus has made a formal offer to purchase a 29.9% stake in Atos' $4.8 billion Evidian cybersecurity, big data and digital business.

See Also: OnDemand Panel | 2022 Top Challenges and Strategies in Higher Education Technology

The Paris-based conglomerate says it will conduct due diligence and initiate negotiations with the Dutch aircraft manufacturer focused on both Airbus' offer and a long-term strategic and technological partnership between the two organizations. Airbus says it won't grant any exclusivity to Atos and remains open to offers from other parties capable of supporting a major financial and industrial project (see: Report: Airbus Eyes Minority Stake in Atos Security Business).

""Airbus' interest in becoming an anchor shareholder is an acknowledgement of Evidian's unique capabilities in an increasingly complex digital environment with heightened security challenges,"" says Bertrand Meunier, chairman of the Atos board of directors. ""Through this proposed large-scale partnership, we would accelerate Evidian's industrial project and future growth while ensuring technical sovereignty.""

Investors in Atos reacted favorably to Airbus' offer, sending the company's stock up 17.5%, or $2.20, to $14.83 per share in trading since the bid was revealed before the market opened Thursday. Similarly, Airbus' stock is up 5.5%, or $7.06, over the past two days, to $134.41 per share. Airbus said its revenue increased by 12.9% in 2022, to $62.89 billion, and reported annual earnings of $5.78 per share.

Catalyzing Cross-Sell Opportunities

Atos intends to stand up Evidian as a separate, publicly listed company by the end of 2023 and has said it intends to use proceeds from selling partial ownership in Evidian to bankroll its transformation plan for Atos' $6.99 billion infrastructure and data management business as well as its $4.38 billion business and platform solutions unit. Atos will maintain up to a 30% stake in Evidian following the separation.

""There's a lot of complementarity and synergies with what Evidian is doing.""

– Guillaume Faury, CEO, Airbus

Neither Atos nor Airbus disclosed how much Airbus offered to pay for the nearly 30% stake in Evidian. Atos in September rejected a $4.12 billion offer from rival Onepoint to acquire Evidian outright. Atos values Evidian at about $7.49 billion, including a $3.21 billion debt, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters (see: Atos Rejects $4.12B Onepoint Bid for Cybersecurity Business).

“The worlds in our businesses - be it commercial aviation, defense, space, helicopters - will be very much enabled by data, big data, connectivity, cloud-based solutions, connected objects in a cyber secure environment,” Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury said during an earnings press conference Thursday. “So there's a lot of complementarity and synergies with what Evidian is doing.”

Having Airbus as an anchor shareholder with a long-term strategic and technological agreement would strengthen Evidian's European leadership and reach in cloud, advanced computing, digital security and digitization, according to Atos. The investment would allow Airbus and Evidian to generate cross-selling opportunities and enter into new markets such as secure cloud, data management and security, he says.

Leading the Way in Managed Security Services

Combining Airbus' capabilities with Evidian's expertise in managed security services and supercomputing would create a unique European entity across cybersecurity, public safety, critical national infrastructure and digitalization of the defense sector, according to Atos. Gartner in April recognized Atos as the world's largest managed security services vendor after it grew its practice by 20.9% in 2021.

Revenue for Atos' Evidian business in the first half of 2022 inched up to $2.49 billion, just 2% higher than the $2.44 billion the year prior on a constant currency basis, thanks to above-market growth from the company's cybersecurity practice. Evidian has 50,000 employees focused on its $3.43 billion digital transformation business and 9,000 employees serving its $1.38 billion big data and security practice.

Airbus has three divisions: a $44.31 billion commercial aircraft business, which grew by 15% in 2022; a $12.04 billion defense and space business, which grew by 11% in 2022; and a $7.54 billion helicopter business, which grew by 8% in 2022. Cybersecurity has been part of Airbus' defense and space unit and includes security operations centers, incident response services and cryptography for NATO countries.

Airbus also operates a 400-person cybersecurity subsidiary in Europe called Stormshield that sells data, endpoint and network security technology. Airbus last year said it would increase Stormshield's research and development activities to enrich the company's portfolio in network security, data encryption and endpoint detection and response (see: Airbus Sets Up Cybersecurity-Focused Organization).","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.6116407513618469}",neutral,0.6116407513618469,0

ITA Airways Inaugurates First Airbus A320neo - Business Traveler USA,"Fri, 24 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vYnVzaW5lc3N0cmF2ZWxlcnVzYS5jb20vbmV3cy9pdGEtYWlyd2F5cy1pbmF1Z3VyYXRlcy1maXJzdC1haXJidXMtYTMyMG5lby_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"ITA Airways has entered into service its first Airbus A320neo. The aircraft joined the airline’s revenue roster on Monday, February 20, connecting the airline’s hub at Rome Fiumicino with Palermo.

The new plane, painted in ITA’s signature Savoia Blue livery, has been named after Francesco Moser, a professional cyclist famous in the 1970s and 1980s.

Initially, the airline will base the plane in Rome and deploy it on 11 domestic and three European destinations. However, as more airframes join the fleet in the summer, the airline will deploy them on all short and medium-haul routes spanning Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa.

ITA Airways chose a quite dense configuration on its Airbus A320neo, featuring 180 seats. As a result, Business Class passengers do not have a dedicated cabin. Instead, they have more personal space as the middle seat of each row is left empty, and they enjoy an upgraded dining experience with hot meals and fine wines.

In a note released to the media, the company stressed the environmentally-friendly performance of the new type. “Bringing together technology and efficiency, the Airbus A320neo delivers 20% less fuel consumption and CO2 emissions per seat compared to previous generation aircraft,” said ITA Airways.

“With the new airplane, ITA Airways will further enrich its modern and environment-friendly fleet, which will feature 80% new generation aircraft by 2026, consequently downscaling of 1.3 million tons of CO2 emissions”.

The A320neo is the third new aircraft type ITA introduced in its fleet after it replaced Alitalia as Italy’s flag carrier in October 2021. In August 2022, it put into service the A350, followed in October by the A220.

Fleet Upgrades

The Italian carrier operates a fleet of 66 aircraft—six A350-900s, eight A330-200s, 30 A320ceo, one A320neo, 17 A319ceo, and four A220-300.

The plan is to grow the fleet to 109 airplanes by 2026.

This year, the airline expects to receive 39 new aircraft, with the debut of the A330-900s and the A321neos.

Today, the airline teased through its Instagram account the manufacturing process of its first Airbus A330neo. “Something new is coming, and by “something” we mean our new @airbus #A330NEO,” said the post.

View this post on Instagram A post shared by ITA Airways (@itaairways)

ITA will use these new airplanes partly to phase out older aircraft, like the A320/A319ceos and the A330-200s. According to the 2022-2023 winter schedule, the carrier flies to nine intercontinental, 22 intra-European, and 20 domestic destinations for a total of 51.

Services to San Francisco and Washington have been announced and will start before the end of 2023, following the arrival of the new A330-900s. In addition, the A321neos will open new destinations in the Middle East, with Riyadh and Jeddah in Saudia Arabia and Kuwait City in pole position.

According to the plans of the carrier, the single-aisle A321neos will be configured to guarantee the same level of comfort offered onboard widebody aircraft, with lie-flat seats in Business Class.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999938011169434}",neutral,0.9999938011169434,0
20/Twenty: Airbus’s Versatile ACH145 - Aviation Week,"Mon, 27 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1hdmlhdGlvbi9haXJjcmFmdC1wcm9wdWxzaW9uLzIwdHdlbnR5LWFpcmJ1c3MtdmVyc2F0aWxlLWFjaDE0NdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A variant of the MBB-BK117, twin-engine Airbus H145 was the final variant of the series marketed as the Eurocopter EC145, MBB-BK117 D2.

Over the years, the helicopter has upgraded to the current BK117D3 standard, with an upgraded 5-blade rotor system. The relatively new designation of ACH145 reflects the rebranding to Airbus Helicopters in January 2014. Demand for the ACHH145 has remained high, with a waitlist of about two years for a new unit with a list price of $9.7 million. Its closest competitor for sales is the Bell 429.

Multiple operators and acquisition companies can affirm that a fair price for a pre-owned ACH145 is north of $7 million. The figure remains consistent among newer and older model-year H145s, especially since the oldest models date back just to 2014.

Published performance data includes a maximum range of 335 nm with a 30-min. fuel reserve, an endurance of 3 hr., 35 min. and a recommended cruise speed of 130 kts. The helicopter’s useful load is 4,200 lb. with a standard fuel tank capacity of 1,593.9 lb. The hover ceiling OGE (out-of-ground effect) is 8,955 ft.

“This helicopter can represent the trophy, luxury SUV found on display on one’s driveway, except for a certain crowd that driveway is a superyacht,” says Scott Gugel, owner of On Deck Aviation, a company specializing in yacht-based aviation. Gugel hires and trains pilots to land helicopters on superyachts and praises the H145 as his favorite helicopter to fly. He also serves as a regional sales director for Global Aircraft, an aircraft sales and management firm.

The operational capabilities of the H145 extend beyond this niche demographic, however, which explains why competition and price for a pre-owned model are relatively high. Other multi-mission areas include law enforcement, emergency medical services, offshore oil operations and passenger transport for private and business aviation.

ACH145 interior layout configurations can vary with space for up to 10 passengers with one or two pilots. “The interior is very convertible,” Gugel says. “All the seats can be taken out, leaving you with a large flat deck. The back opens like a clam shell.”



Its versatility has made the H145 popular among police and government agencies for public-use-related operations. These are the customers contributing most to the waitlist, and the large accounts that sales departments inevitably target the most, leaving business and civil operators with more competition to gain access to any available supply. At any given time across the global marketplace, less than five ACH145s are typically available, with a portion of these sales occurring off-market.

In-House ‘Helionix’

Powered by two ARRIEL 2E turbine engines with FADEC engine control, all ACH145s come equipped with Airbus’s in-house “Helionix,” a system dubbed as the only avionics suite developed for helicopters.

“The system displays only the most pertinent details of a flight phase, filtering out all unnecessary and distracting information,” says Christian Gottschalk, head of the Helionix program at Airbus Helicopters. The suite offers two-to-four multifunction display screens designed to improve situational awareness.

In 2021, a wireless airborne communications system was deployed on the ACH145 that enhanced its connectivity by transmitting helicopter data in real-time. That year, Airbus reported its global helicopter fleet with Helionix avionics had completed more than 500,000 flight hours.

Another component of Helionix that pilots including Gugel value is the four-axis autopilot. “The autopilot has a noticeable performance increase compared to other OEMs’ helicopters; you can even take your feet off the pedals,” Gugel says. “The OEI (One-engine-inoperative) performance coupled with its fenestron tail-rotor technology and ease of use provide greatly enhanced safety features.”

Mercedes-Benz Style

Before the ACH145 rebranded to Airbus Helicopters in 2010, Mercedes-Benz Style created a luxury design concept for the Eurocopter version. One year later, the Mercedes-Benz Style EC145 made its debut at the European Business Aviation Conference & Exhibition (EBACE) in Geneva, Switzerland, attracting interest from VIP operators.

The design complements a mix of configurations accommodating four-to-eight passengers and has been noted to contribute to a positive passenger experience. “It’s a smooth ride with good visibility,” says Gugel. “The design is based on a legacy aircraft; everything on it is constantly improved upon due to this heritage.”

Cabin interior highlights include a wooden floor with LED lights, a front separation wall between the cabin and cockpit, soundproof interior panels, an inflight entertainment system, an electrical interface and several basic items covered with leather. One disadvantage is the Mercedes-Benz style has developed a reputation for being heavy, making it harder to remove for maintenance activity.

Most operators find that ACH145 maintenance tasks, both calendar and flight-time related, are accomplished during normal 400-hr. and 800-hr. annual inspections, leaving the helicopter available for operation the remainder of the year.



The D3 version of the ACH145 entered service in 2020 equipped with a five-bladed main rotor as opposed to four. According to Airbus Helicopters, there are 38 D3s in service. There are nearly 1,500 BK117, EC145 and H145 models in operation worldwide. At any given time, up to two D3s are listed for sale on the market, with a fair price between $8.5 million and $9 million, according to Global Aircraft.

Airbus: helicopter industry recovery to take 2 to 3 years - Vertical Magazine,"Thu, 16 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLWhlbGljb3B0ZXItaW5kdXN0cnktcmVjb3ZlcnktdG8tdGFrZS0yLXRvLTMteWVhcnMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters said it expects it will take “two to three” years for the industry to return its pre-Covid state, with geopolitical and economic uncertainty causing operators to delay purchase decisions towards the end of 2022.

“We’re on the way to a recovery,” David Prevor, head of marketing analysis and forecasting at Airbus Helicopters, told media while unveiling the manufacturer’s 2022 Market Status and Outlook report. “It’s not a one-shot recovery in one year and we’re back on track, it’s actually taking several years. And what we anticipate . . . is it will happen over the next two to three years to go back to the ‘normal’ level of the industry.”

According to Airbus, there were 1,082 turbine helicopter bookings around the globe in 2022, with 584 of those being for the civil and parapublic market, and 498 for the military sector. While this was a significant increase from the nadir of 751 global turbine booking in 2020, it was still some way below 2019’s figure, and represented just a two-percent uptick from the number of aircraft ordered in 2021.

Airbus itself recorded 374 civil orders in 2022, down from 2021’s 419.

Prevor said “the world economy has never faced such a high level of risk” as it did in the third quarter of 2022, and although prospects have now improved, this uncertainty led to the postponement of purchases.

That there was any growth in turbine sales was thanks to the military market, he said. Driven by orders for training and tactical transport aircraft, there were over 110 more military aircraft ordered in 2022 than in the previous year, while the civil and parapublic market orders actually reduced by 86.

However, there was the first sign of a rebound in the energy segment (in which Airbus includes wind power, along with oil-and-gas), with 16 aircraft ordered for work in the sector — a mix of Airbus H175s and H145s, and Leonardo AW169s and AW189s. Super mediums were the only helicopter class that sold more last year than in 2019, and this has been driven by growth in the energy segment, Prevor said.

Another positive sign is the continued strength of the private/business aviation sector, which was the only civil sector exceeding 2019 bookings in 2022.

Geographically, only the traditionally strong markets of Western Europe and North America exceeded 2019 orders last year.

In terms of productivity, the global average of flight hours per turbine helicopter was up seven percent from 2021. This increase was most pronounced in commercial operations (+18 percent) and oil-and-gas (+12 percent), with air medical, private/business aviation and public services remaining relatively static. Airbus said this was more a reflection that aircraft in these sectors were kept busy throughout the pandemic rather than any negative factor last year.

All told, this reflects “a balanced situation between supply and demand” in a global sense, said Prevor. “There was clear oversupply of helicopters in [civil] operations in 2021,” he said. “This oversupply has been absorbed and this is what we see here.”

Looking ahead, Airbus predicts more than 16,200 civil and parapublic helicopters will be delivered over the next 20 years, worth an estimated €120 billion. Of those, almost 12,000 will simply replace retiring airframes — meaning Airbus expects the global helicopter fleet to grow by just over 4,200 aircraft (16 percent) over the next two decades.

According to the manufacturer, the current global in-service fleet of civil and parapublic helicopters is just over 26,000. Over the last 10 years, 60 percent of the aircraft entering the market have been for market growth rather than replacement, but Airbus clearly expects that growth to drastically slow over the coming years.

Prevor said this is largely due to the maturation of the North American and Western European markets, while Airbus also expects a sizeable portion of the existing fleet (55 percent) to still be in operation in 2042.

Future global growth will be driven by Asia/Pacific (+ 33 percent), Africa/Middle East (+31 percent), and Latin America (+18 percent), the company believes.

Of those 16,200 aircraft entering operation over the next 20 years, Airbus said half will be light singles — but they will represent just 18 percent of the value. At the other end of the scale, it expects a demand for over 2,000 super medium/heavy helicopters, representing 32 percent of the overall value.

Focusing on the energy sector, Regis Magnac, the company’s head of energy, leasing, and global accounts, said the future looks positive, with overcapacity now absorbed and flight hours increasing.

“Clearly what we see is signs of a rebound in the energy sector,” he said. “We see clearly the 175 particularly, [and other] super mediums replacing the heavies — or at least taking a role that used to be taken by the heavies.”

He said the energy industry had been “underinvesting in the last few years,” with Airbus expecting a new cycle of replacement to begin as older Sikorsky S-92s begin to retire from the offshore fleet.

“if you look at the public data on registration numbers, we’re in the range of 12 aircraft [likely to exit service] a year in the next 10 years,” he said. In the short term — the next five years or so — super mediums would replace these larger aircraft, he added.

“It’s hard to imagine where the energy sector will be in 10 years,” said Magnac, “but for the first five years it’s obvious. And when is it starting? I sense it’s starting now.”","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9986385703086853}",positive,0.9986385703086853,1
Airbus Foundation supports explorer and scientist Jean-Louis Etienne's Polar POD expedition – SatNews - SatNews,"Tue, 28 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5zYXRuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDIzLzAyLzI4L2FpcmJ1cy1mb3VuZGF0aW9uLXN1cHBvcnRzLWV4cGxvcmVyLWFuZC1zY2llbnRpc3QtamVhbi1sb3Vpcy1ldGllbm5lcy1wb2xhci1wb2QtZXhwZWRpdGlvbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Airbus Foundation has signed an agreement with the Polar POD expedition to support both the scientific program and the operational phase of the mission. The Airbus Foundation will provide access to products and services such as Earth observation satellite data, as well as offering additional capabilities for reliable high-speed telecommunications.

The maritime expedition, driven by renowned French explorer and scientist Jean-Louis Etienne’s non-profit organization “Océan Polaire”, aims to better understand global environmental and climate dynamics. Running for several years, it will achieve this by monitoring the Southern Ocean using an innovative inhabited low-carbon vessel: the Polar POD. It has no engine and will be propelled by the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, sails and wind power.

The aim of the Polar POD initiative is to measure air-sea exchanges to improve climate studies, detect man-made impacts (such as microplastics, pesticides, etc.), and analyze the ocean’s weather, waves, winds and color to improve satellite calibration.

“We are honored to support this major oceanographic initiative by providing access to Airbus’ products and services. The research being undertaken by the Polar POD expedition aims to help mitigate the impact of climate change and to restore damaged ecosystems. This mission is well-matched with our priorities and perfectly complements other projects supported by the Airbus Foundation, which have until now focused on land-based activities, such as wildlife and ecosystem protection and reforestation monitoring,” said Rachel Schroeder, Managing Director, Airbus Foundation. “The Foundation and Polar POD teams will work side-by-side to successfully implement this extraordinary mission and tackle the important scientific and technological challenge together.”

“Polar POD will explore the Southern Ocean, which has the world’s largest ocean data gap. Severely under-sampled by traditional methods, we have designed the Polar POD: a floating inhabited laboratory that can withstand the severe conditions of the ‘Furious Fifties’ all year round. This huge circumpolar ocean is the largest oceanic carbon sink on Earth; climate models have an urgent need for this uptake of CO2. The Southern Ocean, which links the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific waters, is an immense reservoir of marine biodiversity. Polar POD, a silent platform, is a unique opportunity to make an acoustic census of marine life. The resulting data will be shared by scientific institutions worldwide, and available for collaborative educational projects. Thank you to the Airbus Foundation for contributing to this unprecedented and long-awaited maritime exploration,” said Jean-Louis Etienne.

Airbus optical and radar satellite constellations will support the scientific studies of the Polar POD initiative, offering better resolution than public satellites. All images acquired by Airbus satellites will support the communication and educational impact of the initiative.

The Airbus Foundation will also provide access to additional Airbus services such as telecommunication services for high-speed data transmissions, in this remote part of the world, far from commercial maritime routes. These services will also enable live transmissions during television broadcasts with a higher resolution.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.7379896640777588}",positive,0.7379896640777588,1
Airbus looking to fill over 800 positions in Canada to accelerate A220 production - Skies Magazine,"Wed, 22 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vc2tpZXNtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLWxvb2tpbmctZmlsbC04MDAtcG9zaXRpb25zLWNhbmFkYS1hY2NlbGVyYXRlLWEyMjAtcHJvZHVjdGlvbi_SAWJodHRwczovL3NraWVzbWFnLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FpcmJ1cy1sb29raW5nLWZpbGwtODAwLXBvc2l0aW9ucy1jYW5hZGEtYWNjZWxlcmF0ZS1hMjIwLXByb2R1Y3Rpb24vP2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Dayna Fedy-MacDonald | February 22, 2023 Dayna Fedy-MacDonald |

Estimated reading time 3 minutes, 46 seconds.

Airbus on Feb. 22 announced its plans to recruit more than 800 new employees in Canada this year, as the manufacturer is looking to ramp up production of its A220 commercial aircraft, as well as “meet opportunities in the helicopter, defense, and space fields,” the company said in a press release.

In 2022 alone, Airbus hired 800 new personnel and created more than 400 positions for the A220 in Mirabel, Quebec. Now, the OEM is looking to recruit a further 800 employees in 2023. Of the 800 new employees, 500 will be recruited for the creation of new positions, which Airbus said reflects the growth of its operations in Canada.

The jobs will range from sub-component assembly and flight operations, to IT and customer service. “Two-thirds of the workforce will be in support functions, while one-third will be in production,” Airbus said.

More specifically, Airbus Canada’s president and CEO, Benoît Schultz, said this year the company is aiming to “allocate one-third of our positions to young graduates and early-career professionals, and maintain our goal to have 33 percent of new hires and promotions allocated to women.”

The company added: “These new hires will be essential to maintaining [our] position as a leading player in the Canadian aerospace sector, ensuring the full potential of the A220 and supporting the decarbonization of air transport.”

Airbus currently manufactures the A220 at two facilities, both located in North America. The first is in Mirabel — which is the main A220 facility — and the second is in Mobile, Alabama. There are nearly 3,000 personnel working at the A220 commercial aircraft program headquarters in Mirabel, and more than 4,000 individuals who work at the 10 sites and offices of Airbus and its subsidiaries in Canada.

While Airbus has not offered a recent update regarding the A220’s monthly production rate, Skies reported in August 2022 that Airbus is producing a total of 72 A220s per year between the Mirabel and Mobile facilities. The OEM has plans to increase that number to 168 units by 2025, which would translate to a monthly production rate of 10 units at Mirabel and four units at Mobile.

Currently, the largest operator of the A220 is Delta Air Lines, with 59 of the type in its fleet — comprised of both the A220-100 and A220-300. Canada’s flag carrier, Air Canada, is not far behind, with 33 A220-300s in its fleet.

The aircraft is tailored specifically for the 100- to 150-seat market. In July 2022, Airbus forecasted that there will be global demand for at least 7,000 aircraft in that exact seat category over the next 20 years.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999967098236084}",neutral,0.999967098236084,0
Airbus engineer Antoine Alouani sets his sights on the stars - Airbus,"Thu, 09 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIzLTAyLWFpcmJ1cy1lbmdpbmVlci1hbnRvaW5lLWFsb3Vhbmktc2V0cy1oaXMtc2lnaHRzLW9uLXRoZS1zdGFyc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Alouani is the Propulsion Subsystem Technical Authority for the third European Service Module (ESM-3) that Airbus is building for the U.S. Orion next-generation space system – which will transport astronauts beyond low Earth orbit for the first time since the Apollo program of the 1970s.

He serves as the lead engineer for ESM-3’s entire propulsion system, in charge of ensuring that it is designed, built and tested to the exacting requirements of a human-rated spacecraft as specified by the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and European Space Agency (ESA).

The ambition of navigating the cosmos

“My job at Airbus is more than just a job…it’s a way to get closer to my ultimate dream of going into space,” Alouani said. “Being in contact with the Orion spacecraft enables me to see how it will be flown, providing knowledge I can apply if I’m on an Orion mission someday that may use a future ESM.”

He acknowledges that the ESM programme represents a major step forward for Europe – marking the first time NASA has delegated such a critical element of a human-rated spacecraft to European partners.

“It’s a great sign of confidence that has been truly earned,” Alouani added. “I see this every time we have engineering meetings with my counterparts at NASA and Lockheed Martin, the U.S. prime contractor for Orion. We are treated as a key partner, we’re bringing added value to the program, and we are recognized by the U.S. for our professionalism and performance.”

The lifetime goal of becoming an astronaut

Working in the space sector – and eventually becoming an astronaut – has been a dream for Alouani since he was nine years old, and his entire educational path was oriented with this goal in mind. After graduating with a master’s degree in aerospace engineering, he joined Airbus Defence and Space – taking on multiple assignments that has continually broadened his experience during 12 years at the company.

Alouani started as a member of the system mechanical engineering team for Europe’s heavy-lift Ariane 5 launch vehicle, working at the Airbus facility in Les Mureaux, France. When transferring to the company’s Bremen, Germany operation, Alouani joined the Ariane 5’s propulsion functional team with responsibilities that took him to the launch pad in French Guiana for final integration and testing campaign of Ariane 5’s upper stage, as well as ground operations until lift-off.

Alouani’s next job brought him closer to the realm of human spaceflight as a propulsion engineer on Airbus’ Orion ESM in the framework of the “delta” development for the propulsion subsystem on ESM-3 onwards. He first supported technical impact studies, architecture trade-off, local design changes and optimization for mass savings and reliability improvement. The experience offered Alouani the opportunity to become the Lead Engineer for this improved propulsion subsystem, with the goal of ensuring that it is designed, integrated, tested and qualified as agreed with NASA and ESA for the benefit of the mission and the safety of the astronauts aboard.

A true “citizen of the world”

In addition to his now-extensive professional experience, Alouani is well attuned to another characteristic of becoming a future astronaut: the international aspect that increasingly is a reality for large-scale human spaceflight endeavours. Born in Strasbourg with parental roots mixed between France and Syria, he experienced a multi-cultural environment from childhood – as this French city is only three kilometres from Germany and remains strongly influenced by a mix of ethnicities and multiple languages (French, German and the Alsatian dialect).

Growing up in the Geneva region, he regularly crossed the French, Swiss and Italian borders, while keeping in close contact with Germany through school exchanges. After graduating from France’s prestigious ISAE SUPAERO institute with a master’s degree in aerospace engineering, he finalized this degree at Canada’s Polytechnique Montréal technological university.

“The experience in North America actually made me a true European: while being away from Europe, I took a step back and appreciated what I was missing – especially the diversity of language, cultures and the way of thinking,” Alouani concluded. “Coming back from Canada, I wanted to serve Europe, and it meant not being ‘closed up’ in a national company or programme. This is why I put all of my efforts into joining Airbus…and today, the people I work with in my office include not only French, German, Greek, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish nationalities, but also American, Canadian, Mexican and even Columbian!”

Airbus UAM plans year of building in 2023 ahead of CityAirbus NextGen first flight - Flightglobal,"Fri, 17 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mbGlnaHRnbG9iYWwuY29tL2Flcm9zcGFjZS9haXJidXMtdWFtLXBsYW5zLXllYXItb2YtYnVpbGRpbmctaW4tMjAyMy1haGVhZC1vZi1jaXR5YWlyYnVzLW5leHRnZW4tZmlyc3QtZmxpZ2h0LzE1MjEyMy5hcnRpY2xl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"“Our mantra this year is build, build, build,” says Balkiz Sarihan, head of Airbus urban air mobility (UAM). And while assembly of the first CityAirbus NextGen prototype is a core part of that effort, it also encompases construction of a wider operational ecosystem, test environment and regulatory landscape.

Perhaps the most visible element of that is the vehicle itself: parts for the first CityAirbus NextGen prototype are beginning to arrive at the manufacturer’s facility in Donauworth, Germany, ahead of final assembly activities starting later this year, to support a first flight in 2024.

“This year is all about assembly – literally the pieces are coming in,” says Sarihan.

Sarihan, briefing journalists on 15 February, said the electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft is on course to make its first flight – without a pilot on board – in 2024.

Development of the CityAirbus NextGen is being led by Airbus UAM – a separate Munich-based legal entity – but drawing on expertise elsewhere in the group.

Donauworth is home to Airbus Helicopters’ production line for its H135 and H145 light-twins, but is also serving as the final assembly and test base for the CityAirbus NextGen; the manufacturer last year broke ground on a dedicated test centre that will be built at the site.

All the suppliers for the programme have now been lined up, says Sarihan; the most recent addition – announced in January – is French firm Crouzet, which will provide the human-machine interface for the aircraft. Sarihan reveals little about what the pilot controls will look like, save to say there will be “a stick”.

Other suppliers include Spirit AeroSystems (wing), KLK (tail), and MagicAll (the electric propulsion units, or EPUs).

But Airbus UAM has also looked within the broader group for expertise: Airbus Defence & Space is providing the batteries, while Airbus Helicopters is developing the main fuselage and the aircraft’s eight propellers. “We are pulling in expertise from all these areas,” says Sarihan.

Although Airbus UAM is dedicated to the CityAirbus NextGen effort, it also serves as a technology development and testing house for “the benefit of the [Airbus] group”.

That includes distributed propulsion, full-electric flight, batteries themselves or “different kinds of propulsion as well, in addition to [battery] electrification”.

In this instance, that means hydrogen fuel cells, which will later be tested aboard a subsequent CityAirbus NextGen prototype.

Although many operating in the UAM space have brought the development of batteries in-house, Sarihan thinks in future this may become a more standardised technology across the industry.

“I think eventually there has to be co-operation on batteries, because everyone is chasing the same technology.”

Developers will be able to add value through the design of the battery packs the battery management systems, she says, but adds: “In the end, the cells are the cells – everybody’s using the same cells.”

Meanwhile, Airbus UAM continues working to shape the broader ecosystem in which the CityAirbus NextGen might operate. That includes the regulatory environment, pilot licensing requirements and operational use cases.

In collaboration with the Bavarian government and 28 other partners, Airbus UAM is to create an early test environment in the southern German state. This will see it establish vertiports in two locations – to be confirmed next year – from which it will operate a number of routes and missions to “test the interoperability of the system requirements”.

Airbus UAM sees medical services as a key early use case for the eVTOL aircraft – providing a societal benefit that could accelerate wider acceptance of the technology, Sarihan argues.

In addition, such services – “getting the right intervention, the right medication, the right person to the right place at the right time” – can be performed with the current CityAirbus NextGen design that features a three-passenger cabin and can operate from existing helipad infrastructure.

“Operators are saying to us ‘I don’t need you to replicate what I can do in my helicopter… I need you to give me something that is additive’,” she adds.

But for those eyeing air taxi operations, is a three-passenger cabin large enough to ensure profitability? Sarihan argues that it is simply “a starting point”.

“It’s not three passengers from a business case perspective, it is three passengers from a reasonable projection of technology readiness.

“The machine is scalable – it’s just the technology needs to reach our ambition.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998921155929565}",neutral,0.9998921155929565,0
