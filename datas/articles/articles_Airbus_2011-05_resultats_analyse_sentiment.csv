W.T.O. Ruling on Airbus Subsidies Upheld on Appeal - The New York Times,"Wed, 18 May 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMTEvMDUvMTkvYnVzaW5lc3MvZ2xvYmFsLzE5d3RvLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A World Trade Organization appeals panel on Wednesday upheld a ruling that Boeing lost market share to its European rival, Airbus, as a result of billions of dollars in low-cost government loans, according to European and American officials.

But the panel rejected claims by the United States that state financing for the Airbus A380 superjumbo jet was automatically prohibited under global trade rules, the officials said.

Appeals judges at the trade body, which is based in Geneva, concurred with the initial finding that loans extended to Airbus over the course of four decades did constitute unfair subsidies that had caused Boeing to lose aircraft sales.

But the ruling also appeared to upend what the Americans had considered one of the most crucial parts of the landmark case: namely, that the loans — known as launch aid — that Airbus received from Germany, Spain and Britain for the twin-deck A380 jets were expressly prohibited because governments expected a significant export market for the planes when they granted the support.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9819392561912537}",negative,0.9819392561912537,-1
Photo Blog: An Inside Look at Lufthansa’s Airbus A380 - Airline Reporter,"Wed, 11 May 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAxMS8wNS9hbi1pbnNpZGUtbG9vay1hdC1sdWZ0aGFuc2FzLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzgwL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Yesterday, San Francisco International Airport saw their first passenger carrying Airbus A380 arrive, operated by Lufthansa. Once all the passengers were able to de-plane and the aircraft was cleaned up (this was the first time that the SFO based cleaning crew cleaned up an A380), media and guests were able to take an inside look at one of Lufthansa’s seven Airbus A380’s.

I was excited, since this was my first time actually inside an A380. I had only seen one previously from the tarmac and of course I have viewed lots of photos, but there is nothing like getting inside the world’s largest commercial airliner.

Due to the A380’s size, there are three jetways options that passengers can board. Two are located on the bottom deck and one goes to the top. The tour started on the bottom where all 420 economy seats are located. Even though the bottom deck is long, but it doesn’t feel it, since it is broken up into individual sections. Every seat has their own in-flight entertainment system, adjustable headrest and ample legroom. Sitting in the seat, I was plenty comfortable for the three minutes I was there. Not too sure how my 6’1″, 250lbs frame would handle 11 hours if I had someone sitting next to me.

On a longer flight, I would prefer to head up top where you can find 98 Business Class and eight First Class seats. One of the first things I noticed were all the seats on the aircraft were cloth. In most Business and First Class areas, one is more likely to find leather. This didn’t make the seats any less comfortable and most likely would reduce sliding when converted into a bed.

While up on the second deck, I had a chance to sit down and take a look out the window. The Airbus A380 has one frek’n big wing. These large wings have 54% more surface area over a Boeing 747-400 and you can tell.

The new Lufthansa First Class on the A380 was quite impressive. Each person has their own area, with large screen and fold down bed. The walls were covered in suede (or fake suede) and extra sound deadening is used to keep the sound to a minimum. The First Class cabin also has access to two very large lavatories. We are talking full sitting couch and vanity. If you ever wanted to join the mile-high club, this would be the place to do it — even all that extra sound deadening might help. From forks to roses, Lufthansa’s catering crew loads on 40,000 items for just the First Class passengers alone (yes, 40,000). That just goes to show the level of service that flying First Class provides.

One thing you will find missing in the first class section are overhead bins — they are missing. Instead each seat has a storage area where passengers can store their belongings. This really adds a sense of upward space and makes the First Class cabin that much more comfortable. Even though the Business and First Class areas are what you might expect, it just doesn’t feel as exclusive on the top deck of the A380 versus the smaller top deck of the Boeing 747-400.

Although the A380 looks impressive pulling up to the gate, it is missing some of the grace that the Boeing 747-8 Intercontinental has in my opinion. The Airbus A380’s job is not to win any beauty contests, but to provide airlines with an economical way to move a lot of people in style and it does just that. After my tour of an A380 I am super pumped to get a ride in one and hope to write up a trip report soon.

For those of you who have flown in an Airbus A380 what have been your impressions?

"Airbus A380 Jets May Soon Carry 1,000 Passengers - Fox News","Wed, 25 May 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveG5ld3MuY29tL3RyYXZlbC9haXJidXMtYTM4MC1qZXRzLW1heS1zb29uLWNhcnJ5LTEwMDAtcGFzc2VuZ2Vyc9IBUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveG5ld3MuY29tL3RyYXZlbC9haXJidXMtYTM4MC1qZXRzLW1heS1zb29uLWNhcnJ5LTEwMDAtcGFzc2VuZ2Vycy5hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It's either your worst nightmare or a dream come true: The new Airbus A380's may soon have capacity for 1,000 passengers, the Australian Business Traveler reports.



While the idea of what is being dubbed a ""super cattle-class"" plane may cause claustrophobes to breathe in just a bit deeper, those who love to fly may soon be heralding inventive design in a future class of airplanes.



This past weekend, Singapore Airlines ordered airplanes that would fit 407 passengers, which isn't entirely crazy considering Korean Air already flies a plane with seats for 409 people (see photo at left).



The Australian Business Traveler predicts that Qantas will soon have an A380 that can fit 497 passengers.



But the real whopper?



French airline Air Austral has ordered up planes from Airbus with room for 840 people, with plans to debut the jets in 2014. And Lufthansa and Air France are already eyeing the next generation of A380s, the A380-1000, which would have a passenger capacity of 1,000.



Australian newssite news.com reports that Richard Branson, the boss of the Virgin Airlines conglomerate, has already stated his preference a for longer, packed A380, coming in at 900 people, saying ""Ideally, we'd like Airbus to stretch them because for the A380 to be really competitive it needs to be even bigger than it currently is.""

"Airbus, Air France welcome second black box recovery from 2009 crash - New York Post","Tue, 03 May 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDExLzA1LzAzL2FpcmJ1cy1haXItZnJhbmNlLXdlbGNvbWUtc2Vjb25kLWJsYWNrLWJveC1yZWNvdmVyeS1mcm9tLTIwMDktY3Jhc2gv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — The chief executives of Air France-KLM and Airbus welcomed Tuesday the recovery of the two flight recorders from the submerged wreck of an Air France flight that plunged into the Atlantic Ocean in June 2009, saying they hoped that the data was usable and would enable investigators to determine the cause of the accident.

The French aviation accident investigation bureau said that a search effort retrieved Tuesday the cockpit voice recorder, also known as a black box, from the wreck of the Airbus A330 plane, in which all 228 passengers and crew lost their lives. A remote-controlled submersible vehicle brought the plane’s flight data recorder to the surface Sunday.

“We are excited by the news, and we hope that the data is still readable,” Airbus CEO Tom Enders said in a statement. “Only this will contribute to understanding the events that led to the accident. We are pleased that over the last two years, we have pushed to continue the investigation and the search, no matter what the cost and efforts.”

Air France CEO Pierre-Henri Gourgeon called the recovery of the second recorder “another decisive step forward in the inquiry.” Gourgeon said in a statement that he hoped that the data from the recorders “may be used and provide answers to questions that relatives of the victims, Air France and the entire airline industry have been asking for nearly two years about why this tragic accident occurred.”

Investigators suspect that faulty air-speed sensors might have been a contributing factor in the crash of the plane en route to Paris from Rio de Janeiro on June 1, 2009, but without data from the flight recorders, it was impossible to determine the exact cause of the incident.

Both Air France and Airbus were cited in lawsuits accusing them of manslaughter for not having responded quickly enough to reports that the air-speed probes were giving inaccurate readings.

The two companies paid the estimated €9 million ($13.3 million) cost of the latest mid-Atlantic search effort.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9960922598838806}",neutral,0.9960922598838806,0

Airbus forced into emergency landing in Singapore - The Guardian,"Mon, 16 May 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDExL21heS8xNi9haXJidXMtZW1lcmdlbmN5LWxhbmRpbmctc2luZ2Fwb3Jl0gFTaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMTEvbWF5LzE2L2FpcmJ1cy1lbWVyZ2VuY3ktbGFuZGluZy1zaW5nYXBvcmU?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The engine of a Cathay Pacific Airbus A330-300 has caught fire in mid-air, forcing the plane to make an emergency landing in Singapore.

Flight CX715 took off from Singapore heading to the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, at 1.12am on Monday, but turned around after engine trouble and landed at 1.57am, Singapore's Changi airport said in a statement.

Firefighters extinguished the flames and normal flight operations resumed on the runway about an hour later, the airport said.

It was the second time in six months an Airbus had to make an emergency landing in Singapore because of engine problems. A Qantas A380 turned around shortly after takeoff on 4 November when one of its Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines disintegrated.

The airport would not say how many passengers were on board the flight or what kind of engines the plane used. A spokesman for Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific was not available for comment.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9463998079299927}",negative,0.9463998079299927,-1
SFO to welcome first scheduled A380 flight - CNET,"Mon, 09 May 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuZXQuY29tL3NjaWVuY2Uvc2ZvLXRvLXdlbGNvbWUtZmlyc3Qtc2NoZWR1bGVkLWEzODAtZmxpZ2h0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Update (Tuesday, 1:12 p.m. PDT): Lufthansa's A380 has landed at San Francisco International Airport, making the airline the first to offer regular service of the world's-largest passenger plane to SFO. But Air France is said to be ready to begin its own A380 service here on June 8.

Though I mostly write about cell phones at CNET, you may have noticed that I'm rather passionate--some would say obsessed--over commercial aviation. I was lucky enough to attend the first flights of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and 747-8, so I jumped at the chance to witness the arrival of the first Airbus A380 flight to San Francisco International Airport (SFO).

Lufthansa will begin operating its daily flight from Frankfurt tomorrow with the world's largest commercial airplane. The A380, which will replace the Boeing 747-400 on the route, will transport up to 526 passengers in three service classes on two levels. The flight time will be about the same (a little more than 11 hours), but the sight of the huge plane landing over the San Francisco Bay will be a win for the entire region.

SFO will be Lufthansa's second A380 U.S. destination (after New York's JFK) and only the third airport in the country to get daily A380 service. Qantas flies the plane every day to Los Angeles International Airport from Sydney, and Lufthansa, Air France, and Emirates regularly serve JFK, but San Francisco beat out heavy hitters like Chicago, Houston, and Miami (the latter will start A380 flights on June 10) for the bronze medal.

Though Lufthansa and SFO will point to San Francisco's popularity with business and leisure travelers, the airport was the first in the nation to be able to accommodate the airplane (LAX, for example, had to reposition taxiways and a runway to make room for the immense 261-foot wingspan). What's more, SFO's decade-old International Terminal was specifically designed to accommodate the double-decker aircraft with jetways that could board each deck simultaneously. SFO first hosted the A380 on a ""working visit"" back in 2007, but this will be your first chance to actually buy a ticket.

The flight arrives at 12:05 p.m. PT. It then spends a few hours on the ground before heading back to Germany. I'll be on hand with CNET's Daniel Terdiman to witness the arrival and then crawl through all areas of the cabin, from the high-tech cockpit to the posh first class (check out SeatGuru.com for the complete seat map). Hopefully we'll get to walk under the airplane as well to capture its immense size--that alone has caused problems at the world's airports as this recent incident at JFK demonstrated--but expect lots of photos and maybe some video in any case.

Until then, though, I'll be on the edge of my seat in anticipation.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999953508377075}",neutral,0.9999953508377075,0
Airbus to partner Indian firms for Offshore Centre - Business Standard,"Mon, 30 May 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzLXN0YW5kYXJkLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2NvbXBhbmllcy9haXJidXMtdG8tcGFydG5lci1pbmRpYW4tZmlybXMtZm9yLW9mZnNob3JlLWNlbnRyZS0xMTEwNTMwMDAwNDlfMS5odG1s0gF-aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3Mtc3RhbmRhcmQuY29tL2FtcC9hcnRpY2xlL2NvbXBhbmllcy9haXJidXMtdG8tcGFydG5lci1pbmRpYW4tZmlybXMtZm9yLW9mZnNob3JlLWNlbnRyZS0xMTEwNTMwMDAwNDlfMS5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"To improve offshoring capability and to build a strong engineering talent pool in India, Airbus is set to start an ODC (Offshore Development Centre) model. This is being tried by it for the first time anywhere in the world.

The ODC model includes a commitment by Airbus to partner with Indian suppliers, handhold them in training and execution, and depute technical managers to manage these ODCs until they reach a level of maturity. This process may take at least two years for each such unit.

As a part of this process, Airbus has selected Bangalore-headquartered CADES as their ODC partner for fuselage design activities.

Said S Ravi Narayanan, chairman & CEO of CADES: “It is a great honour not only to us but to the entire Indian engineering community. We would do our best to utilise the opportunity and model to create a world class aerostructure design eco-system with the help of Airbus,” he added.

According to industry analysts, Airbus outsources nearly $3 billion worth of work to global suppliers annually, but the cumulative value of orders obtained by Indian companies put together are less than three per cent of this.

“The reasons being inability of Indian companies to climb up the aerospace engineering value chain and to provide total solutions.

Global companies like Assystem, Ferchau, Altran and AKKA receive and execute close to $2 billion worth of engineering services every year for Airbus, while four Indian companies — Infosys, Mahindra Satyam, CADES and Quest — execute orders worth about $40 million between them for Airbus,” an industry analyst said.

According to industry estimates, there are less than 10,000 trained aerospace engineers in India and very few of them can do conceptual-evel or design authorisation, a must for high value contracts.

Airbus is a major player in the growth of Indian aviation. It also started an Airbus Engineering Center in India during 2006. Industry analysts say the fresh contract from Airbus can go up to as much as $300 million over a few years, based on the progress of the vendors.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9968288540840149}",neutral,0.9968288540840149,0

The first aircraft outfitted by Comlux America, an Airbus ACJ320 that features an outstandingly quiet cabin, is being displayed at the EBACE show in Geneva, allowing potential customers to see its unmatched comfort, space and freedom of movement at first hand.

With our origins in VVIP charter and aircraft management, we are uniquely well placed to understand and satisfy the cabin outfitting needs of private jet customers, says Comlux America President Ettore Rodaro. We can also take care of their cabin refurbishment and and maintenance needs via Comlux Aviation Services, which was previously known as Indyjet and which has around 30 years of experience, he adds

Comlux approval follows a complete audit of the company and its capabilities, allowing Airbus to recommend the company to its customers with confidence. Its intention is to outfit three to four private jets a year.

We now offer our corporate Jet customers a choice of nine Airbus-approved cabin-outfitters, giving them a wide choice of cabin completion options that will help them to get a great cabin to go with an outstanding aircraft, says Airbus Executive Vice President, Programmes, Tom Williams.

Growing the Airbus-approved VIP cabin outfitting network by adding companies such as Comlux America helps us to provide an efficient solution to increasing customer demand for turnkey solutions, as well as facilitating faster access to completion slots, adds Airbus Executive Vice President, Procurement, Klaus Richter.

Airbus offers the largest and most modern corporate jet family in the world, with aircraft that offer more space, more comfort and more freedom of movement than traditional business jets.

The family comprises the Airbus ACJ318, ACJ319 and ACJ320 and, for customers that want even more comfort, capacity and capability in range, VIP widebodies such as the ACJ330, ACJ340, ACJ350 and ACJ380.

(05-11) 11:10 PDT -- A decade-long dream became reality Tuesday when Lufthansa Flight 454 from Frankfurt touched down at San Francisco International Airport, kicking off SFO's first regularly scheduled daily service with the Airbus A380 - the world's largest passenger jetliner.

The event was significant for SFO, where prescient planners opened an International Terminal in December 2000 that was purpose-built to handle such huge airplanes of the future. The $1 billion terminal has four two-level gateways that allow massive double-decker planes to load and unload the two passenger decks simultaneously.

The build-it-and-they-will-come philosophy took 10 1/2 years to pay off, stalled by two deep recessions, 9/11 and the fact that there were no double-decker superjumbos actually flying until late 2007.

But that didn't seem to matter Tuesday as city and airport officials joined executives from Lufthansa and Airbus, the European company that builds the A380, at an International Terminal celebration. A plane-spotting party drew hundreds to Millbrae's Bayfront Park, while inside, balloons, a band and bullish predictions of more travel and commerce between the Bay Area, Germany and beyond filled the air.

The four-engine A380 is configured to haul 526 passengers. The second-largest passenger jetliner, the Boeing 747-400, typically carries 300 to 400 passengers.

Airline spokesman Martin Riecken said Lufthansa will operate a daily afternoon departure from SFO to Frankfurt and a morning arrival from Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital, through Oct. 31, the busy season. In winter, Lufthansa will swap the A380 for the Boeing 747.

Air France gets A380

On June 6, Air France also will begin service with the A380, which it plans to operate between SFO and Paris' Charles de Gaulle International Airport until Sept. 4, with an eye to redeploying the big plane in the summer of 2012.

""It's very exciting to have the A380 here,"" airport Director John Martin said. ""Our growth is coming chiefly in international travel, and the A380 is a perfect fit for that. We're up nearly 7 percent from last year in international passengers."" All told, Martin said, SFO has 97 percent of the international passengers among the three major Bay Area airports.

Not just Germany

San Francisco Travel Association President and CEO Joe D'Alessandro noted: ""Germany is a very important market for us. But this service will allow ease of travel not just to Germany but to the Middle East and South Asia, as well, through Frankfurt. Tourism is San Francisco's No. 1 industry, and one-third of our visitors are international arrivals.""

A cluster of Bay Area government and business leaders piled onto the inaugural A380 flight, which left Frankfurt International Airport Tuesday morning in warm, hazy sunshine. As they boarded, the high-fliers were serenaded by the recorded voice of Scott McKenzie warbling his 1967 hippie anthem ""San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair).""

Once airborne, the enormous plane - it weighs nearly 1.3 million pounds and stands as tall as a four-story building - impressed passengers with its relatively quiet jet engines, smooth ride, wired-to-the-max work and entertainment systems and all-around spaciousness, especially in business class.

5 airlines fly A380

Each of the five airlines now flying the A380 configures the aircraft to its own design. Lufthansa has installed 420 economy-class seats - all on the lower deck - and devoted the upper deck to eight sumptuous first-class seats and an unusually numerous 98 business-class seats.

This is, of course, by design. On board the aircraft during the inaugural flight, Lufthansa Chief Executive Officer Carsten Spohr told reporters the airline is wooing Bay Area business flyers because of the high-tech and venture capital executives in the region and the large number of Indian engineers in Silicon Valley who fly back and forth to India. Lufthansa, a profitable airline, competes for business to India out of SFO with prosperous Emirates and Singapore Airlines, both of which fly A380s on other routes, but not the Bay Area.

Lufthansa has 6

Spohr said Lufthansa flies six A380s to six destinations, including mega-markets such as Tokyo and New York, and expects to have 15 of the superjumbos in use by 2015.

""It is much quieter than other wide-body aircraft. It gives 15 percent more space for everybody,"" he said. ""It's a much less fuel-consuming aircraft. It's a much more efficient aircraft; it costs 30 percent less to operate than other wide bodies.""

The A380's modernity, comfort and stylishness should help drive business between the Bay Area and overseas markets, said R. Sean Randolph, president and CEO of the Bay Area Council Economic Institute. Randolph said he thinks this is especially true of the burgeoning business relationship with India, which generates high transpacific traffic.

The A380 should enable growth in all these areas, and drive up passengers numbers at SFO, which handles 39 million passengers a year. Said SFO's Martin: ""There will be more A380s down the road.""","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999969005584717}",neutral,0.9999969005584717,0
San Francisco Welcomes First West Coast Lufthansa Airbus A380 Flight - Airline Reporter,"Tue, 10 May 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAxMS8wNS9zYW4tZnJhbmNpc2NvLXdlbGNvbWVzLWZpcnN0LXdlc3QtY29hc3QtbHVmdGhhbnNhLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzgwLWZsaWdodC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Today was a beautiful day to fly down to San Francisco (SFO) to greet the Lufthansa’s first Airbus A380 passenger flight from Frankfurt, Germany to SFO.

The Airbus A380 is the largest passenger airliner made and it’s closest competitor will be the Boeing 747-8 Intercontinental, when it makes it to the market. I have been able to catch a glimpse of a Qantas Airbus A380 while in LAX, but this was my first time to get up close and personal. I do not think the A380 is as majestic as the Boeing 747, but she is very impressive for sure.

The event is a big deal for the airline and the city. San Francisco Mayor Edwin M. Lee has officially declared May 10, 2011, as “Lufthansa German Airlines Day.” Pretty cool when an airline gets an official city day. I am not sure it really means anything, but still neat.

The airport had to make very little updates to prepare for the A380, since the International Terminal was designed with the A380 in mind and it fit with no problems.

Lufthansa already has taken delivery of seven A380’s with an additional 15 on order.

As part of the event, we got a tour of the interior of the A380 and I will be posting that story tomorrow.

"EBACE: Airbus introduces new names, branding for corporate jets - Flightglobal","Mon, 16 May 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vZWJhY2UtYWlyYnVzLWludHJvZHVjZXMtbmV3LW5hbWVzLWJyYW5kaW5nLWZvci1jb3Jwb3JhdGUtamV0cy85OTg4Ni5hcnRpY2xl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has introduced new names, branding and colours for its corporate jets, in a move aimed at reflecting commonality throughout the family and the modernity of the jetliners.

The words ""Airbus ACJ"" will now precede the model of the airliner from which each corporate jet is derived, with the A318 Elite becoming the Airbus ACJ318; the A319 Corporate becoming the Airbus ACJ319; the A320 Prestige becoming the Airbus ACJ320 and so on throughout the family, including the forthcoming Airbus ACJ350 widebody.

The new colours comprise metallic-blue shading on most of the fuselage and tail, highlighted by flowing curves ""that echo the colour schemes often chosen by Airbus corporate jet customers"", and are accompanied by a new ""Airbus Corporate Jets"" logo, said Airbus.

News of the new branding scheme comes as Airbus gears up for its busiest-ever EBACE. ""Particularly this year, the show is going to be very, very big. We have more meetings set ahead of the show than we ever had,"" said Airbus Corporate Jets vice-president worldwide sales Francois Chazelle.

Europe and the Middle East have traditionally been strong markets for Airbus's corporate jet sales. Fly Comlux, for instance, has placed a new ACJ320 into VIP charter operations from its new base in Bahrain, called Comlux Middle East. But Russia and China are emerging as growth markets, said Chazelle.

Airbus has also fielded some interest for an ACJ321. ""The ACJ321 with sharklets will be very interesting as a [Boeing] 757 replacement, as on the commercial side,"" said Chazelle, who noted that in addition to improved efficiency, the ""visual effect"" of adding sharklets is particularly appealing to customers. ""Expect to see some [sharklets] on the business jet side in 2013,"" he added.

Air France flight stalled before plunging into Atlantic - Yahoo Singapore News,"Fri, 27 May 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vc2cubmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vYWlyLWZyYW5jZS1waWxvdHMtZmxldy1ibGluZC1wbHVuZ2luZy1vY2Vhbi0xNDE0MjE1MjcuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Air France pilots lost vital speed data and their Airbus A330 stalled, beginning a fatal three minute plunge into the Atlantic in June 2009 with 228 people aboard, the BEA aviation safety agency said Friday. ""We have no valid indications,"" one of the pilots of flight AF447 from Rio to Paris said, according to information from the flight data recorders released by the French Bureau of Inquiry and Analysis (BEA). The aircraft had entered a zone of turbulence two hours into the flight when the autopilot suddenly disengaged. Shortly thereafter one instrument showed ""a sharp fall"" in airspeed and a stall warning sounded, indicating the plane was no longer being lifted by the air pushing under the wings. As the two co-pilots struggled to understand what had happened the captain, who had left the cockpit to take a rest, returned but did not retake control of the plane. The agency said the plane's engines were working normally and responded to commands. An interim inquiry, conducted prior to the raising of the data recorders from the ocean floor earlier this month, had pointed to an icing problem with the probes measuring air speed but there was no definitive conclusion as to the cause of the crash. According to several experts, the deactivation of the autopilot could have caused by the icing up of the air speed probes, known as Pitots. Low airspeed data can cause the airplane's computer system to reject as invalid other readings, according to the BEA. Pilot's unions and some of the victims' families have accused the airline of reacting too slowly to safety warnings but both Airbus and Air France insist they reacted properly. Since the accident, Air France has replaced the Pitots on its Airbus fleet with a newer model. Both companies are being probed for alleged manslaughter in connection with the crash. Airbus said the information released Friday was consistent with the BEA's preliminary and interim reports and ""constitutes a significant step towards the identification of the complete chain of events"" that led to the crash. Air France Friday called for waiting for the BEA's further analysis of the data to determine the precise cause of the crash, although it said it appears ""that the initial problem was the failure of the speed probes"". It praised the ""three skilled pilots"" who ""demonstrated a totally professional attitude and were committed to carrying out their task to the very end"". However a source familiar with the investigation was puzzled by the reaction of the pilots. ""Why, when getting the stall signal, did the pilots pull the (aircraft nose) up and not push it down?"" A retired pilot, Jack Krine, told AFP that in a stall the normal procedure would be to push the plane's nose down in order to regain speed and lift, adding that they may not have had enough time to analyse the situation properly. According to the chronology provided by the BEA, the responses by the co-pilot flying the aircraft ""were mainly nose-up"" and the aircraft initially gained altitude. ""The trimmable horizontal stabilizer (THS) passed from 3 to 13 degrees nose-up in about 1 minute and remained in the latter position until the end of the flight,"" said the BEA report said. The last data on the recorder showed that the plane's nose was up at a sharp angle as it plunged into the sea at 10,912 feet (3,300 metres) per minute.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.5911876559257507}",negative,0.5911876559257507,-1

Search teams recovered the memory unit of one of the “black boxes” of the Air France Rio-Paris plane that crashed in the Atlantic in June 2009, investigators said Sunday. The crash had killed all 228 people on board.

AP - Investigators have located and recovered the missing memory unit of the flight data recorder of a 2009 Air France flight - a remarkable deep-sea discovery they hope will explain why the aircraft went down in a remote area of the mid-Atlantic, killing all 228 people on board.

France’s air accident investigation agency BEA said a search by a submarine probing 3,900 meters (12,800 feet) below the ocean’s surface located and recovered the unit Sunday morning. The unit is now aboard the Ile de Sein, a ship that’s helping conduct the probe, the statement said.

The statement also included photos of the recorder - a red cylinder partially buried in sand on the sea floor. Judging from the photos, the unit appeared to be in good condition.

Still, BEA officials have warned that the recordings may yet prove unusable, considering the pressure they were subjected to for nearly two years.

“We can’t say in advance that we’re going to be able to read it until it’s been opened,” a BEA spokeswoman told The Associated Press in a telephone interview. She did not give her name in accordance with her agency’s policy.

Last month, the agency said the undersea search had identified the “chassis” that had held the recorder, but the memory unit was still missing. Detached from the chassis, the memory unit was found nearby, the spokeswoman said.

The flight data recorder stores technical data from the flight. Another so-called “black box” records cockpit conversations. The second black box has not yet been found, but the submarine probes were continuing, the spokeswoman said.

Investigators hope Sunday’s remarkable discovery will allow them to determine what caused the June 1, 2009 crash of Flight 447 from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to the French capital, Paris. The aircraft slammed into the Atlantic northeast of Brazil after running into an intense high-altitude thunderstorm.

Automatic messages sent by the Airbus 330’s computers showed it was receiving false air speed readings from sensors known as pitot tubes. Investigators have said the crash was likely caused by a series of problems, and not just sensor error.

The crash site was so remote and in such a deep area of the Atlantic that two previous undersea operations failed to turn up the bulk of the wreckage. The latest search - the fourth - was targeting an area of about 3,900 square miles (10,000 square kilometers), several hundred miles off Brazil’s northeastern coast.

Searchers were using up to three autonomous underwater search vehicles, each of which can stay underwater for up to 20 hours while using sonar to scan a mountainous area known as the Mid-Ocean Ridge. Researchers download the data, and a vehicle with a high resolution camera is sent to check out an area if scientists see evidence of debris.

In early April, French officials said the operation had succeeded in finding most of the Airbus jet, including its motors. Bodies of some of the victims were also discovered.

Determining the cause of the crash took on new importance in March, when a French judge filed preliminary manslaughter charges against Air France and planemaker Airbus.

Air France and Airbus are financing the estimated $12.5 million cost of the latest search effort, but the French government is to fund the retrieval effort. About $28 million has already been spent on the three previous searches for the jet’s wreckage.

Experts have said that without retrieving the voice and data recorders there would be almost no chance of determining what caused the crash - the worst disaster in Air France’s history.

Report details final minutes of doomed Rio-Paris flight - FRANCE 24 English,"Fri, 27 May 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyYW5jZTI0LmNvbS9lbi8yMDExMDUyNy1haXItZnJhbmNlLWZsaWdodC1yaW8tcGFyaXMtcGlsb3RzLWNyYXNoLWJyYXppbC1haXJidXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"AVIATION

An initial report by French investigators says the ill-fated Air France flight that crashed en route from Rio to Paris in June 2009 stalled before plunging from 38,000 feet into the Atlantic Ocean in less than four minutes.

Advertising Read more

French investigators revealed new details Friday about the final minutes inside the cockpit of Air France Flight 447, which crashed into the Atlantic Ocean in June 2009, killing all 228 people on board. The first reports of data obtained from the flight’s black box recordings offered no new information on the suspected malfunction of the speed sensors aboard the A330 Airbus, nor did it provide new insight into the possibility of human error.

The report showed that the aircraft’s autopilot mode was shut off around two hours after it took off from Rio de Janeiro’s Galeao Airport, and that soon after the crew took the controls they noticed the aircraft’s speed indicators were defective. Then the plane suddenly stalled before plunging into the ocean four minutes later.

Snatches of those final tragic minutes appear in the report. The text describes the pilots’ struggle to regain control of the plane and includes some of their conversation.

Rapid descent from 38,000 feet

The Air France flight had been encountering stormy weather in the mid-Atlantic when its problems began. Capt. Marc Dubois told his two co-pilots that they were experiencing a “little bit of turbulence” and that “we should find the same ahead”. He then told his two colleagues: “We’re in the cloud layer. Unfortunately, we can’t climb much,” before leaving the cockpit to rest.

Pilots on long-haul flights often take turns at the helm in order to remain alert. Dubois was called back to the cockpit by the co-pilots after they encountered trouble, but never took back the controls.

The plane quickly lost speed but continued to climb on one of the co-pilot’s orders, reaching an altitude of almost 38,000 feet (11,500 metres). According to Thierry Laffitte, a former Air France captain, such high altitude is uncommon, and was probably what led to the crash.

The aircraft stalled, then plunged toward the Atlantic at a speed of almost 11,000 feet (3,350 metres) per minute. The plane’s engines were operational and responding to crew commands.

“There was no reason for [the engines] to stop,” Laffitte said. “But at a certain moment the engines could no longer make the plane re-accelerate.”

In the last exchange between the crew, one co-pilot tells the other, “Go ahead, you have the controls,” after they simultaneously move their side-sticks.

Pitot tubes remain principal suspect

The investigators did not provide any new information about the pitot tubes - the plane's speed sensors, which previous probes have identified as the likely cause of the accident.

Ongoing search efforts, which have retrieved the flight recorders and some of the victims’ bodies, have so far failed to recover the pitot tubes.

A renewed focus on the actions of crew members has followed the report’s release, according to Patrick Smith, a US pilot and aviation expert. “Perhaps they did not react exactly as they should have,” Smith said. “But bear in mind they were dealing with equipment failures, degraded flight controls, stormy conditions and darkness.”

“It’s important to note that an accident is always the result of a chain of events,” Laffitte explained. He is convinced that blocked pitot tubes were the source of the flight’s problems. “The pitot tubes should never have malfunctioned. After that, we are faced with human decisions – humans who couldn’t, or did not know how to, find the right solution to the problem,” he said.

While investigators were pressured by the media to reveal the initial data from the flight recorders, a full report on the crash – with a more detailed transcript of the crew’s conversation – is not expected until next year.

Best Economy Seats on Emirates Airbus A380 [+Seat Map] - Executive Traveller,"Fri, 20 May 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4ZWN1dGl2ZXRyYXZlbGxlci5jb20vdGhlLWJlc3Qtc2VhdHMtaW4tZWNvbm9teS1jbGFzcy1vbi1lbWlyYXRlcy1haXJidXMtYTM4MNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Which is the best seat to pick in Economy class on Emirates' Airbus A380 superjumbo flying between Sydney and Dubai (or Sydney and Auckland)? Australian Business Traveller brings you the latest in our series revealing the best seats in the sky.

The airline with the most A380s in the world, Emirates plans to have a full 90 of the superjumbos flying via its Dubai mega-hub.

Emirates already has the biggest fleet of Airbus A380 superjumbos in the world, with one dedicated to the Dubai-Sydney-Auckland run and back. In Economy, it's one of the most comfortable options around if you're heading to Europe, and the touchscreen ICE entertainment system is one of the very best in the sky.

It's also a great (and comparatively very cheap) way to get from Sydney to Auckland in comfort and with proper service.

An A380 with full meal service and top-class entertainment systems beats Qantas' rickety, squashed Boeing 737-400s, Air New Zealand's supremely irritating safety videos and low-cost carrier fare system, or Jetstar's squashed high-density cabin hands-down.

From Emirates' mega-hub in Dubai, Australian passengers for Europe and the Middle East destinations can connect on A380s to London Heathrow, Paris, Manchester and Jeddah -- as well as other destinations on smaller planes.

The airline also uses A380s on flights to Bangkok, Beijing, Hong Kong, Johannesburg, Seoul, Shanghai and Toronto.

The Economy Class cabin

Economy stretches along the entire main deck of the A380, in a 3-4-3 configuration. That means there are three seats (A, B and C) by the left window, four in the middle (D, E, F and G), and three by the right window (H, J and K).

The smallest (and therefore quietest) section is down the back between rows 80 and 88, with the next smallest at the front between rows 43 and 51. (That section has more seats in the middle, though it's still 8 rows long. Two longer sections from rows 52-66 and 67-79 are in the middle of the plane.

In general, it's a remarkably good plane for economy seating. But if you like to look out of the window, skip window seats between rows 52 and 72, where the wings are.

The best seats on the plane

The best economy seats on Emirates A380 are rows 68 and 81 seats A and K because of the ample leg room, abundant storage space, and a good chance that the middle seat will be empty. In general, we recommend sitting further forward rather than to the back of the aircraft because there's less engine noise and you're faster off the plane. However, if those seats are unavailable, read on to discover our top economy seat choices on Emirates Airbus A380.

(You may find it more useful to open the seat map in a separate window.)

68A 68K 81A 81K: these window seats aren't at the front of each section, so you might not notice them on the seat map, but there's no seat in front of them. So they've got heaps of legroom, and since the middle seat next to them isn't an exit row there's a greater likelihood of it being empty.

67B 67C 67J 67K 80B 80C 80J 80K: aisle + middle exit row seat pairs, these are unusual because there's no window seat next to them. The B seat is particularly good for a bit of extra elbow room.

41A 41B 41C 41H 41J 41K: sets of three exit row seats at the very front of the plane, these will have extra legroom, and there's no middle block of seats in this section, meaning it is likely to be quieter.

52A 52B 52C 52H 52J 52K: these bulkhead seats in sets of three by the windows on either side are at the start of the second cabin, so there'll be nobody reclining into your space. Bear in mind that they're bassinet crib positions so you may be moved to make space for an infant, which may also make noise of its own.

Seats D E F G in rows 45, 54, 67 and 82: if the other seats we recommend aren't available, consider one of these bulkhead seats at the front of the middle block of four seats, where nobody will be reclining into you. Again, they are bassinet crib positions too, so the usual caveats of being moved and noisy babies apply.

The worst seats on the plane

There aren't actually that many worst seats on this plane with reduced legroom or recline, or which are worse than any other rows for seating reasons.

You might want to avoid rows 44-45, 64-66 and 86-88 because they're close to lavatories, or seats at the back of any section because they're close to either loos or the galley kitchens. But overall, it's a consistent experience no matter where you are on the plane.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998608827590942}",neutral,0.9998608827590942,0
Qantas Airbus A380 inflight engine failure - Australian Transport Safety Bureau,"Wed, 18 May 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF0c2IuZ292LmF1L21lZGlhL25ld3MtaXRlbXMvMjAxMi9xYW50YXMtYWlyYnVzLWEzODAtc2luZ2Fwb3Jl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The ATSB is investigating an occurrence involving a Qantas A380 aircraft that experienced an uncontained engine failure over Batam Island, Indonesia on 4 November 2010. The aircraft landed safely in Singapore having returned with the aircraft's No 2 engine shut down. There were no injuries.

Update 19 January 2012

The investigation team is being led by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB). With the assistance of accredited representatives from the Bureau d'Enquêtes et d'Analyses (BEA), the Air Accidents Investigation Branch of the United Kingdom (UK AAIB), the Air Accident Investigation Bureau of Singapore (AAIB Singapore), the National Transportation Safety Committee of Indonesia (NTSC), and advisors to those investigation bodies including Rolls-Royce, Airbus, SAFRAN Sagem, Honeywell (USA and UK), Aerolec UK and Singapore Aero Engine Services Private Limited, the data gathering phase of the investigation is complete and the team has commenced analysing that data.

During the period July to August 2011, accredited representatives from the BEA and UK AAIB and advisors from Airbus met with ATSB investigators in Canberra, Australia to ratify relevant A380 technical data in respect of the structural and systems damage sustained by the aircraft as a result of the uncontained engine failure. The examination of relevant Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engine data and a number of engine manufacturing processes is nearing completion.

The ATSB has met with Rolls-Royce and Qantas Airways to update those parties on the progress of the investigation. In accordance with international protocol and ATSB policy and procedures, those and other relevant stakeholders will be involved in the development of the investigation findings and final report.

In conjunction with the UK AAIB and Rolls-Royce, the ATSB is continuing its examination of the circumstances and missed opportunities with the potential to have detected the reduced wall thickness and offset counter bore of the oil feed pipe prior to, during and after the manufacture of the module 51 assemblies. The ATSB has also reviewed the quality audits undertaken, and quality assurance system affecting the module 51 design and manufacturing process, and their effectiveness in detecting deficiencies in that process.

In the interim, Rolls-Royce has conducted a number of major internal investigations into its processes including the:

manufacture of oil pipes with reduced wall thickness

management of retrospective concessions of manufactured components

failure mode, effects and criticality analysis (FMECA) of previous component failures.

As a result of those investigations, Rolls-Royce has:

revised procedures for new structures that include feature verification and risk assessment during the design and manufacture process

introduced a revised, standalone procedure with appropriate supporting training to better manage the application of retrospective manufacturing concessions

revised its FMECA procedures to provide 'best practice' numerical justification for any assumptions made.

The investigation will monitor the progress of those initiatives.

Aircraft response to the disc failure

The examination of airframe and systems damage that resulted from the engine disc burst has been completed. That examination did not reveal any significant or critical safety issues.

The continuing repair of the aircraft in Singapore has allowed the examination of relevant removed/replaced aircraft components at the ATSB's technical facilities in Canberra. Those components have included a number of wiring looms, elements of the aircraft's airframe and a number of sub-components.

Airbus proactive safety action

As part of its ongoing examination of this event, Airbus has commenced working with a number of airport and rescue and firefighting agencies to develop an agreed safe means for those agencies to externally shut down engines on Airbus aircraft - as became necessary in this case. Any agreed procedures will be incorporated in the Airbus Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting Chart and be made available to airports and fire crews on line in document and poster form.

Ongoing investigation activities

The investigation is continuing and has progressed to the analysis of the large amount of complex factual information that has been gathered during the investigation. The drafting of the investigation report has commenced and will include extensive liaison with domestic and international stakeholders. In accordance with international protocol, that will include a 60-day consultation period for international parties to the investigation.

The final report is anticipated for public release in the third quarter of 2012.

The information contained in this web update is released in accordance with section 25 of the Transport Safety Investigation Act 2003 and is derived from the initial investigation of the occurrence. Readers are cautioned that new evidence will become available as the investigation progresses that will enhance the ATSB's understanding of the accident as outlined in this web update. As such, no analysis or findings are included in this update.

Update 3.00pm - 18 May 2011

An interim ATSB investigation report has confirmed the sequence of events that led to the 4 November 2010 uncontained engine failure on board a Qantas A380 aircraft over Batam Island, Indonesia.

The investigation team has inspected the damaged engine and components and determined the sequence of events that led to the failure of the engine disc.

The investigation is also examining the airframe and systems damage that resulted from the engine disc burst to understand its effect on those systems and the impact on flight safety. That includes their effect on the aircraft's handling and performance and on crew workload. A flight simulator program was used to conduct a number of tests in a certified A380 flight simulator. Analysis of the flight simulation test data is ongoing.

The investigation is continuing.

Interim-factual report AO-2010-089

Media release: 18 May 2011

Update 3.30pm - 23 December 2010

The ATSB investigation into the in-flight uncontained engine failure that occurred over Batam Island, Indonesia on 4 November 2010 is continuing. Two ATSB investigators have recently returned to Australia from meetings with the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), Rolls-Royce plc and Airbus. During these meetings the progress and findings of the investigation to date were reviewed and the scope of the ongoing investigation discussed.

In the United Kingdom (UK), Rolls-Royce plc is continuing the examination of the engine HP/IP structures at their facility in Derby, under the supervision of the UK Air Accident Investigations Branch. Rolls-Royce plc is also working with European airworthiness authorities to facilitate the return to service of all affected A380 aircraft.

Work to characterise the oil feed pipe fracture surfaces has identified that the location of the fatigue fracture appears to be associated with the thinnest pipe wall section, consistent with the previously-identified counter-bore eccentricity.

Since early in the investigation, an inspection regime has been in place to detect any abnormal leakages in key parts of Trent 900 engines. Based on recent engine inspections, manufacturing data and stress analysis work, Rolls-Royce plc has revised the threshold for inspection and the intervals at which inspection should be completed.

These revised inspection requirements were mandated through the 21 December 2010 EASA Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2010-0242R1. A copy of the AD is available at: http://ad.easa.europa.eu/ad/2010-0242R1

The ATSB will continue to report significant progress in the investigation as information comes to hand.

Update 3.30pm - 8 December 2010

Results from safety inspections of engines

On 2 December 2010, the ATSB issued a safety recommendation that identified a potential manufacturing defect with an oil tube connection to the high-pressure (HP)/intermediate pressure (IP) bearing structure of the Trent 900 engine installed in some A380 aircraft.

As a result of the safety recommendation, Rolls-Royce plc immediately issued revision 1 to the non-modification service bulletin (NMSB) 72-G595 incorporating assessment and engine rejection criteria for the measurement of potential oil feed stub pipe counter-bore misalignment, and a tightening of the compliance time frame from 20 to 2 flight cycles.

Since the issue of that bulletin, 45 Trent 900 engines have been inspected, and of those engines:

29 engines were installed on operating aircraft

8 engines were not installed on aircraft

4 engines were due to be delivered on a new aircraft

4 engines were on a flight test aircraft.

Three engines failed the inspection and were removed from service for further examination. All Qantas aircraft engines currently flying had no defects recorded and remain in service.

In addition, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) approved software updates to the Rolls-Royce plc change to the engine electronic control system has now been incorporated in all operating aircraft. The software upgrade predicts intermediate turbine overspeed events and shuts the engine down before a turbine disc failure occurs.

Update 10.30am - 3 December 2010

Manufacturing problem potential factor in QF32 engine failure

In a preliminary investigation report released today, the ATSB outlines safety actions that have already been taken in response to an uncontained engine failure on board a Qantas A380 aircraft over Batam Island, Indonesia on 4 November 2010.

""The investigation highlights Australian and international cooperation in the interests of aviation safety,"" said the ATSB's Chief Commissioner, Martin Dolan. ""The ATSB is the lead investigator, but many others are involved and their cooperation has been essential"".

""We're still in the early stages of investigation,"" Mr Dolan added, ""but significant action has already been taken to minimise the risk of a recurrence"". Full media release more...

Update 1.00pm - 2 December 2010

Manufacturing problem potential factor in QF32 engine failure

The ATSB has issued a safety recommendation about potential engine problems in some Airbus A380 aircraft.

The safety recommendation identifies a potential manufacturing defect with an oil tube connection to the high-pressure (HP)/intermediate-pressure (IP) bearing structure of the Trent 900 engine installed in some A380 aircraft.

The problem relates to the potential for misaligned oil pipe counter-boring, which could lead to fatigue cracking, oil leakage and potential engine failure from an oil fire within the HP/IP bearing buffer space.

In response to the recommendation Rolls Royce, affected airlines and safety regulators are taking action to ensure the continued safe operation of A380 aircraft. The action involves the close inspection of affected engines and the removal from service of any engine which displays the suspected counter-boring problem.

The ATSB will hold a media briefing tomorrow (Friday 3 December 2010) at 10.30am to accompany the release of its preliminary factual investigation report into the QF32 occurrence. ATSB Chief Commissioner Mr Martin Dolan will present the known facts gathered from the investigation and highlight the key safety issues that have resulted from the investigation to date.

The full safety recommendation is available via the ATSB website at AO-2010-089.

Update 11.00am - 1 December 2010

Media Briefing

On Friday 3 December 2010, the ATSB will hold a media briefing to accompany the release of its preliminary factual investigation report into the 4 November 2010 engine failure onboard Qantas Flight QF32 over Batam Island, Indonesia.

Update 4.40 pm - 22 November 2010

Engine examination

ATSB investigators examining the engine in Singapore are expected to return to Australia on Wednesday 24 November. The parts of interest from the failed No 2 engine have been removed. This includes the Low Pressure Turbine (Figure 1) module and the Intermediate Turbine module and drive shaft. The Intermediate Pressure components have been photographed and are being shipped to Rolls-Royce in the UK for detailed examination by Rolls-Royce, under the supervision of the UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch.

Figure 1: Low Pressure Turbine module removed from the No 2 engine

Aircraft examination

The examination of the aircraft damage is continuing with a focus on the hydraulic, mechanical and electrical systems affected by debris strikes. ATSB investigators involved in this examination are expected to return to Australia on Friday 26 November.

On-going investigation activities

The ATSB is continuing to analyse the recorded data recovered from the aircraft systems.

The next update on this investigation will coincide with the release of the preliminary factual report on 3 December 2010.

Update 4.00 pm - 17 November 2010

Engine examination

The No 2 engine has been successfully removed from the aircraft in Singapore (Figure 1), and is being progressively dismantled in a local engine workshop. The Low Pressure Turbine module has been removed to allow access to the damaged Intermediate Pressure Turbine area for examination. The disassembly and examination of the remainder of the engine should be completed by the end of this week.

The examination of the recovered No 2 engine turbine disk segment at the Rolls-Royce facility in Derby, United Kingdom has been completed. The two ATSB investigators who supervised that examination have returned to Australia. The ongoing examination of relevant No 2 engine components and of any material subsequently recovered from Batam Island, Indonesia will be carried out at the Rolls-Royce, Derby facility. This will be done under the supervision of investigators from the United Kingdom Air Accident Investigation Branch.

ATSB investigators will continue their oversight of activities in the United Kingdom in cooperation with the Rolls-Royce engineering staff in Derby, and with the supervising Air Accident Investigation Branch investigators.

Aircraft examination

The examination of the aircraft in Singapore is also continuing. A number of wing and body fairing panels have been removed from the aircraft to facilitate the examination of the underlying structure and systems affected by the engine failure.

This work is expected to continue for at least the remainder of this week.

Locating aircraft components

The search for the remaining engine debris on Batam Island, Indonesia was concluded by the Indonesian National Transportation Safety Committee and ATSB investigators on Saturday 13 November 2010. A number of small engine components were recovered during the search, including some turbine blades and blade attachments; however, other significant parts of the liberated No 2 turbine disk have not been located.

If anyone on Batam Island finds anything that resembles the remainder of the turbine disk or other engine components, they are requested to contact the local authorities.

On-going investigation activities

ATSB investigators are also reviewing:

the recorded Singapore Air Traffic Control radio and radar data

the flight and cabin crew interviews

the downloaded flight and other data from the aircraft.

Relevant information from these sources will be included in the ATSB preliminary factual report that is planned for public release by 3 December 2010.

Update: 4.00pm - 13 November 2010

Aircraft examination continuing

In Singapore, the No 2 engine has been successfully removed from the aircraft and is being prepared for transport to a local engineering facility for technical examination under ATSB supervision. The removal of the engine will also facilitate closer examination of the damage to the surrounding wing and other structures and systems.

Locating aircraft components

The search for the remaining engine and debris on Batam Island by the Indonesian National Transportation Safety Committee and ATSB investigators and local authorities is ongoing. After initial success, the search is becoming increasingly difficult as a result of the local terrain, which includes virgin jungle (Figure 1).

Figure 1: Indication of the some of the terrain on Batam Island

On board recorded flight and other data

The retrieval and analysis by ATSB investigators of the recorded flight, cockpit voice, engine monitoring and other data is continuing. The aircraft's 'black box' flight data and cockpit voice recorders were removed from the aircraft and returned to Australia immediately after the occurrence.

The aircraft's flight data recorder provided extensive flight and engine data, including from the entire occurrence flight (Figure 2). That data was forwarded to the aircraft and engine manufacturers through the relevant accredited representatives to allow a full understanding by the various parties of the event as the physical and other examinations were taking place.

Figure 2: Aircraft's flight data recorder

The cockpit voice recorder was transported to the ATSB's technical facilities in Canberra, Australia for download and analysis. Over 2 hours of cockpit audio was recovered. However, due to the failure of the No 1 engine to shutdown in Singapore, and therefore continuing power supply to the recorder, the audio at the time of the engine failure well over 2 hours before the No 1 engine could be shut down, was overwritten. That said, elements of the available audio are expected to be of assistance to the investigation.

Figure 3: Aircraft's cockpit voice recorder

A number of other data recorders, such as the aircraft's wireless quick access recorder have also been recovered by the ATSB for download (Figure 4). Those recorders offer a record of additional engine and other parameters to those recorded by the aircraft's flight data recorder. This information is particularly valuable in gaining a full understanding of this type of event, more specifically during the lead up to and during the engine failure.

Figure 4: Aircraft's wireless quick access recorder

Despite initial difficulties as a result of damage to the aircraft's electrical system, the ATSB, in collaboration with Airbus, Qantas, the Air Accident Investigation Bureau of Singapore and the aircraft condition monitoring system manufacturer, have successfully recovered all pertinent data. That data has been shared with Rolls-Royce and other participants in the investigation.

Conclusion

The integration, examination and analysis of the data from the various recorders is continuing, and will supplement the evidence obtained from the examination of the No 2 engine turbine disk segment at the Rolls-Royce facility in Derby, United Kingdom and the disassembled No 2 engine and damaged aircraft in Singapore.

Update: 6.55pm - 12 November 2010

Engine investigation

The examination under ATSB supervision of the No 2 engine turbine disk segment at the Rolls-Royce facility in Derby, United Kingdom is continuing. Boroscopic and other examination of the engine itself continues in Singapore.

EASA Airworthiness Directive (AD)

On 10 November 2010 (European time), the European Aviation Safety Agency issued EASA AD No: 2010-0236-E in respect of the operation of the Rolls-Royce PLC RB211 Trent 900 series engines. The airworthiness directive introduced a requirement for the periodic inspection of the high pressure/intermediate pressure engine structure for any abnormal oil leakage. If any discrepancy is identified, the further operation of that engine is prohibited.

The action by the European Aviation Safety Agency was based on a preliminary analysis of the circumstances of the engine failure by the European Aviation Safety Agency, which the agency said showed that an oil fire in the high pressure/low pressure structure cavity may have caused the failure of the intermediate pressure turbine disc.

Rolls-Royce announcement

This evening, Rolls-Royce announced that its own investigations had led it to draw two key conclusions:

'First, as previously announced, the issue is specific to the Trent 900. Second, the failure was confined to a specific component in the turbine area of the engine. This caused an oil fire, which led to the release of the intermediate pressure turbine disc.'

At this stage, the ATSB does not have enough information to comment on the first conclusion. The second conclusion is not inconsistent with the ATSB's work to date in Derby and Singapore. The ATSB supports any proactive safety action that is undertaken in response.

Ongoing ATSB investigation

The effort by the ATSB and investigation team to fully understand the nature and implications of the engine failure and its consequences is ongoing. The search for additional engine and other components on Batam Island, Indonesia enjoyed initial success, with the recovery of a small engine part. The search continues and it is hoped that additional large portions of the No 2 engine turbine disk will be located.

Preparations for the removal of the No 2 engine from the aircraft are nearing completion and it appears that the engine may be able to be removed from the aircraft somewhat earlier than initially planned. Once safely removed from the aircraft, the engine will be transported to a local engine repair facility for disassembly and technical examination under ATSB supervision.

In Australia, the flight crew interviews have been finalised and collated. Qantas has invited ATSB investigators to attend the cabin crew post-incident de-brief.

Update: 12.55pm - 12 November 2010

Locating aircraft components

ATSB investigators will arrive in Batam Island this morning to assist Indonesian National Transportation Safety Committee investigators search for the remaining engine and debris on Batam Island. The mapping of the damage to the aircraft is complete and has meant that the search will concentrate to the right of the aircraft's track (Figure 1). Assistance from the local authorities on Batam Island and a number of Rolls Royce staff is being coordinated by National Transportation Safety Committee investigators. Any recovered engine components will be forwarded to the Rolls Royce facility in Derby, United Kingdom for technical examination under ATSB supervision.

Aircraft examination continuing

Internal examination of the on-wing No 2 engine has been carried out via borescope and a specialist lifting cradle is en route to Singapore from Germany to facilitate the removal of the engine from the aircraft. That removal is planned for this weekend.

A number of electronic engine control and other components have been removed from the engine and sent to the Rolls Royce facility in Derby, United Kingdom for examination and possible recovery of recorded data.

Turbine disk examination

Technical examination of the sectioned No 2 engine turbine disk at the Rolls Royce facility in Derby, United Kingdom is ongoing. Additional areas of the disk are being sectioned before cleaning for closer examination. If located on Batam Island, the remainder of the turbine disk and other engine components will be subjected to similar examination.

Update: 2.50pm - 11 November 2010

Safety action in response to the engine failure

On 10 November 2010 (European time), the European Aviation Safety Agency issued airworthiness directive EASA AD No: 2010-0236-E in respect of the operation of the Rolls-Royce PLC RB211 Trent 900 series engines. The airworthiness directive introduces a requirement for the periodic inspection of the high pressure/intermediate pressure engine structure for any abnormal oil leakage. If any discrepancy is identified, the further operation of that engine is prohibited.

This action is based on a preliminary analysis of the circumstances of the engine failure by the European Aviation Safety Agency, which the agency says shows that an oil fire in the high pressure/low pressure structure cavity may have caused the failure of the intermediate pressure turbine disc.

While the investigation is ongoing, and may take some time to fully understand the nature and implications of the engine failure, the action by the European Aviation Safety Agency to issue AD No: 2010-0236-E represents proactive safety action to minimise risk. That safety action will be reflected in the ATSB preliminary factual report that will be released to the public no later than 3 December 2010.

A full copy of EASA AD: 2010-0236-E is available at: http://ad.easa.europa.eu/ad/2010-0236-E

Update: 10.15am - 11 November 2010

Flight crew interviews

ATSB investigators have completed their interviews of the flight crew, which began in Sydney yesterday, assisted by a senior Airbus A380 test pilot. The flight crew interviews have provided an understanding of the aircraft's performance during the emergency, the effect on the aircraft's systems during that time, and of the flight crew's actions to recover from the emergency. It is anticipated that the examination of the management of the emergency will identify valuable insights into the handling of future emergencies in the A380.

Aircraft examination continuing

Qantas engineers have developed a number of technical orders and work sheets to prepare for the removal of the No 2 engine from the aircraft. It is anticipated that the removal of the engine for disassembly and further examination will occur later in the week.The examination will take place in a Singapore engineering facility under ATSB supervision.

Locating aircraft components

The mapping of the damage to the aircraft is complete. It has been integrated with the relevant recorded flight data to localise the search for the remaining engine and other debris on Batam Island. The results of that integration are encouraging, markedly reducing the potential search area. Investigators from the Indonesian National Transportation Safety Committee are presently returning to Batam Island to coordinate the search with the authorities on the island. ATSB and Singapore Air Accident Investigation Bureau investigators will travel from Singapore to Batam Island to assist with the search.

Turbine disk examination

The initial technical examination of the recovered portion of the No 2 engine turbine disk at the Rolls Royce facility in Derby, United Kingdom has concluded. The disk will be sectioned into more manageable parts. The relevant surfaces and areas will be forensically 'cleaned' before anadditional, more detailed examination.

Failure of the No 1 engine to shut down after landing at Singapore

The ATSB is working with engineering advisors from Airbus, Rolls Royce, the European Aviation Safety Agency and other members of the investigation team to understand the nature and implications of the failure of the No 1 engine to shut down after landing.

Timeframe

The ATSB has begun planning for the release of a preliminary factual report via the ATSB website at www.atsb.gov.au by 3 December 2010. The investigation is anticipated to be completed within 1 year of the occurrence. However, should any critical safety issues emerge, the ATSB will immediately bring those issues to the attention of the relevant authorities or organisations and publish them as required.

Update: 4.50pm - 9 November 2010

Flight crew interviews

The ATSB today commenced interviews in Sydney with the flight crew, and are being assisted by an Airbus A380 test pilot. The flight crew interviews will provide an understanding of the aircraft's performance during the emergency, and of the flight crew's actions to recover from that emergency. The flight crew will also be able to advise what went well during their management of the emergency. This will provide highly useful safety lessons for managing similar incidents in the future.

Aircraft examination continuing

The aircraft has now been moved to a hangar at Changi Aerodrome. An initial internal examination of the No 2 engine has been carried out using a slender optical periscope (borescope). The engine is expected to be removed from the aircraft's wing for technical examination during the next few days.

Locating aircraft components

The ATSB has mapped the damage to the aircraft. This map is being used with relevant recorded flight data to localise the search on Batam Island for the remaining engine and other debris. The ATSB is working with the Indonesian Transportation Safety Committee and Batam Island authorities to recover those components. ATSB investigators are particularly interested in recovering the remainder of the fractured turbine disk. The ATSB advises Batam island residents to avoid handling any of the aircraft components due to potential health risks.

Turbine disk examination

ATSB investigators have arrived at the Rolls Royce facility in Derby, the United Kingdom to examine the recovered portion of the No 2 engine turbine disk. A copy of the recorded flight data has been provided to the engine and aircraft manufacturers by the respective accredited representatives. This will allow the manufacturers to assist with a full understanding of the data and its implications for the investigation.

An investigation of this complexity can take up to a year to complete. However, should any critical safety issues emerge, the ATSB will immediately bring those issues to the attention of the relevant authorities.

Update: 12.15pm - 8 November 2010

The portion of the recovered engine component has arrived in the United Kingdom under the ATSB's custody. The component is being transported to the engine manufacturer's premises in Derby for a detailed technical examination under ATSB supervision. That examination is planned to commence when additional ATSB technical expertise arrives in Derby on Tuesday 9 November 2010.

The examination of the aircraft in Singapore is continuing. This involves mapping the damage to the aircraft as a result of the uncontained engine failure. Once finalized, that damage map may assist the investigation, the Indonesian National Transportation Safety Committee and Batam Island authorities to localize the search for the remainder of the engine component on the island.

In addition, the No 2 engine and surrounds were prepared for the engine's removal from the aircraft. A comprehensive plan for that removal was developed with expert assistance from the engine and aircraft manufacturer members of the investigation team.

An Airbus A380 test pilot will arrive in Canberra today to assist Operations Group investigators. The Operations Group will examine the cockpit indications leading up to the engine failure, and the aircraft operational aspects of the failure and subsequent recovery to Singapore.

It is anticipated that interviews will take place with the flight crew in the next few days.

Update: 9.15am - 7 November 2010

The ATSB has requested any residents of Batam Island that might have recovered additional aircraft items, in particular similar to the portion of what looks like a geared disk at Figure 1, to forward those items to the local police for retention. The recovery of that disk could be crucial to a full understanding of the nature of the engine failure, and may have implications for the prevention of future similar occurrences.

The Indonesian Transportation Safety Committee has assisted the ATSB with the recovery of a number of items of debris from the QANTAS A380 aircraft that sustained an engine failure overhead Batam Island, Indonesia on Thursday, 4 November 2010. The recovered items arrived in Singapore on 6 November, and a portion of a recovered engine component has been prepared for on forwarding to the United Kingdom in the custody of the ATSB. On arrival in the United Kingdom, that item will be examined by the engine manufacturer and other expert parties under the supervision of ATSB investigators.

Additional ATSB investigators will depart Australia on 7 November 2010 for the United Kingdom to oversight the examination of the recovered engine component, and to Singapore to assist the in-place investigation team with the ongoing examination of the aircraft, and of the remaining debris that was recovered from Batam Island.

Figure 1: Portion of recovered turbine disk

At Changi International Airport, Singapore the damage to the aircraft as a result of the engine failure is being mapped by investigators in order to understand the nature of the uncontained engine failure, and the failed number two engine and surrounds is being readied for removal from the aircraft. Once removed from the aircraft, the engine will be transported to an appropriate engineering facility for disassembly and technical examination.

A highly-experienced and technically-qualified international team of accredited representatives and advisors has assembled in Singapore to assist the ATSB investigation. Those representatives and advisors are being overseen by the ATSB and include personnel from the aircraft and engine manufacturers, the aircraft operator, the United Kingdom Air Accident Investigation Branch, the Indonesian National Transportation Safety Committee, the Singapore Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau and the French Bureau d'Enquêtes et d'Analyses pour la sécurité de l'aviation civile (BEA). Personnel from those organizations and agencies can also be expected to partake in the examination of the recovered engine component in the United Kingdom.

The recorder was located late Monday night local time and retrieved early Tuesday morning by the Remora 6000, a US-built remotely operated vehicle (ROV). The discovery comes a day after the same team found and retrieved the airplane’s data recorder.

On June 1st, 2009, Air France Flight 447, an Airbus A330-200, was enroute to Paris Charles de Gaulle International Airport from Rio de Janeiro when it apparently plunged into the Atlantic roughly halfway between South America and Africa, killing all 228 people on board. The cause of the crash has been impossible to determine without the data and voice recorders, which were widely believed to have been unrecoverable due to the extremely deep seas in the area.

Photos of both recorders seemed to indicate that they were relatively intact, but it is not yet known if the data is still recoverable. The intense pressures and temperatures of such depths, as well as the long time elapsed, are well beyond those the recorders were designed to withstand.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9996181726455688}",neutral,0.9996181726455688,0
Investigators Successfully Recover All Data from Air France Flight 447 Recorders - NYCAviation - NYCAviation,"Mon, 16 May 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55Y2F2aWF0aW9uLmNvbS8yMDExLzA1L2ludmVzdGlnYXRvcnMtc3VjY2Vzc2Z1bGx5LXJlY292ZXItYWxsLWRhdGEtZnJvbS1haXItZnJhbmNlLWZsaWdodC00NDctcmVjb3JkZXJzLzE1NTMx0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"French investigators have successfully downloaded the entire record of data from the recently retrieved flight data and voice recorders from Air France Flight 447.

The entire record of flight data was recovered from the doomed plane’s data recorder, as were the final two hours of cockpit conversation from the voice recorder, according to BEA, the French Office of Investigations and Analysis (BEA) for the Safety of Civil Aviation.

Information gleaned from the recorders will be key to discovering the cause of the crash, which has left investigators, engineers and the public dumbfounded since the Airbus A330-200 (F-GZCP) plunged into the Atlantic without warning on June 1, 2009. All 216 passengers and 12 crewmembers were killed as the flight crossed an infrequently traveled stretch of ocean separating South America and Africa while enroute to Paris from Rio De Janeiro.

The recorders were recovered from the sea floor earlier this month, nearly two years after the plane went down. Despite being built to withstand great stresses, many feared that the data on the recorders would not have withstood not only the extreme forces of the crash impact, but the immense pressure of sitting beneath nearly three miles of saltwater for such a long period. Photos of the recorders when they were recovered by a deep sea submersible vehicle, however, showed the recorders in seemingly good condition.

Until now, the leading theory about the plane’s disappearance has focused on a fault of the jet’s pitot tubes, sensors which measure air speed. The model of pitot tube installed on the crashed jet had been earlier recalled due to its susceptibility to ice, though Air France had not yet installed replacements.

The BEA says the data was downloaded in the presence of safety investigators from Germany, the United States and Brazil, in addition to French judicial police and a court expert. All operations were filmed. An interim report will be released after the data is analyzed, which is expected to take several weeks.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9996634721755981}",neutral,0.9996634721755981,0

Cathay Pacific flight fire emergency landing in Singapore: Airbus A330 engine catches fire - Daily Mail,"Mon, 16 May 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlLTEzODc0ODMvQ2F0aGF5LVBhY2lmaWMtZmxpZ2h0LWVtZXJnZW5jeS1sYW5kaW5nLVNpbmdhcG9yZS1BaXJidXMtQTMzMC1lbmdpbmUtY2F0Y2hlcy1maXJlLmh0bWzSAYsBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGFpbHltYWlsLmNvLnVrL25ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZS0xMzg3NDgzL2FtcC9DYXRoYXktUGFjaWZpYy1mbGlnaHQtZW1lcmdlbmN5LWxhbmRpbmctU2luZ2Fwb3JlLUFpcmJ1cy1BMzMwLWVuZ2luZS1jYXRjaGVzLWZpcmUuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"'Will we die?' Horror aboard Airbus A330 as engine bursts into flames mid-flight



A Cathay Pacific aeroplane was forced to make an emergency landing after one of its engines caught fire.

Passengers have spoken about how they prayed together as the aircraft made its way back to Singapore early this morning.

Changi Airport said flight CX715 took off from Singapore heading to Jakarta, Indonesia, at 1.12am, but quickly turned around after engine trouble and landed at 1.57am.

The Airbus 330, bound for Jakarta, had 136 passengers on board and managed to land 'without incident'.

Lucky escape: Firefighters put out a fire that started in the starboard engine of the Cathay Pacific Airbus when it landed at Singapore

Horror: Passengers react on board the flight - which had been bound for Jakarta - before they disembark Safe: Firefighters help people as they walk down the stairs off the Cathay Pacific Airbus A330 THE A330'S SAFETY RECORD

1994: Seven killed during flight test while the crew simulated an engine failure .

2001: Air Transat flight landed in Portugal after problems with the fuel system . No deaths. 2009: 228 people killed when an A330 vanished over the Atlantic Ocean in mysterious conditions .

2010: A 12-year-old Dutch passenger was the only survivor out of 104 when a plane crashed near Tripoli .

The pilot, who praised the passengers for being calm, shut down the engine after receiving a 'stall warning'. Reuters photographer Beawiharta was aboard the plane with his wife, two sons and daughter.

He said that about 20 minutes after take-off there were two sharp bangs. As the plane began shaking violently, cabin crew went to retrieve meals they had only just begun serving and the lights went out. He said there was a smell of smoke but when his son, Pradipta, 15, looked out of the window he couldn't see anything out of the ordinary.



Relief: Passengers weep as they make their way down the staircase of the flight

'But I asked him to cup his hands to get a better view,' Beawiharta said. 'He shouted: 'I see fire! I see fire!'

'Panicked, he then asked: ""Will we die? Will we die?"" I took his hand and told him firmly: 'No, we are going to live.'

'Behind us, passengers were praying: 'God, save our flight! Give us your protection!''

The prayers got louder and louder, pierced by only the occasional cry of panic.

'A stewardess told us an engine had caught fire and we were on our way back to Singapore. Glued to the window, my son said he could see lights, the sea and ships and then lights on the ground.

Thanks: Some people prayed together after touching down safely

'We all grabbed life jackets from beneath our seats, but the plane landed smoothly.

'Within five minutes, as firefighters doused the damaged engine, we walked off the plane into the terminal.'

In the waiting room, the pilot greeted assembled passengers.

'The best that we can ever ask of passengers is to stay cool, stay calm ... which you did,' he said. 'And for that we thank you.'

Overcome: Passengers of the flight weep after surviving their ordeal

Easyjet unveils 200th celebratory aircraft – Business Traveller - Business Traveller,"Thu, 26 May 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzdHJhdmVsbGVyLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMTEvMDUvMjYvZWFzeWpldC11bnZlaWxzLTIwMHRoLWNlbGVicmF0b3J5LWFpcmNyYWZ0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"To mark the 200th Airbus aircraft to join its fleet, Easyjet has painted it bright orange. At 15 years old, Easyjet is the youngest airline in history to reach this landmark.

Easyjet unveiled the new A320 at a delivery ceremony today, at Airbus' Toulouse factory. Carolyn McCall, Easyjet's CEO, said: “We aim to turn Europe orange and the special livery on our 200th aircraft embodies that ambition.”

Currently the fourth largest European airline, Easyjet will end this year with 204 aircraft in total, but plans to keep its fleet size fairly static in the future, said McCall.



Speaking to Business Traveller's sister website abtn.co.uk at the event, she said the airline had reached its critical mass in terms of fleet size.

The low-cost carrier operates an almost entirely Airbus fleet, which has the most A319s of any airline worldwide. McCall said Easyjet is in conversation with both Boeing and Airbus about future aircraft acquisitions, including Airbus' next generation A320neo.

While she said it is “very early days” for the A320neo, it is an interesting proposition.

“If it really is as fuel efficient as they say it's going to be, we really have to take it seriously,” said McCall.

Airbus claims its A320neo will cut fuel burn by 15 per cent, with a new type of engine and the addition of “sharklets”, Airbus' extended wing tips.

Since Easyjet took delivery of its first Airbus aircraft in 2003, Airbus has delivered an aircraft every fortnight to the airline, on average, over the last eight years.

Qantas to the USA: Airbus A380 via LAX or Boeing 747 via Dallas? - Executive Traveller,"Wed, 18 May 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4ZWN1dGl2ZXRyYXZlbGxlci5jb20vcWFudGFzLXRvLXRoZS11c2EtYWlyYnVzLWEzODAtdmlhLWxheC1vci1ib2VpbmctNzQ3LXZpYS1kYWxsYXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"With Qantas' new flights from Sydney to Dallas/Fort Worth (and back via Brisbane) well under way, Australian passengers are presented with new connection options for other US cities.

Dallas is, after all, the hub of Qantas' oneworld alliance partner American Airlines, which is why Qantas is flying there rather than San Francisco -- and why Qantas has added 28 US cities to its codeshare list.

(Codesharing means that an airline adds its own two-letter airline code (QF for Qantas, AA for American Airlines, and so on) to another airline's flights. So, American Airlines flight AA76 is also Qantas flight QF3085. Codesharing generally means that you earn more frequent flyer points too.)

To get to Dallas from Sydney, Qantas is using its Boeing 747-400ER planes, the ones with the extra fuel tank that only Qantas ever ordered from Boeing. They're older than the airline's A380s, though, which means that the seats aren't as comfortable and don't have the latest features.

But Qantas is still flying to Los Angeles' LAX with A380s -- which means its newest seats, including the excellent fully-flat Skybeds, are still available. And LAX still has better lounges than DFW.

Why is a fully-flat Skybed better than the lie-flat version? Check out our exposé: The Lie-Flat Lie.

So business travellers will have to make a decision based on connection times, seat comfort and features, and services on the ground.

Do you value a more comfortable seat across the Pacific in exchange for a slightly longer flight from LAX on arrival? Is the second-rate lounge situation in Dallas a deal-breaker?

After weighing everything up, here's what we recommend.

Go via LAX for...

New York

New York is a special case where you should definitely go via LAX for New York's JFK airport.

You'll be able to continue on Qantas' Airbus A330 flights with angled-flat Skybeds or -- on AA flights -- recliner seats on Boeing 767s that are slightly more comfortable than the regular American domestic offering.

Unless you have a specific reason to fly to New York's La Guardia (LGA) or Newark (EWR) airports, JFK is the way to go for a more comfortable flight.

Chicago, Denver, Las Vegas, Oklahoma City, Phoenix

American flies to these cities nonstop from LAX, and simple geography means that it makes sense to connect via LAX rather than going east to DFW to then fly west again.

Flights from Melbourne

The A380 flies direct between Melbourne and Los Angeles, so rather than connecting in Sydney, take the more comfortable A380 from MEL before changing in LAX and another US airport to get where you're going.

Try to go via LAX for...

Calgary, Cancun, Detroit, Guadalajara, Kansas City, Mexico City, Milwaukee, Madison, Minneapolis, Monterrey, Omaha, Puerto Vallarta, Vancouver

While connecting to these cities via LAX makes geographical sense, American doesn't fly non-stop from Los Angeles.

However, you may be able to get a connection on another airline, although you may not earn as many Qantas Frequent Flyer points for your flight.

Go via DFW for...

Atlanta, Austin, Hartford, Nashville, Boston, Baltimore, Cleveland, Charlotte, Columbus, Cincinnati, Des Moines, Newark, Fort Lauderdale, Grand Rapids, Houston (Intercontinental and Hobby), Washington DC (Dulles and National, aka Reagan), Indianapolis, Jacksonville, Lexington, Louisville, Memphis, Miami, New Orleans, New York (La Guardia and Newark), Orlando, Norfolk, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Raleigh/Durham, San Antonio, Saint Louis, Tampa, Tulsa, Toronto

Flying via Dallas makes geographical sense for this (rather extensive) list of cities and airports, since you'll have a greater proportion of your flight time on Qantas.

We look at it this way: even though you can connect to, say, Washington Dulles from LAX, it's overall better to spend more time on Qantas' older 747s than any American Airlines plane that flies from LA to DC.

But some travellers -- especially in Business Class -- may still prefer to get a better night's sleep on the newer and more comfortable A380 before continuing on, even if that means an extra connection.

75 more Air France crash bodies recovered - CBC News,"Tue, 31 May 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9uZXdzL3dvcmxkLzc1LW1vcmUtYWlyLWZyYW5jZS1jcmFzaC1ib2RpZXMtcmVjb3ZlcmVkLTEuMTAzOTI0NdIBIGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9hbXAvMS4xMDM5MjQ1?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Brazilian search planes first spotted debris from Air France Flight 447 about 650 kilometres northeast of the Archipelago of Fernando de Noronha. ((CBC)) The French gendarmerie says that 75 more bodies have been pulled from the Atlantic Ocean in the past week, nearly two years after the crash of an Air France flight from Rio de Janeiro to Paris.

That announcement in Paris brings the total number of bodies recovered since June 1, 2009 to 127. All 228 people aboard the plane died.

Two French investigating judges have written to families of victims to tell them bodies that are too badly damaged will not be recovered to preserve their dignity.

An initial reading of the cockpit and data recorders from the flight, which were found on May 1, show that the Airbus 330 went into an aerodynamic stall that the pilot could not rectify, perhaps because of incorrect speed readings, and the plane dropped 11,500 metres into the ocean in 3½ minutes.

The plane crashed into deep waters, beyond the range of radar and sonar. To conduct the actual search, planes and ships rely on sonar signals from the black box. Depths reach as far down as 3,900 metres in the Atlantic.

Automatic messages sent by the Airbus 330's computers showed it was receiving false air speed readings from sensors known as pitot tubes. Investigators have said the crash was likely caused by a series of problems, and not just sensor error.

Discovery of the black box was crucial, as a French judge recently handed down a decision allowing preliminary manslaughter charges against Airbus, which made the plane. Information from the black box could help or hurt Airbus, the world's largest airplane manufacturer.

The $12.5-million US search was jointly financed by the airline and Airbus.

The search covered a 10,000-square-kilometre area, several hundred kilometres off Brazil's northeast coast.

More than $28 million has been spent on previous searches.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.8587473034858704}",neutral,0.8587473034858704,0

The announcement of Emirates’ first scheduled A380 service to Africa comes as the airline unveiled its full year financial results for 2010-11.

These revealed an increase in the number of South African travellers flying with Emirates – with total passenger growth up 12 per cent over the previous financial year.

Overall revenue from the South African market also rose sharply, up 34 per cent from 2009-10.

“We have enjoyed a successful partnership with South Africa since launching services in 1995, and now connect our Johannesburg, Cape Town and Durban gateways to our vast global network through 42 non-stop flights each week to Dubai,” said Emirates president Tim Clark.

“The very positive trends we have witnessed over the past 12 months will only be boosted by the arrival of our flagship A380 aircraft, which has set a new benchmark for air travel.”

Johannesburg is the most populous city in South Africa and capital of the Gauteng province, the country’s wealthiest province and home to approximately nine million residents. The city, which is located on the mineral-rich Witwatersrand range of hills, is also a thriving centre for the gold and diamond trade.

Emirates currently operates a three times daily service to Johannesburg, a double-daily service to Cape Town and a daily service to Durban.

The airline’s fleet of 15 A380s operate on services from Dubai to London Heathrow (double-daily), Manchester, Paris Charles de Gaulle, Toronto, Seoul, Bangkok, Beijing, Shanghai, Jeddah, New York, Hong Kong, Sydney and Auckland.

Emirates Holidays, the tour-operating arm of Dubai-based Emirates Airline, offers travel packages to South Africa which can be tailor-made according to the travellers’ needs or interests. The Emirates Holidays brochure, A World of Choice 2011-12, with a wide variety of exciting holiday ideas and suggestions, was launched earlier this month.

Emirates currently serves 19 passenger and cargo destinations across the African continent.

The airline operates flights on a daily schedule from Malta to Dubai via Larnaka, Cyprus.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999592304229736}",positive,0.9999592304229736,1

Deliveries of these Sharklet-equipped Airbus aircraft will begin from the second quarter of 2013.

Delivery of Air Arabia order of 44 Airbus A320s (34 placed in 2007 and 10 in 2008) has already started in the last quarter of 2010 and will make the carrier one of the region largest A320 operators with one of the most modern single-aisle fleets.

Air Arabia is on the path of a reasonable expansion, in-line with the company vision to become one of the world leading airlines in terms of eco-efficiency, profit margin, innovation, and operational excellence. This new order will further contribute to the airline operational efficiency when we take delivery of the first Sharklet-equipped A320s in 2013, said Adel Ali, Board Member and Group CEO of Air Arabia.

We are delighted that Air Arabia has taken the opportunity to maximise the capability and efficiency of its future A320 fleet by equipping them with our fuel-saving Sharklets, said John Leahy, Airbus Chief Operating Officer, Customers. The popular A320 Family already has the best reliability, highest revenue-generation and the lowest operating costs of any single-aisle aircraft in its class, and with the new Sharklets, customers like Air Arabia will benefit even more, he adds.

Sharklets were launched for development in 2009. These new wingtip devices are around 2.5 metres tall and further enhance the efficiency of the popular A320 Family by replacing the aircraft current wingtip fence. Offered as an option on new-build aircraft from the end of 2012, the devices reduce fuel burn particularly over longer sectors. As well as increasing payload-range and improving take-off performance, Sharklets result in around 3.5 percent reduced fuel burn over longer sectors, corresponding to an annual CO 2 reduction of around 700 tonnes per aircraft.

Air Arabia already operates a large fleet of new and leased A320s. From its main hubs, Sharjah in the UAE, Casablanca in Morocco, Alexandria in Egypt, the carrier serves a network of more than 65 international routes across Europe, the Middle East, Asia and Africa.

The A320 Family (A318, A319, A320 and A321) is recognised as the benchmark single-aisle aircraft family. Nearly 7,000 Airbus A320 Family aircraft have been ordered and more than 4,600 delivered to more than 320 customers and operators worldwide, making it the world best-selling commercial jetliner ever.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999910593032837}",positive,0.9999910593032837,1

Currently the production rate for Airbus’ long-range A330 family is 8.5 per month, increasing to nine in early 2012 and ten in the second quarter of 2013.

“The low operating costs and high dispatch reliability offered by the A320 family make it the best seller in its market” said Tom Williams, executive vice president of Programmes. “With a backlog of over 2,300 A320 family aircraft to deliver, we need to increase production to accommodate continuing strong customer demand for these new eco-efficient aircraft.”

Airbus delivered a total of 510 aircraft in 2010, including 401 A320 family aircraft. By the end of April, Airbus had already delivered 132 A320 family aircraft and is well on track to exceed previous years’ deliveries.

To keep the A320 family in the leadership position, Airbus has recently introduced a new engine option (neo) for the A320 family which will enter into service in October 2015. The A320neo family incorporates new more efficient engines and large “Sharklet” wing tip devices which together will deliver up to 15 per cent in fuel savings.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999998807907104}",positive,0.9999998807907104,1
Airbus Military announces AEW&C aircraft - defenceWeb,"Tue, 24 May 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuY2V3ZWIuY28uemEvYWVyb3NwYWNlL2Flcm9zcGFjZS1hZXJvc3BhY2UvYWlyYnVzLW1pbGl0YXJ5LWFubm91bmNlcy1hZXdjLWFpcmNyYWZ0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Military plans to fly a demonstrator airborne early warning and command (AEW&C) variant of its C295 twin turboprop transport next month. The aircraft will sport a rotodome similar to the Boeing E3 Sentry – rather than a dorsal “plank” fairing as used by the Saab Erieye.

Airbus Military head of engineering Miguel-Angel Morell Fuentes says a dummy dome was installed on an aircraft last week for flight tests. The C295 is currently available as a transport – carrying up to 66 troops, a maritime surveillance platform and as an armed maritime patrol/antisubmarine/surface warfare platform. Describing the mooted variant as an “interesting technology”, he noted the C295 “appears to be ideal also for AEW&C application”, featuring optimal flight behaviour, the longest cabin in its class and state-of-the-art avionics. It also has a wider cabin than many peers.

Fuentes said in is presentation to the Airbus Military trade media briefing last week that his engineers are “always looking for new applications”. The idea for an AEW&C variant was first mooted about a year ago and was followed by a feasibility study and a feasibility assessment. Both were successfully completed, leading to work on aircraft systems modifications, rotodome aerodynamic, structural and system integration with the C295 and computational fluid dynamics and wind-tunnel testing in the Netherlands.

A company-owned C295 was next converted to a “100% representative AEW test-bed” at the business’ facility in Sevilla, Spain. Fuentes added flight flight will be followed by an extensive three-month flight test campaign. Expected time on station could be as long as seven or eight hours and aerial refuelling would be available. A decision will then be made on the way forward. To date, the work has been entirely company funded, but Fuentes added the company was open to sign a contract with a lead customer.

Trade journalists attending the media briefing were somewhat surprised by the announcement and questioned whether there was space in a somewhat crowded market for the aspirant new entrant. Fuentes believed there is advantage for operators who use a common fleet of aircraft for military transport, maritime patrol and AEW&C as it could provide them “with important benefits and savings, and [lower] operating costs”.

Fuentes could not comment on the capability of a radar fit, as none have as yet been contemplated. The rotodome is some 6m in diameter, about two thirds the size of the E3 radome (9m) and just slightly smaller than that fitted to the E2 Hawkeye (7m). Fuentes continued the company also believes that rotodomes are superior to longtitudinal “planks” because they provide 360 degree coverage while the Erieye-type arrays only provide coverage to the sides, with blind spots forward and aft of the aircraft, requiring the aircraft to fly “racetrack” courses to achieve all-round vision.

South Africa in 2008 had a brief look at the Swedish Erieye mounted on a Brazilian Embraer as a solution to help safeguard the 2009 soccer Confederations Cup and the 2010 World Cup. But in November 2008 SA Air Force chief Lieutenant General Carlo Gagiano said the system was too expensive for the country. “Now we`re talking real money,” says Gagiano. “We don`t have the capacity. There`s no money in the defence budget for Erieye. From an acquisition point of view, I don`t see it, although I would like it, but the financial realities won`t allow it.”

But that may change. South Africa’s recently approved – but as yet unpublished – maritime security strategy includes plans to cover the country’s entire exclusive economic zone (EEZ) with “some form of sensor, or combination of sensors that will produce the most optimal coverage”, Minister of Defence and Military Veterans Lindiwe Sisulu last week said in answer to a parliamentary question by Democratic Alliance MP SP Kopane. “It is obvious that such an integrated system will require the cooperation of many stakeholders and will benefit the RSA in order to ensure that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of our maritime zones remain intact,” Sisulu said. “Such an integrated system forms part of the deliberations on a maritime security strategy for the RSA.” She did not elaborate, but a reading of the answer suggests that pricey as it may be, an AEW&C aircraft could be part of the solution.

Saab Surveillance Systems director Peter Hultin in May 2008 told defenceWeb the Erieye`s software-driven Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar gave users the ability to comprehensively and simultaneously survey the air, sea surface and ground environment in a radius of up to 450km around the aircraft to which it was fitted – or about 450 000 square kiliometers. By contrast, ground radar could perhaps scan the near-ground environment to a range of about 50km, taking into account the curvature of the earth. Using Doppler radar, Erieye could accurately track hovering helicopters flying nap-of-the-earth or “rubber duck” type boats and jetskis in the surf at ranges of several hundred kilometres. This was a valuable feature when employing Erieye in the search-and rescue role or for detecting piracy or illegal fishing activities, he added.

Hultin pointed out that a single aircraft could monitor approximately a quarter of SA`s lowest airspace at any given time, versus a 1/200th for ground radar. “Two aircraft, one based in Gauteng and the other in the Cape, can observe almost all of SA in as fast as half an hour: 10 minutes to warn the systems and take off, and 20 to reach orbit,” he adds.

In addition, an AEW&C platform can complement or supplement existing ground radar and even replace ground-based air traffic control in case of natural calamity, power outage or terrorist attack.

The platform is also ideal to help impose economic and environmental exclusion zones around nature and fishery reserves for example. Similarly, it can assist in enforcing no-fly zones in peacekeeping operations, around VIP meetings such as those of the G8, critical infrastructure such as nuclear plants or major events, typified by the 2010 FIFA Soccer World Cup.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998551607131958}",neutral,0.9998551607131958,0

Flight CX715 took off from Singapore at 1.12am, bound for Jakarta, but was forced to make an emergency return to Changi Airport after one of its Rolls-Royce engines caught fire.

Six firefighting crews had to approach the plane on the runway and put the fire out upon landing, with the plane's fire suppression systems unable to quell it.

Passengers on the jet reportedly thought the plane was going to go down and started praying together and pulling lifejackets from beneath the seats.

Reuters reported that two loud bangs were heard by passengers, the plane began shaking violently, and the internal lights went out. Flight attendants started hurriedly taking meals back that they'd just handed out to passengers.

However, despite passengers' worries, the plane landed safely at Changi, without further incident.

Another Cathay Pacific Airbus A330 also had serious engine problems en route to Hong Kong from Indonesia last month. Six of eight tyres deflated upon touchdown, after brakes overheated due to the plane being overspeed at landing.

Twenty minutes prior, the pilots of the plane noticed large fluctuations in engine thrust, with one engine underperforming, and the other engine bursting overspeed.

It's not yet known whether the latest incident was on the same aircraft.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9991447925567627}",negative,0.9991447925567627,-1

Virgin Blue will shift its assault on Qantas into high gear today when it relaunches as Virgin Australia and welcomes the first of its new Boeing 737-800 'Next Generation' aircraft, fitted with new business class and economy class seats.

At a press conference to be held at the carrier’s Sydney Airport terminal at 10am this morning, Wednesday May 4th, Virgin Blue Group CEO John Borghetti and Sir Richard Branson will unveil the new Virgin Australia brand.

It's the next step in Borghetti's ambitious ‘Game Change’ programme – with which he aims to snare up to 20% of Australia’s domestic business travel market.

""Everywhere I go, business travellers tell me they want more competition"" Borghetti says. ""They are crying out for it. They face competition in the environment they operate in and they know it compels them to strive to be better.”

As part of Borghetti’s push we’ve already seen the forthcoming launch of daily flights between Sydney and Perth; new business class seats with an inflight menu designed by award-winning chef Luke Mangan; a fast-track lounge at Sydney Airport with valet parking, an express security lane and a kerb-to-lounge time of under two minutes; and stylish new uniforms for Virgin Blue flight attendants and crew.

But there's plenty left in the barrel. Here’s a rundown of what we’ll be looking to see today.

Australian Business Traveller will be attending this morning's press conference and will bring you live updates over Twitter – follow us on @AusBT or watch for the #virginblue, #newvirgin or #virginaustralia hashtags.

New name: Virgin Australia

For the past few weeks the safest bet in town is that Virgin Blue's new brand would be Virgin Australia: they've registered the trademark with a new logo, they've taken ownership of the VirginAustralia.com.au Internet address and reportedly the @VirginAustralia Twitter account.



And in a classic 'oops' moment, for several hours on Friday the online booking system for Virgin Blue's international arm V Australia accidentally showed domestic connections operated by Virgin Australia.

At the moment all we've seen for 'the new face' of Virgin Blue is the new corporate logo in black and white:

but we're expecting a treatment similar to below, albeit perhaps with the 'Australia' in red or silver:

(You can read our detailed analysis of the logo and Virgin Blue's options).

New livery

Virgin Blue's most recent aircraft deliveries have all been painted stark white, but today we'll see the arrival of the Virgin Australia's first Boeing 737-800 adorned with some version of new logo and colour scheme.

Don't expect this to be anything like the airline's current red-dominated paintwork – think white, with highlights of red and purple and flashes of silver.

Futuristic Boeing 'Sky Interior'

The factory-fresh Boeing 737-800s which Virgin Australia is adding to its fleet will come fitted with a futuristic Sky Interior cabin designed by Boeing and based on the interior of the revolutionary Boeing 787 Dreamliner (which Qantas expects to start flying in 2012).

The cabin represents a major makeover for conventional aircraft interiors by embracing organic curves and soft colours to make the cabin lighter and brighter, as well as looking ‘softer’ and more spacious. Virgin Blue will be installing video screens for every seat, even economy.

Leather economy seating

Borghetti trumpeted Virgin Blue's new Airbus A330 business-class seats in February, which will be introduced on the Sydney-Perth flights, but chose to keep his powder dry on the look and design of the economy class seats.

We've already seen a teaser image on the Virgin Blue website, which also tells us the seats will be covered in 'luxury leather', with over 18 inches in width and legroom from 30 to 32 inches.

Airport lounges

Virgin Australia's lounges at Melbourne and Brisbane airport are undergoing renovations, and we expect today's event will include details on improvements to both lounges.

Tipped for Melbourne is streamlined lounge-to-gate access with a dedicated security channel for the benefit of Virgin Australia's premium passengers.

Virgin Australia also has three new airport lounges on the cards: one at Coolangatta has been announced, so we hope to hear which other two airports will be getting The Lounge treatment.

Velocity Rewards overhaul

There are already plans to overhaul the Velocity Rewards frequent flyer program this year, with John Borghetti going so far as to call it the ""launch of a new loyalty program"" which could even see the Velocity brand ditched entirely.

How much of that will be revealed today is unclear but some announcements are on the cards. The airline is believed to have formed an alliance with the Coles FlyBuy program, under which members could earn Velocity points for each dollar spent at participating FlyBuy outlets including Coles, Target, Kmart, Liqourland and Budget car rentals.

The Virgin Blue-Coles FlyBuy partnership would allow each company to take on its larger competitors of Qantas and Woolworths, which already enjoy a highly promoted dollars-for-points deal between the Woolworths Everyday Rewards Card and Qantas Frequent Flyer programme.

"Skywest buys new Airbus A320 and Fokker 100 planes, announces new flights and details of Virgin Australia tie-up - Executive Traveller","Fri, 13 May 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4ZWN1dGl2ZXRyYXZlbGxlci5jb20vc2t5d2VzdC1idXlzLW5ldy1wbGFuZXMtYW5ub3VuY2VzLW5ldy1mbGlnaHRzLWFuZC1kZXRhaWxzLW9mLXZpcmdpbi1hdXN0cmFsaWEtdGllLXVw0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Regional West Australian airline Skywest has leased an extra Airbus A320 and intends to buy a Fokker 100 to keep up with Western Australian demand for business travel. The airline has also released further details of its tie-up with Virgin Australia, plus additional routes from Geraldton.

New planes

First up are additional aircraft, including an extra Airbus A320. Skywest's existing 162-seat A320 is frequently used for fly-in fly-out mining company work. So business travellers in the resources sector are likely to see additional services and more airliner-style comfort on high-demand routes when the new plane arrives this August.

A further Fokker 100 jet, seating just over 100 passengers, is also on tentative order. The airline already has nine of the small 1990s-era jets in its fleet.

Virgin Australia tie-up details

As Australian Business Traveller recently reported, Skywest entered into a partnership with Virgin Australia for West Australia regional flying. It's a remarkably lucrative market, and Skywest plans to use new ATR-72 turboprop planes in the Virgin Australia paint scheme.

The first ATR will arrive in June, and be operating commercial flights by the end of August if all goes according to plan.

And, of course, Virgin Australia's Velocity Rewards frequent flyer programme members will continue to earn points on Skywest flights.

New Geraldton flights

West Australian resources sector hub Geraldton will see extra flights, to Denpasar internationally and to Melbourne and the Pilbara within Australia. The new flights will start later this winter.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999955892562866}",neutral,0.9999955892562866,0
