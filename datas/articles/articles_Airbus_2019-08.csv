What’s So Special About the Airbus A330-900neo? Touring One of Delta’s to Find Out! - Airline Reporter,"Wed, 07 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAxOS8wOC93aGF0cy1zby1zcGVjaWFsLWFib3V0LXRoZS1haXJidXMtYTMzMC05MDBuZW8tdG91cmluZy1vbmUtb2YtZGVsdGFzLXRvLWZpbmQtb3V0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Timing can be a magical thing. I was just talking to my pal Jason Rabinowitz about airplanes (we do this often) and I was asking why the Airbus A330neo was such a big deal. I actually tracked down our high-end chat:

Me: “Why do we care so much about the A330neo? Just b/c that is all we have right now to celebrate?”

Jason: “It new. And it all we got.”

Don’t get me wrong. I have still been excited watching the new A330 go into service, but it doesn’t match the excitement of the 787 Dreamliner, 747 Intercontinental, or A350 XWB.

The day after my award-winning chat with Jason, I received an invite from Delta Air Lines to come check out one of their new Airbus A330-900neos at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA). Perfect.

The A330 has been a great international workhorse for airlines, but I have never gone out of my way to fly on one (okay, maybe domestically on Hawaiian once). “What’s the aircraft flying my route? An A330? OMG YES I LOVE THAT PLANE,” said no one ever.

Of course most passengers aren’t as concerned with the type of plane they are flying (yes, I know it is shocking to think there are people like that out there), but they are more concerned with the product. Although Delta has been upgrading the interiors of their 777s to the newest product, the A330neo is the first type that has the newest product coming from the factory. I hadn’t seen the updated interior yet, and even though this was going to be a short visit with the plane on the ground, I still excited to have an opportunity to get onto a plane!

GETTING SET AT SEA-TAC

I always love an airline event that doesn’t require me to get up at 3:00am. With this one, I just needed to be at the Delta counter at 10:30am and get my day pass, which of course is going into my AvGeek collection. You still get to go through security and it prompts fun questions from the TSA agents. “Uh, I am going to look at an airplane, but not fly anywhere, don’t worry, it is totally legit” (pretty close to my actual convo).

Needless to say, I made it through (otherwise this would be a very different story), and we headed to the buses to ride out to our A330-900neo, which was located next to Delta’s maintenance facility at the south side of the airport.

After de-busing (that is a thing), we walked through a hangar and saw a Delta Boeing 717. A few of us geeked out a bit. The funny part is one of the cameramen (not an AvGeek) started setting up his camera and a Delta employee was asking if they were going to push in the stairs for us to go in. Since a few of us AvGeek media types got so worked up over the plane, they thought this must have been the plane we were all there for. Nope. It just takes a long time to get AvGeeks to move through any airport facility. #sorrynotsorry

WE ARRIVE TO THE DELTA AIR LINES AIRBUS A330-900neo

As we walked up to the back of the A330neo, I was super excited to hear the APU going. Why? Because it was a really odd weather combo in Seattle: rain, sun, heatt, and humidity! It felt more like Atlanta than Seattle.

Most times when I am touring an aircraft like this, I first head to the back, and then make my way forward. This was no different! Here we go…

First stop was the galley in the rear of the aircraft. It was quite large. The plane we were on was being prepped to fly a scheduled passenger flight, so soon there was going to be plenty of food and drink.

I will mention again that we didn’t have a heck of a lot of time to tour the plane. Part of it was we spent a lot of time outside the plane (taking photos of the A330neo and of course that 717), and this plane needed to be prepped for people who mattered – customers. I really didn’t get to try out much of the product; I just sat, played a bit, asked a few questions, took a few photos, and kept on moving forward (I didn’t want to miss out on seeing the flight deck).

For cost comparisons that you will see below, I looked at some one-way fares from Seattle to Shanghai on the Delta Airbus A330-900neo between now and the end of the year. With the product really impressing me, I wanted to see how much it would actually cost to fly, so I figured I would share the numbers. I averaged those costs to give a basic comparison, but obviously check delta.com yourself before packing your bags!

DELTA MAIN CABIN (aka economy)

Next was the economy section, or as Delta calls it “Main Cabin.” This is the place where the majority of passengers will fly… and honestly that is not a bad thing. The inflight entertainment (IFE) screens were large, and reacted quickly to my input. The seats were comfy for my quick sit, but probably not as comfy after a 10-hour flight. Of course with the A330, best to try and get one of the two seats on the edge because sitting in the middle, of the middle, with strangers will make your flight feel even longer. Not wanting to spend too much time in Delta Main Cabin, I kept moving forward.

Average Delta Main Cabin A330-900neo cost flight: $435

DELTA COMFORT+ (aka “premium” economy)

The next product forward is Delta Comfort+. This is really your standard economy seat, with some additional legroom. You also get a fun little extra pocket on the seat back, and a red swath on your seat. I will admit that the addition of red in the cabin actually adds a bit of class.

Also, it’s a good time to mention that the aircraft has air vents!!! I love this. Too few international aircraft have them and as a guy who normally runs hotter, I like having some control of my temperature.

Average Delta Comfort+ A330-900neo cost flight: $485

compare that to $435 in Main Cabin

Hmm. Okay. So only $100 more for a round-trip ticket in Comfort+, I might actually be interested in that.

Delta Premium Select (aka domestic first)

Now we are talking! The Delta Premium Select seat is where I started perking up. I rarely pay extra for more legroom. It just doesn’t seem like a good purchase, even at 6’1″. What I do find helpful is width, especially at 250lbs. The Delta Premium Select product is the seat that took most of my time (even more than Delta One)… and that is a good thing.

The seat really felt like an updated and upgraded domestic first class seat. You have a better IFE screen, seat controls, and the ability to recline. With a 2-3-2 layout vs the 2-4-2 layout in the back of the (air)bus, that extra width really makes a difference.

Average Delta Premium Select A330-900neo flight cost: $600

compare that to $435 in Main Cabin and $485 in Comfort+



Dang. Now, I don’t have lot of extra money to spend on airfare, but $330 more for a round trip ticket in Premium Select vs Main Cabin might be worth it. Or at least paying $165 coming back home (so I can sleep before going back to work).

Delta One (aka business class)

You have arrived. Delta One is the best of the best from Delta and that is saying something. I appreciate that every “window” seat actually gets easy access to the window – not always the case with today’s business “suites” – and those in the middle of the cabin can easily put down a wall to chat with their seat mate, or put it up and stay private. You have the most room, best controls, lie-flat seat, and even a little slider door to up your privacy level.

Average Delta One A330-900neo flight cost: $3350

compare that to $435 in Main Cabin, $485 in Comfort+, and $600 in Premium Select



Hot damn that is a lot of money (but actually not a bad deal compared to other business class products)! But often it makes sense for passengers (or businesses) to shell out the money or miles to fly in Delta’s best product. Based on the extra cost, I think it makes Delta Premium Select even a better deal!

Airbus A330-900neo Flightdeck (aw yea!!!)

Had to make it to the very front of the plane, and I did! I was only able to chat with a Delta pilot for a small amount of time before I was given the bad news that our time on the plane was coming to an end.

Final Delta Air Lines Airbus A330-900neo Thoughts

After getting back to the terminal, we headed on over to the Delta lounge at the airport. I had never been and it was a nice place to sit down, talk airplanes, and think a bit about the A330neo. I was impressed. I think the first time that I fly on a Delta A330-900neo will be the first time I am legitimately excited to fly on an Airbus A330, and maybe (just maybe) I can say that the airline/aircraft combos has become one of my favorites. Maybe.

Why I Loved My 2 Flights on Swiss' Airbus A220 - The Points Guy,"Tue, 06 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9uZXdzL3doeS1pLWxvdmVkLXN3aXNzLWEyMjAv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"I recently returned from a trip around the world that centered around a cheap Swiss first-class ticket I found from Kiev, Ukraine, to Zurich, Switzerland, to Bangkok, Thailand. I booked a separate ticket that got me from New York to Zurich, spent the night in Zurich, and flew on yet another ticket from Zurich to Kiev to catch the first-class itinerary. I specifically chose this circuitous routing to experience a new plane (well, at least for me): the Bombardier CS300 Airbus A220-300.

The C-series came into service in 2016, and TPG UK's general manager, Christian Kramer, even reviewed Swiss's business-class product on the A220. My experience was similar to Christian's, and I was pleasantly surprised by this passenger-friendly plane.

The A220 Is Quiet

The first thing I noticed during the takeoff roll was how quiet the A220 is.

No, you're not in a library, but I'd say that the ambient noise level was close to that of a 787. I had just arrived in Europe on a 27-year-old 767-300ER, so the relative quiet was noticeable.

The 2-3 Configuration

The A220 has 50% fewer middle seats than the A320 or B737. You may think it doesn't make much of a difference, but I was so happy to not have to climb over two people to go to the bathroom.

And if you're flying in business class, you can select a seat on the port side of the plane and be guaranteed the entire row to yourself.

This was also the first plane where I noticed that the aisles were actually wide enough to accommodate most passengers' carry-on bags when rolled horizontally. While I don't have measurements for other airline's aisles, the aisles on the Swiss A220 measured 22 inches wide. Even if that number is meaningless to you, trust me when I say these aisles are noticeably wider.

Large Overhead Bins and Windows

There's nothing worse than having to gate check your bag. With larger and deeper overhead bins, especially on the starboard side of the A220, gate checking bags may become a thing of the past.

While the port side overhead bins are definitely smaller, they still do the trick for most carry-on bags.

I've long loved the large windows on the Embraer 190 and Boeing 787, but the oval windows on the A220 were seemingly designed to help your #AvGeek Instagram feed.

The windows are about as wide your standard airplane window (10.5 inches at their widest point), but they're much longer than other windows (15 inches at its longest).

Bathrooms

No, you won't find a shower or urinal or powder area in an A220 bathroom. Nonetheless, you'll be pleasantly surprised by the bathrooms on the A220. They feel larger and taller than other similarly sized short-haul aircraft.

There's a bit more width than usual, since the sink doesn't have a storage compartment underneath it. Oh, and water doesn't squirt on you when you try to wash your hands.

Welcome to the 21st Century

Flying the A220 felt like I was on a plane built in the last decade. Aside from how fresh and clean the cabin looked, there were small screens near the passenger service unit displaying a looping route map. The chrome finishes that Swiss chose added to the modern feel as well.

What I Didn't Love

Speaking of a plane built in the last decade, it's laughable that Swiss elected not to install power outlets or USB ports at any of the seats. I was almost out of power after my two flights! Kudos to Delta for staying relevant. Rather annoyingly, Swiss also didn't install Wi-Fi on the plane. Even though Wi-Fi adoption on intra-European flights is progressing at a glacial pace overall, Swiss should've invested in the future.

Slimline seats are also a thing of the future, and, unfortunately, Swiss jumped on that bandwagon with their A220s. The seats may be comfortable for an hourlong hop to London or Frankfurt, but they certainly didn't cut it for the two and a half hours each way to Kiev.

Overall Impression

The A220 is such a treat for a short-haul flight within Europe. Yes, the plane may have slimline seats, but most other planes operating within Europe do as well. If you have a choice, I'd definitely recommend routing on an A220. The 2-3 configuration, large and modern bathrooms, big windows and modern touches combine to make for a pleasant flying experience. When flying the Swiss A220, make sure to board fully charged, and you'll be set for a great flight.

Now, I'm back home wishing that other domestic US airlines would follow Delta's and JetBlue's lead and order this fantastic aircraft.

Airbus A321XLR: Small jets are the future of big trips - CNN,"Thu, 01 Aug 2019 09:39:36 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vdHJhdmVsL2FydGljbGUvYWlyYnVzLWEzMjF4bHItZXh0cmEtbG9uZy1yYW5nZS9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFGaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vdHJhdmVsL2FydGljbGUvYWlyYnVzLWEzMjF4bHItZXh0cmEtbG9uZy1yYW5nZQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"CNN —

Boarding a long-distance flight today, travelers are accustomed to big jets with roomy cabins, two aisles and space to walk around. But the future of flying is going to look a lot more like the dawn of the Jet Age 60 years ago, when aircraft were considerably smaller.

Airbus is betting that this is how we’ll travel in the future. Its A320 family has evolved over the last 30 years, adding bigger and smaller models capable of crossing continents.

Airbus has incrementally improved the A321 – the largest of its one-aisle aircraft – since it first flew in 1993. In 2013 it added “Sharklets” (what Airbus calls its winglets), new engines in 2016 and extra fuel tanks in 2018.

Extra Long Range

This summer’s Paris Air Show saw the launch of the Airbus A321XLR, the latest in the line. The “XLR” stands for “Extra Long Range.”

In a 175 to 200 passenger, three-class layout with business-class lie-flat seats, premium economy and economy cabins, the XLR will be able to range out as far as 4,700 nautical miles, or 8,700 kilometers. At the plane’s maximum 244-seat passenger capacity, the range drops to 4,000 nautical miles, or 7,400 kilometers.

The XLR will be able to link cities like Rome and New York, London and Delhi, and Tokyo and Sydney. These extended international journeys are reminiscent of the start of global jet travel.

“I think we are really in a ‘Back to the Future’ moment here,” says Henry Harteveldt, travel industry analyst and founder of Atmosphere Research Group.

In the late 1950s, travelers marveled at the speed and comfort of the early Douglas DC-8s and Boeing 707s. Those pioneering jetliners ushered in a new era in international travel, although sometimes the planes couldn’t quite reach their destinations without a mid-route refueling stop.

Douglas and Boeing quickly began improving the planes’ range, and it wasn’t long before passengers had non-stop service between distant cities, including ocean-spanning hops.

In its early days, the Boeing 747 offered a lounge, cocktail service and sometimes even a piano. Boeing

Then, 50 years ago in 1969, the jumbo Boeing 747 appeared. The “Queen of the Skies” changed airline travel forever.

Much bigger than a 707, passengers now felt like they were flying in a large room with two aisles instead of a metal tube with a single aisle. It wasn’t long before airlines shifted long-range travel to wide-body airliners like the 747 and its contemporaries, the Douglas DC-10 and Lockheed L-1011 TriStar.

Over the decades, twin-aisle aircraft like Boeing’s 767, 777 and 787, and the Airbus A330, A350 and A380 have become the standard for international travel.

And while the single-aisle Boeing 757 has given yeoman’s service since the mid-1980s over medium-distance – including trans-Atlantic – routes, airlines that still operate the plane are looking to update their fleets.

Beefed up

American Airlines has chosen the A321XLR to replace its aging 757s, with 50 of the new Airbus jetliners on order.

“The A321XLR is exceptionally versatile, and I think that’s the key piece for the airlines,” says Jeff Knittel, chairman and CEO, Airbus Americas, in an interview with CNN Travel.

“What the XLR does is it gives [airlines] a broader set of alternatives to use the airplane. This is more of an expansion of the single-aisle capabilities than anything else. It’s not a replacement of wide-body aircraft.”

Thanks to the efficiency and flexibility of the XLR, Knittel explained that airlines will be able to schedule the plane on a short connecting flight, say Miami to New York, and then fly to Paris on its next flight.

To reach distant destinations, the A321XLR will be equipped with a newly designed rear center fuel tank, located in the fuselage behind the wing. The plane’s landing gear has been beefed up to handle the extra weight of the fuel, with the plane’s overall takeoff weight increased compared to other A321 models.

Passenger experience

But will long flights in an XLR be an endurance test for passengers?

Airbus has experience making the longest trips on Earth with its bigger A350ULR ultra-long-range jetliner, which is now flying for Singapore Airlines on routes such as Singapore to New York, a 19-hour plus airborne marathon.

According to Knittel, that experience has been applied to the A321XLR.

“We’ve used all of the talents of Airbus to come together on the XLR and really optimize the airplane from a passenger experience perspective. The airplane in terms of systems has been optimized for longer-range flights for up to 10-hour flights, whether it’s [lavatory] holding tanks, water storage or trash,” he says.

The XLR will be equipped with the latest Airspace by Airbus interior fittings, including re-contoured sidewalls, programmable LED-lighting and larger overhead luggage bins, that Knittel said are “about 40% bigger in volume” than previous designs.

As always, it’s up to the airlines to decide on seat types and configurations, as well as in-flight entertainment and connectivity systems.

But no matter what airlines do to optimize the in-cabin passenger experience, they can’t speed up the plane – the A321XLR cruises at a lower airspeed than its wide-body cousins. For example, a westbound flight from Paris to Boston could take up to 50 minutes longer in an XLR than an A350.

“I think passengers will look more at departure time, price and on-board amenities. And to be very honest, there’s so many other factors that go into a flight’s total travel time,” says Harteveldt.

“An airline may use this to intentionally stratify the market,” he adds. “The A321XLR may be a little slower, so the airline could offer more, lower-fare seats on those flights because it’s going to take a little bit longer. On the other hand, the faster jet may not have as many low-fare seats.”

Scheduling flexibility

A mixed fleet of A321XLRs and faster, wide-body aircraft could give airlines scheduling flexibility, linking new cities or adding additional flights on existing routes without adding too much new seating capacity.

The first XLRs will be rolling off the Airbus assembly lines in Mobile, Alabama and Hamburg, Germany, in 2023 or 2024.

Airlines and leasing companies, including JetBlue Airways, Iberia, Air Lease Corp (which will rent them out to other airlines) and Saudi Arabian Airways have ordered the plane or converted previous orders for A321s to the new variant.

And while Harteveldt says he expects wide-body jetliners will continue to serve major, high-capacity routes, “I really do see a day coming where I think you will be back to a significant number, perhaps a majority of trans-Atlantic and other long-haul routes being operated by narrow-body, long-range airplanes.”"
Airbus announces additional industrial projects in Malaysia - Airbus,"Fri, 30 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOS0wOC1haXJidXMtYW5ub3VuY2VzLWFkZGl0aW9uYWwtaW5kdXN0cmlhbC1wcm9qZWN0cy1pbi1tYWxheXNpYdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus today announced plans to develop further its industrial presence in Malaysia with three new initiatives. These include the expansion of Airbus’ wholly-owned maintenance facility, Sepang Aircraft Engineering (SAE); the establishment of the Airbus Malaysia Digital Initiative; and an increased participation in the Aerospace Malaysia Innovation Centre (AMIC).

The projects are covered by a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) signed today in Kuala Lumpur by Airbus Chief Executive Officer Guillaume Faury and AirAsia Group Bhd Executive Chairman Datuk Kamarudin Meranun. The MOA was signed in the presence of Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Prime Minister of Malaysia. Tan Sri Tony Fernandes, Chief Executive Officer, AirAsia Group, who has played a key role in identifying the potential initiatives, was also present at the signing.

“These initiatives will significantly enhance our presence in Malaysia, which is one of our most important markets in Asia,” said Guillaume Faury, Chief Executive Officer, Airbus. “They will strengthen further our win-win partnerships with Malaysia, contribute to the development of the Malaysian aerospace sector and enable Airbus to benefit from the competencies and skills available in the country.”

Tan Sri Tony Fernandes, Chief Executive Officer, AirAsia Group said: “AirAsia is proud to play a leading role in advancing Malaysia’s aerospace industry, which is in line with the country’s vision to open up more aerospace hubs to support the growing aviation industry and create more high-value job opportunities for Malaysians. We will continue to work with all relevant stakeholders to achieve this objective.”

The expansion of SAE will include the construction of a new hangar capable of accommodating four single-aisle or two wide-body aircraft for heavy checks, as well as the addition of new paint and component repair shops. The facilities will be ready to incorporate the latest smart technologies, including data analysis and planning using the Airbus Skywise digital platform and automated inspection techniques.

Under the Airbus Malaysia Digital Initiative, Airbus will work with local stakeholders to develop a master plan and select and perform dedicated projects to enhance the competitiveness of the Malaysian aerospace sector through the application of new digital technologies. The initiative will also contribute to the alignment of Malaysian industrial partners with new processes and systems being introduced by Airbus across its manufacturing and supply chain.

Building on its position as a founding member of AMIC, today’s agreement will see Airbus appoint an Innovation Technical Director to support the non-profit organisation and increase its funding for joint research programmes. These will include research at AMIC into the potential production of alternative and sustainable aviation biofuels in Malaysia.

Airbus is the largest international partner for the Malaysian aerospace industry, with its sourcing and services businesses in the country now valued at some $400 million (U.S.) per year for the local economy. The company’s activities currently sustain employment for over 4,000 Malaysians in the country’s fast-growing aviation sector.

Malaysian suppliers are involved in a wide range of Airbus programmes, producing components and structures for the A320 Family, A330neo, A350 XWB, A380 and A400M. Meanwhile, SAE specialises in the maintenance, repair and overhaul of A320 Family and ATR aircraft, with customers including AirAsia Group, Malaysia Airlines, Scoot, Indigo, Jetstar Asia, VietJet and Bangkok Airways.

In addition to SAE, Airbus also operates a Customer Services Centre at Sepang offering specialised aircraft complex repairs embodiment, structure repair design and Flight Hour Services (FHS) operations.

Malaysia is also the regional hub for Airbus Helicopters, offering customer support, MRO and training services from its facility at Subang. The facility has recently been expanded with the opening of a new state-of-the-art helicopter completion and delivery centre for the region.

Airbus and Boeing Report July 2019 Commercial Aircraft Orders and Deliveries - Defense & Security Monitor,"Tue, 20 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vZHNtLmZvcmVjYXN0aW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC5jb20vMjAxOS8wOC8yMC9haXJidXMtYW5kLWJvZWluZy1yZXBvcnQtanVseS0yMDE5LWNvbW1lcmNpYWwtYWlyY3JhZnQtb3JkZXJzLWFuZC1kZWxpdmVyaWVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Boeing Conducts 500th 737 MAX Test Flight – Targets Early Q4 Return to Service

by J. Kasper Oestergaard, European Correspondent, Forecast International.

Boeing and Airbus delivered 19 and 69 commercial jets in July 2019, compared to 39 and 77 deliveries, respectively, in the same month last year. With 258 deliveries this year to date, Boeing is 159 shipments behind last year’s total for the first seven months of the year. Airbus delivered a total of 458 jets from January to July, compared to 380 during the same period last year. Boeing’s deliveries have taken a severe hit since the March 10 crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, a 737 MAX, and the subsequent deliveries halt and grounding of the fleet. Boeing decided on March 14 to suspend all deliveries of 737 MAX jets. The crashes were with a high degree of certainty caused by the aircraft’s Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), which suddenly activated in response to erroneous angle of attack information. In 2018, Boeing delivered 806 jets (763 in 2017), with Airbus handing over 800 (718 in 2017).

In July, Boeing delivered two 737 NGs. Boeing is still producing 737 MAX jets at a reduced rate of 42 aircraft per month and thereby building up an inventory of aircraft ready to be shipped. During 2018, Boeing raised its 737 production rate to 52 and was planning a further increase to 57 per month from June this year. Producing the 737 MAX at a reduced rate will allow the company to prioritize additional resources to focus on returning the 737 MAX to flight. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has established a Boeing 737 MAX Joint Authorities Technical Review (JATR) comprising a team of experts from the FAA, NASA, and international aviation authorities. The review sessions commenced on April 29 and the JATR’s work is ongoing. On May 16, Boeing announced that it had completed development of the updated software for the 737 MAX and that it had flown the aircraft with updated MCAS software for more than 360 hours on 207 flights. On May 23, the FAA held a full-day meeting with representatives from 33 global regulatory bodies to discuss the process for bringing the 737 MAX back into service. On June 26, Boeing announced that the FAA has identified an additional requirement that it has asked the company to address as it updates the software, and Boeing is now working to implement this. On August 5, Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg announced that the company has conducted almost 500 737 MAX test flights with updated software. According to the Associated Press, Boeing is currently working on new software for the 737 MAX that will use a second flight control computer to make the system more reliable. It remains unclear when the 737 MAX will return to service. Boeing’s best estimate is that the jet could be approved “early in the fourth quarter.” The largest operator of the grounded jet, Southwest Airlines, has canceled all 737 MAX flights through early January. To date, Boeing has delivered 387 737 MAXs, of which 57 were delivered in Q1 2019. A total of 256 737 MAX jets were delivered in 2018, up from 74 in 2017. In July, Boeing also delivered three 767s, two 777s, and 12 787s. Boeing recently raised the monthly Dreamliner production rate to 14 aircraft. Boeing has handed over 90 787s year-to-date. The company delivered 145 787s in 2018, up from 136 in 2017. In connection with Boeing’s second quarter 2019 earnings report, Muilenburg announced that Boeing plans to increase 777F production due to 777X delays, but provided no further details.

In July, Airbus delivered two A220s, 52 A320s (7 CEO / 45 NEO), seven A330s, seven A350s, and a single A380. A total of 386 A320neo family aircraft were delivered in 2018, up from 181 and 68 in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Later this year, Airbus expects to increase the A320 production rate to 60 aircraft per month. Furthermore, the company is targeting a raise to 63 jets per month from 2021. Airbus has delivered 60 A350s year-to-date and delivered 93 A350s in 2018, up from 78 in 2017, and recently increased the monthly production rate to 10. Airbus is considering a further increase to 13 A350s per month, but a date has yet to be announced. With the ramp-up of A350 XWB deliveries combined with a higher A320 production rate, Airbus has nearly eliminated Boeing’s deliveries lead in recent years. Following the tragic 737 MAX events, Airbus is almost certain to deliver more aircraft in 2019 than Boeing will.

Turning to the orders race, Boeing had a solid month in July, logging 31 gross orders, all 777 and 787 widebody jets (no cancellations => net of 31). Boeing’s July bookings included 20 787 Dreamliners for Korean Air: 10 787-9s and 10 787-10s. Korean Air committed to buying these aircraft at the Paris Air Show in June and has now firmed up the order. In addition, an undisclosed customer ordered a single 787-8. Qatar Airways firmed up five 777 freighters (Paris commitment), with China Airlines firming up three (Paris commitment of six 777Fs). Finally, an undisclosed customer placed an order for two 777-300ERs. Year-to-date, Boeing has accumulated 139 gross orders (227 cancellations => -88 net new orders). For the full year 2018, Boeing booked 893 net new orders (1,008 gross orders).

In the orders race, Airbus had a disappointing month and booked 33 gross orders but, at the same time, reported 42 cancellations, resulting in nine net cancellations. In July, Republic Airways canceled an order for 40 A220-300s. Airbus’ July orders were a mix of A320neo narrowbodies and A330 and A350 widebodies. The largest orders were 20 A350-900s for Air China and eight A330-900s for Virgin Atlantic. The Virgin Atlantic order was announced at the Paris Air Show. For 2019 to date, Airbus reports 246 gross orders (167 cancellations => net of 79). Of the cancellations, 31 were due to Emirates’ decision earlier this year to reduce its A380 order book. This subsequently forced Airbus to announce that it will cease A380 production in 2021. In 2018, Airbus landed a total of 747 net new orders (831 gross orders), thereby losing the 2018 orders race as Boeing had accumulated 893 net new orders. Airbus had retained an orders lead over its rival every year since 2012.

On July 31, 2019, Airbus had a backlog of 7,198 jets, of which 6,253, or 87 percent, are A220 and A320ceo/neo family narrowbodies, not far below the company’s all-time backlog record high of 7,577 jets set in December 2018. By the end of July 2019, Boeing’s backlog (total unfilled orders after ASC 606 adjustments) was 5,745 aircraft, of which 4,599, or 80 percent, are 737 NG/MAX narrowbody jets. Boeing’s all-time backlog high of 5,964 aircraft was set in August 2018. The number of Airbus aircraft to be built and delivered represents 9.0 years of shipments at the 2018 production level. In comparison, Boeing’s backlog would “only” last 7.1 years. This year to date, Boeing’s book-to-bill ratio, calculated as orders divided by deliveries, is negative. Airbus’ book-to-bill ratio is 0.17. In 2018, Boeing boasted a book-to-bill ratio of 1.11, with Airbus at 0.93. In 2017, Boeing booked 912 net new orders for a book-to-bill ratio of 1.20. That same year, Airbus booked 1,109 net new orders for a book-to-bill ratio of 1.54.

2019 Forecast

Forecast International’s Platinum Forecast System® is a breakthrough in forecasting technology. Among many other features, Platinum provides 15-year production forecasts. The author has used the Platinum Forecast System® to retrieve the latest delivery forecasts and, for 2019, Forecast International’s analysts expect Boeing and Airbus to deliver 724 and 875 large commercial jets, respectively. The 2019 forecast for Boeing was 904 prior to the second 737 MAX crash and the subsequent grounding of the fleet and temporary cut in the production rate. These are the latest “live” forecast figures (adjusted frequently by FI analysts as new information comes in).

Prior to the second 737 MAX crash, in connection with the release of its 2018 earnings report in late January, Boeing announced it was targeting between 895 and 905 commercial jet deliveries in 2019, a 12-13 percent increase from 2018. Boeing has yet to announce a revised figure and is likely awaiting the 737 MAX’s return to service before providing updated guidance. On February 14, Airbus announced that it aims for 880 to 890 commercial aircraft deliveries in 2019, equal to a 10-11 percent increase from 2018.

Note: Boeing 777-300ER category includes one 777-200LR order placed in October 2018.

MOSCOW, Aug. 15 (Xinhua) -- An Airbus plane with over 200 passengers on board made an emergency landing on Thursday near Moscow shortly after taking off, injuring some 20 people, including five children, authorities said.

The Ural Airlines' flight A321 performed a hard landing near Zhukovsky International Airport, southeast of Moscow, after its engines were struck by birds, the Sputnik news agency quoted Russia's Federal Air Transport Agency as saying.

The aircraft was traveling from Moscow to Simferopol in Crimea, with 226 passengers and seven crew members on board.

Sputnik reported that the plane landed in a corn field near the airport. All passengers have been quickly evacuated and people who got injured in the incident have been sent to nearby hospitals."
40 Success Stories: When Airbus Prompted the Industry to Watch This Airspace - APEX Media,"Tue, 06 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vYXBleC5hZXJvL2FydGljbGVzLzQwLXN1Y2Nlc3Mtc3Rvcmllcy1haXJidXMtcHJvbXB0ZWQtaW5kdXN0cnktd2F0Y2gtYWlyc3BhY2Uv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Aircraft Interiors 40 Success Stories: When Airbus Prompted the Industry to Watch This Airspace Share

To celebrate the 40th anniversary of APEX EXPO this year, APEX Media is looking back at its members’ most significant achievements. Today, we explore how Airspace by Airbus pioneered a new approach to aircraft cabin design.

In April 2014, Airbus unveiled a clean-sheet aircraft cabin design for the A350 XWB and opened a dedicated Customer Definition Centre (CDC) to give airlines a “one-stop-shop” where they could design and customize their A350 XWBs, all in one place.

Two years later, at Aircraft Interiors Expo in 2016, the OEM announced that the design features of the cabin – which won Airbus the 2016 “Best of the Best” Red Dot Award for Product Design – would be rolled out across the rest of the Airbus product line under a new brand, Airspace by Airbus.

Ingo Wuggetzer, VP Cabin Marketing at Airbus, explained, “The most exciting thing about Airspace for me personally is that this approach goes beyond the product – it’s the establishment of a cabin brand that is targeting not only the B2B market but also the B2C market, the passenger.”

The CDC has also been expanded to cater to the OEM’s A330 and A320 family customers. Wuggetzer said, “The CDC has transformed the industry. It was built on a clear process designed for the modular cabin platform of the A350, to be efficient in answering customer questions and to accelerate the definition phase tremendously, all while providing inspiration and creating unique airline cabins.”

The Airspace cabin is due to launch on board A320 family aircraft with JetBlue in 2020. Wuggetzer is confident the two parties are creating “a cabin product that will bring the wide-body passenger experience to A320 family aircraft.”

The A320 Airspace cabin will definitely feature the XL bins, which launched with American Airlines earlier this year, as well as a new sidewall panel design that delivers an extra inch of shoulder clearance and Airspace lavatories with mood lighting, aroma dispensers and soothing sounds.

It will also see the introduction of the “hero light” – a lighting strip that runs the length of the cabin ceiling. Designed to match the new Airspace XL bins, the “hero light” is fully customizable, offering branding opportunities that will be visible even when the overhead bin doors are open during turnarounds.

“Of course, there will be unique JetBlue-specific highlights – watch this space!” Wuggetzer said. “We have already more than 800 Airspace cabins on order for the A320 Family – a fantastic pre-entry into service endorsement.”

10 Fun Facts About the Airbus A380 - The Points Guy,"Thu, 08 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9uZXdzL2Z1bi1mYWN0cy1hYm91dC10aGUtYWlyYnVzLWEzODAv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Ah, the Airbus A380. We can talk all day about whether it's a beauty or an ungainly giant, but one fact is indisputable: It's the largest passenger aircraft ever made. If you've ever flown on one, you'll know that if offers an incredibly smooth ride and lots of room; and if you've ever seen one take off, you'll know that it's an exceptionally quiet airplane. But the end is near for the plane sometimes known as the flying whale.

It's never been a commercial success, and Airbus decided this year to end production in 2021. Big twin-engine jets like the Boeing 777 and Airbus' own A350, which can carry almost as many passengers but with far lower costs, effectively killed the big four-engined beast. It's the same fate that hit the Boeing 747.

RELATED:

It's expected that about 250 Airbus A380s will have been made by the time production ends, assuming all current orders are filled. But regardless of commercial success, we at TPG have a soft spot for the A380 — it's the favorite airplane of The Points Guy himself, after all.

Why are we so fond of it? After reading about these 10 facts that make the 380 stand out, you'll see.

It's really, really big

The A380 has a maximum takeoff weight of almost 1.3 million pounds — as much as seven Boeing 737-800s, or 30 percent more than the biggest 747 model. It's the only airplane flying today with a full-length upper deck. It can carry up to 600 gallons of water, feeding the onboard showers as well as the standard bathrooms and galleys. Its maximum fuel capacity is over 85,000 gallons, or about the same as 5,300 Toyota Camrys.

But in one aspect, the 747 has it beat: it's still the longest passenger airplane in the world, at 250 feet versus 238.

Building it almost proved too much for Airbus

A380s are built in Toulouse, France, but their parts come from all over Europe (and beyond: today's commercial jets are truly globalized products).

The wings and Rolls-Royce engines are made in the UK, the fuselage in Germany as well as France, the horizontal tail plane in Spain — all of this comes together by ship and truck, and assembled within painstakingly designed and enforced tolerance parameters. Just like Boeing does. So it was a shock to Airbus engineers when they were getting ready to put together the first A380 in 2005 and the pieces didn't fit. Or rather: the wires designed by the German unit of the company were too short to meet the connectors in the fuselage section built in France. Before joining the parts, they had to redesign the wiring, all 330 miles of it. (You read that right: 330 miles.)

That snafu took months to fix and cost the company billions. In hindsight, it may have been a sign that luck was not with the giant. Or just that large, multinational industrial processes are extremely complicated, especially for a company that had never done anything on that scale before.

Emirates bought almost half of all A380s

When production of the A380 finally did get underway and customers began flying it — starting with Singapore Airlines in 2007 — Airbus was confident that orders would pour in. But that never happened. Only Emirates really loved the big jet, so much so that it has bought 40% of all A380s made. The airline's boss, Sir Tim Clark, was famously a great proponent of the A380; in 2017, when the program had not been cancelled yet, he told TPG that more airlines should buy it. None did.

It costs half a billion dollars a pop

And what if someone did want to buy an A380? How much money would one have to shell out to take home the biggest aircraft you can buy today?

A new A380 costs almost half a billion dollars. More precisely, according to the list prices published by Airbus, $445.6 million. But airlines almost never pay full price; negotiations for commercial-jet purchases are long and complex, and discounts are always part of large orders. In fact, many airlines don't even buy their planes, but lease them.

There were going to be cargo and VIP A380s

One of the very few people in the world with enough money to buy an A380 as a private jet almost did. Prince Alwaleed bin Talal of Saudi Arabia —the owner of significant chunks of Citigroup, Twitter and Lyft — signed an order to buy an A380 at the Dubai Air Show in 2007. He later decided not to take it, preferring instead to continue using his 747. To this day, no A380s are used as VIP jets.

There was also going to be a cargo version of the A380, but it never got built after FedEx cancelled its order. The only place where you'll ever find cargo A380s is Ebay, where desktop-model replicas can get really expensive.

It can have more than 600 seats

No wonder that the A380 should have the biggest seating capacity of any airliner that ever flew.

Seat counts range dramatically among airlines that operate it, ranging from a low of 379 seats on some Singapore configurations to 615 on the high-density layout that Emirates flies on some routes. Those 615 seats are the undisputed world record for most people ever on a passenger airplane. (The record for most people ever on a plane belongs to El Al. During a 1991 rescue operation carrying Ethiopian Jews to Israel, a cargo 747 was crammed with more than 1,000 people.)

It's the only plane with a shower

If you want to take a shower in flight and you don't own a very large private jet, your only choice is the A380, flying first class on Emirates or Etihad. And what if you want your personal butler on a plane? Only the A380 offers that, to passengers who have a lot of money (or a savvy strategy to use their points), in the ultra-first class known as The Residence aboard Etihad.

On the other hand, to experience the famous onboard bar on Emirates, you just need a ticket in business or first class.

It can fly for 17 hours, or just one

You will have plenty of time to enjoy that bar on the fourth-longest nonstop flight in the world, Emirates' Auckland-to-Dubai route, the longest A380 flight currently scheduled. It spends on average about 17 hours in the air.

As for the shortest A380 flight, it's just one hour from Dubai to Muscat, Oman, also on Emirates. Which of course we had to review, because we really are A380 buffs.

It's flown with joysticks

What is that thing to the left of TPG senior writer JT Genter — obviously very happy to be sitting in an A380 captain's seat — that looks like a video game joystick? It is indeed a joystick — the trademark of every Airbus except the early A300 and A310.

Boeings have traditional yokes, but Airbus has dispensed with those since the 1980s, when it introduced the A320, the first airliner using fly-by-wire. That means pilots send their inputs to a computer, which then moves the plane's control surfaces. On Airbuses, they do so using those joysticks — or sidesticks, as pilots call them.

It has no successors

Sometime in the 2030s, likely, the last revenue flight of an A380 will touch down. What will take its place? In short: nothing. No plane currently being designed matches its size or capabilities.

After 2021, the new holder of the title for largest passenger airplane in the world will be... well, the same as the old one. The Boeing 747 will become again the biggest guy around. But that's a bit of a fiction: Boeing has not formally closed down the assembly line for the current 747-8 passenger model, but that doesn't mean that anyone's actually buying it. The fabled Queen of the Skies is just as dead, commercially, as its would-be European rival. If you consider airplanes that are actually being produced and sold, not just offered in a sales brochure, then the biggest one in the post-A380 era will be the Boeing 777-9. That is a beautiful airplane, but it is made to be practical and efficient, not an opulent flying palace.

Onboard showers and Etihad's unique The Residence will die with the A380. Good thing we have an article telling you about the best ways to use your points and miles to cross the oceans in that unique, exceptional machine."

Airbus delivers state-of-the-art H145 helicopters to New Zealand Emergency Medical Services - Airbus,"Tue, 13 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOS0wOC1haXJidXMtZGVsaXZlcnMtc3RhdGUtb2YtdGhlLWFydC1oMTQ1LWhlbGljb3B0ZXJzLXRvLW5ldy16ZWFsYW5k0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Christchurch - Airbus has today delivered two H145 helicopters to the New Zealand Helicopter Emergency Medical Services at a ceremony at the GCH Aviation Group headquarters.

Airbus Australia Pacific Managing Director Andrew Mathewson said these were the first two H145 helicopters in emergency medical services (EMS) configuration in the New Zealand market.

“I’m proud that Airbus’ helicopters are providing vital medical services and assisting the communities between Christchurch and Dunedin operated by New Zealand Helicopter Emergency Services.

“We at Airbus are privileged to work alongside local stakeholders, and play our part in supporting such lifesaving aeromedical operations, as the country grows its focus on this industry.

“A key design factor of the H145 helicopter is to be able to configure the helicopter to provide medical and rescue operations for specialised emergency services.

“This multi-purpose helicopter is tailored for emergency medical services and law enforcement duties, along with aerial work, passenger transport - including private and business aviation - and offshore operations. For multi-mission operators, the H145 can be reconfigured for different roles quickly and easily.

“Designed to deliver excellent performance throughout the flight, the H145 offers capability and flexibility, especially in conditions where the aircraft is operating at high altitude and where time is of the essence,” he said.

The H145 is the market leader for emergency medical services and rescue missions, thanks to its well-established HEMS heritage with its BK117 and EC145 predecessors. The quietest in its class and equipped with state-of-the-art Helionix avionics suite, this twin engine helicopter offers exceptional performance along with upgraded main and tail rotor systems. This guarantees an unprecedented level of performance in both hover and one-engine inoperative conditions.

The Fenestron technology brings benefits such as improved flight and ground safety to customers, as well as reduced power demand in forward flight, and lower sound and vibration levels. Included in the Fenestron is a redesigned tail gearbox that contributes to lower maintenance costs. It incorporates a duplex tail rotor actuator and dual hydraulic circuits – installed in a new damage-tolerant all-composite tail boom.

With a global fleet of more than 1,400 helicopters of the H145 family, the fleet has accumulated more than five million flight hours. In New Zealand alone, there are currently 41 H145 family of helicopters deployed for aeromedical, search-and-rescue, utility and business aviation purposes.

The ARH Tiger: Delivering on its promise - Airbus,"Mon, 19 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDE5LTA4LXRoZS1hcmgtdGlnZXItZGVsaXZlcmluZy1vbi1pdHMtcHJvbWlzZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Article: Belén Morant - Read more in Rotor magazine N°116

Last year the helicopter registered 65% availability and 90% spare-parts availability. But, most importantly of all, it fuelled the optimism of a customer with complete faith in the operational capabilities and reliability of its combat helicopter.

In 2001, the Australian Army ordered 22 ARHs, with the first of the deliveries being made in December 2004. The Australian Tiger was a somewhat different animal to its European brothers, however, on account of its increased armament capability and its resulting complexity, a response to Australia’s desire for a platform capable of firing both missiles and cannons.

A turning point

“The ARH Tiger is an extraordinary machine, that outperforms anything in its class,” says Andrew Mathewson, Airbus Australia Pacific’s Managing Director. “But in the first few years the complexity of both the system and the supply process made it an aircraft that was difficult to maintain. The Tiger was unable to show everything it was capable of and, as you might expect, there was quite a lot of discontent in the Army, with some calling for it to be replaced by another helicopter.

Since 2014 with the agreement of a new performance based contract, we devoted all our efforts, both in Australia and Europe to simplifying supply chain performance, improving the design, reliability and optimising our interaction with the CASG and end customer in Army. Above all, though, we took the crucially important step of focusing all our attention and energy on the end user rather than wasting time and effort on contractual engagements that didn’t really deliver capability to the customer.

An example of this new collaboration is the way in which operational maintenance and deeper maintenance is carried out. Thanks to the close relationship that Airbus’s experts, who know the product inside out, now enjoy with the customer’s maintenance teams, who have a perfect command of operational needs, the maintenance process is optimised, bringing the best out of both teams.

A new era

The improvements made in fleet availability and the aircraft’s capabilities were quickly demonstrated in military exercises. The Tiger’s latest notable success came with its deployment of four ARH Tiger aboard HMAS Canberra, which contributes to the Australian Defence Force aim of establishing an Amphibious Task Force with the enhanced security provided by the Tiger.

“Last April, Airbus was awarded an extension of the Tiger through-life support contract until 2025 by the Australian Department of Defence,” says Andrew, looking resolutely to the future. “It’s a show of faith on the part of the customer and it lets us know we’re on the right path. Our next major challenge now is to prove that we’re able to keep the Tiger updated and operational through to 2040 by addressing obsolescence problems. The Tiger still has a lot to offer. It’s the most effective and efficient option for the government, and we’re going to prove that to them.”

ARH Tiger A Pilots Perspective show more show less ARH Tiger A Pilots Perspective

Everybody knows the Tiger had a difficult introduction into service, but importantly, the message people miss is that in the past two to three years, we’ve really turned a corner with the ARH. The ARH is ready today; the pilots are trained today to go and to support our troops in operation. And we can do that by day, night, all weather conditions, quite effectively.

Team AllWays Air Racing certainly thinks so. The team is setting its sights on accelerating the development of electric flight technology at Air Race E, and inspiring more women and girls to enter air races.

To say that Casey Erickson is an aviation enthusiast would be an understatement. The captain of Team AllWays Air Racing is an experienced aerobatics and race pilot, helming everything from gliders and cargo planes to helicopters and airships. Today, she and her team are busy crafting a custom aircraft for Air Race E based on the design of a home-built Formula One racing aircraft. With a throwback name and retro paint scheme, the aircraft is a very modern tribute to racing machines of the past, which they hope will push the envelope of electric flight.

Racing pushes the envelope of innovation. It serves as a conduit for new and untried technologies that can trickle down to aviation at large.

5 questions with Casey Erickson, Captain of Team AllWays Air Racing

Q. Why did your team decide to enter Air Race E?

Initially, we were working on a new aircraft that could compete in International Formula One (IF1) air racing. But the model that we ultimately decided to build seemed like a better fit for an electric motor due to the excellent aerodynamics. Our original plan was to try and break National Aeronautic Association (NAA) electric aircraft speed records during the off-season. But then we heard about Air Race E. We signed up almost immediately!

Q. Can you give us some insight on the aircraft you’re currently working on? What is your approach?

After talking to a number of different aircraft designers, we decided to go with a derivative of the Snoshoo (i.e. an American home-built Formula One racing aircraft that was designed by Alan VanMeter and A.J. Smith). Even though the early design had been around for some time, no one had built the first-generation Snoshoo SR1 and actually raced it prior to 2018. We conducted some major redesign to the fuselage and wing, including an unprecedented amount of computational fluid analysis for an IF1 aircraft. We named the aircraft Erickson Special ER-1 (Erickson Race Model 1), which is how pilots named their racing machines in the 1930s. And the paint scheme is a throwback to the iconic 1970s-era Porsche 917 that raced at Le Mans. We want to pay tribute to those that came before us, while producing a thoroughly modern aircraft.

Q. What sets your team apart in this race?

Our engineer (Jon Latall) and the build team (A.J. Smith, Craig Catto and Bobby Graham, with a lot of technical advice from Justin Meaders), are top notch. On a personal level, I have a fierce desire to compete and win the inaugural Air Race E competition!

Q. For you, what is the most exciting aspect of the race?

It’s the thrill and adventure of racing aircraft, especially in different locations around the world. In addition, I hope to inspire women and girls to chase their dreams. Unfortunately, very few women have raced airplanes. I would love to see that change with more women entering air races.

Q. How important is electric flight to the future of aviation?

Electric flight will be one of many ways to help reduce our carbon footprint. Racing pushes the envelope of innovation. It serves as a conduit for new and untried technologies that can trickle down to aviation at large because it helps us to learn from our mistakes, and find what works and what doesn’t. Engineering is an iterative process, and racing speeds up those iterations. That’s a great thing for all of us!

Casey Erickson is captain of Team AllWays Air Racing, a participating team in Air Race E, which will become the world’s first all-electric airplane race when it launches its inaugural series of international races in 2020. The demand for speed, performance and power management under the rigors of a competitive race environment provides the perfect platform for the development and promotion of cleaner, faster and more technologically advanced electric motors. Airbus is the Official Founding Partner of the series."
CIMON is back on Earth after 14 months on the ISS - Airbus,"Wed, 28 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOS0wOC1jaW1vbi1pcy1iYWNrLW9uLWVhcnRoLWFmdGVyLTE0LW1vbnRocy1vbi10aGUtaXNz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A successor to the technology experiment will have additional functionality, and is currently being built and tested by Airbus on behalf of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) Space Administration.

Second version of CIMON will also use Watson AI technology from IBM

Scientific elements of the project are supervised by the Ludwig-Maximilian University Hospital in Munich (Klinikum der Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München).

Friedrichshafen – CIMON has returned to Earth: the Crew Interactive Mobile CompanioN (CIMON), the astronaut assistant featuring artificial intelligence, arrived back on its home planet on board a Dragon spacecraft from US company SpaceX. The SpaceX-18 undocked from the International Space Station (ISS) on 27 August 2019 at 16:59 Central European Summer Time (CEST). The capsule then touched down in the Pacific Ocean around 480 kilometres southwest of Los Angeles and was recovered at 22:21h CEST.

“We expect to have the first CIMON back in Germany by the end of October,” says Dr Christian Karrasch, CIMON Project Manager at the DLR Space Administration. “The CIMON technology experiment has lived up to all our expectations,” Karrasch continues, summarising the past few months. “During its first mission in space – a 90-minute session with German ESA astronaut Alexander Gerst on the ISS in November 2018 – CIMON demonstrated its ability to work well in microgravity conditions and to successfully interact with astronauts. We are still incredibly happy with the only artificial intelligence mission to take place on the space station to date, and have been working on a new, enhanced model for several months. The first CIMON has allowed us to lay the foundations for using social assistance systems in space – systems that support astronauts with their tasks and that at some point may even take some work off their hands.”

Just like its predecessor, the second CIMON is being built by Airbus in Friedrichshafen and Bremen on behalf of the DLR Space Administration and is being funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Energie; BMWi). Airbus in Friedrichshafen has assembled and tested the hardware for the new CIMON, while Airbus in Bremen is working to improve the software for flight and attitude control. IBM is implementing new AI features. “All in all there are several upgrades, including better microphones, a more robust computer, improved flight and attitude control, and new software features for conversation – for example in the areas of voice recognition, conversational skills and understanding intentions,” explains Till Eisenberg, CIMON Project Manager at Airbus.

Matthias Biniok, Project Manager at IBM, adds: “CIMON represents a unique application scenario in an extreme working environment. And we’ve seen that by using AI technology – in our case IBM Watson – we can support astronauts in their work. Our primary objective for CIMON’s next stage of development is to improve the comprehension of speech in specific contexts and the analysis of emotion in language.”

Ethical questions around the future use of CIMON are being examined and evaluated by medical experts at Ludwig-Maximilian University (LMU) in Munich. Privacy rights are affected by the interaction between humans and machines, as CIMON records, processes and interprets images and audio of astronauts. There needs to be high technical standards in data security while recognising that trust in such systems is an important factor for teamwork between humans and machines. Basically, this means deciding what CIMON is permitted to do, know and say. “The new CIMON has an in-built switch that allows the flow of data from all cameras and microphones to be interrupted from the ISS. This means that the astronaut is in control of CIMON at all times, which we thought was particularly important,” says LMU scientist Dr Judith Buchheim.

DLR Space Administration, which is responsible for German contributions to the European Space Agency (ESA), is working with ESA to send the new version of CIMON to the ISS in December 2019 so that it can benefit from crew time with astronauts.

The first CIMON arrived on the ISS as a technology experiment on 2 July 2018. On 15 November 2018, the robotic assistant with a smart ‘face’ received global attention when it was deployed for the first time: it successfully ‘worked’ together with German ESA astronaut Alexander Gerst for 90 minutes. CIMON demonstrated its basic functions, such as its ability to fly in microgravity conditions using autonomous navigation, performing several turns and movements in every direction, and was able to search for Gerst’s face, recognise it, make eye contact and speak to him. It then showed the instructions for an experiment on its ‘face’ – a display in the centre of the sphere – and played music. It also used its cameras to record a video and take a photo of Gerst.

In 2018, the CIMON project won the US ‘Popular Science Award’ in the category ‘Best of What’s New in 2018’ in aerospace. Airbus was also awarded the ‘2019 German Innovation Prize’ (Deutsche Innovationspreis) in the large companies category (#dip19).

•CIMON – the idea

Developed and built in Germany, CIMON is a technology experiment to support astronauts and increase the efficiency of their work. CIMON is able to show and explain information and instructions for scientific experiments and repairs. The voice-controlled access to documents and media is an advantage, as the astronauts can keep both hands free. It can also be used as a mobile camera to save astronaut crew time. In particular, CIMON could be used to perform routine tasks, such as documenting experiments, searching for objects and taking inventory. CIMON can also see, hear, understand and speak. CIMON can orientate itself using its ‘eyes’ – a stereo camera and a high-resolution camera that it uses for facial recognition – as well as two other cameras fitted to its sides that it uses for photos and video documentation. Ultrasound sensors measure distances to recognise potential collisions. Its ‘ears’ consist of eight microphones to identify directions, and an additional directional microphone to improve voice recognition. Its ‘mouth’ is a loudspeaker that it can use to speak or play music. At the heart of the AI for language understanding is the IBM Watson AI technology from the IBM Cloud. CIMON has not been equipped with self-learning capabilities and requires active human instruction. The AI used for autonomous navigation was provided by Airbus and is designed for movement planning and object recognition. Twelve internal rotors allow CIMON to move and rotate freely in all directions. This means it can turn towards the astronaut when addressed, nod and shake its head, and follow the astronaut – either autonomously or on command.

The partners:

The interactive astronaut assistant was developed and built by Airbus in Friedrichshafen and Bremen on behalf of the German Aerospace Center (Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt; DLR) Space Administration and funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Energie). Watson AI technology from the IBM Cloud provides voice-controlled artificial intelligence. Scientists from the Ludwig-Maximilian University Hospital in Munich (Klinikum der Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München, LMU) helped develop and oversee the human aspects of the assistance system. An approximately 50-strong project team from DLR, Airbus, IBM and LMU have been working on the implementation of CIMON since August 2016. CIMON has been on board the ISS since 2 July 2018. It is no coincidence that its name is reminiscent of ‘Professor Simon Wright’, the robotic assistant – or the ‘flying brain’ – from the Japanese science fiction series ‘Captain Future’."
AirAsia X orders 12 more A330neo and 30 A321XLR aircraft - Airbus,"Fri, 30 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOS0wOC1haXJhc2lhLXgtb3JkZXJzLTEyLW1vcmUtYTMzMG5lby1hbmQtMzAtYTMyMXhsci1haXJjcmFmdNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"AirAsia X, the long-haul unit of the AirAsia Group, has finalised a firm order with Airbus for an additional 12 A330-900 and 30 A321XLR aircraft. The contract was signed by Tan Sri Rafidah Aziz, Chairman, AirAsia X Berhad and Guillaume Faury, Chief Executive Officer, Airbus in Kuala Lumpur today, in the presence of Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the Prime Minister of Malaysia.

Tan Sri Tony Fernandes, Chief Executive Officer, AirAsia Group, who was present at the signing, said: “This order reaffirms our selection of the A330neo as the most efficient choice for our future wide-body fleet. In addition, the A321XLR offers the longest flying range of any single-aisle aircraft and will enable us to introduce services to new destinations. Together, these aircraft are perfect partners for long-haul low-cost operations and will allow us to build further on our market leading position in this fast-growing sector.”

Tan Sri Rafidah Aziz, Chairman of AirAsia X Berhad, said: “Today’s announcement is testament to our confidence and commitment to longer haul air travel. This is the future of our long-haul operations. The A330neo’s revolutionary new features and modifications will move our long-haul service sectors up to a higher level and allow AirAsia X to look at expanding beyond the eight-hour flight radius, such as to Europe, for example.”

Guillaume Faury, Chief Executive Officer, Airbus commented: “AirAsia X has been the pioneer of the long-haul low-cost model in the Asia-Pacific region. This new order for the A330neo and A321XLR is a true endorsement of the Airbus solution to meet mid-market demand with a combination of single-aisle and wide-body products. This powerful solution will provide AirAsia X with the lowest possible operating costs to expand its network and enable even more people to fly further than ever before.”

The new contract increases the number of A330neo aircraft ordered by AirAsia X to 78, reaffirming the carrier’s status as the largest airline customer for the type. Meanwhile, the A321XLR order sees the wider AirAsia Group strengthen its position as the world’s largest airline customer for the A320 Family, having now ordered a total of 622 aircraft.

AirAsia X currently operates a fleet of 36 A330-300s on services to points within the Asia-Pacific region and the Middle East. In addition, in August, the first A330neo joined the fleet of AirAsia’s Bangkok-based long haul affiliate, AirAsia X Thailand. The aircraft is the first of two leased A330neos joining the airline’s Thai affiliate by the end of the year.

The A321XLR is the next evolutionary step from the A321LR which responds to market needs for even more range and payload, creating more value for the airlines. From 2023, it will deliver an unprecedented Xtra Long Range of up to 4,700 nm – 15% more than the A321LR and with 30% lower fuel burn per seat compared with previous generation competitor aircraft.

The A330neo is a true new generation aircraft building on the A330’s success and leveraging on A350 XWB technology. It incorporates the highly efficient new generation Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines, and a new higher span 3D optimised wing with new Sharklets. Together these advances bring a significant reduction in fuel consumption of 25% compared with older generation competitor aircraft of a similar size. The A330 is one of the most popular wide-body families ever, having received over 1,700 orders from more than 120 customers.

I was just talking to my pal Jason Rabinowitz about airplanes (we do this often) and I was asking why the Airbus A330neo was such a big deal. I actually tracked down our high-end chat:

Me: “Why do we care so much about the A330neo? Just b/c that is all we have right now to celebrate?”

Jason: “It new. And it all we got.”

Don’t get me wrong. I have still been excited watching the new A330 go into service, but it doesn’t match the excitement of the 787 Dreamliner, 747 Intercontinental, or A350 XWB.

The day after my award-winning chat with Jason, I received an invite from Delta Air Lines to come check out one of their new Airbus A330-900neos at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA). Perfect."

A350 premium economy trends towards narrower 2-4-2 layout - Runway Girl Network,"Tue, 27 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTkvMDgvYTM1MC1wcmVtaXVtLWVjb25vbXktdHJlbmRzLXRvd2FyZHMtbmFycm93ZXItMi00LTItbGF5b3V0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"What does premium economy look like? For most of the life of this middle cabin — launched in 1992 by either Virgin Atlantic or EVA Air, which is an interesting story in itself — airlines have largely agreed on the number of seats in each row. Eight on a Boeing 747 or 777 or Airbus A380, seven on the Airbus A330, A340 or Boeing 787.

But the A350 was different from the start, with early operators split about whether to install seven seats in a 2-3-2 configuration or eight in a 2-4-2 layout.

This split wasn’t along the usual lines of airlines renowned for offering additional inflight comfort, either. Singapore Airlines and Cathay Pacific were offering eight seats across while Lufthansa and China Airlines fit just seven in the same space.

As deliveries have proceeded apace — at the end of July Airbus’ orders and deliveries spreadsheet shows 295 of the A350 are in operation — the vast majority of airlines that have installed premium economy have chosen eight-abreast seating.

These 2-4-2 airlines include Delta, Air China, Vietnam Airlines, China Eastern, Philippine Airlines, Iberia, China Southern, Japan Airlines (in its domestic Class J product, which is akin to an international premium economy seat), Virgin Atlantic and British Airways. I understand that Air France and Aeroflot will also be installing eight-abreast seating in their own forthcoming A350s.

The one exception to the rule is, interestingly, Frenchbee, the long-haul low-cost carrier from Groupe Dubreuil, based in (unsurprisingly from the name of the airline) France. Its Premium Class is in the more spacious 2-3-2 configuration, which is especially interesting given that the ultra-narrow seats down the back are in the 3-4-3 layout.

(Another detail to note is Air Caraïbes, also from Groupe Dubreuil, which has 3-4-3 down the back in its economy Class Soleil, but the regular mainline carrier 3-3-3 economy class seats in its Class Caraïbes, which is a sort of ‘premium economy lite’ offering.)

One might have expected given the received wisdom — and experience with the Boeing 777’s transition from nine-abreast to ten-abreast among full service airlines — that carriers would seek to maximize the “comfort canyon” between economy and premium economy in order to create the greatest demand for upselling to what is the most profitable cabin in the aircraft.

That would mean that carriers with better economy class seating should theoretically look to offer better premium economy seating, and vice versa.

It’s fascinating to see that this does not seem to be the case, and it will be equally fascinating to see whether today’s — and tomorrow’s — increasingly mobile, vocal and social passengers notice the detail in space between eight- and seven-abreast.

Newer premium economy seats, like those in economy class, have in many cases been designed to give a feeling of more space compared with previous generations.

These design improvements could well mean that enough passengers don’t notice enough of a difference to think that the extra price of premium economy — some two to three times that of economy class, as a general rule — is still worth it.

But the risk for airlines is that they might be slicing too much density off the meaty thighs of the premium economy golden goose.

The risk for passengers is even greater: if not enough people are upgrading to premium economy because economy class is “too nice”, airlines will see pressure from their accountants to make economy class much less pleasant.

Could the eight-abreast A350 premium economy be what eventually drives regular economy seats into ultra-narrow ten-abreast configurations?

More progress for Airbus's Wayfinder autonomy project - Vertical Magazine,"Wed, 14 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLXdheWZpbmRlci1hdXRvbm9teS1wcm9ncmVzcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus’s Silicon Valley Innovation Center, A3, has released a new video highlighting the progress of its Wayfinder project, which is developing scalable, certifiable autonomy systems for self-piloted aircraft.

Initially developed for the Vahana eVTOL demonstrator, Wayfinder is now being used in other Airbus projects, including the Autonomous Taxi, Take-Off and Landing (ATTOL) demonstrator. A3 by Airbus Image

Launched in 2016 to develop the sense-and-avoid system for the Vahana eVTOL demonstrator, Wayfinder has now been extended to vehicle applications across the Airbus product line. That includes Airbus’s Autonomous Taxi, Take-Off and Landing (ATTOL) demonstrator, an A320 that will be equipped with “a suite of sensors, actuators, and computers to explore the potential of autonomy via computer vision and machine learning,” the Wayfinder team wrote on its blog.

The new video shows a Wayfinder machine learning algorithm in action during a simulated approach to a runway at Toulouse-Blagnac airport. This type of simulation allows the team to quickly develop and test different versions of its software as it works to “teach the aircraft to see and navigate to the runway using deep learning,” as Wayfinder head of software Harvest Zhang explained in a July 10 blog post.

According to Zhang, Wayfinder used the X-Plane Pro flight simulator to generate photorealistic synthetic data for training the convolutional neural network that forms the basis of its computer vision system for ATTOL. “Using synthetic data, our network can reliably detect the runway from several miles away, and runway distance estimates are typically within a few percent of ground truth,” he wrote, acknowledging that “localizer and glideslope deviation estimates are more challenging and need some more work.”

Zhang said that the network performed “surprising well” on real images, despite having only been trained on synthetic images. “As we collect more real flight data, we can begin to explore domain adaptation across different combinations of synthetic and real training data, while recent developments in generative adversarial networks may allow us to blur the distinction between synthetic and real data altogether,” he added.

As the video describes, for Vahana, the Wayfinder team captured training data through the use of drones that emulated how and where the vehicle would fly, and the obstacles it would encounter. The full-scale demonstrator Vahana Alpha One has now completed over 70 test flights with the Wayfinder system on board."
Airbus starts building A220 in Alabama - CNBC,"Mon, 05 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMTkvMDgvMDUvYWlyYnVzLXN0YXJ0cy1idWlsZGluZy1hMjIwLWluLWFsYWJhbWEuaHRtbNIBT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tL2FtcC8yMDE5LzA4LzA1L2FpcmJ1cy1zdGFydHMtYnVpbGRpbmctYTIyMC1pbi1hbGFiYW1hLmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus members celebrate the landing of an Airbus A220-300 aircraft during its presentation in Colomiers near Toulouse, France, July 10, 2018.

""The airplane has substantial backlog, whether it be the 220 and the 320 series where we have over a six-year backlog,"" said Jeff Knittel, CEO of Airbus of America. ""Some of that from the U.S. airlines is a function of being in Alabama, but some of it is just having the right product at the right time.""

The first U.S.-built A220 will not be finished and delivered until well into next year, but the start of production is a major milestone in the Boeing competitor's push to leverage its Alabama base to grow business.

European aerospace giant Airbus is pushing its growth in the U.S. with the start of production in Alabama for its A220 airplane.

This growth is exactly what Airbus had in mind in 2017 when it bought 50.1% of the C Series plane from Canada's Bombardier. The C Series was a single-aisle plane with the capacity to carry 120 to 160 passengers. It was also struggling to attract buyers, given the dominance of Airbus and Boeing in the single-aisle market.

Bombardier, looking for greater financial certainty to grow its other aviation and rail operations, was willing to sell a majority of the C Series and Airbus was looking for a chance to counter Boeing's expansion in smaller single-aisle planes through its courtship of Embraer.

Since buying the majority of the C Series and renaming it the A220, Airbus has leveraged the planes' unique capacity. The company now has firm orders for more than 500 A220s and momentum fueled in part by its assembly plant in Alabama.

With a new assembly line under construction, the A220 will add 400 jobs to Airbus' plant in Mobile and eventually push employment there to more than 1,500 workers. With the U.S. unemployment rate near a 50-year low, finding those workers has been a challenge.

""The labor market is tight, so what we have done is expanded our recruiting efforts across the U.S.,"" said Knittel. ""The good news is, in the Alabama area, the Florida area, reaching over even into Texas, there is a substantial number of high-quality employees available.""

While the A220 has become a success for Airbus, the commercial aviation industry has been focused on Boeing's 737 Max. That plane has been grounded since March following two crashes that killed 346 people.

It's also lead to speculation Airbus can capitalize on the Max grounding to generate more orders for the A220. Knittel said it's not that simple.

""The Max situation really doesn't change what we're doing today. The order book is full, the demand for airplanes is substantial,"" he said. ""This is not something that we can flip the switch and start producing more airplanes.""

"Pontifications: Good A220 endorsement, but Airbus still has cleaning up to do - Leeham News and Analysis","Mon, 05 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxOS8wOC8wNS9wb250aWZpY2F0aW9ucy1nb29kLWEyMjAtZW5kb3JzZW1lbnQtYnV0LWFpcmJ1cy1zdGlsbC1oYXMtY2xlYW5pbmctdXAtdG8tZG8v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Aug. 5, 2019, © Leeham News: Airbus last week won a big, validating commitment from Air France-KLM Group for 60 orders and more options for the A220-300.

The contract won’t be firm until later this year, but the AF Memorandum of Understanding (when converted) brings the A220 order book to 611. There are some other commitments that haven’t yet been converted to orders.

Through mid-July, there were 86 A220s in service. There were 465 Letters of Intent, MOUs and Options before the Air France deal was announced.

But of those firm orders, 110 of them aren’t so firm. In fact, some of them really shouldn’t even be on the books.

Ghost orders

Republic Airways Holdings has an order for 40 A220s and 40 options, a transaction dating to 2009 when Bombardier owned the program.

Republic then owned Frontier Airlines, and the CS300s were intended for this low cost carrier.

But in financial trouble, Republic later sold Frontier to Bill Franke’s Indigo Partners group. Republic now had no airline to use the airplanes. Republic later declared bankruptcy, yet did not shed the orders through reorganization. The airplanes remain on the order book, but deferred indefinitely.

Odyssey Airlines is a UK start up with an order for 10 A220-100s, which also began as a BBD deal for the CS100. The carrier planned to use the aircraft to fly from London City Airport to New York and other cities.

The order was suspect from the beginning because Odyssey was crowd-funding its finances. Unsurprisingly, it hasn’t raised the money needed to start operations. The website doesn’t even come up anymore. Yet the orders are still on the books.

Braathens Regional Airlines has an order for 10 A220-100s. This, too, is a leftover Bombardier deal. The carrier cited poor domestic market conditions for deferring the aircraft.

Lease Corp International, a tiny lessor, was one of the first customers for the C Series—still under Bombardier at the time—but has repeatedly deferred the order. It has 20 on order.

A changing business plan and a contract price that by today’s environment is well above market, LCI is in no hurry to take the airplanes. This, too, is an indefinite deferral.

Ilyushin Finance Corp, a Russian leasing company, and Saudi Gulf Airlines have 30 airplanes between them that are indefinite deferrals. Sanctions against Russia affect delivery to IFC. Saudi ordered Airbus A320neos, with suggestions these would be in lieu of the A220, but the order remains for now.

Like the others, these were also Bombardier deals.

Near bankruptcy

It’s clear the move by Bombardier in 2017 to sell a majority share of the C Series (as it was then known) to Airbus is paying off. Airbus owns 50.01% of the program; Bombardier owns about one-third and a Quebec Province pension fund owns the rest.

Bombardier and the pension fund stand to gain when these recent orders under the Airbus leadership begin delivering.

Teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, Bombardier couldn’t gain traction with airlines and lessors who questioned the company’s ability to survive.

Airbus sealed deals with JetBlue and “Moxy” Airlines at the 2018 Farnborough Air Show, but both were transactions that began under BBD. These were for 60 airplanes each.

At this year’s Paris Air Show, Airbus won an important endorsement from lessor Air Lease Corp, which ordered 50.

But it’s clear Airbus still has some cleaning up to do. And the order book is inflated with the ghost orders.

Top airbus exec: Mobile-built A220 'a global airplane' - AL.com,"Wed, 14 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsLmNvbS9uZXdzL21vYmlsZS8yMDE5LzA4L3RvcC1haXJidXMtZXhlYy1tb2JpbGUtYnVpbHQtYTIyMC10by1iZS1hLWdsb2JhbC1haXJwbGFuZS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"One of Airbus’ top-ranking global executives, Chief Operations Officer Michael Schoellhorn, said he liked what he saw on his first visit to the company’s manufacturing operation in Mobile.

Schoellhorn, who is German, was announced as COO in February; prior to that he’d worked as an executive for BSH Home Appliances GmbH and The Bosch Group. But he said his Alabama visit was “some sort of a homecoming as well.” In the ’80s, while serving in the German military, he spent about a year stationed at Fort Rucker, training as a helicopter pilot. Speaking to media on Wednesday in Mobile, he said that experience had given him a lasting appreciation for the American South, leading him to spend part of his career with Bosch in Charleston.

His visit to Mobile came at a pivotal time both for the Airbus plant and for the global economic climate in which it operates. On the local level, Airbus is adding a second assembly line, where it will build the A220 family of jets alongside the A320-family jets it has been assembling in Mobile for several years. But even though construction is still in full swing on the A220 production facilities, Airbus's Mobile workforce is already building its first A220.

""I met with people today and walked the shop floor,"" Schoellhorn said. ""I am extremely excited to see our guys here and what they have accomplished in only four years. They have a really can-do attitude.""

Schoellhorn said that pushing ahead with A220 assembly and site construction simultaneously did create challenges, but it also provided a business advantage.

""Yes, it's temporary in nature,"" he said of the arrangement. ""It has enabled us to also win business by being able to ship to our U.S. customers as early as they wanted. It is something that I think was well mapped out, but by the same token it's not the final setup.""

Daryl Taylor, Vice President & General Manager of the Airbus U.S. Manufacturing Facility, said that the original facility had room for growth.

""The capacity that is in here in the facility, the existing organization, has allowed us to start the 220 at a faster pace than we did the 320,"" Taylor said. ""And also very clearly it's permanent tooling, it's permanent methods, it's just in temporary locations. It's not a temporary way to build the aircraft. That's a key factor.""

Airbus officials said that the Mobile plant now directly employs about 800 people, not counting employees of other companies who work on-site in support roles. That 800 is expected to grow to around 1,100 by the end of the year and could hit 1,500 in a few years when both assembly lines are running at capacity.

Airbus is maintaining that robust expectation in the face of some concerns about global economic instability. Tariff wars between the U.S. and other countries are an ongoing concern and reports recently emerged that President Donald Trump had criticized a U.S. airline for buying Airbus jets rather than Boeing products. The aftermath of Brexit remains a concern in Europe. And though Airbus and Boeing have thousands of jet orders in hand, some industry observers speculate that a general global downturn could reveal part of that to be an “order bubble.”

Schoellhorn waved away the criticism that Airbus jets were a foreign product. ""If you look at our procurement volume, 40 percent of every [one] of our planes has American content,"" he said. ""So there's a good bit of 'Made in the U.S.' in every [one] of our planes. Now, you add the final assembly here in Mobile and it clearly makes it a U.S. plane.""

Schoellhorn acknowledged that Airbus has been ramping up A320 production to meet the demand for thousands of aircraft. That's created some anxiety among suppliers, who wonder if higher production rates will be sustainable in the face of a downturn, he said.

""If you look at our order books, speaking now mainly for the 320, I think it would take a lot to disrupt that,"" Schoellhorn said. ""I don't see it coming in the near future.

""By the same token,"" he said, ""if trade wars led to some completely different situation, it could have an effect on the overall company, as it would on aviation as a whole.""

Airbus has far fewer orders in hand for the A220 -- 551 as of the end of June -- but that's mainly because it's so new. Schoellhorn maintained the company line that there's a big market for the 100- to 150-passenger market segment the jet serves. Orders are still coming in, he said, and feedback on a recent demonstration tour through Asia has been positive.

""I think the A220 is really gaining traction, as also demonstrated by the recent Air France business award of 60 aircraft,"" he said. ""And the echo in China is good. We want to make this a global airplane, by the same token, with a Canadian and a U.S. home."" (The A220, originally developed by Bombardier, also is built in Mirabel, Canada.)

As for Brexit, it has always presented some possibility of disruption to Airbus’ international supply chains. All its commercial jet wings, for example, are made in Wales.

""The only good thing about the current situation is that it's been lingering around so long that it gave us some time to get prepared,"" Schoellhorn said. ""We do now look at Brexit as being very likely a hard Brexit, so the U.K. dropping out of the E.U. without a real deal. So, we're getting ready for that. We have increased our buffer stock, we have made dry runs of processes that will help us cope with the aftermath, and what could happen.""

Given his personal interest in helicopters, Schoellhorn said, he’s definitely interested in visiting Airbus’ helicopter assembly plant in Mississippi. But that’ll have to wait for another visit, he said."

Airbus begins U.S. production of A220 aircraft - Airbus,"Mon, 05 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOS0wOC1haXJidXMtYmVnaW5zLXVzLXByb2R1Y3Rpb24tb2YtYTIyMC1haXJjcmFmdNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has today officially begun manufacturing the A220 in the U.S. The first team of A220 production workers began work at Airbus’ Mobile, Alabama-based production facility following their recent return from on-the-job training in Mirabel, Quebec, Canada, where the A220 programme and primary final assembly line are located.

“The expansion of our commercial aircraft production in Mobile to a second product line – with 400 additional jobs to support it – further solidifies Airbus’ standing as a truly global aircraft manufacturer, and confirms without a doubt that Airbus is an important part of America’s manufacturing landscape,” said Airbus Americas Chairman & CEO C. Jeffrey Knittel. “With Mobile, and our production network in Asia, Canada and Europe, we have strategically created a worldwide industrial base to better serve our customers.”

Airbus announced plans for the addition of A220 manufacturing in Mobile in October 2017. Construction on the main A220 flowline hangar and other support buildings for the new A220 began at the Mobile Aeroplex at Brookley at the beginning of this year. Airbus is producing the first few aircraft within some current A320 Family buildings and newly-built support hangars. The first U.S.-made A220 – an A220-300 destined for Delta Air Lines – is scheduled for delivery in the third quarter of 2020. By the middle of the next decade, the facility will produce between 40 and 50 A220 aircraft per year.

The A220 is the only aircraft purpose-built for the 100-150 seat market; it delivers unbeatable fuel efficiency and wide-body passenger comfort in a single-aisle aircraft. The A220 brings together state-of-the-art aerodynamics, advanced materials and Pratt & Whitney’s latest-generation PW1500G geared turbofan engines to offer at least 20% lower fuel burn per seat compared to previous generation aircraft. The A220 offers the performance of larger single-aisle aircraft. With an order book of 551 aircraft as of end of June 2019, the A220 has all the credentials to win the lion’s share of the 100-to-150-seat aircraft market, estimated to represent 7,000 aircraft over the next 20 years.

Airbus has strong and longstanding ties to the United States, with Airbus aircraft being operated by the largest airlines in America. Additionally, Airbus is a major partner of U.S. aerospace companies and workers. The company has purchased $48 billion of components and materials from American suppliers in the last three years alone, and supports more than 275,000 American jobs. Among its facilities in the U.S. Airbus has: engineering centers in Kansas and Alabama; training facilities in Florida and Colorado; materials support and headquarters in Virginia; an innovative think tank (A3) in California; a drone data analysis business (Airbus Aerial) in Atlanta, Georgia; helicopter manufacturing and assembly facilities in Texas and Mississippi; and a satellite manufacturing facility (OneWeb) in Florida.

Airbus began producing A320 aircraft at its $600 million Alabama assembly plant in late 2015. To date, the company has delivered more than 130 aircraft to eight different airlines, with Delta claiming the most, with 52 deliveries.

More than 800 people are now working at the Airbus assembly line. The company employs an additional 220 at an engineering center in Mobile and another 70 people at its Space and Defense division in the city, pushing its total employment in Alabama to around 1,100."
"Interview: Julien Franiatte, head of Airbus Russia - www.rusaviainsider.com","Tue, 27 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJ1c2F2aWFpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9pbnRlcnZpZXctanVsaWVuLWZyYW5pYXR0ZS1oZWFkLW9mLWFpcmJ1cy1ydXNzaWEv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Russian airlines have been operating Airbus aircraft for more than 25 years now. In the early 1990s, the European consortium entered the Russian market with its A310 and, today, the country’s largest airline is preparing to introduce the brand new A350 into its fleet. Shortly ahead of the MAKS-2019 event, ATO Show Observer’s (Russian Aviation Insider’s sister publication) correspondent met with Julien Franiatte, head of Airbus Russia, to discuss amongst other things, the importance of the air show, Aeroflot’s preparations for the A350 and the future needs for aircraft in the Russian market.

What will Airbus demonstrate at the Moscow Aerospace Show (MAKS) 2019 and why?

This year we’ll have a nice stand where we’ll be exhibiting not only our product portfolio, but also Airbus’ activities in Russia, focusing a lot on the industrial cooperation in the space segment via our JV Synertech and in the commercial aircraft segment via our engineering centre and our cooperation with suppliers. In addition, as we’ve been doing at every MAKS since 2011, we’re bringing our flight test aircraft. This year it will be the A350-900, with registration number MSN002.

We’re very glad to bring the A350 to MAKS again, especially as it’s fitted with some elements of our latest innovation, Airbus Connected Experience, which we unveiled at Hamburg Interiors Expo in April of this year. It is a part of numerous innovation projects Airbus is currently exploring. As you know, we’re not innovating just to be innovative, we’re innovating where it really matters. Airbus Connected Experience is a kind of an IoT [Internet of Things] concept platform to test various cabin innovations like smart galleys, trolleys, seats, overhead bins and other cabin elements. The crew will be able to access this data and exchange it, the airline will be able to store it and analyse it for predictive purposes, while passengers will be able to receive a more personalised experience. For example, this technology can show the cabin crew the exact location of a can of coca-cola in the galley, or the amount of food items left, etc.

The main goal of all of these innovations we are implementing inside an aircraft is to reduce costs, to boost efficiency, to enhance interaction between the cabin crew and the passenger, thereby increasing passenger satisfaction. The equipment installed aboard MSN002 makes it a kind of Airbus innovations demonstrator used to test the future prospects of various digital cabin technologies available today. This is quite unique, because it’s the first time that some elements of Airbus Connected Experience have been fitted on an aircraft and we’re bringing this aircraft to MAKS.

So, you’ll be bringing only the A350?

The A350-900 yes, but it’s already a big deal. This year the A350-900 will be on the static and flight displays until the 31st of August, meaning that we will demonstrate it not only on the business days, but also during the two public days.

How important is MAKS when compared to other air shows? Do you think that MAKS has been losing importance lately?

I don’t compare MAKS to Farnborough or Le Bourget. I think MAKS has and always has had a special flavour – a unique DNA that you don’t have at other air shows. I think it comes from the legacy of the great aeronautic and aerospace industry that Russia has. I mean, when you go to the MAKS air show, it’s not only about current exhibitors, you can also see the planes from the Soviet Union and the current era that are displayed, and it’s fantastic! Furthermore, MAKS is unbeaten by any air show when it comes to flying displays. And when you look at the exhibitors there, they are different. They are more regional and the small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have more chance to be presented.

MAKS has always been an air show on its own. So I would not compare it to Le Bourget or Farnborough, which are more commercial for us. MAKS is more of an opportunity to get in touch with the airlines, industry partners and to demonstrate our industrial co-operation in Russia.

That’s basically why we are bringing the A350. Next year Aeroflot will start operating this aircraft. Also, this aircraft has quite a few components made and manufactured in Russia. Airbus ECAR engineering centre has been very much involved in the design of the A350, with more than 6,000 technical drawings provided by the team, including two patents. Then, on the titanium side, VSMPO-Avisma covers about 50 per cent of Airbus’ needs in titanium (all modern aircraft use quite a lot of titanium). The A350 is 14 per cent titanium, for example. We also have the Liebherr and Hydromash companies that are producing parts for the landing gear of the A350.

It’s now widely believed that the Russian civil aircraft industry is unlikely to become a major player in the market. Do you agree with that view?

No, I would not be that critical. Russia already has a great history of aviation. You’ve demonstrated to have fantastic engineers and this is the key for the industry. I don’t think that 50 years ago, when there was this big duopoly of Boeing and McDonnel Douglas, that many people were actually betting that Airbus would become what it became. For instance, take the A320 – in the beginning the business case was to sell 600 airplanes – and today we’ve sold in excess of 14,700 units of the A320 family.

I think we have to see how things will evolve. Yes, there’s a strong duopoly between Airbus and Boeing, but we always said that we welcome competition, and we strongly believe that the duopoly will not last – I mean, we broke it in the past. We now see the emergence of manufacturers worldwide, whether it’s from Russia or China. So the game is not over. It’s too soon to say that Russia will not become an important player.

Last year you said that Airbus now accounts for 50 per cent of all foreign-made +100-seat aircraft in Russia and your goal is to increase this share to 55 per cent. When will that happen and what will contribute to that?

We believe that there’s a sound position between 45 and 55 per cent which is where Airbus and Boeing would like to be positioned. Of course, we have ambitions in Russia and I believe we have the best products, so we can be on the higher end of the figures I just mentioned. We now have around 340 aircraft flying in Russia with nine airlines. Also, we’re now in talks with many [other] airlines which are interested in expanding or joining the Airbus family, so I’m confident that in a few years’ time we’ll get to the 55 per cent market share.

What are the three key differences between Russian aviation and other markets?

I don’t know if I can reduce it to three. Firstly, I would say that you have an incredibly resilient market. That’s one of your biggest strengths. I mean, if you look back, the air transport market has had to face the closure of Ukraine, the closure and partial opening of Turkey and Egypt – all of which were among the top destinations when it comes to leisure traffic for instance. There was, as we know, the economic downturn. There was the rouble devaluation. If you put all these things together, it’s close to the perfect storm. And yet, when you look at the numbers, they’re growing again. Of course, the market has completely changed. It went from well-balanced international-domestic to be mostly domestic at this moment. But the domestic traffic grew by 10 per cent I believe last year and the growth continues. That’s rather unique. I don’t know of many markets [in the world] that went through such a change in such a short space of time.

Secondly, you have to deal with the strong challenges when you look at the country itself. I mean, Russia is the ninth largest country by population and the largest in terms of geographical size. There are nine time zones and the climate is down to below -50 [degrees C] in some parts of the country in winter, and it gets more than +30 [degrees C] in the summer. So this environment is quite harsh for aircraft operations.

And finally the population is unevenly distributed, with three-quarters located in one-third west of Ural. In this situation of course you have a major hub, but you also create a desire to travel and discover the rest of the country. And this is where Airbus has an ideal product, the A321XLR, the newest of the A321 family. This plane is going to be a game-changer for Russia, because it will allow airlines to operate very long routes with a relatively small model. Today, between Moscow and Vladivostok, you have to operate a wide-body, but with the A321XLR you can fly from Kaliningrad to Vladivostok with a smaller option of 180-200 passengers. So that development would be a route-opener.

According to Airbus forecasts, over the next 20 years, Russia and the CIS will need approximately more than 1,200 aircraft. What is your forecast about the Russian market alone?

Firstly, I would like to highlight that, from last year, we changed our approach to our forecasts. Now we look not only at the size, but also the range, for this illustrates more accurately the current changes in the aviation market. For example, we see now that SA [single-aisle] aircraft are used on the same routes as WB [wide-body], such as the A321LR, which can fly from Moscow to Vladivostok, or the A330 which is now used on shorter routes, where the SA used to be operated (Moscow-Irkutsk). So, if we look at the Russia and CIS [together] market from that perspective, we can see a demand for more than 1,200 aircraft in 20 years: 998 smaller, 140 medium, 39 large and 44 extra-large aircraft. For Russia only, I would say that represents somewhere between 900 and 1,000 aircraft, with the prevailing majority being SA aircraft.

And how many wide-body aircraft will Russia and the CIS need in the next 20 years?

We estimate this to be around 200 aircraft in the A330 and A350 category.

What is the average fleet age of the Airbus aircraft operated by Russian airlines?

If I’m not mistaken, it’s on the high end of nine years. If we compare ourselves to our competitor Boeing, we’re about two years younger. Over the course of our presence in Russia, we have always had the youngest fleet versus the competition, and this is something of which we’re proud.

How have things changed during the 27-year history of the presence of Airbus aircraft in the fleet of Russian airlines? What do you think will happen in the future? How will it change?

We have had several waves. We entered the market first with the A310 to Aeroflot in the early 1990s. Then we really made a breakthrough again with Aeroflot in 2003 when the first A320s were delivered and, of course, when you deliver new airplanes, the fleet age instantly drops. Then we had a series of airlines joining the game from 2003 to 2010: Aeroflot got Airbuses, as well as S7 Airlines and Ural Airlines. So we had this first wave of current engine option aircraft coming to the country and therefore bringing down the age of the fleet.

Now we’re expecting the second wave, which was initiated two years ago at MAKS-2017, when S7 Airlines took delivery of the first A320neo in Russia. Now we have this new wave of neos and Ural Airlines has recently added the first A320neo to its fleet. Aeroflot has also announced plans to have the neo. We’re going to see that the average age will drop again.

Talking about Ural Airlines, which received the first A320neo, what has been done on your part to ensure that the customer is sufficiently familiarised and prepared for the new type?

Ural Airlines took delivery of their first A320neo on the 6th of August, becoming the first CFM International [LEAP-1А]-powered A320neo operator in Russia. The commonality between the neo and the ceo is close to 95 per cent. It’s basically just the engines that change. If you take one of the last ceos to come off the production line and compare it with the neo, the difference is really less than five per cent. So the mechanics are already well trained on 95 per cent of the airplane. The remaining five per cent is the engine. As you know, Ural Airlines has extensive experience in A320 family operations and maintenance. But, of course, all the necessary training schemes for the neo were put in place and the respective technical and flight documentation was provided to make the new type’s entry into service as seamless as possible. As usual we’re sending what we call the ‘field representative’, which is the Airbus employee that will be physically located inside Ural Airlines’ facility and will be there to answer any questions the airline might have.

But again, the A320neo is a well-known machine, so we’re not expecting any surprises there.

How are you helping Aeroflot prepare for the A350?

Let’s say that we initiated the preparation when we welcomed the A350 at Sheremetyevo [Aeroflot’s Moscow base airport] in August 2014. It was quite unique because I believe it was the first time that a western-built, non-certified aircraft had landed on Russian soil. Right there you can say that we started checking the [mutual] compatibility of the A350 and Sheremetyevo. Of course, 24 months prior to the actual entry into service next year we had a team from Toulouse working closely with Aeroflot to ensure that the start of operations will be smooth, and this work continues. Meanwhile, here is a gentle reminder that the A350 has a common type rating with the A330s, which Aeroflot has been successfully operating for more than 10 years, plus today we have some 270 A350-900s flying, so it’s an airplane that’s well known by Airbus and it’s also well-known in many places that Aeroflot will be flying to. So again, here everything has been done to minimise any risk and we don’t foresee any challenges.

Airbus also announced that the A220 will receive its Russian type certificate in 2019. When exactly will that happen and why do you think the aircraft still has no commitment from Russian airlines?

It’s not that no airline has committed. There was a commitment from Red Wings, but it did not work out. We see the market for the A220 in Russia. We’re working closely with Russian civil aviation authorities to certify the A220, as we understand it’s on track and it’s to be achieved by the end of this year.

Now let’s talk about customer support. How do you develop your customer support programmes? What news can airlines expect in this area in the next four years?

Customer support, like the rest of the company, is benefiting from digitalisation. I will not go into fine detail, because we talked a little bit about it when we discussed the Connected Cabin, but I will give you just two examples. One is what we call Skywise, a digital platform which enables to record, share and analyse a large amount of data. For example, the A350 generates close to 800 GB of data in one flight, and Skywise can help gather all this amount of information and detect, for example, what we call the micro-fault. This refers to the non-complete failure of a component whereby a micro-fault – that would not necessarily appear in the cockpit because the component hasn’t failed – is recognised as just a micro-fault.

And that tremendously allows the airline to anticipate a failure. This is really the next step in the cost of aircraft maintenance. When you record a certain frequency of micro-faults in a valve, for example, you’re able to remove the valves before they actually fail. And this also allows you to send that valve for repair before it completely fails, so the subsequent cost of repair is much lower. We can even start to gather this big data during the birth of the aircraft in the factory, and then continue to gather all that information throughout its lifecycle. Therefore, airlines have a complete picture of their aircraft and they can anticipate and maintain them accordingly. And for an airline that is used to having second-hand aircraft, this tremendously reduces the cost because, together with the aircraft, you also receive all this information.

The second one is drone technology to carry out the inspection of an aircraft. Today if you inspect an aircraft you do it on a crane, which is time-consuming and there is always a risk of damaging the plane. What we’ve developed is an automatic drone equipped with an HD camera and an Airbus’ aircraft inspection software analysis tool. This way the inspection lasts only three hours, including 30 minutes of image capture by the drone. So you go from one full day to only 3.5 hours and you completely avoid the risk of damaging the aircraft. And, again, the full report and HD images created by the drone and software can then be uploaded into Skywise, thus feeding the big data.

What do you think about the Russian Customs import tariffs and VAT? Should the government change something in this area?

Let me answer differently, we’re in an industry that needs stability and long-term planning. When airlines lease airplanes they lease them for six years minimum. And the standard for wide-bodies is 12 years. They need to be able to plan when it comes down to Customs duty, VAT, or anything on those scales.

What do you think will happen with demand for your narrow-body aircraft in Russia after the MC-21 comes into service?

We always welcome competition and we’re happy to see a third or a fourth player depending if you count the Chinese market. Again, when you look back 50 years ago, we managed to break a duopoly. It’s too early to see how it is going to happen in Russia, we see that there are quite a few commitments from Russian airlines for the MC-21 and it’s natural. We’re glad to see that there’s interest for the MC-21 because that means that there’s demand for such types of models, so maybe it’s an opportunity for Airbus and Boeing to re-think something. But if you look at our forecasted demand for some 1000 aircraft for Russia and the CIS in the next 20 years I think there’s room for everyone.

What is the average daily utilisation rate of Airbus aircraft in Russia compared to in other countries?

The daily utilisation rate in Russia is one of the highest if I’m not mistaken. It’s around 10 hours for single-aisles in Russia compared to nine worldwide. And for the A330 it’s close to 13 hours versus 11.7 worldwide. We regularly have Russian airlines that break records for the number of hours flown on single-aisles. Thus, we have three leaders in terms of daily utilisation in Russia: they are Rossiya Airlines, S7 Airlines and Ural Airlines. Sometimes they fly for 11-12 hours per day, which demonstrates that the airplane is capable of operating those flight-hours which is a sign that the airlines know what they’re doing. And also the more they operate the aircraft the less the unit cost. So that has a direct impact on a plane ticket for passengers."
"No, a Saudi man did not accidentally buy two Airbus jets - AFP Factcheck","Wed, 28 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vZmFjdGNoZWNrLmFmcC5jb20vbm8tc2F1ZGktbWFuLWRpZC1ub3QtYWNjaWRlbnRhbGx5LWJ1eS10d28tYWlyYnVzLWpldHPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"No, a Saudi man did not accidentally buy two Airbus jets

Copyright © AFP 2017-2024. All rights reserved.

The story of Saudi man who accidentally bought two Airbus A350-1000s for his son’s birthday, instead of miniature models of the passenger jet, has been widely shared on WhatsApp and social media. The tall tale tapped into stereotypes about the vast wealth of some Saudi nationals, and prompted many social media users to jokingly wish that someone might accidentally buy them a similar birthday gift. Some social media users suggested the story was too good to be true, and they were right: it originated on a website that describes itself as satirical, and an Airbus official confirmed that it had been invented. He also talked us through the lengthy process of buying one of these enormous, expensive jets. Contrary to the story, it’s not possible to buy an A350 simply by handing over credit card details on the phone.

A screenshot of an online article carrying the story has been circulating over the past few days in Kenya and India, among other places.

A quick Google search allowed us to trace the screenshot to the website Thin Air Today -- we’ve archived the post here. According to data from social media analysis tool CrowdTangle, it has been shared more than 3,000 times on Facebook via various accounts, and received more than 2,000 likes on Instagram since it was published on August 15, 2019.

However, the website says in a small disclaimer on the bottom of the web page that all of its content is satirical.

The owner of the website confirmed this in a direct message on Twitter. “I have a satirical aviation-based website, just for fun,” he told AFP Fact-Check, declining to give his name. “And for the aviation community. The goal is not to spread fake news but have some fun and think.”

Other sites have missed the satirical nature of the story

The story may have been intended as light-hearted fiction, but other websites have since reproduced it without clarifying that it was made up for fun. The Middle East Monitor and Zambian entertainment site Tumfweko relayed the story, as did India’s Times Now before issuing a correction.

On social media, some users doubted whether the story could be true, while others appeared intrigued by the expensive mistake. Many said they wished that their loved ones would make similar gaffes on their birthdays.

Reactions to the 'accidental purchase' on Facebook.

It’s not that easy to buy an Airbus A350-1000

According to Airbus’ guide prices for 2018 -- the latest available -- one A350-1000 costs a whopping $366.5 million, meaning the Saudi victim of the story would have accidentally paid around $733 million for the two planes, despite thinking that what he was getting were model aircrafts.

“I got lost in currency conversions, I thought it was a bit expensive but still reasonable,” he is quoted as saying in the Thin Air Today post, which says he paid with American Express following a confusing conversation with Airbus staff due to his lack of English.

In fact, buying a passenger jet from Airbus is not nearly as easy as the story might suggest.

AFP contacted Airbus media relations manager Matthieu Duvelleroy, who explained that purchasing an A350-1000 is a long process with various different stages.

“First, there needs to be an interest by an airline or a government upon which discussions on the needs will take place. After this, a call for tender will be made followed by price negotiations which could involve the board,” Duvelleroy told us by email.

“Once the pricing has been agreed on, contracts will be drafted and signed then the first payment and validation of the scheduled of payment made. The parties will agree on the date of delivery in terms of the actual production plan,"" said Duvelleroy, adding that there were “many other processes” along the way.

It is not, contrary to the story, possible to buy an Airbus jet using a personal credit card.

“You can’t really buy A350 with your personal credit card,” Duvelleroy said. “This seems to be fake news.”"
Airbus Helicopters opens completion and delivery center in Malaysia - Vertical Magazine,"Tue, 06 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2FpcmJ1cy1oZWxpY29wdGVycy1vcGVucy1jb21wbGV0aW9uLWFuZC1kZWxpdmVyeS1jZW50ZXItaW4tbWFsYXlzaWEv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters is further extending its footprint in Malaysia with the opening of a new regional helicopter completion and delivery center (CDC) at its Subang facility.

The new CDC will see Airbus’s new helicopters for customers in the Southeast Asia region being completed in, and delivered from this center of excellence, consolidating Malaysia’s role as Airbus’s regional hub for helicopter services, customer support and full-flight simulator training.

Malaysia’s transport minister, Anthony Loke, officially opened the regional center on Aug. 6.

Speaking at the ceremony, Raymond Lim, head of Airbus in Malaysia, said, “The move to set up a regional helicopter completion and delivery center in Malaysia fully demonstrates Airbus’s unwavering commitment to the country’s aerospace industry, in particular the promotion of Malaysia’s growing industrial footprint across all areas of our business.”

“This expansion is part of our growth plan for the region, and will enable us to provide the best possible end-to-end support to our customers in this fast-growing region, backed by our extensive range of helicopter services,” he added.

The new regional helicopter center can accommodate up to four medium-sized helicopters at any one time. It is capable of assembling and delivering up to 20 helicopters per year from across all its rotorcraft models.

In addition to the new completion and delivery center, the company has also expanded its full motion full-flight simulation center with the addition of a Dauphin AS365 N3/N3+ simulator to its existing H225/H225M simulator. With two simulators in place, training of pilots and crew from customers in the military, parapublic and civil sectors through the Asia-Pacific region and beyond, can now take place in Malaysia.

Strategically located 25 kilometers from Kuala Lumpur, Airbus Helicopters’ Malaysia facility spans more than 10,000 square meters. The facility is fully equipped to provide a broad spectrum of services from scheduled and unscheduled maintenance, aircraft modifications, aircraft completion and delivery, material management and technical support. Airbus Helicopters has a team of over 100 personnel, supporting operations in Malaysia and the region.

The expansion of the facility at Subang further extends Airbus presence in Malaysia. Airbus is the largest international partner for the Malaysian aerospace industry, with its sourcing and services businesses in the country worth US$400 million annually for the local economy. The company’s activities currently sustain employment for over 4,000 Malaysians in the country’s fast-growing aviation sector.

Malaysian companies supply parts for a wide range of Airbus programs, including the A320 Family, A330neo, A350 XWB, A380 and A400M. In addition to the regional helicopters center, Airbus operates a customer service center at Sepang offering specialized aircraft modification and design services. The company also through its fully-owned Sepang Aircraft Engineering offers maintenance, repair and overhaul for A320 Family and ATR series of aircraft."
Retrospective: The beginning of the end of Airbus A340 - AeroTime,"Thu, 15 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm90aW1lLmFlcm8vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjM4MTctYTM0MC1yZXRyb3NwZWN0aXZl0gE_aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYWVyb3RpbWUuYWVyby9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMzgxNy1hMzQwLXJldHJvc3BlY3RpdmUvYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus was competing with Boeing, McDonnell Douglas and Lockheed’s TriStar only in short and mid-hauls until 1993. But in the long-haul market, Boeing was robust with its 747 since 1970. To fill the long-haul market gap, Airbus designated the A340 to be a “true globe-trotter” that airlines could use on their longest routes. With better operating economics than the 747, the A340 was poised to take over the Queen’s throne as the king of long-haul flights.

On October 25, 1991, Airbus A340-300 made its maiden flight, before joining fleets of launch customers Air France and Lufthansa (LHAB) (LHA) and officially commencing service in 1993. On November 10, 2011, Airbus announced that the company has finished the production of the once record-breaking quadjet and will not take on any more new orders. Merve Kara from AeroTime looks at the 18-years of history of the A340.

Record Breaker

Airbus A340 started out with a good beginning in 1993. On June 16, 1993, the aircraft, dubbed “World Ranger”, flew from the Paris Airshow to Auckland, New Zealand, and back in 48 hours and 22 minutes, breaking six world records, including the longest non-stop flight by an airliner. This record was broken by Boeing 777 on a 12,455.34 statute miles (20,044.20 km) flight from Seattle, the U.S., to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, in 1997.

Airbus developed four A340 variants: A340-200, A340-300, A340-500 and A340-600. The A340-600 was the largest-capacity member of the Airbus A340 Family, which would become the longest-range commercial airliner until Boeing 777-200LR appeared on the stage in 2005. Virgin Atlantic announced it will become the worldwide launch customer for the new A340-600 in August 1997.

As the competition continued between Airbus and Boeing, the U.S. planemaker came up with a new move in 1999. When Singapore Airlines (SIA1) (SINGY) ordered 17 A340-300s, all 17 of the A340-300s were purchased by Boeing in order to sell 10 new 777’s to the carrier in 1999. It would not be the last bad news for the A340. The Wall Street Journal reported that Thai Airways International halted its 17-hour non-stop route from Bangkok to New York to save fuel costs. Thai Airways flew the last flight on the route on July 1, 2008, and sold its four A340-500s.

Airbus

Last goodbyes to the A340

On November 10, 2011, Airbus announced that the production of A340 had ended. As for the reasons behind the decision, the company’s spokesperson told AeroTime: “Given the low orders placed for the aircraft type, Airbus decided that no new A340s would be built from November 2011. Airbus however still fully support the global A340 fleet as long as they are on operation”. When all airlines decide to retire their A340s, it will be the final ending for the aircraft.

There are other ideas on why Airbus stopped the production of A340. Aerospace engineer Thomas Stagliano shared his ideas with AeroTime: “Airbus was developing the A330 and the A340 at roughly the same time. The A340 with four engines and the A330 with two engines. First flights in the early 1990s. By then it became obvious that the airlines wanted long-range two-engine aircraft with the more modern larger and efficient and more reliable jet engines”.

Stagliano thinks that the competition between Boeing and Airbus hastened the process of ending the manufacturing of A340s.“Boeing came out with the 777 a year later in 1993 and that was a long-range two-engine airliner and that was the doom for the A340. Airbus needed to go back and make larger versions of the A330,” he explained.“The A340 ran its course quickly and then Airbus followed Boeing into composite aircraft with the A350 to counter the 787,” Stagliano added.

Recently, Virgin Atlantic announced that the company will phase out its last remaining Airbus A340-600s at the end of 2019 as it announces new order for 14 A330neos. By that time, 131 A340-500/600s were made, of which 123 remain in operation (as of July 30, 2019, including Virgin Atlantic’s six), according to Airbus’ Orders and Deliveries file. The largest operators of the type remain Lufthansa (LHAB) (LHA) and Iberia (both airlines have 17 A340s in their fleets)."

Airbus drops bid to replace Canada fighter jets - Tech Xplore,"Fri, 30 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vdGVjaHhwbG9yZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDE5LTA4LWFpcmJ1cy1jYW5hZGEtZmlnaHRlci1qZXRzLmh0bWzSAUJodHRwczovL3RlY2h4cGxvcmUuY29tL25ld3MvMjAxOS0wOC1haXJidXMtY2FuYWRhLWZpZ2h0ZXItamV0cy5hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Eurofighter Typhoon is out of the running to replace 88 aging Canadian fighter jets

Aerospace giant Airbus announced Friday that it is withdrawing from a Canadian government call for proposals to replace 88 aging fighter jets.

The contract is reportedly valued at a minimum Can$15 billion (US$11.4 billion).

The company announced in a statement with Britain's Defense Ministry that the Typhoon fighter presented by the Eurofighter consortium would no longer be among the candidates.

The statement cited two factors for the decision, the first of which was that security requirements from the joint US-Canadian North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) were too expensive.

""NORAD security requirements continue to place too significant of a cost on platforms whose manufacture and repair chains sit outside"" the United States and Canada, the statement said.

The new aircraft's central role will be to patrol North American air space with the US Air Force under NORAD.

Additionally, ""the significant recent revision of industrial technological benefits (ITB) obligations does not sufficiently value the binding commitments the Typhoon Canada package was willing to make, and which were one of its major points of focus,"" the statement said.

Airbus's withdrawal leaves the field open to three other candidates: Saab's Gripen, Lockheed Martin's F-35 and Boeing's F/A-18 Super Hornet.

France's Dassault Aviation took its Rafale out of the running in November because of technical requirements tied to Canada's membership in the ""Five Eyes"" signals intelligence sharing group of nations that the company could not meet, sources told AFP.

The Five Eyes group is comprised of Canada, the United States, Britain, Australia and New Zealand.

The defense contractors have until the spring of 2020 to submit initial proposals with a contract award due in early 2022 and delivery expected in 2025.

After a trade dispute with Boeing, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government announced in 2017 that, instead of buying 18 new Super Hornets, it would buy 18 used F-18s from Australia as a stop-gap measure.

The Airbus A380 Jumbo Jet Is Fading Fast - Yahoo Finance,"Sat, 03 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9haXJidXMtYTM4MC1qdW1iby1qZXQtZmFkaW5nLTE4MTEwMDQxMC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Earlier this year, Airbus (OTC: EADSY) bit the bullet and announced that it would wind down production of its slow-selling A380 jumbo jet by 2021. With the exception of Emirates, the A380 failed to win any big fans, and a multiyear order drought ultimately forced Airbus' hand.

Since that decision was announced back in February, the Airbus A380's popularity has waned even further. A growing number of airlines that operate the jumbo jet have announced plans to retire their A380 fleets prematurely in favor of more efficient jets. That's great news for Boeing (NYSE: BA), which may be able to sell more 777-9 jets over the next few years as airlines plan for the replacement of their A380s.

The retirement announcements just keep coming

Around the time Airbus announced its decision to stop building new A380s, Qatar Airways revealed that it plans to retire each of its A380s as they reach 10 years of age. This would put the retirement dates for its 10 A380s between 2024 and 2028.

A typical commercial jet has a useful life of 20 to 30 years. However, retiring A380s after just 10 years wouldn't be unprecedented: Singapore Airlines -- the second-biggest A380 customer in the world -- has already retired five of its A380s at the 10-year mark. At least two of those planes are in the midst of being scrapped.

A Singapore Airlines A380

A month later, Airbus agreed to buy back six of Lufthansa's 14 A380s in conjunction with the latter's order for 20 additional A350-900s. Given the lack of a secondary market for the A380, these planes are likely to be scrapped, too. Returning the A380s to Airbus will clear the way for Lufthansa to take delivery of the 20 777-9 jets it has ordered from Boeing.

Even Emirates -- which hasn't finished taking delivery of all of the A380s it has ordered -- has already started talking about when they will disappear from its fleet. A couple of months ago, company president Tim Clark stated that Emirates would continue flying A380s until the mid-2030s. Of course, that's just the end date for the carrier's A380 retirement process: The oldest ones could potentially begin leaving the fleet just a few years from now.

Story continues

Most recently, Air France revealed last week that it will retire all of its Airbus A380s by 2022. Even its oldest A380 would be just 13 years of age by then.

Retirements can be contagious

With so many airlines starting to retire Airbus A380s at such a young age, the active global fleet of A380s will start declining pretty soon. Over the next five years, the changes will probably be fairly minor. But in the five years thereafter, the number of A380s still in service could drop precipitously, particularly if Emirates sticks to its typical schedule of keeping planes for no more than 10 to 15 years.

An Emirates A380 jet

As the active fleet shrinks, it will be harder to maintain a network of spare parts throughout the world. Additionally, engine maintenance could become prohibitively expensive, due to the lack of scale. (Aside from the A380's low sales numbers, it also had two engine options.)

This will make it challenging for airlines to keep the remaining A380s in the air. In effect, the decision by many airlines to retire their A380s at a very young age could force other airlines to follow suit by making the jumbo jets even more expensive to operate than they already are.

Can Boeing cash in on this opportunity?

After A380 deliveries end in 2021, the Boeing 777-9 will be the largest commercial jet still in production. It will also be the most efficient commercial jet in the world, according to Boeing. That makes it a natural A380 replacement -- although some airlines are opting for the somewhat smaller Airbus A350-1000 instead, either for fleet commonality reasons or because they have decided that smaller jets work better for their route networks.

A majority of the top A380 operators have already ordered 777-9s. However, most of those orders were primarily designed to replace other aircraft models or for growth. That leaves plenty of room for follow-on orders in the coming years. Boeing's backlog contains 344 orders for 777X jets today -- nearly all 777-9s -- so getting another 100 or 150 A380 replacement orders would give the program a nice lift.

The biggest risk to getting those orders would have been if airlines chose to keep operating their Airbus A380s well into the 2030s. By that point, a better replacement might be available.

It doesn't look like that will be an issue, though. The vast majority of the global A380 fleet is on track for retirement over the next decade or so. There isn't likely to be a good alternative to the Boeing 777-9 within that timeframe. Thus, Boeing can look forward to more 777-9 orders rolling in as airlines finalize their A380 replacement plans in the coming years.

Boeing's Woes With Its Top-Selling Jet Adds Luster To Airbus' Results - NDTV,"Sun, 04 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5kdHYuY29tL3dvcmxkLW5ld3MvYm9laW5ncy13b2VzLXdpdGgtaXRzLXRvcC1zZWxsaW5nLWpldC1hZGRzLWx1c3Rlci10by1haXJidXMtcmVzdWx0cy0yMDgwMDA00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has overtaken the American giant Boeing in some key benchmarks in 2019.

With its main rival hobbled by the worldwide grounding of a top-selling jet, Europe's Airbus could seem poised to emerge as the undisputed global aerospace leader.

Airbus has overtaken the American giant Boeing in some key benchmarks in 2019. And the company is now better positioned to move quickly on a new jet product.

Meanwhile, the American company is mired in efforts to get its crisis-stricken 737 MAX planes back in the sky after two deadly crashes.

Still, experts say the Toulouse, France-based aviation giant faces production constraints that likely limit its ability to grab more market share.

""Airbus is a winner only at the margins,"" said Richard Aboulafia, a longtime industry analyst at the Teal Group, an aerospace market analysis firm.

To be sure, Boeing's suspension of deliveries of its top-selling plane has added luster to Airbus's solid and unscathed results.

Moreover, as the MAX grounding has dragged on since March, key airline customers are becoming increasingly blunt in expressing frustration.

Airbus delivered 389 planes through the end of June, an increase of 28 percent. During the same period, Boeing deliveries fell 37 percent to 239.

It was the first time since 2011 that Airbus overtook its US rival in plane deliveries, which is when the bulk of revenues are generated, effectively rendering Airbus the world's largest aircraft maker.

Airbus also has had net orders of 88 planes in 2019, compared with Boeing, which has seen a decline of 119.

At the Paris Air Show in June, Airbus announced orders for 383 planes worth $44 billion, about $10 billion more than Boeing's take from the show.

Still, a consolation prize for the US company was a letter of intent by British Airways parent IAG to buy 200 new 737 MAX planes, a vote of confidence in the aircraft.

Airbus is primed to move more quickly with commercializing a new mid-distance plane, launching the A321XLR in Paris this year, a single-aisle plane with greater range and passenger capacity of 240.

Boeing also has had a plan under development for a competing jet, but the timeframe has been pushed back because of the MAX.

No major Boeing cancellations

But since the MAX crisis, Boeing has seen ""no major cancellations of orders,"" said Aboulafia.

The Saudi budget carrier Flyadeal reversed a plan to purchase MAX planes but the deal had been provisional, aviation experts said.

Still, some plane contracts allow airlines to cancel the agreement without charge six months after a grounding. That means late September could be a telling juncture.

""That's when we'll know whether Airbus really has benefited from this tragedy,"" said Michel Merluzeau, an expert at Air Insight Research, an analysis firm and consultancy.

But even if airlines did want to shift to Airbus, they might have doubts about the European company's ability to deliver higher output.

Ramping up production in aerospace is a capital-intensive process that involves around five years of planning, Merluzeau said.

""I'm not sure Airbus's supply chain can sustain another increase in production,"" Aboulafia said. ""It will require additional investments, and we are talking about millions of dollars.""

Airbus has struggled to keep up with some of its production targets due to difficulties at engine makers Pratt & Whitney and CFM International, a joint-venture of General Electric and Safran.

Airbus has said it expects output of MAX rivals under its A320 line to reach 60 per month in 2019 and 63 per month next year."
Airbus Helicopters and Elbe Flugzeugwerke take on maintenance activities for the Bundeswehr's NH90 fleet - Airbus,"Wed, 28 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOS0wOC1haXJidXMtaGVsaWNvcHRlcnMtYW5kLWVsYmUtZmx1Z3pldWd3ZXJrZS10YWtlLW9uLW1haW50ZW5hbmNl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Donauwörth – Airbus Helicopters as prime contractor will work together with Dresden-based Elbe Flugzeugwerke to maintain the German Armed Forces’ (Bundeswehr’s) NH90 fleet. Airbus and the Federal Office of Bundeswehr Equipment, Information Technology and In-Service Support (BAAINBw) signed the corresponding 10-year support contract on Wednesday.

The services to be rendered at a package price under this contract comprise scheduled maintenance, 1,200 flight-hour inspections as well as on-demand repairs. Work will begin at Airbus Helicopters in Donauwörth during the first quarter of 2020 and at Elbe Flugzeugwerke in Dresden in early 2021.

Dresden as the subcontractor will be the Bundeswehr’s second major industrial centre alongside Donauwörth; the addition of this facility will greatly expand the Bundeswehr’s capacities for maintaining its helicopters. The German Army currently has 74 NH90 TTH helicopters; all 82 will have been delivered by 2021. The German Navy will start to receive its 18 helicopters in October 2019 – the maintenance of these is also covered by the contract. The German Army’s NH90s will be used as tactical transport helicopters (TTH), while the German Navy’s NH90s will be used as naval transport helicopters (NTH) – this helicopter type will also be known as the Sea Lion.

“Together, Airbus Helicopters and Elbe Flugzeugwerke are excellently poised to handle the growing influx of NH90 helicopters,” said Wolfgang Schoder, Executive Vice-President Light Helicopters and Governmental Programs at Airbus Helicopters. “Elbe Flugzeugwerke is an experienced and internationally renowned maintenance and conversion specialist that we will be incorporating into the NH90 programme for the long term.”

Andreas Sperl, President & CEO of Elbe Flugzeugwerke, said: “Based on our many years of experience in aircraft maintenance, and with the support of Airbus Helicopters we will be a reliable partner when it comes to maintaining the Bundeswehr’s NH90 helicopters. This will open up a new, very challenging and promising market for us.”

The service package offered by the two partners is based on a new concept that has already been successfully implemented with other NH90 user nations and has led to a significant reduction in turnaround times.

A quantum leap in computing power - Airbus,"Thu, 08 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDE5LTA4LWEtcXVhbnR1bS1sZWFwLWluLWNvbXB1dGluZy1wb3dlctIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Once thought of as impossible due to its complexity, quantum computing could be a game-changing technology across industries—from science to medicine. In the aerospace industry, quantum computing is showing great potential to solve computational challenges in aircraft modelling, simulation and more.

Are our computers reaching peak processing power? For more than half a century, Moore’s Law—or the observation that the number of components in an integrated circuit will double every two years—has held true. But recent studies are suggesting that this axiom is running out of steam. This is because, by 2040, the world’s computers may need more electricity than is possible to deliver—unless there is a radical shift in power production or computing efficiency.

The answer may lie in quantum computing. This next generation of supercomputers could deliver untold processing power, helping us to solve problems existing computers cannot. In turn, this could radically transform a range of sectors.

Quantum computing is poised to create a paradigm shift in flight physics. By enabling parallel computations, it will eventually lead to substantial time and cost savings in complex problem-solving

- Thierry Botter, Head of Airbus Blue Sky

In the aerospace industry, the range of potential applications for quantum computing is vast. This includes speeding up aircraft design, debugging millions of lines of software code and resolving complex computational challenges. At the same time, quantum computing could also help assess the optimal amount of fuel and speed at which to operate a commercial aircraft, thereby potentially helping the industry to improve its sustainability performance.

Quantum computing: how does it work?

Regular computers make sense of the data we input by processing information in “bits,” which can exist in two states: 0 or 1. In fact, everything from emails to MP3s are essentially long strings of binary digits known as software codes.

Instead of regular bits, quantum computers use quantum bits, or “qubits,” which can exist in any superposition of 0 or 1 states. A qubit can be seen like an imaginary sphere: whereas a regular bit can be at either end of the sphere’s two poles, a qubit can exist at any point on the sphere. A computer using qubits can thus process much more information using much less energy, enabling it to solve problems more quickly.

Consider an aircraft: it can have more than 120 million lines of software code! Verifying and validating this code is a time-consuming and complex process but critical for safe flight operations. Accelerating the verification and validation process could thus unlock significant time and cost savings, improve production efficiency and ensure flight operations are as safe as possible.

Quantum computing could also significantly improve computer modelling and simulation, thereby speeding up aircraft design. For example, it currently takes engineers many years to accurately model air flow over a wing. Quantum computing could significantly reduce the calculation time by simulating the overall air flow over the wing. That level of detail would maximise design efficiency, lowering fuel consumption, reducing drag and improving lift.

A paradigm shift in flight physics

According to Thierry Botter, Head of Airbus Blue Sky, quantum computing is poised to create a paradigm shift in flight physics: “By enabling parallel computations, it will eventually lead to substantial time and cost savings in complex problem-solving.”

To fully exploit the potential of this ground-breaking technology, Airbus is actively forging links to the quantum computing industry. “We want to partner with the best,” Thierry explains. “Our aim is to identify how quantum computing can bring the greatest benefit, changing the way we build and fly aircraft.”

To this end, Airbus Ventures is a seed investor in QC Ware, a cloud-based quantum computing solution provider. And to further accelerate the development and maturity of quantum computing in aerospace, Airbus launched the Airbus Quantum Computing Challenge in January 2019. The competition aims to build bridges to academia and start-ups, enabling participants to work on real industrial cases with Airbus across five areas: computational fluid dynamics; quantum neural networks; and optimisation in wingbox design, and aircraft climb and loading.

To date, more than 524 teams have registered interest. The deadline for registration is 31 October 2019. Winners will be announced in the first quarter of 2020. Prospective candidates can register here."
Airbus built ExoMars rover gets its eyes - Airbus,"Tue, 20 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOS0wOC1haXJidXMtYnVpbHQtZXhvbWFycy1yb3Zlci1nZXRzLWl0cy1leWVz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"UK designed and built PanCam integrated on rover at Airbus in Stevenage

Stevenage – One of the key instruments on the European Space Agency’s (ESA) ExoMars rover, the Panoramic Camera (PanCam) has been fitted and integrated in the Airbus bio-burden cleanroom in Stevenage.

Designed and built by University College London’s Mullard Space Science Laboratory (MSSL) in an international partnership, and including the High Resolution Camera provided by DLR, the PanCam will be the scientific eyes of the rover when it lands on Mars in spring 2021.

The high resolution camera will take 3D images to be used by the autonomous navigation system on the rover. Images will be sent back to the Rover Operation Control Center for the scientific team to choose a location and then the rover, Rosalind Franklin, will determine its own safe path to travel there. The PanCam will also give textural information for example, laminations or pitting, which could be related to the presence of organisms.

The PanCam will also observe atmospheric phenomena such as Mars’ famous dust devils and water in the atmosphere.

Colin Paynter, Managing Director of Airbus Defence and Space UK said: ""ExoMars is Europe's latest flagship space mission and Airbus is at the heart of it. Today's installation in Stevenage of the powerful PanCam, which will not only provide 3D images of the Martian landscape but also data on the atmosphere, is a major milestone as we move forward to the rover being ready to fly in July 2020.”

The PanCam consists of three cameras. Two wide angle cameras will take panoramic images, and a filter wheel enables them to image in 12 different wavelengths. A high resolution camera will image in full colour. Included on the rover is a Rover Inspection Mirror which will allow the PanCam to image parts of the rover not directly in its field of view to allow the status of the rover to be monitored.

The ExoMars rover Rosalind Franklin will be Europe’s first planetary rover and is being assembled at Airbus in Stevenage. It will search for signs of past or present life on Mars and is equipped with a 2m drill to take samples from below the surface where they will have been protected from the harsh radiation environment.

The rover features nine instruments which will help scientists conduct a step-by-step exploration of Mars, from a panoramic scale and progressively converging to smaller (sub-millimetre) studies, concluding with the molecular identification of organic compounds. The rover is equipped with an autonomous navigation system developed by Airbus which will enable it to travel between sites of interest much more quickly than by being driven remotely in real time from Earth.

Rosalind Franklin is in the final stages of integration in the cleanroom in Stevenage. The instruments have been fitted inside the rover’s “bathtub” and the top deck with solar arrays has been installed. The rover’s drill is also in place – with testing due to take place in the next few weeks. After completion at Stevenage the rover will be shipped to Airbus in Toulouse for a programme of environmental testing to prepare it for launch.

Mirus reaches linefit milestone for Airbus A320 family - PaxEx.Aero,"Thu, 22 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vcGF4ZXguYWVyby9taXJ1cy1oYXdrLWxpbmVmaXQtYWlyYnVzLWEzMjAv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Seating manufacturer Mirus hit a major milestone this week, dispatching its first ship set of seats to Hamburg for installation on an aircraft at the Airbus factory. The seats are expected to be installed on the final assembly line at Finkenwerder next week, with first flight and customer (AirAsia) delivery shortly thereafter.

The Mirus seats loaded up for shipping from England to Germany and installation on an AirAsia A320 at the Finkenwerder factory next week.

In a statement issued commemorating the milestone CEO Phil Hall highlighted some of the challenges overcome to get to this point, as well as the support and contributions from suppliers and partners, as well as from Airbus and AirAsia, to reach this point.

Today marks the culmination of a dream that started over 8 years ago. It also marks the fulfilment of a promise made. That dream and that promise was that I could deliver an economy seat to the Airbus final assembly line as an approved Airbus supplier. I use the word ‘I’ liberally as clearly I could not have reached this milestone by myself. There were no shortcuts to get to this place, just a lot of dedicated, hardworking individuals who share my passion to do things a little differently. Therefore, I would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone that has helped us on this journey – from our suppliers, to our shareholders, and to each and every member of Team Mirus – because without them, none of this would have been possible. We are also immensely thankful of the steadfast support of our customer, AirAsia, and the patience and guidance received from Airbus, both of whom contributed so enormously to us reaching this momentous goal. The road to get here has been tortuous and sometimes treacherous; there is still so much to learn and so many areas we can and need to improve. We give knowing acknowledgement to the fact that we can do better and that we are still on our journey to be the best we can be and truly fulfil our potential. But this is what drives us. Nonetheless, today, as we waved off our first shipset for delivery, I took a moment to let the pride sink in. For me, this achievement marks the maturing of Mirus Aircraft Seating as a business and as a real contender. I sometimes forget that 4 ½ years ago none of the business I see today existed. I am very excited to see what we can achieve in the next 4 ½ years and beyond.

Mirus Hawk seats as installed on an A320

The line-fit installation comes 17 months after the first AirAsia A320 retrofit with the Mirus Hawk seat took flight. That milestone was reached just two years after the order was first announced. The overall timeline for the company’s entrance into the seating market as a significant player has proven very impressive.

Beyond the AirAsia work, Mirus also has a retrofit contract with TUI Group for retrofit work on some of that carrier’s 767s.

Seated in the Mirus Kestrel mock-up at AIX19 and my knees had plenty of room, even at 28″ pitch

The company also continues to innovate. It unveiled an even lighter and slimmer model, the Kestrel, at Aircraft Interiors Expo in Hamburg earlier this year.

Foundation of data - Aerospace Manufacturing,"Tue, 27 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiK2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm8tbWFnLmNvbS9mb3VuZGF0aW9uLW9mLWRhdGHSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus is connecting its software platforms, old and new, to create a data collection and analysis system that drives continuous improvement within the European giant and beyond to its supplier base and airline customers. Rob Coppinger reports.

A data lake fed by Airbus, its suppliers and airline customers are to be the backbone for all the improvement efforts in design, development, manufacturing and servicing that the European aerospace firm will carry out in future. Called Digital Design Manufacturing and Services (DDMS) it includes existing software such as enterprise resource planning, product data management and what Airbus calls its manufacturing execution system and its more recent, Skywise platform. Airbus launched Skywise to a handful of internal and external users a few years ago and is now expanding its use.

With DDMS, a goal is to co-design the product and production system simultaneously with the help of that data lake backbone.

“What we are putting in place is the mastering of the execution not only internal to Airbus, but really in the complete ecosystem of Airbus and our partners,” says Airbus senior vice-president Alain Tropis, who oversees the digital design manufacturing and services project. The digital co-design of product and factory is expected to deliver a faultless manufacturing process, leading to higher rates of production early on and quicker deliveries for an aircraft programme.

“We'll capture some data from all the execution systems,” Tropis says, referring to the manufacturing system and all the other core business functions that carry out and execute what is necessary for the business to deliver its products. We will capture this information from the different systems and combine them in a single environment to be able to connect data.”

The datalake is expected to create digital twins for products and factories and the manufacture of an aircraft would be modelled in detail to ensure production started without any problems

Airbus is not building the entire DDMS and then turning a switch for an overnight changeover; instead various parts of the DDMS are already in place and slowly it is all being brought together for that data lake.

“We have perhaps six or seven [DDMS] demonstrator [projects],” Tropis explains. One demonstrator he describes is for an engine nacelle and that project is focused on production with the involvement of the shopfloor staff. Another demonstrator project is ongoing at Airbus’ Hamburg site, and its hangar 245 where it builds its single aisle models. “We are already implementing [DDMS] at the shopfloor level to really get the buy-in [by staff], demonstrating the value to their work on their ergonomics,” Tropis says. And shopfloor operators are also being proactive in their engagement with the DDMS demonstrators.

The A350 EXtra Wide Body model is another area where DDMS demonstrator projects have been underway. Again, this involves the shopfloor. “We are deploying [DDMS for] the A350 between engineering work orders and the way we are iterating with the shopfloor to make more efficiencies at shopfloor level.” The introduction of new automation will also be planned through DDMS, to try to implement robotics to help manufacturing, without having a large shopfloor footprint. Another new part of Airbus’ approach to manufacturing is its use of its Skywise platform, which it deploys for its factories’ quality management.

Skywise is a platform that is the point of access for airlines, lessors, maintenance repair organisations, suppliers and regulators within the DDMS data eco-system Airbus is developing. Airbus has created a worldwide infrastructure with telecoms partners for the collation of data from its customers that it says is secure and reliable for Skywise. This digital platform has more than 70 airlines and 6,000 aircraft, along with Airbus users and 10,000 users of Skywise every month. The US carrier Allegiant Air told Airbus that Skywise stops one aircraft-on-ground event every day.

Airbus Helicopters and the company’s defence and space division are also undertaking DDMS projects. Tropis also cites more, “ambitious,” projects that are taking place in Airbus’ research and technology (R&T) activities. “We try to be much more innovative with what we are testing because, by definition, we are in R&T. We can push the limit of the system more,” he explains. Airbus’ investments in this digital co-operative future include the Internet of Things (IoT). Tropis explains that on some of Airbus’ sites, IoT devices are providing a feedback loop for manufacturing analytics to improve the shopfloor operational performance.

The collection of data from the shopfloor and the use of Internet of Things technology means an exact copy of production machinery can be created and these virtual machines can be programmed

Bringing its suppliers with it on this journey to build DDMS up into an enterprise wide system is important to Airbus. “We need to ensure that we are designing and interacting in the co-development mode between Airbus and its partners,” Tropis says. Airbus will not be specifying particular software platforms for suppliers to use. Instead, Airbus will use Application Programming Interfaces, or APIs, which allows dissimilar software to share data. “We'll agree on the APIs and data exchange to get these data exchanges,” he adds.

Security is going to be important for these data exchanges. “Cybersecurity is a key parameter in the design [of DDMS],” says Tropis. “Today, we are customising a Cloud approach to be sure that we embed all the security that we want to put in place.” Airbus is examining how to use the cloud whether to outsource the Cloud or to have its own Cloud datacentres.

Cybersecurity is an important issue because Airbus has military projects as well as civil ones. “Tomorrow, we will exchange, and we'll share a lot of data, so the continuity of the data will be key. To ensure that the continuity of the data is really powerful, we need to ensure the cybersecurity of the data between Airbus, the partner, and the airlines,” he adds.

Shopfloor projects, IoT devices sending back data from the factory, the modelling of the machine tools and other equipment to create a virtual copies, like a product’s digital twin; and not only of Airbus’ finished product and operations, but of the suppliers – this digital extended enterprise aims to fully harness the potential of data as an agent of change from the very beginning of an aerospace component to airlines’ own operations.

American Airlines A319 First Review I - One Mile at a Time,"Wed, 28 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vb25lbWlsZWF0YXRpbWUuY29tL2FtZXJpY2FuLWFpcmxpbmVzLWEzMTktZmlyc3QtY2xhc3MtcmV2aWV3L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Since you guys seemed to enjoy my recent review of Delta’s 737 first class, I’ve decided to review more domestic (or in this case transborder) flights. To kick off our awesome trip, Ford and I flew to Toronto, which is where we were meeting my dad (he flew to Toronto on Air Canada Rouge from Tampa).

Booking our American flight

The schedule that worked best for us was an American Airlines flight departing in the morning from Miami to Toronto. The flight was operated by an A319, which has just eight first class seats. Because of the small cabin, upgrades on this plane are notoriously difficult.

We booked about a week out and there were only two first class seats for sale. We ended up paying about $400 per person to buy those seats outright. That was about $150 more per person than we would have paid for economy, so that seemed worthwhile since the upgrades seemed unlikely.

American A319 first class review

Miami is my home airport, and it was a pleasantly quiet day. Usually the TSA PreCheck line even has a long queue, but in this case we were through in a matter of minutes. While Miami Airport has several Priority Pass restaurants and an Amex Centurion Lounge, usually I just go to the Admirals Club.

Why? Because there are two convenient locations, and they’re surprisingly quiet, especially in the mornings. If we were hungry we would have gone to a Priority Pass restaurant, while I find the Centurion Lounge is often crowded. I get access to the Admirals Club on account of my Citi AAdvantage Executive Card.

We spent about 30 minutes in the lounge before heading to our departure gate.

Our flight was departing from gate D41, just a five minute walk from the D30 Admirals Club.

Boarding was scheduled for 8:08AM, and sure enough boarding started a couple of minutes after that. Concierge Key members were invited to board first, followed by first class.

Seat: 1A (First Class)

It’s always nice boarding an American Airlines flight and seeing the sticker right by the door reminding you that you’re flying on a five star airline. In fairness, on this particular day American was actually performing like a five star airline (give or take).

At the door I was greeted by the friendly lead flight attendant. American’s A319 first class cabin sure is intimate. That’s bad news if you’re trying to get an upgrade, though it’s good news if you’re seated in the cabin, since service is more attentive and it also feels pretty private.

I lucked out here because I was on one of American’s “nice” A319s. This was an ex-American A319, which came installed with personal televisions and comfortable seats. Meanwhile the ex-US Airways A319s aren’t nearly as comfortable. Eventually they’ll make all A319s less nice.

There were two rows of seats in a 2-2 configuration.

Ford and I were in seats 1A & 1C.

The padding and design of these seats was excellent, much more so than the new style seats that American is installing.

Personal televisions were on the bulkhead. In addition to them being touchscreen, there was also an entertainment controller on the far armrest that you could use to select your entertainment.

The tray table folded out from the center armrest, and could be flipped over in half.

I also like that these seats have little drink trays that can be raised from the center armrest, which are great if you want somewhere to put a drink without using your full tray table.

The power outlets (including 110v and USB outlets) plus headphone jack were underneath the center armrest. This is such a better location than where American is installing power on their reconfigured planes (which is to the back corner of the seat).

Waiting at my seat was a pretty basic blanket — American doesn’t offer pillows on flights within North America, except in select premium markets.

A few minutes after settling in, the friendly flight attendant offered us pre-departure drinks of choice. A punctual flight, a plane with a nice interior, a friendly flight attendant, and pre-departure beverages of choice on American? Someone pinch me. Ford and I both had coffee with milk.

Boarding was efficient even though the flight was full, given that the A319 is a fairly small plane. At around 8:40AM the main cabin door closed. At this point the lead flight attendant announced our flight time of 2hr42min and our cruising altitude of 37,000 feet.

A few minutes later we started our pushback, at which point the safety video was screened. At 8:45AM we started our taxi.

While our taxi to the runway was fairly quick, we had to wait about 15 minutes before it was our turn for takeoff, as there were both planes arriving and departing. We took off right behind a 777-200 bound for Dallas.

We were cleared for takeoff on runway 26L at 9:10AM.

Taking off from Miami

While departure views were nice, we were flying west, so we didn’t get to fly over the water.

This A319 had American’s Viasat Wi-Fi. Personally that’s my preferred provider (American otherwise has Gogo 2Ku — both are excellent). So I connected using my Gogo credentials. I’d note for those without a membership, the pricing was reasonable, as Wi-Fi for the entire flight cost $10.

About 20 minutes after takeoff the flight attendant introduced himself by name, and reconfirmed the breakfast options that we had pre-ordered. He also asked us what we wanted to drink.

About 10 minutes later he offered us warm towels.

Then a few minutes later he offered us drinks — we both had water.

About 40 minutes after takeoff breakfast was served. There were two options, and we selected one of each.

I had the oatmeal with a side of fresh fruit.

Meanwhile Ford had the scramble.

With both we had the choice of a biscuit, bagel, or chocolate pastry. I selected the biscuit, while Ford had the chocolate pastry.

The food wasn’t great — the oatmeal was bland, while the egg dish just looked like it was too much effort for them to execute well. At the same time, I think just about all US airlines do breakfast pretty poorly. I’d actually say this breakfast was a bit better than what was served on Delta in first class on a flight of a similar length the week prior.

After the meal I checked out the lavatory at the front of the cabin, which was a decent size. It didn’t have any special amenities, but was clean.

I worked for almost the entire flight. I’d note that the flight attendant was truly excellent, and constantly checked to see if anyone wanted anything.

Since I was working the entire flight I didn’t use the entertainment much, other than to watch the moving map.

For those who do want to watch the entertainment, the selection was quite good, with dozens of movies and TV shows.

At around 11:30AM the seatbelt sign was turned on for landing. A few minutes after that the flight attendant came through the cabin to distribute mints and thank everyone for flying American.

It’s also worth noting — simply because it’s abnormal — that the crew didn’t do a credit card pitch. I’m not sure if that’s because this was technically an international flight, or what (as I know I’ve heard them on international flights as well).

It wasn’t a particularly nice day in Toronto, and we ended up touching down at 11:50AM.

View approaching Toronto

From there we had a roughly 10 minute taxi to our arrival gate at Terminal 3, where we arrived at 12PM.

Immigration was a mess, at least for those of us without NEXUS. First you have to go to a kiosk and enter all kinds of information. No big deal, except these kiosks seem to constantly be broken, and spend an inexplicable amount of time trying to adjust to your height when taking your picture.

Then we had to queue for an agent. The biggest issue was just that the queuing system for all of these things was nonsensical. Like there are dozens and dozens of kiosks, and then you have to line up again, but the line only starts in one place, and then people keep trying to cut it.

American A319 first class bottom line

This was a very good flight on American — if only they were always this good. Our flight was on-time, the service was friendly, and we got one of the American A319s with the old (nice) interiors."

From existing sport plane to e-racing machine - Airbus,"Wed, 21 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDE5LTA4LWZyb20tZXhpc3Rpbmctc3BvcnQtcGxhbmUtdG8tZS1yYWNpbmctbWFjaGluZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Condor Aviation has made its name building and testing bespoke modifications to light aircraft. Now, thrilled by the challenge of electric flight, Team Condor—eight engineers from Condor Aviation—is applying that same expertise to create a customised electric aircraft for Air Race E.

Approximately seven years ago, Martyn Wiseman acquired a disused airfield, which dated back to 1942, in Yorkshire, UK. With the backing of his structural engineering company Condor Projects, he set about creating a small aviation R&D business—Condor Aviation. The airfield site underwent major renovation and now houses a full engineering shop that designs, builds and tests bespoke modifications to light aircraft. This is the headquarters of Team Condor, where Wiseman and a team of eight engineers are turning an existing sport plane into an electric-powered racing machine.

If air racing provides a boost to battery technology—as F1 has done for fuel efficiency and KERS—that can only be a good thing.

- Martyn Wiseman, Head of Team Condor

5 questions with Martyn Wiseman, Head of Team Condor

Q. Why did your team decide to enter Air Race E?

Air Race E is a tremendously exciting challenge! We’re a competitive group of people who like to win, so air racing is a fantastic opportunity. Over the past 20 years, we’ve been undertaking R&D and modifying aircraft—first as a hobby and, more recently, as a professional operation. After meeting Air Race E CEO, Jeff Zaltman, we decided we were in a great position to assemble a team and build a competitive race plane.

Q. Can you give us some insight on the aircraft you’re currently working on? What is your approach?

Firstly, we don’t aim to reinvent the wheel! There are some brilliant, proven airframes out there. And with some—admittedly extensive!—modification, we can change the powertrain from fossil fuels to electric. What needs to be considered is the weight of the batteries to enable the aircraft to run at full speed for the duration required. There are two options available: an airframe capable of carrying a large 250 hp-plus motor with heavy batteries, or a lighter frame with a 100 hp motor and lighter batteries. Both approaches are viable, so we’ve decided to go for both: an unlimited racer and a lightweight-restricted category.

Q. What sets your team apart in this race?

We’re one of just a few companies in the UK permitted to design and build or modify experimental aircraft under the new “E Conditions.” This means we can design, build and test-fly anything aviation-related without having to wait for either the Permit to Fly or a Certificate of Airworthiness from the regulatory authorities. That cuts months, if not years, off the build time.

Q. For you, what is the most exciting aspect of the race?

I love the engineering challenge, and I love to be a pioneer. I also like racing, and I love to win! As a businessman, I find the most exciting thing is to take an idea, prove it and then take it to market.

Q. How important is electric flight to the future of aviation?

Critical—from both an ecological and a commercial point of view. Air travel is here to stay, so we have to look to an alternative means of power, even if only for short-haul flights in the first instance. If air racing provides a boost to battery technology—as F1 has done for fuel efficiency and KERS (Kinetic Energy Recovery System)—that can only be a good thing.

Martyn Wiseman is head of Team Condor, a participating team in Air Race E, which will become the world’s first all-electric airplane race when it launches its inaugural series of international races in 2020.

The demand for speed, performance and power management under the rigors of a competitive race environment provides the perfect platform for the development and promotion of cleaner, faster and more technologically advanced electric motors. Airbus is the Official Founding Partner of the series."
Flying at night over the City of Tech - Airbus,"Thu, 29 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDE5LTA4LWZseWluZy1hdC1uaWdodC1vdmVyLXRoZS1jaXR5LW9mLXRlY2jSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Buckle up for a quick tour of Silicon Valley and San Jose: three major airports dot the length of the Peninsula – San Jose, San Francisco, and Moffet Field – not to mention the ever-busier Palo Alto and San Carlos airports. On the freeways, don’t be surprised to see self-driving cars emblazoned with adds for apps and start-ups. And while the air space over its major cities is lit by a white glow of light, the region’s mountain ranges and prized public parks present limitations to night-time visibility.

Policing the vast sprawl that is San Jose, California is challenging at the best of times. “We’re in the middle of a valley,” says Officer Andy Lacayo of the San Jose Police Department. “We have a ridge line that we’re surrounded by. There are public parks nearby. Just last night, there was a missing person in the mountains. If it wasn’t for the fact that we had night vision goggles, we wouldn’t have been able to look for this person, because it’s completely dark.”

The San Jose Police Department’s new H125 comes with night vision goggles and camera equipment, opening a new world for officers patrolling Silicon Valley’s southernmost city.

“A BIG JUMP FORWARD”

The San Jose Police took delivery of a new H125 in July 2018 and with it, a serious increase in the force’s public safety capabilities. In addition to a night vision-goggle compatible cockpit, the helicopter can handle a load of mission equipment that was less adapted to the department’s previous H120. In supporting ground patrol units during searches and suspect pursuits, and supporting the fire and sheriff’s departments, “flying the H125 was a big jump forward for what we do,” says Lacayo. “We have more equipment: the camera system, the lighting system, police radios. And we hope to help in rescue missions—that’s more weight, but the H125 is capable of expanding to that mission.”

H125 San Jose Police

Despite the area’s kilometres of jam-packed freeways – or perhaps because of it – the police department’s air support unit plays a starring role in suspect pursuits. A chat with one of Lacayo’s fellow officers sounds like something out of a Hollywood movie. “We had a shootout with officers,” says Officer Kris Kubasta. “The sheriff’s department tried to stop a stolen car with two suspects. They started shooting at the deputies. We picked up the vehicle just as it started driving the wrong way at speeds of 80 miles per hour on the freeway. We followed until the suspects ditched that vehicle and fled on foot with the shotgun until they came upon a UPS driver. They took him hostage at gunpoint, forced him into the UPS truck, and then fled.” Happy ending: after a hostage standoff, both suspects were taken into custody, and no officers were hurt. “The suspects would have been in the wind, had we not been overhead and without the capabilities of the H125, its camera system, and its advanced electronics.”

We have more equipment: the camera system, the lighting system, police radios. And we hope to help in rescue missions—that’s more weight, but the H125 is capable of expanding to that mission.

- Officer Andy Lacayo of the San Jose Police Department

“A WHOLE NEW WORLD”

Whether it be following lawbreakers down neighborhood streets or apprehending criminals (the H125 was integral in finding a bank robber the first day the helicopter was put into operation), its pilots laud the greater mission capability the helicopter provides. “We can fly longer, we can fly higher,” says Kubasta. “The equipment that it can carry is phenomenal. The space in the cockpit is great, enough to have a larger screen, more room to look around, and visibility. Plus with the night vision cockpit upgrade that we have—we’re in a whole new world.”

A Look Inside China Southern’s First Airbus A350-900 - The Points Guy,"Tue, 13 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9uZXdzL2NoaW5hLXNvdXRoZXJuLWZpcnN0LWFpcmJ1cy1hMzUwLTkwMC1pbnNpZGUtbG9vay_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It's been about a month since China Southern's first A350 entered service and photos of its interior have finally surfaced. Along with the launch of a new aircraft type for the airline comes the introduction of completely new business class, premium economy and economy seats.

Up front, the business class cabin offers 28 seats in a 1-2-1 configuration. It sports Recaro's CL6710 seat, which is the same model you'll find in business class on El Al's Dreamliners and TAP Portugal's A330neo.

While the blue leather seats, beige plastic and light ""wood"" trim color scheme leave a lot to be desired, the seats themselves should be a slight improvement over China Southern's current product. The seats resemble a reverse-herringbone design similar to what's found on airlines such as Cathay Pacific and EVA Air, but with the seat position alternating between rows. Each seat offers direct aisle access.

China Southern is initially flying the A350 between Beijing (PEK) and Guangzhou (CAN) before deploying it on long-haul trans-Pacific flights. The airline has 19 more of these planes on order, which they expect to take delivery through 2022. As of now, there are no plans to retrofit existing planes with these seats.

EASA finds excessive pitch issue in second Airbus A320 family jet - AeroTime,"Mon, 05 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm90aW1lLmFlcm8vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjM3ODItZWFzYS1maW5kcy1leGNlc3NpdmUtcGl0Y2gtaXNzdWUtaW4tc2Vjb25kLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzIwLWZhbWlseS1qZXTSAW5odHRwczovL3d3dy5hZXJvdGltZS5hZXJvL2FydGljbGVzLzIzNzgyLWVhc2EtZmluZHMtZXhjZXNzaXZlLXBpdGNoLWlzc3VlLWluLXNlY29uZC1haXJidXMtYTMyMC1mYW1pbHktamV0L2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Airbus A320neo has been found to be potentially subject to an angle-of-attack protection weakness, which, under certain circumstances, could lead to excessive pitch and higher flight crew workload conditions. The notification by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) comes weeks after a similar excessive pitch anomaly was discovered on the A321neo.

According to the Airworthiness Directive (AD), issued by the EASA on July 31, 2019, a “reduced efficiency” of the A320neo angle-of-attack (AOA) protection under certain flight configurations, and in combination with specific commanded maneuvers from the flight crew, could lead to excessive pitch attitudes, possibly resulting in increased workload.

This “potentially unsafe” condition, although never encountered during operations, was discovered during analysis and laboratory testing of the A320neo flight control laws, the EASA says.

Airbus has issued temporary revisions to the A320neo flight manual (AFM TR) to address the situation, and the EASA has ordered operators of the type to revise their manuals accordingly. The revisions limit the center-of-gravity envelope for the plane. In addition, the manufacturer has provided loading recommendations.

The regulator’s instructions for the type come after a similar issue was found in another member of the Airbus A320 Family, the A321neo. In that case, Airbus’ temporary revisions to the A321neo flight manuals were necessitated after analysis of the elevator and aileron computer installed on the aircraft. A behavior anomaly in these computer units was also found to potentially lead to an excessive pitch scenario.

In the AD, issued by the EASA on July 17, 2019, operators of the A321neo were also urged to update their flight manuals according to temporary revisions developed by Airbus. The directive, considered as an “interim action”, has since been revised and published again on July 31, 2019. Operators must comply with a 30 day ‘window’ starting August 7, 2019.

As for the instructions regarding the A320neo, the AD comes into effect on August 14, 2019, already, with the commentary period postponed after its publication."

Following training in Mirabel and Quebec, Canada, where the primary A220 production and delivery facilities are, the first team of workers commenced operations in the new Mobile building next to the existing A320 line.

Airbus notes the additional production line provides around 400 new jobs within the area, as well as broadening their commercial aircraft manufacturing footprint.

“With Mobile, and our production network in Asia, Canada and Europe, we have strategically created a worldwide industrial base to better serve our customers.” Airbus Americas Chairman & CEO, C. Jeffrey Knittel



The first aircraft in assembly is an A220-300 scheduled to be delivered during the third quarter of 2020 to Delta Air Lines. Although a lengthy build, launching a new production line with a new aircraft requires a firm and established set of knowledge in all the workers.

Delta’s New A220

Additionally, suppliers have to prepare for greater production output and new delivery locations. By the middle of the next decade, Airbus aims to have Mobile produce 40-50 A220 aircraft per year.

Although construction of Airbus’ $300 million investment is still ongoing, completed structures as well as spare room in the A320 line is allowing the workers to commence the work. The first large components, such as the cockpit and fuselage sections, arrived at the facility in June.

Airbus Mobile, Alabama Production Complex

The initial plan was to produce the A220 in the United States as a way of avoiding the threat of tariffs on the import of the aircraft. Despite the growing fear, Bombardier won the dispute before handing over majority rights to Airbus, who elected to continue their US plans anyway.

As of the end of June 2019 Airbus recorded a backlog of orders for the A220 of 551 aircraft. Offering a 20 per cent reduction in fuel burn per seat compared to the previous generation competing aircraft; Airbus states the A220 has all the credentials to win the majority of the 100-150 seat market, representing over 7000 aircraft over the next 20 years."

Brisbane – Airbus Helicopters is offering a cost-effective approach for taking the Tiger platform beyond 2040, in response to the Commonwealth of Australia’s (CoA) Request for Information (RFI) for the Project LAND4503 Armed Reconnaissance Capability. The RFI seeks solutions for the army’s future armed reconnaissance helicopter needs.

Airbus is the manufacturer of the tandem seat Tiger helicopters introduced to the Australian Army in 2004. Eighteen of the 22 units were assembled at the Airbus site in Brisbane, Australia. The fleet has been supported in Australia for more than 15 years.

The Airbus Helicopters proposal will offer the Australian Army and taxpayer with more than AUD3 billion in savings against the expected budget for LAND4503.

“Tiger is an extremely agile, effective, and digitally connected armed reconnaissance helicopter,” said Andrew Mathewson, Airbus Australia Pacific Managing Director.

“Since delivery, the Australian Tiger has matured into a fully operational army capability, and is integrated into the combined arms team. It continues to prove itself as an adaptable platform, and is now a key element of Australia’s amphibious capabilities on-board the Canberra Class Landing Helicopter Docks.”

Cost per flight hour of the Australian Tiger has reduced by more than 30 per cent, and the sortie success rate is currently sitting at above 95 per cent. It is these measures that are acknowledged in Australia and internationally as unmatched, and place Tiger in a compelling position.

“Airbus proudly delivers a strong Australian industry capability, including more than 260 local staff supporting Tiger,” Mathewson added.

The Tiger fleet has proven itself in diverse and extreme environments around the world with 120,000 flights hours logged by international operators, including more than 30,000 in Australia. It has provided support to counter insurgency operations in Mali, security operations in Afghanistan, and amphibious strike in Libya, operating reliably in the harsh extremes of heat and cold of the desert and in the maritime domain.

Globally, 181 Tigers have been delivered to Australia, France, Germany and Spain. First deployed by the French Army in Afghanistan in 2009, Tiger continues to demonstrate its essential role in theatres of operation as a highly versatile, stealthy, and manoeuvrable attack helicopter.

A Look Back At Airbus Cracking the US Market - InsideFlyer,"Fri, 16 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRlZmx5ZXIuY29tLzIwMTkvMDgvMTYvYS1sb29rLWJhY2stYXQtYWlyYnVzLWNyYWNraW5nLXRoZS11cy1tYXJrZXQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus cracking the US market was one of the most important things in that companies history. Without that, the aviation industry we know today would be very different.

Their lead product, known as the Airbus A300, entered airline service on 30 May 1974 with Air France. Despite sales tours around the world, less than 25 aircraft were in service by the end of 1976. The new manufacturer was struggling to gain momentum.

Airbus Cracking The US Market

Following on from the video last week about the BAC One-Eleven, this week we take a look at the early history of Airbus. Produced by the excellent Mustard channel on YouTube, this runs for a little over 10 minutes.

Wheeling and dealing is a feature of the corporate world and the aviation industry is no different. Airbus came up with a unique solution to get their new jet into service with a premier airline.

Eastern Airlines was, at the time, one of the largest domestic carriers in the USA, led by ex-astronaut Frank Borman of Gemini 7 and Apollo 8. Airbus approached the airline to loan them four Airbus A300s for six months, for nothing, as a trial.

In service, the Airbus A300 used up to 30% less fuel than the Lockheed TriStar, resulting in an order for 23 aircraft. The other thing that helped Airbus was the extension of ETOPS to 90 minutes, opening up more destinations directly.

Overall Thoughts

While Airbus cracking the US market was a milestone, just as important was the development of a family of aircraft. From the A300 came the A310 and then later in the 1980s, a little technological marvel arrived, named the Airbus A320. You might have heard of it!

The industry has changed a lot since the 1970s, as back then the main manufacturers were Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, with Fokker and Lockheed also prominent. Nowadays it is Boeing and Airbus, with Embraer and Bombardier covering the smaller segment.

The aircraft, registration N850UA, returned to service after being outfitted with 12 first-class seats on July 31, an internal newsletter to flight attendants and FlightAware.com show. The reconfigured aircraft has 36 extra-legroom Economy Plus seats and 78 economy seats for a total of 126 passengers, or two fewer than United's previous A319 layout.

The additional first-class seats, and smaller Economy cabin, benefits both the Chicago-based carrier and passengers. It creates additional revenue opportunities for United, as well as additional upgrade opportunities for passengers.

United announced plans to add first-class seats to both its A319 and Airbus A320 fleets in February. The move is part of a larger push to offer more premium seats across its fleet and includes plans for the Bombardier CRJ550 -- a re-certified CRJ700 with 50 seats, including first class -- and its ""high-J"" Boeing 767-300ERs with an expanded Polaris Business Class cabin.

""In an era where many airlines are adding seats to their aircraft to crowd more passengers onto the plane, we're... doing exactly the opposite – for the benefit of our customers,"" said Andrew Nocella, chief commercial officer of United, in a February statement. ""From adding more premium seats on aircraft that serve some of our most traveled routes, introducing a revolutionary, best-in-class 50-seat experience... we are committed to making United the airline that our customers choose to fly.""

By Liz Lee

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysian budget carrier AirAsia Group Bhd <AIRA.KL> scaled back plans to order the Airbus <AIR.PA> A330neo wide-body passenger jet by nearly two thirds on Friday, switching its focus instead to a long-range new version of the popular A321 series.

The long-haul arm of Asia's largest budget airline group, AirAsia X Bhd <AIRX.KL>, had left its fleet expansion in suspense since initially unveiling plans to order 34 more of the 250-300-seat A330neo jets, on top of 66 already on order.

The deal was later thrown into doubt as AirAsia reviewed its needs and on Friday the group said it was confirming 12 of the 34 extra A330neo planes while adopting 30 of the smaller, long-range A321XLRs.

The move came days after AirAsia X reported its biggest quarterly loss since 2015 and said it expected the operational environment to remain challenging.

Late on Friday, AirAsiaX said in a stock exchange filing that chief financial officer Wong Mee Yen had resigned to ""pursue personal interests,"" giving no further detail. She had served in the post since December 2017.

Airbus said the latest jet deal would have been worth more than $5 billion at catalogue prices, which it no longer publishes. After typical discounts, the deal would be worth about half this, aircraft traders say. AirAsia Group CEO Tony Fernandes said the recently launched A321XLR, which seats up to 240 passengers and can fly for up to 9 hours without refuelling, would allow the group to open longer niche routes without the risk of trying to fill the A330neo.

""There are many routes from Malaysia, Thailand and some other countries that we really want to fly that (take) more than four hours, so don't fit the AirAsia model but have too (few passengers) for the A330,"" he said, citing destinations in India, China, Russia and Turkey.

""We can use this smaller plane to develop new routes and then transfer it to the bigger aircraft.""

Story continues

TOUGH NEGOTIATIONS

The downsized order for A330neos - offset by an investment in the A321XLR - follows more than a year of tough negotiations.

In July 2018, Fernandes had tweeted that conditions for a new order included price, performance, engines and advance payments, before adding ""or else"" in a remark designed to draw in rival Boeing <BA.N>..

Airbus, under pressure to catch Boeing which was leading the order race before the grounding of its 737 MAX, and facing questions over the future of the A330neo, announced at the 2018 Farnborough Airshow it had a ""firm"" AirAsiaX order for 34 jets.

But negotiations took a further twist as the deal failed to materialise in Airbus's books and the arrival of the new A321XLR added a new option for the two sides to play with this year.

Industry sources have said AirAsia was in talks to become a launch customer for the A321XLR at the Paris Airshow in June this year but an agreement was not reached in time.

The rejigged contract increases the number of A330neos on order by AirAsiaX to 78, leaving it as the largest global customer, though some analysts question how quickly the loss-making airline can take delivery of the planes.

None of the planes from its prior firm order for 66 A330neos has yet been delivered to the airline, although Thai AirAsia X took a leased A330neo from leasing company Avalon this month after the plane was freed up by the demise of Iceland's WOW Air.

AirAsia did not announce delivery dates for most of the extra A330neos or the A321XLRs, but Fernandes said they were ""perfect partners"" for AirAsiaX's long-haul low-cost operations

The airline group is Airbus's largest Asian customer. As part of the deal, Airbus said it had signed a provisional agreement to expand its industrial initiatives in Malaysia.

HiFly Unveils Airbus A330neo Cabin - SamChui.com - Sam Chui,"Wed, 21 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vc2FtY2h1aS5jb20vMjAxOS8wOC8yMS9oaWZseS11bnZlaWxzLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzMwbmVvLWNhYmluL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Ahead of delivery HiFly has unveiled their new Airbus A330-900neo cabin, as part of an effort to secure greater interest in their wet-lease and charter product.

HiFly has elected to configure their state-of-the-art Airbus A330-900neo in a two-class layout, featuring 371 Economy and Business seats.

Class Number of Seats Economy 353 Business 18

Business Class

Three rows of 2-2-2 fully-flat Business Class seating will be installed on HiFly’s Airbus A330neo, making for a cozy cabin area for premium flyers.

The bright primary structures, along with the darker secondary fittings add to the cosy look whilst remaining quite modern.

Business passengers will have high-speed entertainment at their fingertips, with Zodiac’s third-generation RAVE as the selected entertainment hardware.









It’s obvious from the photos that passengers will also have access to the common features such as: storage areas, USB ports, AC power outlets and variable controls for the seat position.

Economy

The squeeze becomes evident in Economy, as HiFly has opted for 353 seats in a 3-3-3 configuration; which as many know, is painful enough on the A330 and Boeing 787.

Depending on your location in the economy cabin, the seat pitch is listed as 30 to 32″.

Just like Business each Economy passenger will have access to a smaller Zodiac RAVE entertainment system, as well as USB charging ports.







Based in Portugal, HiFly has positioned itself as one of the most prominent aircraft wet-leasing and chartering specialists.

Since their launch in 2006, HiFly has adopted an all-Airbus fleet comprising of the following aircraft:

1x Airbus A321-200

2x Airbus A330-200

2x A340-300

1x A340-500

1x A380-800

HiFly Airbus A380-800

Their first of ten Airbus A330-900neos is expected to be delivered to the airline in the very near future.

HiFly’s website states this aircraft will be registered as TS-TKY and will be flown as MSN 1929.

The addition of the new aircraft will provide excellent efficiency and operating performance, thanks to its new Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines and advanced aerodynamic upgrades.

The upgrades alone allow for flight distances up to 11,700km, with a max payload burning 5.2 tons of fuel per hour.

At this time, no announcement has been made as to who will be the first customer; however with the ongoing 737 MAX groundings likely to continue, the new aircraft may prove attractive.

Part of what HiFly specialises in is not only providing airlines with an aircraft, but also the crews, maintenance and insurance to sustain operations.

Although not top of the line, or amazingly attractive, the cabin selected for their new fleet of Airbus A330neos is definitely an upgrade, this will be far more attractive to the airlines in need of a quick fleet patch.

AirAsiaX places US$5 bn order with Airbus - Asia Times,"Sat, 31 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vYXNpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS8yMDE5LzA4L2FpcmFzaWF4LXBsYWNlcy11czUtYm4tb3JkZXItd2l0aC1haXJidXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In a major blow to US aircraft manufacturer Boeing, Malaysian airline AirAsia X has ordered 42 Airbus aircraft worth a total catalogue price of US$5 billion, Airbus said on Friday, Channel News Asia (CNA) reported.

The long-haul arm of Malaysia’s flagship budget carrier AirAsia has placed a firm order for 12 long-range A330neo planes and 30 medium-range A321XLR models, the European aircraft manufacturer said in a statement.

Major purchases are often finalized at a discount to the official catalogue price, CNA reported.

The contract with Airbus increases the number of A330neos on order by AirAsia to 78, making it the largest global customer for the type.

None of the planes from its prior firm order for 66 A330neos have yet been delivered to the airline, although Thai AirAsia X took a leased A330neo this month.

AirAsia did not announce planned delivery dates for the fresh batch of 12 A330neos or the A321XLRs, but AirAsia CEO Tony Fernandes said in a statement that the types were “perfect partners” for AirAsia X’s long-haul low-cost operations.

“In addition, the A321 XLR offers the longest flying range of any single-aisle aircraft and will enable us to introduce services to new destinations,” he added at a press conference in Kuala Lumpur.

He added that some of the destinations AirAsia was looking into with the new fleet were Nice, France, which is famous for its beaches, as well as London, CNA reported.

“London has always been close to our heart and with these new aircraft, we are positive we can reach there and return (profitably),” he said.

Airbus launched the A321XLR only this year, at the Paris Air Show, and expects to roll it out starting in 2023.

The single-aisle’s aircraft range is 15% above that of its predecessor model, the A321LR, making it a cost-effective alternative to long-haul wide body planes.

Guillaume Faury, The CEO of Airbus added: “This powerful solution will provide AirAsia X with the lowest possible operating costs to expand its network and enable even more people to fly further than ever before.”

AirAsia X last week reported its biggest quarterly loss since 2015 and said it expected continued pressure on the Malaysian currency and for the operational environment to remain challenging against the global economic backdrop.

According to Airbus, the A330neo will bring AirAsia X fuel savings of 25% compared to “older generation competitor aircraft of a similar size.” Meanwhile, the Airbus A321XLR will bring similar savings of 30% lower fuel burn than “previous generation competitor aircraft.”"
Air France to retire Airbus A380 by 2022 - International Flight Network,"Thu, 01 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmlmbi5uZXdzL3Bvc3RzL2Fpci1mcmFuY2UtdG8tcmV0aXJlLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzgwLWJ5LTIwMjIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Air France will phase out its entire fleet of Airbus A380 superjumbos by 2022. The airline currently operates a fleet of ten Airbus A380s.

According to Air France, the A380 consumes 20-25% more fuel per seat than new generation long-haul aircraft. Furthermore, increasing aircraft maintenance costs, as well as necessary cabin refurbishments reduce the economic profitability of the airline’s A380 fleet.

In November last year, it has already been reported that the French flag-carrier plans to retire a handful of its Airbus A380 aircraft in the near future.

The Air France-KLM Group has not yet decided on a replacement aircraft for the A380s, but is “studying possible replacement options for these aircraft with new generation aircraft currently on the market“.

Earlier this year, aircraft manufacturer Airbus announced that it will end its Airbus A380 programme. Singapore Airlines has already phased out several Airbus A380s and other airlines, including Lufthansa and Qatar Airways, also plan to retire at least some of their A380 jets. On the other hand, All Nippon Airways received its first Airbus A380 superjumbo in March and Emirates will take delivery of its final A380s until 2021. Moreover, Maltese charter airline HiFly Malta started operations with a second-hand Airbus A380, which was previously owned by Singapore Airlines.

Europe chooses Airbus for SMILE space weather satellite - GPS World magazine,"Fri, 09 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdwc3dvcmxkLmNvbS9ldXJvcGUtY2hvb3Nlcy1haXJidXMtZm9yLXNtaWxlLXNwYWNlLXdlYXRoZXItc2F0ZWxsaXRlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The European Space Agency has chosen Airbus to build the European component of the SMILE (Solar wind Magnetosphere Ionosphere Link Explorer) satellite.

SMILE will be the first joint satellite mission between the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), following on from the success of the Double Star/Tan Ce mission which flew between 2003 and 2008.

The objective of SMILE is to study and understand space weather. Specifically, it will look at the physics behind continuous interaction between particles in the solar wind and Earth’s magnetosphere, the magnetic shield that protects the existence of life in our planet.

Space weather can interfere with GNSS signals.

The mission is now entering a four-year period of manufacturing, testing and integration of the payload module and the platform. In launch configuration, these two components will form a 3.15-meter-high stack.

The spacecraft will have a mass of 2,200 kg and will travel in a highly elliptical orbit around the Earth. Its perigee will be at a distance of 5,000 km (from where it will download data to the Troll ground station in Antarctica and the CAS ground station in Sanya, China), while the apogee will be as far as 121,000 km (almost one third the distance to the Moon). At this vantage point the satellite will have a prolonged view of the Earth’s northern polar regions, to enable the boundary of the Earth’s magnetic field and the Northern Lights, or aurora borealis, to be imaged.

Payload in Madrid, platform in Shanghai. The payload module will be built at the Airbus site in Madrid, where the instruments will be integrated. The platform will be built in Shanghai. Both, the payload module and the platform will be integrated and tested at ESA’s European Space Research and Technology Centre facilities by a multinational team.

The science payload consists of four instruments:

The Soft X-ray Imager will obtain unique measurements of the regions where the solar wind impacts the magnetosphere.

The Ultra-Violet Imager will study the global distribution of the auroras.

The Light Ion Analyser will measure the energetic particles in the solar wind.

The Magnetometer will assess changes in the local magnetic field.

“Today, we are able to predict the weather on Earth; now it’s SMILE’s turn to help us understand space weather around the Earth and who knows? Probably one day, we will have enough data to be able to forecast dangerous solar storms that could disrupt our systems in space and on the ground,” said Fernando Varela, head of Airbus Space Systems in Spain. “We thank the Spanish Administration for their decisive and continued support to scientific missions.”

Other ESA missions, built by Airbus, such as Cluster that studied the Earth’s magnetosphere, and SOHO that studied the Sun, have already improved understanding of space weather.

Under the current plans, the spacecraft will be launched by a European Vega-C or Ariane 62 rocket in 2023."

Air Canada will begin nonstop service between Montreal and Toulouse, France, the airline announced Wednesday.

Once the service begins June 4, Air Canada says it will be the only carrier offering year-round nonstop service between North America and Toulouse. Canadian budget carrier Air Transat — which Air Canada is in the midst of acquiring — offers seasonal service, also from Montreal.

As for Toulouse, the city in southern France is home to Airbus' headquarters and hosts one of the jetmaker's largest factories. Airbus' final assembly line there includes facilities for its A380, A350, A330 and A320 aircraft.

Air Canada's service on the Montreal-Toulouse route – fittingly to be operated with Airbus A330-300 wide-body jets – will connect Toulouse to a region that's newly important to Airbus.

Airbus' new A220 line – which was acquired from struggling Canadian manufacturer Bombardier in 2017 when the plane was known was the ""CSeries"" – was developed and is currently in production at a facility in Mirabel, Quebec, just outside Montreal.

""This service will create opportunities to accelerate synergies between two of the world's leading aerospace industry hubs,"" Air Canada CEO Calin Rovinescu said in a statement.

He noted the route follows Air Canada's recently announced service between Montreal and Seattle, which is the largest production site for US giant Boeing. Those flights — which will be flown with Air Canada's new A220 aircraft — are set to begin May 4.

Flights will operate five days a week and come amid Air Canada's international build-up at its Montreal.

""This new route is our sixth destination in continental France and represents further growth from our Montreal hub, where Air Canada has launched 35 new global routes since 2012,"" Rovinescu said in the statement. ""At the same time, as this route will be the only year-round service to south west France from Canada, it will strengthen Montreal's position as both a business and tourism destination while making it a premier North American Atlantic gateway, conveniently connecting customers to Air Canada's extensive North American network.""

British Airways has begun commercial services with their brand new Airbus A350-1000 aircraft. The inaugural flight took off on Monday from London Heathrow Airport bound for Madrid. The aircraft will initially operate twice a day on the Heathrow to Madrid route for crew training and familiarization. The airplane, registered as G-XWBA, will be joined by a second A350 next month.

British Airways plans to add the aircraft to existing routes initially before launching new routes with the versatile aircraft. Starting September 2, the aircraft will be put on the Heathrow to Dubai route, and from October 1 the Heathrow to Toronto route.

Additionally, the aircraft will be added to the Tel Aviv and Bangalore routes towards the end of 2019 and beginning of 2020. The airline has an initial order with Airbus for a total of 18 Airbus A350-1000 aircraft.

The airline plans to use the aircraft to help replace the aging fleet of Boeing 747-400s. The new A350 will have nearly the same capacity as BA’s Boeing 747s, however, the aircraft burns about half as less fuel per hour as the jet its replacing.

The A350 will have a three cabin layout with 331 seats, including a brand new business class cabin. British Airways will be introducing the new business class across its fleet over the next four years.

British Airways has become the third commercial operator of the Airbus A350-1000, behind fellow oneworld carriers Cathay Pacific and Qatar Airways. The airline currently has around 30 flight crew members trained on the aircraft, with most coming from the Airbus A320 pool of pilots.

The new aircraft will help the airline reduce costs and expense as it prepares for the uncertainty of the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union.

British Airways’ brand new Airbus A350 has flown its inaugural commercial flight, ferrying passengers from London to Madrid on a jet that promises to cut emissions while offering the most comfortable cabin in the airline’s fleet.

The aircraft, which is the first to feature BA’s new business class “Club Suite” offering a flat bed and sliding privacy door, will be flown from Heathrow to the Spanish capital over the course of the next month to allow crews to familiarise themselves with the plane before it is rolled out on longer routes, starting with Dubai and Toronto in the autumn.

Passengers expecting a Boeing 777 built at the end of the last century were instead treated to the flag carrier’s newest arrival at the west London hub on Monday – day one of scheduled services. The first clue for travellers that the jet they were about to board was fresh off the Airbus production line were the A350’s gracefully blended wingtips that curve up to the sky, otherwise known as “sharklets”.

Inside, the differences are even more apparent. BA’s A350-1000 (the largest variant in the A350 family) offers passengers in even the cheapest seats a more comfortable ride, with higher air pressure and humidity and lower noise levels. Its cabin altitude of 6,000ft is 2,000ft lower than a B777 – and Airbus says its newest jet pumps 20 per cent more fresh air into the cabin than its nearest Boeing rival, the 787 Dreamliner.

But it is the passengers willing to pay top whack for business class seats that will really feel the benefit of the upgraded cabin. The radical redesign of the Club Suite has introduced flat bed seats in a 1-2-1 configuration, which means that every traveller has direct access to an aisle without having to climb over their neighbour. Each seat comes with its own sliding door, creating a personal cabin, along with an 18-inch high-definition screen for the inflight entertainment and generous storage.

The new Club Suite on the A350 ( British Airways )

Even in economy, BA promises that its A350 passengers can enjoy much larger entertainment screens, USB charging points and a more ergonomic seat.

Speaking at the launch event at Heathrow, BA’s chief executive, Alex Cruz, said he hoped the new plane and suite would help propel the company up the Skytrax World Airline Award list (it fell from number one in 2006 to 31st place in 2018, but climbed to 19 this year).

The A350 is one of the most fuel-efficient aircrafts operating in the world today, with around 25 per cent less CO2 emissions per seat compared with previous generation aircrafts such as the Boeing 767.

Recommended British Airways receives first Airbus A350

BA has bought 18 of the jets, which will carry 331 passengers at a maximum speed of 682mph and a range of 16,100km (8,700 miles). Singapore Airlines uses an ultra-long-range version of the smaller A350-900 to link the island city-state with New York – the world’s longest non-stop commercial flight.

Tel Aviv and Bangalore will be the next two destinations for the BA A350 later this year. Cruz said it was too early to say whether the jets would be used to open up new routes not currently served by the airline.

What it was like to fly on BA’s new A350

It’s hard not to be impressed with the experience onboard BA’s new A350. This was my first flight in a business class seat, and it didn’t disappoint. The first thing you notice is how bright the cabin is, and how thoughtful the design details are for each seat. The neat reading light incorporated into the side of the seat, the soft-close storage compartments and the touchscreen panel that allows you to recline all the way to horizontal.

It is the quietest of quiet cabins – I barely noticed the engines powering up on take-off – and the food, part of a new menu, was genuinely delicious.

The inflight entertainment was also a joy to use on a large screen. At 6ft 2in, I could stretch out on the flat bed and could imagine comfortably getting some sleep on a long-haul flight – though I was too busy trying out the features of the new plane to snooze. The sliding door has to be kept open for take-off and landing but on a longer overnight flight the additional privacy of a door would be welcome.

The result is a seat that feels both intimate and incredibly comfortable. I disembarked in Madrid feeling noticeably less travel-weary and only wished the flight had been longer.

Of course, the majority of people won’t choose to fly business, and BA is promising an improved offering to passengers in all classes, including in economy where the seat-back entertainment has benefited from an upgrade."
