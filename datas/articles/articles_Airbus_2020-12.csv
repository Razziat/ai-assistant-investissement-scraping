Airbus W-IFE represents natural evolution of airframer strategy - Runway Girl Network,"Thu, 10 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMjAvMTIvYWlyYnVzLXctaWZlLXByb2dyYW0tcmVwcmVzZW50cy1uYXR1cmFsLWV2b2x1dGlvbi1vZi1haXJmcmFtZXItc3RyYXRlZ3kv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has long offered an inflight connectivity backbone on board its aircraft, enabling approved aero ISPs to interface with the architecture to support their airline customers’ various onboard Internet and connected in-seat IFE needs. Pioneered by Airbus and Kid-Systeme in 2007, ALNA – or Airline Network Architecture – was the first inflight connectivity hardware and software system available as linefit on all Airbus aircraft.

Now Airbus is inviting a cadre of new wireless partners to interface with its ALNA architecture to offer streaming entertainment solutions to airlines, initially for Airbus A320 and A330 family aircraft.

Under the airframer’s optional new Open Software Platform (OSP) program, Airbus provides the embedded servers, routers, Wi-Fi access points and operating software for the W-IFE solution. Airlines then have the flexibility to choose from a growing portfolio of partners who provide the software and content (including ‘airline native’ apps) to load onto the Airbus platform for their passengers.

From an airline point of view, it’s essentially about ticking a box for linefit hardware delivery and then contracting with one of the approved vendors to develop the wireless inflight services the airline wants, with the flexibility of changing software partners if they so choose at a future point.

“It’s an absolute masterstroke for Airbus,” says David Brown, business development director at Bluebox Aviation Systems, which is one of four wireless IFE providers initially selected to participate in OSP, and the first out of the gate to deliver its software and content to a customer as part of the program. Wetlease charter specialist Titan Airways has taken delivery of its first Airbus A321LR with Airbus OSP and Bluebox software.

For Airbus customers like Titan, OSP obviates the need to retrofit wireless IFE hardware to aircraft post-delivery. It “gets rid of the whole retrofit thing: you’ve got the benefits of a linefit hardware kit that comes with the aircraft, delivered. They’ve selected a small number of vendors [from which] the airline can choose which vendor they want to actually provide the software for the IFE and other services,” notes Brown. However, airlines can choose to retrofit the package to older aircraft as well, ensuring consistency across their fleet.

Inflight Dublin, Collins Aerospace and Display Interactive have subscribed to OSP in addition to Bluebox, says Airbus, “with more to come”.

The airframer has long been eyeing a more flexible approach. Back in 2015, Airbus told Runway Girl Network that it was looking to offer the option for airlines to simply take the onboard wireless part of its ALNA system for content streaming.

“Flexibility for our customer is key,” Airbus now tells RGN via spokesperson Martin Fendt. “The market of wireless IFE is very dynamic. For the airline this flexibility is provided by de-coupling the choice of wireless IFE partner from the underlying platform (hardware and operating software) that is provided by Airbus as the aircraft OEM. The OSP platform makes wireless IFE services offers much more comparable.”

Battery and aircraft-powered portable W-IFE units have grown in popularity in recent years, with airlines adopting solutions from AirFi, Bluebox, Lufthansa Systems and others. Carried on board by catering or crew and placed in overhead bins or galleys, the boxes have provided a relatively quick and easy way to bring streaming content to passenger devices. But an integrated solution, whereby airlines can simply tick a box and order W-IFE as part of their aircraft – whilst using their preferred OSP-approved software and content partner – has its charms.

Airlines can customize their own onboard passenger experience “without any hardware or certification impact”, notes Airbus, adding that this is an important benefit to simplify the process, especially as aircraft transition from one operator or aircraft lessor to another. “Another benefit of Airbus’ integrated solution is that the W-IFE hardware does not encroach into the passengers’ overhead bins or other personal space.”

From the Bluebox perspective, OSP means that it can continue to sell its hardware-included systems for the retrofit market while providing software for the linefit-installed Airbus hardware.

Given that Bluebox is the first wireless IFE provider to unveil a customer for the OSP backbone, it has set up a dedicated Airbus lab at its headquarters in Dunfermline, north of Edinburgh. The lab contains the media server that hosts the Airbus ALNA-OSP platform, a 4G cellular link for on-ground data transfer, a wireless access point, and a test rig to simulate the interface between the platform and aircraft systems like the public address function, including the IFE pause modes.

ALNA is the hardware & software system that provides the environment for the optional OSP to run. “So, you can have ALNA without OSP, but you can’t have OSP without ALNA,” explains Bluebox head of marketing Catherine Brown.

The first Titan A321LR — which, RGN notes, appears to be using the two overwing exit and deactivated after-wing door Airbus Cabin-Flex layout — carried out its final system testing on a two-hour flight shortly after delivery from Airbus’ factory, during the UK’s COVID-19 lockdown, an impressive feat in itself.

The airline set up 150 iPads on the aircraft in order to confirm the performance of the system, including inflight connectivity, wireless content streaming, the moving map and the integration of third party apps into the Bluebox front-end hardware and Airbus back-end network.

Notably, the portal for Titan’s landing pages direct passengers to IFE and connectivity, and Bluebox is handling the portal, not the connectivity provider. RGN is given to understand that the connection is powered by Inmarsat Global Xpress Ka-band.

“In this case, it’s actually a highly complex and unusual operational environment due to the requirement for flexibility to cope with the different models Titan need for their different customers. And aside from the connectivity model, there were also several additional custom enhancements we developed for the TCS portal which demonstrate our ability to integrate much more than what is generally considered IFE,” explains Catherine Brown.

Indeed, the Titan install is a particularly illustrative example of the benefits of the OSP platform: the aircraft will initially fly for luxury tour operator TCS World Travel, for which Bluebox has added a substantial amount of front-end branding, destination content together with a content management system, plus realtime flight information. But the aircraft could be deployed elsewhere in the future.

After the TCS contract, Bluebox’s David Brown explains, “Titan are going to be using this aircraft for other customers. So we also have a Titan graphic user interface that can be used when they’re chartering to football teams and things like that. But if they then have a charter, we can change the software completely within a day. We just turn up with our laptop and load a different software build onto the aircraft. There’s not many other systems you could do that on.”

While the Titan-Bluebox launch is the first announced installation for OSP, Bluebox tells Runway Girl Network that another A320 family aircraft has the solution installed but is currently in storage as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Bluebox also sees an opportunity to deploy on more twin-aisle aircraft as part of OSP. Airbus has made OSP available (line-fit and retrofit) on Airbus A320 and A330 family aircraft, says Catherine Brown. (The A350 is a somewhat different beast for now.)

“For an airline (e.g. low-cost long-haul) or leasing/charter company already flying or originally intending to order new twin-aisle aircraft with no IFE – OSP offers a way to introduce IFE but as an alternative to a more expensive seatback system. With the connectivity option, it’s another enticement. Add to that some in-seat power, app-free delivery, everything that W-IFE supports – such as on-board retail to passenger devices – and evolving passenger behaviour/demands for using their devices on board, and the business case merits for W-IFE on twin-aisle aircraft add up,” she says.

Airbus has secured five launch customers for OSP; they include lessors and airlines; linefit and retrofit; and single-aisle and twin-aisle aircraft. Its early success is not surprising. Aviation is changing amid the COVID-19 crisis with a renewed focus on monetization. The Titan install is a good example of what Bluebox means when it says it offers more than IFE “where ‘E’ was once Entertainment, and now is about Engagement, and about Earning”, says Catherine Brown.

“We’re already doing onboard retail – F&B, duty free, attractions, and paid access to entertainment – on Bluebox Wow [portable Wi-Fi] for a customer, so we’d certainly be able to do so on OSP-based deployments as well.”

Airbus’ announcement falls hard on the heels of Boeing’s own revelation that it is jumping into wireless IFE with a solution called Digital Direct, which will launch as a retrofit option but is under study for future linefit solutions.

This is where the magic happens

Airbus is proud to be the Innovation Partner for the American Magic team show more show less Airbus and the U.S. American Magic team are working side-by-side to capture the oldest trophy in competitive sailing and modern sports.

Since 2018, the Airbus-American Magic collaboration brings together two partners known for out-of-the-box thinking and concepts, united to win sailing’s most prestigious trophy designing a new type of ground breaking 75-foot foiling monohull, the AC75, which is capable of reaching speeds in excess of 50+ knots (approximately 100 km/h).

“Having flown many aircraft in my life, I would compare this vessel to a fighter jet,” said Jean-Brice Dumont, Executive Vice President - Engineering at Airbus. “It’s extremely powerful, and it’s a concentration of technologies that can work thanks to people's brains – not only muscles. Airbus was a natural fit for the American Magic team with the company’s direct access to state-of-the-art engineering expertise and manufacturing facilities.”

Optimising design, engineering, data capture, analysis and simulation were among the parallel priorities of the Airbus and American Magic teams. While an aircraft’s wings produce lift, and the sails on a boat generate thrust, both interact with the air in similar ways. When the American Magic boat’s hull lifts out of the water, aerodynamics become crucial to speed and stability as it “flies” across the water on foils shaped like the wings of an Airbus aircraft.

We love competition that pushes us…

Airbus’ competitive spirit

The 36th America’s Cup competition – to be held in Auckland, New Zealand – will officially kick off on 17 December with a preliminary World Series and “Christmas Cup” exhibition involving all four competing teams - 3 Challengers and the Defender. The Prada Cup, also known as the Challenger Selection Series, will begin on the 15th of January, while the America’s Cup Match presented by Prada is planned to start on 6 March.

“This is a true challenge for the team to optimise technological innovation under such tight time and resource constraints,” added Jean-Brice Dumont. “We love competition that pushes us to continuously improve, innovate, solve challenges, learn from experience and, ultimately, win. Our goal in this project was to help American Magic design the fastest flying yacht for 2021.”

American Magic’s participation in the multi-stage America’s Cup contest also is an outstanding opportunity to showcase Airbus’ pioneering spirit in an entirely new context, as well as underscore its key industrial and market presence in the U.S.

From the 17-20th of December all three challengers (American Magic, Team Ineos UK & Luna Rossa Prada Pirelli) and defender, Emirates Team New Zealand will line up on the starting line for the PRADA America’s Cup World Series and PRADA Christmas Race in Auckland, New Zealand. The America’s Cup races, the PRADA Cup and the America’s Cup Finals, will follow a month later and run from January to March 2021 in Auckland.

Airbus prepares for 'Eurodrone' contract signing in early 2021 - Defense News,"Wed, 09 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS9nbG9iYWwvZXVyb3BlLzIwMjAvMTIvMDkvYWlyYnVzLXByZXBhcmVzLWZvci1ldXJvZHJvbmUtY29udHJhY3Qtc2lnbmluZy1pbi1lYXJseS0yMDIxL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"STUTTGART, Germany — The cogs are churning for the four-nation Eurodrone unmanned aerial system program, with a development contract approved last month and formal contract signing expected early next year, an Airbus official said Dec. 9.

Speaking at the company’s annual trade media briefing, Airbus’ Unmanned Aerial Systems director Jana Rosenmann shared that the company reached an agreement Nov. 19 with the Organisation for Joint Armament Cooperation (OCCAR) to develop the next-generation medium-altitude, long-endurance drone. OCCAR is managing the Eurodrone program on behalf of the four European partners: Germany, France, Spain and Italy.

The program’s industrial team, composed of lead contractor Airbus Germany, along with Dassault Aviation and Leonardo, submitted a bid for the program in June. Since then, the companies have been involved in “very interesting and very lively discussions” with OCCAR, Rosenmann said during the briefing, which was held virtually.

“I believe that what we have now, today on the table, is a fair and reasonable offer for both sides, both for the customer, as well as for industry,” she said. While a formal contract signing is expected in nearly 2021, the industry teams will now prepare for the Eurodrone program’s ramp-up, to include filling 7,000 new technical positions around the continent.

Rosenmann also revealed that the Eurodrone’s final assembly will take place at Airbus’ hub in Manching, Germany. “We will only have a single final assembly line,” she said. “This is for efficiency purposes, and clearly also for cost reasons for our customers.”

Certain elements may be manufactured elsewhere, and then transferred to Manching for final assembly and ground testing. The delivery center will also be located in Manching, she noted. The aircraft fuselage will be fully integrated and assembled in Spain, before being transferred to Germany, Rosenmann added.

Meanwhile, questions remain on who will supply Eurodrone’s 120 total engines. “As we are in a competitive process at the moment, we’re not at liberty to reveal any further details,” Rosenmann said.

The COVID-19 pandemic caused significant disruption to industries around the world, and Airbus was not exempt, Rosenmann noted. But the UAS division began to pick up steam once again at the end of calendar year 2020, and is eager to maintain momentum on its portfolio of programs, including Eurodrone, she said.

While the company awaits the formal contract signing, Airbus anticipates Eurodrone’s first flight in 2025, and deliveries to begin in 2028, per Rosenmann. The current contract provides for 20 Eurodrone systems, each of which will include three aircraft for a total of 60 twin-engine air platforms. Currently, Germany as the program’s lead nation is on contract for seven systems, while Italy has committed to five systems. Spain and France are each targeting four Eurodrone systems.

Alaska Replaces Most of Its Airbus Fleet with the MAX – Cranky Flier - Cranky Flier,"Wed, 23 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vY3Jhbmt5ZmxpZXIuY29tLzIwMjAvMTIvMjMvYWxhc2thLXJlcGxhY2VzLW1vc3Qtb2YtaXRzLWFpcmJ1cy1mbGVldC13aXRoLXRoZS1tYXgv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"I know, I know. It’s a Wednesday, and you don’t usually get a post on Wednesday. But as I prepare my regular year-end posts, I realized that I’m running out of normal days to talk about what I want to talk about. So, here we are, because I want to talk about Alaska.

I had the chance to speak with Alaska President-and-soon-to-be-CEO Ben Minicucci about the airline’s decision to retire almost all of its Airbus aircraft and replace them with 737 MAX airplanes. It’s a good and unsurprising move for an airline that has long painted “proudly all Boeing” on the nose of its aircraft.

Original, undoctored image via Alaska Airlines

In the Virgin America merger, Alaska inherited 10 A319s and 53 A320s. It also took over an order for 10 A321neos — all of which have been delivered since 2017 — and 30 A320neos, none of which have been delivered. It was widely assumed that Alaska would retire the Airbus fleet. It wouldn’t commit to that despite all the rumors, but it had started to chip away slowly.

Two of the A320s were returned in 2019. After the pandemic began, Alaska quickly retired all 10 of the too-small A319s. It has since announced it would retire the 10 A320s that it owned, but it was going to stick with the rest of the A320s until leases expired. Then Boeing came along, and the end of the A320s at lease expiration has now been officially confirmed.

Way back in 2012, Alaska placed an order for the 737 MAX. It had a plan to bring on 20 737 MAX 8s and 17 737 MAX 9s, plus options. A couple years ago, that was modified and the order became just 32 737 MAX 9s plus options for 37 more. After the pandemic began, Alaska started doing some bargain hunting. It picked up 13 more 737 MAX 9s on lease, and now it has gone back to Boeing to pick up 23 more plus 15 options.

Alaska must have pulled off one heck of a deal here. It did say that nine of the aircraft are so-called “white tails.” Those are airplanes that were built for a customer that never took delivery. Though I don’t know who these aircraft were built for, it’s safe to assume that at least some of them were part of the Primera order since Primera is now gone and the lessor probably doesn’t have a use for them. Either way, Ben told me that they would be fully outfitted in Alaska’s standard configuration before being delivered. Boeing, meanwhile, will be happy to get those airplanes sold off. I’m sure they made Alaska an offer they couldn’t refuse.

These 68 firm aircraft will replace the 61-strong Virgin America A319/A320 fleet entirely, and then some. Sure it’s a few more airplanes, but it’s also a lot more capacity. The A320s had 150 seats while the 737 MAX 9s will have 174. Of course, it’ll be a lot cheaper to operate the MAX than the A320s, so those are basically free seats that Alaska can fill with low fares and be happy about it.

MAX airplanes will start coming in 2021 and this will happen quickly. It was going to operate 41 A320s in 2021, but that is now down to 30. Meanwhile, 13 MAXs will show up in 2021. The Airbus fleet will stay at 30 through 2022 with 30 MAXs getting delivered. In 2023 there will be only 10 A320s with 13 MAXs coming into the fleet. Then the Airbuses will be gone and in 2024, another 12 MAXs arrive. Options would start being delivered after that, if exercised. In the meantime, you can expect to see A320s parked regularly, getting ready to go back to their owners.

This gradual shift will allow Alaska to, as Ben explained, “put in place a deliberate, thoughtful training plan to convert pilots” to the MAX. Alaska has 830 Airbus pilots on staff.

Once this is all complete, Alaska will… still be operating Airbuses. Ben confirmed that the 30 A320neos will not be delivered, but the 10 A321neos in the fleet today aren’t going anywhere, at least not before the leases expire in 2029. Ben says those are largely going to operate from Los Angeles and San Francisco, but there will be some presence in the Pacific Northwest. Still, why not just retire them?

First, it would be way too expensive to retire those airplanes and not fly them, but Ben did say that if there was an opportunity to get out of the A321s, that would be considered. Still, it’s not just a money problem. Those airplanes are better than anything Boeing can offer.

Ben mentioned two destinations in particular as being ideal for the A321s. Kahului, Maui has a pretty short runway, and the A321s give the airline a big bump in capacity that can easily make it to the West Coast. On the other end of the country, there’s Washington’s National Airport. National has a short runway and it’s slot restricted. That means Alaska wants bigger airplanes to maximize the use of the precious slots it has. The A321neo fits the bill in both cases. Boeing does not have an airplane that can do what Alaska needs to be done from those airports.

I asked Ben if Alaska might consider doing something different with those 10 airplanes. It’s a small fleet, so it could possibly afford to experiment. Could it put flat beds on? Might it create a more premium offering? Nope. Ben shot that down pretty quickly. These A321s will fly as they are.

So, Alaska now has its future fleet plan with only the A321neo sticking out like a sore thumb. If only Boeing could build an airplane as good as the neo, Alaska would have an easier time with its long term plans. But with the neos sticking around at least until 2029, it has plenty of time to wait for Boeing to come up with something better."
Airbus proposes detachable hydrogen propulsion pods for aircraft - New Atlas,"Mon, 21 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3YXRsYXMuY29tL2FpcmNyYWZ0L2FpcmJ1cy1kZXRhY2hhYmxlLWh5ZHJvZ2VuLXByb3B1bHNpb24tcG9kcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"With the move towards electric aviation comes new opportunities to explore what a powertrain looks like, and Airbus is experimenting with a new design that builds entire hydrogen propulsion units, tanks and all, into detachable pods along the wings.

Each of the six pods along the wings of the ZEROe concept includes a liquid hydrogen tank, a cooling system, a fuel cell, power electronics, electric motors, an eight-bladed lightweight composite propeller and all the necessary auxilliary equipment to run it as a standalone propulsion unit. Interestingly, there's no mention of a buffer battery, but then conventional aircraft like this use power in a constant and predictable fashion, so a little lag between throttle and props as the fuel cell catches up might not be an issue.

Not only can these pods detach easily from the wings (not too easily, hopefully), but the ZEROe team wants to make them highly modular, so they can be pulled apart quickly for maintenance, testing and simple component swap-outs.

Why hydrogen? Well, we can see a few advantages. With liquid hydrogen comes an energy density that rivals, or even exceeds jet fuel for long-range flights, but with zero local emissions and the potential to fill up on carbon-neutral renewable energy. It's a no-brainer for manufacturers to be looking ahead at hydrogen for clean aviation.

Each pod has its own complete powertrain, commanded electronically from a flight controller Airbus

Why removable pods? Well, moving to an electric system gives you the opportunity to separate out the propulsion systems into independent units, offering excellent redundancy. If something goes wrong with one propulsion pod, you can shut it down completely or even jettison it over water, letting the flight controller re-balance thrust across the remaining pods.

It also frees up considerable space in the cabin; airline companies love to fill hollow tubes with as many people as possible, and moving the fuel tanks and the entire powertrain outside that hollow tube means extra seats and extra cargo capacity.

And of course, making each one a complete powertrain makes them ultra-swappable, so any issues can be handled at the operator's leisure without having to pull the plane out of service. Just stick a spare one on while the other one's in the workshop.

While Airbus has already taken out patents on this design, it's just one of many concepts the company is evaluating for the ZEROe program.

""This ‘pod’ configuration is a great starting point to nurture further inquiry into how we can scale up hydrogen technology to commercial aircraft,"" says Glenn Llewellyn, Airbus VP of Zero-Emission Aircraft. “This is one option, but many more will be conceptualized before we make a final selection, a decision that is expected by 2025.""

Airbus and Boeing Report November 2020 Commercial Aircraft Orders and Deliveries - Defense & Security Monitor,"Mon, 14 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL2RzbS5mb3JlY2FzdGludGVybmF0aW9uYWwuY29tLzIwMjAvMTIvMTQvYWlyYnVzLWFuZC1ib2VpbmctcmVwb3J0LW5vdmVtYmVyLTIwMjAtY29tbWVyY2lhbC1haXJjcmFmdC1vcmRlcnMtYW5kLWRlbGl2ZXJpZXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"737 MAX Ungrounded and Back in the Air as Boeing Delivers First Jet in Nearly Two Years to United Airlines

by J. Kasper Oestergaard, European Correspondent, Forecast International.

Boeing and Airbus delivered seven and 64 commercial jets in November 2020, compared to 24 and 78 deliveries, respectively, in the same month last year. With just 118 deliveries this year to date, Boeing is 227 shipments behind last year’s total for the first 11 months of the year. Airbus delivered a total of 477 jets from January to November, compared to 725 during the same period last year. Boeing’s deliveries have suffered for many months in the aftermath of two 737 MAX crashes and the subsequent suspension of deliveries and grounding of the fleet in March 2019. For the full year 2019, Boeing delivered 380 aircraft, while Airbus set a new all-time annual record, handing over 863 jets. Prior to this, Boeing had retained a deliveries lead over Airbus since 2012.

On November 18, following a comprehensive and methodical safety review process that took 20 months to complete, the FAA ungrounded the 737 MAX. An Airworthiness Directive spells out the requirements that must be met before U.S. carriers can resume service, including the installation of software enhancements, completing wire separation modifications, conducting pilot training, and accomplishing thorough de-preservation activities that will ensure that previously grounded jets are ready for service. On December 9, Boeing delivered the first 737 MAX in almost two years, to United Airlines. On the same day, Brazilian airline GOL performed the first scheduled 737 MAX passenger flight since March 2019. However, the 737 MAX remains grounded in Europe and China. The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) expects to lift its grounding in January, whereas the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) has not yet set a timetable for the aircraft’s return to service.

In November, Boeing’s seven aircraft shipments included two 737NGs, one 747-8, one 767, and three 777s. Production of the 737 MAX was suspended from January this year until the end of May, when Boeing announced it had commenced low-rate production of the aircraft. Boeing expects the 737 MAX production rate to gradually increase to 31 per month by early 2022, with further increases as market demand allows. Prior to the 737 MAX production suspension, Boeing was manufacturing the jet at a reduced rate of 42 per month and had produced and shipped 387 jets. Boeing has announced that the 787 production rate is being reduced from 14 per month (rate at the start of 2020) to just six per month during 2021. On October 1, Boeing announced it will be moving all 787 production to South Carolina by mid-2021. The combined 777/777X production rate will be reduced to two per month in 2021. Production rate assumptions have not changed for the 747 and 767 programs.

In November, Airbus delivered 64 jets, including two A220s, 54 A320s (2 CEO / 52 NEO), one A330, and seven A350s. For the full year 2019, Airbus handed over 642 A320 family aircraft, of which 551 were NEOs, while also delivering a record 112 A350s. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, Airbus was targeting a 5 percent A320 rate increase to 63 jets per month from 2021 and was also discussing a further ramp-up with its supply chain that could have brought the production rate up to as high as 67 aircraft per month, or 804 per year, by 2023. This would have put the company within reach of a total of 1,000 jets deliveries per year. These plans have now been shelved. Due to COVID-19, Airbus has cut production on several programs and is looking to hold underlying jet output at 40 percent below pre-pandemic plans for two years. The A320 production rate has been reduced to 40 aircraft per month, down from an average of over 53 aircraft per month in 2019. Recently, however, Airbus confirmed that the company is considering an increase in production to 47 A320neo jets per month in the second half of 2021. The A330 and A350 programs have been reduced to a rate of two and six aircraft per month, respectively. No rate cut has been announced for the A220 or A380.

Turning to the orders race, in November, Boeing booked two orders for a total of 27 jets but also reported 88 737 MAX cancellations. Orders in November included a new order for 25 737 MAX 10s from Virgin Australia; however, the airline at the same time canceled an existing order for 48 737 MAX jets in a move to push back deliveries. Also, Boeing Defense, Space & Security (BDS) ordered two 767-2Cs for the Japan KC-46 tanker program. Year-to-date, Boeing has accumulated 94 gross orders (548 cancellations => -454 net new orders). For the full year 2019, Boeing booked 243 gross orders (330 cancellations => -87 net new orders).

In November, Airbus booked no new orders and reported 11 A220 cancellations. For 2020 to date, Airbus has accumulated 381 gross orders (84 cancellations => net of 297). For the full year 2019, Airbus landed 1,131 gross orders (363 cancellations => net of 768), thereby retaking the orders crown from Boeing. In 2018, Airbus booked a total of 747 net new orders and 831 gross orders, thereby losing the 2018 orders race. Prior to this, Airbus had retained an orders lead over its rival every year since 2012.

At the end of November, Airbus reported a backlog of 7,302 jets, of which 6,564, or 88 percent, were A220 and A320ceo/neo family narrowbodies. This is 423 aircraft below the company’s all-time backlog record of 7,725 aircraft set in January 2020. By the end of November 2020, Boeing’s backlog (total unfilled orders before ASC 606 adjustment) was 5,053 aircraft, of which 4,082, or 81 percent, were 737 NG/MAX narrowbody jets. Boeing’s all-time backlog high of 5,964 aircraft was set in August 2018. The number of Airbus aircraft to be built and delivered represents 8.5 years of shipments at the 2019 production level. In comparison, Boeing’s backlog would “only” last 6.3 years at the 2018 level, which we use as a proxy for 2019 due to the severe drop in 737 MAX deliveries. This year to date, Boeing’s book-to-bill ratio, calculated as net new orders divided by deliveries, is negative due to cancellations exceeding gross orders. Airbus’ book-to-bill ratio is 0.62. In 2019, Boeing’s book-to-bill ratio was negative, while Airbus reported a book-to-bill ratio of 0.89.

These pods could provide a blueprint for future hydrogen aircraft - Airbus,"Tue, 15 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIwLTEyLXRoZXNlLXBvZHMtY291bGQtcHJvdmlkZS1hLWJsdWVwcmludC1mb3ItZnV0dXJlLWh5ZHJvZ2VuLWFpcmNyYWZ00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It is unlike anything seen on today’s runways: the “pod” configuration—one of several being conceptualised as part of ongoing R&D on the ZEROe concept aircraft—features a series of stand-alone propulsion systems based on hydrogen fuel cell technology. Today, Airbus is conducting studies to determine how scalable the “pod” configuration, among others, could be to large commercial aircraft.

Twinjet, s-duct, winglets, contra-rotating propellers: the aviation industry has developed numerous configurations over the last five decades that have enabled aircraft to fly higher, faster and longer. Now, Airbus engineers are unveiling a new configuration as part of the ZEROe programme that could enable a passenger aircraft to fly farther than ever without emissions.

The innovative approach consists of six, eight-bladed “pods” mounted beneath the aircraft wing. While the “podded” engine is not a new concept in aviation, these “pods” are not designed to be driven by any ordinary propulsion system: hydrogen fuel cells are among the key components.

“The ‘pod’ configuration is essentially a distributed fuel cell propulsion system that delivers thrust to the aircraft via six propulsors arranged along the wing,” explains Matthieu Thomas, ZEROe Aircraft Lead Architect. “Hydrogen fuel cells have very different design considerations, so we knew we had to come up with a unique approach.”

Indeed, hydrogen fuel cell technology has yet to be scaled up to a passenger-size large commercial aircraft. Smaller experimental hydrogen aircraft, comprising up to 20 seats, can rely on a traditional fixed-wing configuration with two propellers. But more passenger capacity and longer range require another solution. This is why Airbus is studying a variety of configurations, including “pods,” to determine which option has the potential to scale up to larger aircraft.

This ‘pod’ configuration is a great starting point to nurture further inquiry into how we can scale up hydrogen technology to commercial aircraft. This is one option, but many more will be conceptualised before we make a final selection, a decision that is expected by 2025.

- Glenn Llewellyn, VP of Zero-Emission Aircraft

A pod configuration for propeller propulsion

Each “pod” is essentially a stand-alone propeller propulsion system powered by hydrogen fuel cells. It consists of the following elements:

A propeller

Electric motors

Fuel cells

Power electronics

LH2 tank

A cooling system

A set of auxiliary equipment

Hydrogen and air are supplied to the fuel cells to generate electric current. Power electronics convert the current to power the electric motors. Thanks to this energy, the motor shaft rotates, thereby turning the propeller.

Another striking feature of the “pod” configuration is its removable fixtures. This means each “pod” can be disassembled and reassembled in record time. This approach could provide a practical and rapid solution for maintenance and potentially hydrogen refuelling at airports.

The pod’s eight-bladed propellers, made of composite materials, are shaped to provide added thrust during the takeoff and climb-out phases of flight. The advanced airfoil design is expected to lead to improved efficiency and performance.

The ""pod"" configuration is a distributed fuel-cell propulsion system that delivers thrust to the aircraft via six propulsors arranged along the wing.

An exciting starting point for designing ZEROe

Although advanced in its design, the “pod” configuration still requires a lot of work to determine whether it could be a suitable solution. To date, it remains one of many exciting technology options that Airbus engineers are considering as they work towards launching the ZEROe programme.

“This ‘pod’ configuration is a great starting point to nurture further inquiry into how we can scale up hydrogen technology to commercial aircraft,” Glenn Llewellyn, VP of Zero-Emission Aircraft, explains. “This is one option, but many more will be conceptualised before we make a final selection, a decision that is expected by 2025.”

A patent application for the “pod” configuration will be published in December 2020, 18 months after its initial submission. This highlights that Airbus has been working on ZEROe since at least 2018. Several more patent applications are expected to be submitted over the coming months and years as R&D continues on the ZEROe programme."
Airbus quantum computing challenge helps advance sustainable flight - Airbus,"Thu, 10 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMC0xMi1haXJidXMtcXVhbnR1bS1jb21wdXRpbmctY2hhbGxlbmdlLWhlbHBzLWFkdmFuY2Utc3VzdGFpbmFibGUtZmxpZ2h00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Toulouse, 10 December 2020 – Airbus has concluded its global Quantum Computing Challenge (AQCC) announcing the winning team of the competition. The Italian team at Machine Learning Reply - a leading systems integration and digital services company part of Reply Group - won the challenge with their solution to optimise aircraft loading.

Airlines try to make the best use of an aircraft’s payload capability to maximise revenue, optimise fuel burn and lower overall operating costs. However, their scope for optimisation can be limited by a number of operational constraints.

By creating an algorithm for optimal aircraft cargo loading configurations, taking these operational constraints -payload, centre of gravity, size and shape of the fuselage- into account, the winners of the competition proved that optimisation problems can be mathematically modelled and solved through quantum computing.

“The Quantum Computing Challenge is testament to Airbus' belief in the power of the collective, to fully harness and apply quantum computing technology to solve complex optimization challenges facing our industry today,"" said Grazia Vittadini, Chief Technology Officer, Airbus. ""By looking at how emerging technologies can be used to improve aircraft performance and boost innovation, we are addressing the advanced flight physics problems that will redefine how the aircraft of tomorrow are built and flown, and ultimately shape industry, markets and customer experiences for the better.""

The winners are set to start working with Airbus experts, as early as January 2021, to test and benchmark their solution in order to assess how the mastering of complex calculations can tangibly impact airlines, enabling them, as predicted, to benefit from maximised loading capabilities.

With operations being made more efficient, the overall number of required transportation flights could be reduced, having a positive impact on CO2 emissions, thereby contributing to Airbus’ ambition for sustainable flight.

The AQCC was launched in January 2019, to drive innovation across the full aircraft life-cycle. By developing strong partnerships with the global quantum community, Airbus is taking science out of the lab and into industry, by applying newly-available computing capabilities to real-life industrial cases.

“Innovations for FCAS”: Airbus concludes cooperative pilot phase with startup companies in Germany - Airbus,"Wed, 09 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMC0xMi1pbm5vdmF0aW9ucy1mb3ItZmNhcy1haXJidXMtY29uY2x1ZGVzLWNvb3BlcmF0aXZlLXBpbG90LXBoYXNlLXdpdGjSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Munich, 09 December 2020 – Airbus has concluded a pilot phase of the “Innovations for FCAS” (I4 FCAS) initiative which aims at involving German non-traditional defence players -covering startups, small to medium enterprises (SMEs) and research institutes- in the development of Future Combat Air System (FCAS). This initiative which was launched in April 2020 was funded by the German Ministry of Defence.

“The initiative shows that FCAS does not compare with previous larger defence projects. By implementing young and innovative players, some of whom have never been in touch with the defence sector, we ensure to leverage all competencies available for a game-changing high-tech programme such as FCAS”, said Dirk Hoke, Chief Executive Officer of Airbus Defence and Space. “It will also foster technological spill-overs between the military and civil worlds. It is our ambition to continue the initiative in 2021 and beyond, and make it a cornerstone of our FCAS innovation strategy.”

During the pilot phase, 18 innovative players worked on 14 projects in different areas, covering the whole range of FCAS elements: combat cloud, connectivity, new generation fighter, remote carriers, system of systems, sensors. Among these 14 projects, Airbus engineers have worked closely with SMEs and startups to achieve concrete results such as:

· A first flight-test approved launcher of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) from of a transport aircraft. This project is the result of a cooperation between Airbus as A400M integrator, Geradts GmbH for the launcher and SFL GmbH from Stuttgart for UAV integration and supported by DLR simulations. An agile design and development approach allowed for rapid prototyping and flight readiness in only 6 months.

· A secure combat cloud demonstrator: a first time transfer of secured operating systems into a cloud environment. Kernkonzept GmbH from Dresden together with Airbus CyberSecurity have shown how IT security can be used for highest security requirements on a governmental cloud system.

· A demonstrator of applied artificial intelligence on radio frequency analysis. Hellsicht GmbH from Munich trained their algorithms on Airbus-provided datasets, allowing for a unique capability of real time fingerprinting of certain emitters, such as radars.

As Europe's largest defence programme in the coming decades, FCAS aims at pushing the innovation and technological boundaries. Its development will bring disruptive technologies such as artificial intelligence, manned-unmanned teaming, combat cloud or cybersecurity to the forefront.

4D-TBO: a new approach to aircraft trajectory prediction - Airbus,"Thu, 17 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIwLTEyLTRkLXRiby1hLW5ldy1hcHByb2FjaC10by1haXJjcmFmdC10cmFqZWN0b3J5LXByZWRpY3Rpb27SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The real-time transmission of four-dimensional trajectory data has the incredible potential to greatly improve an aircraft’s trajectory prediction. By reducing the inaccuracy of current air traffic management (ATM) prediction models by approximately 30-40%, the Trajectory Based Operations in 4 Dimensions (4D-TBO) project is helping to pave the way to a more sustainable management of tomorrow’s air traffic.

Although some uncertainty exists about the exact timeline for air traffic recovery in the short term, global forecasts are clear: tomorrow’s air traffic will be increasingly dense. In fact, this outlook raises vital questions about the aviation industry’s future environmental footprint. As a result, air traffic management (ATM) is becoming an increasingly important—and complex—focus area.

But a small revolution in ATM has just taken place: after two years of experimental entry-into-service programmes and more than 20,000 flights carried out by about 90 A320 aircraft from six airlines (Air France, British Airways, EasyJet, Iberia, Novair and Wizzair), the 4D-TBO* project led by Airbus alongside more than 15 partners in the frame of the Single European Sky Air Traffic Management Research (SESAR) programme is coming to an end. The project focused on analysing the real-time transmission of four-dimensional trajectory data (Latitude, Longitude, Altitude, Time) as a solution to better inform ATM operations. And initial findings are very encouraging.

“High stakes are behind this project,” explains Jean-Brice Dumont, Airbus Executive Vice-President, Engineering. “Thanks to the transmission of four-dimensional trajectory data, ATM will be able to improve, optimise and better predict an aircraft’s trajectory, thereby enabling us to immediately and concretely reduce our environmental footprint. It will also help us design the ATM system of the future, an endeavour that Airbus has undertaken alongside our other stakeholders in the SESAR programme.”

Airbus ATM AD Function show more show less For several years, Airbus has been participating as an active member of the Single European Sky ATM Research - SESAR Joint Undertaking to develop collective solutions for the modernisation of Air Traffic Management in Europe

Trajectory prediction for improved ATM operations

Two modern-day air traffic control scenarios illustrate how improved trajectory prediction could make a positive impact on an aircraft’s environmental footprint. For example, during periods of heavy airport traffic, such as summer holidays, air traffic controllers often divert some aircraft to holding patterns (i.e. an oval course flown by aircraft awaiting further landing clearance) to better organise arrivals queuing in the terminal area. In another example, ground control often requests an aircraft begin its descent before its optimum Top of Descent (TOD)—or the point at which the planned descent to approach is initiated—due to a lack of accurate visibility of an aircraft’s optimum trajectory.

Thanks to the transmission of four-dimensional trajectory data, ATM will be able to improve, optimise and better predict an aircraft’s trajectory, thereby enabling us to immediately and concretely reduce our environmental footprint.

- Jean-Brice Dumont, Airbus Executive Vice-President, Engineering

In these scenarios, the aircraft must either fly additional time or must withdraw from its optimal trajectory, which requires more fuel consumption and consequently, increases CO2 emissions. In fact, if flying in a holding pattern at 10,000 feet and at 220 knots, an A320 Neo consumes 25 kg of fuel per minute, or 100 kg for a four-minute holding. In addition, these scenarios could result in delayed arrivals, disrupt the departure flow, and increase workload for both controllers and pilots.

However, by transmitting complete, up-to-date information about its trajectory, an aircraft can send air traffic control invaluable data that is essential for better decision-making. The result is more efficient and better coordinated management of optimised aircraft trajectories, which will lead to increased safety of air traffic operations in general.

Assisted by a system fed with this knowledge, the controller in the previous two scenarios will thus be able to request a precise adjustment in the aircraft’s cruise speed to avoid diversion to a holding pattern in the airport terminal area and to enable optimum TOD—an action that will lead to reduced CO2 emissions. Specifically, fuel savings could be up to 10 kg, or the equivalent of approximately 32 kg of CO2, if an aircraft descends from its optimum TOD. When calculated over an entire year for a European jet fleet of about 5,500 aircraft, the savings could be as high as 65,000 tons of fuel.

A phased 4D-TBO entry-into-service during the 2020s

According to Jean-Brice, the main advantage of the 4D-TBO solution is its potential to drastically reduce the inaccuracy of the trajectory prediction models available in control centres until now. But thanks to improved calibration using accurate aircraft data, these new algorithms have proven their ability to reduce the inaccuracy of airspace prediction models by approximately 30-40%.

“Bottom line: improved accuracy of four-dimensional trajectory predictions reduces margins when detecting conflicting trajectories and results in fewer alerts to controllers,” he explains. “This reduces the need for controller intervention and means we can fly as close as possible to the initially identified optimum flight trajectory. As a result, we can reap all the rewards of improved aircraft performance in relation to environment, safety and capacity.”

In 2021, the 4D-TBO function is expected to be gradually entered into service across several European countries (i.e. France, Switzerland, Hungary, Bulgaria, Poland, Spain) as part of the future SESAR PJ38 ADSCENSIO* project. This will involve the development of a centralised shared trajectory data platform.

ATM is a constituent part of the Airbus “Decarbonisation” programme, designed, in particular, to reduce CO2 emissions by 50% from now to 2050 and to develop the first zero-emission commercial aircraft by 2035.

*These projects have received funding from the SESAR Joint Undertaking under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreements No 731818 (DIGITS) and No 101017626 (ADSCENSIO)."

Paris – Airbus Defence and Space expected to sign a contract for a medium-altitude, long-endurance unmanned aerial vehicle in the first quarter of 2021, a deal the company saw as critical for European arms companies, chief executive Dirk Hoke said Dec. 9.

“Here, we are very confident because last week we got the confirmation from OCCAR (Organisation Conjointe de Coopération en matière d’Armement) that the nations approved to go towards a contract for early next year,” he told journalists on a virtual link to the Manching office, southern Germany.

“So we will be finalizing last steps, securing the budgets and if everything goes right, we expect a contract signature around the first quarter next year,” he said.

Hoke declined to disclose the budget, saying the amount was in line with the French request.

The French armed forces minister, Florence Parly, put public pressure on Airbus DS to meet a budget capped at €7.1 billion ($8.6 billion) after submitting an initial offer worth almost €10 billion, business magazine Challenges reported. That budget will include development.

Challenges contested the government’s financial case, with officials giving figures which sought to make the European drone cost less than the U.S. Reaper or SkyGuardian.

The revised offer was worth €7 billion or a little under, a source close to the deal said. The final agreement could be signed in January or February.

“Our ambition is clearly to remain at the forefront of unmanned flight in Europe,” Jana Rosenmann, head of Airbus DS unmanned aerial systems, said.

Airbus DS submitted its offer in June, prompting “interesting and lively negotiations with OCCAR,” she said.

There were “very respectful discussions. What we have now on the table is a very fair and reasonable offer for both sides,” she said.

The OCCAR program board and the four partners – France, Germany, Italy and Spain – approved Nov. 19 the offer and there was Dec. 2 a formal “go-ahead,” which allowed the nations to start their approval process, she said.

Each nation has its procedure, with the Bundestag parliament for Germany and the Direction Générale de l’Armament procurement office for France working on the deal, the source said.

The industrial partners, Airbus DS, Dassault Aviation, and Leonardo will work on an integrated digital platform in Manching and also on their own national digital platforms, Rosenmann said.

The UAV will be the first military development program to be worked on the basis of the Digital Design Manufacturing and Services approach, which will succeed a sequential path in the product life cycle, she said. This aimed to allow co-design and development, while considering the consequences for manufacturing and service once the aircraft was in operation.

There will be heavy use of virtual engineering and behavior simulation, to spot inconsistencies in design, seeking to avoid cost and time overruns, she said. The partners were expected to employ just over 7,000 highly skilled engineers.

The planned order was for 20 UAV systems, with three units per system, making a total fleet of 60 drones. First flight would be in 2025, with series production and delivery in 2028. The commercial wing of Airbus in Toulouse helped prepare the offer.

Significantly, there would be a single final assembly line in Germany, as opposed to the multiple final assembly line model of the Eurofighter.

Remote carrier tests

Airbus DS was also working on remote carriers, which will fly with manned aircraft, she said. The company took part in the Nato Timber Express exercise in June, supplying two simulated remote carriers, connected on the Link 16 data network on the ground and pilots flying Tornado, Eurofighter Typhoon, and H-145 helicopters, she said. That allowed high level commands to be made to RCs.

Tests with RCs will continue next year, with sensors, and flying with a Learjet and Tornado, she said. There was also work to integrate with Eurofighter and the future combat air system.

Negotiations were going on for a contract for RCs in phase 1B, after Airbus DS submitted its work in October, she said.

Phase 1B is the next step in design studies on FCAS, intended to fly technology demonstrators in 2026/27.

Airbus was working to mature RC technology up to technology readiness level six, she said.

TRL is a measure of the maturity of technology in an acquisition process.

There was work on small and expendable RCs, as well as larger, conventional units which could serve as loyal wingman, she said. The company was working with MBDA in France and Germany, and a Spanish consortium comprising Cena, GNV, and tecnobit.

The MALE UAV would be integrated with the FCAS system of systems, flying with RCs, the source said.

There would be a first wave of expendable RCs “lighting up” the air defense system, sending back the target information before they were hit.

A second wave might include the UAV, to provide more information, conduct electronic warfare or destroy radars, allowing a third wave of manned aircraft such as the next generation fighter to fly in.

There could be further waves of aircraft.

“We are in a very critical time,” Hoke said. “These are very important projects for European sovereignty and…the European defense industry.”

Editor’s Note: The Australians are working with Boeing Australia to build a Loyal Wingman UAV, something akin to what the overall goal of the larger UAVs in FCAS might look like.

Recently, a senior Australian RAAF officer involved with the program highlighted a key challenge facing UAVs when operating in integrated airspace with combat aircraft as the key managers of the battlespace.

“The Loyal Wingman is challenged on a range of fronts, including future battlespace management frameworks, communications, and cyber standards, and the development of trusted AI algorithms, as these elements are critical to us being able to trust our Loyal Wingman on combat operations.”

This RAAF officer highlighted the key aspect of trust between the customer and the prime contractor to deliver the kind of development to production process which Rosenmann was talking about.

“Despite the many challenges the trust built between the Royal Australian Air Force and Boeing Australia has grown substantially over the course of the program and has contributed to its success so far.

“This trust is fundamental to the future flexibility needed to adapt this design, should we make further investments. It also provides the foundation for us to adapt quickly, when new designs are needed, and give our primes the ability to foresee needs, before we have fully had the chance to define them. This close partnership is a natural advantage for smaller air forces, which we can make the most of.

“Too much flexibility can also lead to deviating from the goal. And a key design challenge has been maintaining discipline within the program.”"
AvGeekery for beginners: How to tell Airbus A320-family planes apart - The Points Guy,"Tue, 29 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9uZXdzL2F2Z2Vla2VyeS1mb3ItYmVnaW5uZXJzLWhvdy10by10ZWxsLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzIwLWZhbWlseS1wbGFuZXMtYXBhcnQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Quite simply, the Airbus A320 has eaten the Boeing 737 for lunch.

Originally launched as a competitor to the ubiquitous Boeing 737, the A320 has outsold the 737 since its launch. It's also an excellent contribution to aviation in its own right, being the first fly-by-wire, or non-manually controlled, aircraft. It also has wingtip fences to reduce the effects of vortices (drag on the wings) as standard equipment. This popular plane has been tough competition for Boeing, and generally helped keep airline ticket prices lower via lower costs overall. Viva la competition.

In addition, the A320 is a family of aircraft like no other. A pilot that is type-rated (certified) on one of the members of the family can go smaller (to the Airbus A318) or bigger (to the A321XLR) with only minimal differences in training. That's a significant cost savings for airlines.

Airbus A320 aircraft are notoriously hard to differentiate, particularly because many of the variants have been retrofitted with ""sharklets,"" as Airbus calls its distinctive wingtip design. Now, the simplest way is to count the emergency exits, and even that isn't easy. We'll talk about this more below.

Make sure it's an Airbus

It can be hard to differentiate between a Boeing 737 and an Airbus A320-family aircraft; they serve the same purpose. Here's the biggest clue: The nose of the Airbus A320 family is quite bulbous compared to the much pointier Boeing 737.

Nowadays, the key difference is the engine. The ""ceo"" refers to the current engine option and the ""neo"" refers to the new engine option. These changes, however, are not readily apparent to an airplane spotter. The -neo plane engines are larger in size, and have a small plate at the back of the nacelle. All -neo planes have sharklets, but some -ceo planes have been retrofitted with sharklets.

Wingtip fences and sharklets

The A320 was the first commercial aircraft to feature wingtip fences, which reduce wingtip vortices. Nowadays, however, the A320 family (including the A319, A320 and A321) come new with the sharklets or can be retrofitted to add them. Accordingly, the presence of sharklets itself doesn't help identify which plane in the family you're looking at — but if you spot wingtip fences, the aircraft is definitely in the A320 family.

That plane? Probably not an A318

The Airbus A318 is a small, short and stubby little thing. It has few operators nowadays — Air France is the largest, with a little more than a dozen units. Chances are, then, if you spot an Airbus, it's not an A318. That is, unless it's the one operated by British Airways, which used to fly exclusively between London City Airport (LCY) and New York -JFK in an all-business-class configuration. Those flights were suspended in March of 2020 because of a collapse of demand due to COVID-19. It is unlikely the plane will return to service.

So, generally, you can eliminate the A318 from your plane-spotting mind.

All about the emergency exits

Spotting the differences among members of the A320 family requires paying close attention to detail. After all, this aircraft family was specifically designed to look uniform, whether it's the smallest model (the A318) or the largest (the A321XLR).

First, the A318 and A319 only have one over-wing exit door. And because you're not likely seeing an A318, that means you've found an A319, a very common aircraft in the U.S.

The A320 is the easiest to spot: It has two over-wing emergency exit doors. (That's not what the ""2"" stands for in A320, but that's how I remember it.) The A321 confuses matters a bit. Older A321s have four exit doors spread out evenly on the fuselage, but the new A321neo has two emergency exits over the wing, just like the A320. The A321-200 is the aircraft that American Airlines uses to fly passengers from JFK to LAX these days — about the maximum you'd want to fly in a cramped twinjet with one aisle.

Confusing as this may be, the emergency exits are the best way to differentiate the planes.

The A321neo also comes in two longer and longer-range variants, the A321LR and the A321XLR — and both have yet to be delivered to any U.S. airline. The LR is the aircraft that JetBlue has selected for its inaugural London service. American Airlines ordered 50 A321XLRs for service from the East Coast to Europe. It'll be cramped, unless they operate it as an all-business-class configuration. The planes are likely to sport the ""raccoon"" motif for the cockpit windows, have sharklets and be quite a bit longer than the A320.

The nickname

(Photo courtesy of Airbus)

The Boeing 737 sports a unique nickname. Called FLUF, or the ""fat little ugly f*cker,"" the moniker has been around almost as long as the aircraft itself.

The Airbus family, on the other hand, has remained nickname-free so far.

Said Chris Brady, who runs the Boeing 737 Technical Site and is type-rated on the A320 family: ""I haven't really heard crews use any Airbus nicknames. I think the aircraft is just too bland to have one.""

Sad, really.

A history of Helicopter Emergency Medical Services - Airbus,"Tue, 01 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIwLTEyLWEtaGlzdG9yeS1vZi1oZWxpY29wdGVyLWVtZXJnZW5jeS1tZWRpY2FsLXNlcnZpY2Vz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In late spring of 1969, a young boy named Björn Steiger spends the day at the local swimming pool in his hometown of Winnenden, Germany. On his way home that afternoon, he is struck by a car. The local police and Red Cross are immediately contacted, but it takes almost a full hour before the ambulance arrives on the scene. Björn Steiger dies on the way to the hospital.

This story and many others were the reality of what emergency medical services looked like for much of the 20th century. Whether suffering an injury at the top of a mountain or in the middle of a highway, a nascent emergency medical response system meant that many victims did not receive the care they needed fast enough.

Today, Helicopter Emergency Medical Services (HEMS) systems have matured in many countries around the world. The biggest advantage is that helicopters can reach a location three-to-five-times faster than a ground vehicle and sometimes is the only way to access inhospitable terrain. Patients receive medical treatment earlier and the chance of survival in critical cases goes up significantly. Airbus products were instrumental in the development of the HEMS systems working today.

HEMS for civilian use

Air medical evacuation first began its story with fixed-wing aircraft. It wasn’t until the Korean and Vietnam wars that helicopter use became standard for military medical evacuation (MEDEVAC). With such a positive impact, HEMS soon was introduced into the civilian sphere.

Several countries led the way in adopting helicopter use for civilian populations. Flight for Life became the United States’ first civilian HEMS operator in 1972, based at St. Anthony Central Hospital in Denver, Colorado. The French Sécurité Civile began rescue missions dating back all the way to 1959 when for the first time it rescued a mountaineer suffering from a heart attack at the highest resting point on Mont Blanc (and indeed the highest in all of Europe) the Vallot refuge, at 4,362 metres. The SAF Group followed suit and in 1979 began rescue operations in the French Alps. In Germany, the authorities took the decision to launch a medical helicopter trial period with a doctor and a paramedic onboard in order to shorten the response time for accidents, pioneering the concept of taking the physician to the scene of the accident. This approach provided primary care within 10-20 minutes after sounding the alarm.

The global fleet of Alouette III helicopters has accumulated more than seven million flight hours overall, with many of these rotorcraft still in operational service today.

Airbus helicopters that helped pave the way

The Alouette III was instrumental for the growth of HEMS and mountain rescue activities worldwide. It was the helicopter that the Swiss’ REGA, Austrian ÖAMTC, United States’ Flight for Life, France’s Sécurité Civile, and Germany’s DRF Luftrettung grew their activities on. Later the SA315 Lama, with its light airframe and powerful turboshaft engine became instrumental in rescue activities in high-altitudes, such as for the SAF mountain rescue activities.

In the following decades, the Bo 105 and BK117, developed in the late 1970s, were some of the most successful helicopters in HEMS. The special design of the Bo 105 – with features like a flat cabin floor, rear loading and a high main and tail rotor – allowed for easier patient loading, contributed to its success. When Germany’s automobile club ADAC set up its first permanent HEMS base in Munich in 1970, a Bo 105 helicopter, baptised “Christoph 1,” was used for its operations. The helicopter had been developed by Airbus Helicopters’ predecessor company, MBB, and in close cooperation with ADAC.

Today, the H135 and H145 are the standard and most popular helicopters in HEMS operations worldwide. Feedback and requests from the HEMS community were implemented in the design of the H135 in the mid-1990s and later, in the H145, which began production in 2014. Today, 55% of the total 2,750 helicopters that are in dedicated HEMS operations worldwide are Airbus Helicopters.

The pioneering Bo 105 helicopter has been purchased by more than 300 operators around the globe, including Germany’s ADAC air rescue service.

Modern-day HEMS

Many different models for HEMS activities exist around the world today. In some countries, operations are government-run, in others it is based on charity or private business models – or a mix of both. The level of coverage also differs, depending on geography, financial resources and the level of the organisation’s maturity in the respective country.

The HEMS system in Europe today provides coverage in nearly all EU countries. Most of the HEMS bases work on the principle of quick intervention with specialised emergency teams to give primary care. Generally there is a ratio of 1 to 1.5 helicopters per one million residents, but in areas where populations are spread out across mountainous regions or across fjords, such as in Austria or Norway, the ratio can go up to five helicopters per one million residents.

In the United States, there are over 1,000 HEMS helicopters transporting an estimated 400,000 patients annually. HEMS models vary including not-for-profit and for-profit operators offering options from hospital-based systems, where the hospital operates the programme, to independent provider models and county-run programmes. In 2016, 86.4% of the U.S. population was covered by an air medical service, within a 15-20-minute response area.

Launched in 1982, the BK117 became particularly popular among U.S. operators – including Helicopter Emergency Medical Services (HEMS) provider Boston MedFlight.

Emerging markets for HEMS

Interest for HEMS operations has grown in emerging markets. Malaysia and China, among others, have successfully started their first HEMS activities. As programmes continue to be launched in emerging markets around the world, initial challenges first need to be overcome. Before helicopters are introduced, the authorities must ensure that the infrastructure is in place, such as having qualified personnel available and informing the population about emergency procedures. Countries such as India, Brazil, Mexico and Indonesia are potential candidates for a strong HEMS development in the coming decades.

HEMS future improvements

An array of innovations are underway to improve the safety of HEMS missions. From synthetic vision systems to satellite communications and self-learning AI algorithms, these technologies all aim to ease pilot workload and improve operational safety. Smaller Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) platforms are being investigated for their use as “doctor shuttles” and could play a complementary role in the future of HEMS operations.

The technologies and innovations for HEMS are limitless and exciting in what they can achieve. Airbus will continue to pioneer the way forward, dedicated to reaching new heights for what is possible in emergency medical services."
Arianespace to launch four-satellite Airbus CO3D constellation aboard Vega C - SpaceNews,"Wed, 09 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9hcmlhbmVzcGFjZS10by1sYXVuY2gtZm91ci1zYXRlbGxpdGUtYWlyYnVzLWNvM2QtY29uc3RlbGxhdGlvbi1hYm9hcmQtdmVnYS1jL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"JOHANNESBURG — Airbus signed a contract with Arianespace on Dec. 7 to launch a four-satellite optical Earth observation constellation aboard a Vega C rocket in 2023.

The four-satellite Composante Optique 3D (CO3D) constellation is a joint undertaking by Airbus and the French space agency CNES. The two partners each invested approximately 100 million euros ($112 million) in the project with the aim of creating a highly detailed 3D map of the Earth’s landmass within two years.

Airbus spokesperson Guilhem Boltz said Vega C was chosen for the CO3D mission because it is ideally suited to deploy multiple small payloads into the target orbit of 500 kilometers.

Each of the four CO3D satellites weighs just 300 kilograms and carries an optical payload capable of imaging the ground in 50 centimeter resolution. The data collected by the constellation will be fed into an Airbus digital processing system that integrates advanced algorithms developed by CNES to quickly produce precise 3D maps.

The launch of the initial four CO3D satellites is expected to be just the first of a larger constellation. Airbus anticipates that the constellation could grow to between 12 and 24 satellites.

The additional CO3D satellites are expected to be purchased by governments, private customers and by Airbus itself, an avenue by which the European aerospace corporation expects the bulk of the constellation will be built. Guilhem said that Airbus already has commitments for additional satellites, although he declined to name customers for follow-on CO3D missions.

CNES and Airbus commit to Vega

Vega C is under development to replace the Vega rocket that debuted in 2012 and flew 14 consecutive successful missions before suffering two failures in three attempts since mid-2019. The most recent failure took place in November and resulted in the destruction of a pair of payloads that included the CNES TARANIS satellite.

Despite the failure, CNES and Airbus have committed to launching aboard the next-generation Vega launch vehicle. According to Arianespace spokesperson Claudia Euzet-Hoyau, the launch contract reaffirms the value of the Vega C vehicle.

“Vega C, the new-generation European light-lift launcher has reaffirmed, once again with this new contract, its ability to meet users’ innovative needs in low orbits, especially with its ability to carry multiple payloads,” Euzet-Hoyau said.The maiden flight of the Vega C launch vehicle had initially been slated for this year. However, the first Vega failure in July 2019 resulted in the delay of several missions. As a result, Vega C manufacturer Avio made the decision to push out the debut of its next-generation launch vehicle to no earlier than mid-2021 in order to catch up on Vega missions delayed by the failure.

Airbus is seeking to help make that future a reality with its three recently announced ZEROe concept aircraft powered by hydrogen.

It is partnering with ElringKlinger, which will provide the fuel-cell technology and acquire a noncontrolling interest in Airbus. Modified gas turbine engines will burn liquid hydrogen as fuel while hydrogen fuel cells create electrical power that complements the gas turbine, according to Airbus.

UK to ditch US Airbus-Boeing tariffs as it eyes trade deal - POLITICO Europe,"Tue, 08 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmV1L2FydGljbGUvdWstZGl0Y2gtdXMtYWlyYnVzLWJvZWluZy10YXJpZmZzLWl0LWV5ZXMtdHJhZGUtZGVhbC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Legal headache

The Boeing ruling, in which the WTO ruled that the EU could hit U.S. goods with tariffs, has proven a legal headache for the U.K. The trade department was trying to establish a legal basis for Britain to go it alone on these duties, emails seen by POLITICO in recent weeks revealed. Yet the approach was in doubt because only the EU, rather than specific countries, were named in the WTO’s Boeing decision.

If the U.K. did ultimately decide to impose some duties of its own, it could have faced a legal challenge from the U.S. The Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) does not believe the U.K. has a sound legal basis for a share of the tariffs granted by the WTO’s Boeing ruling, the emails reviewed by POLITICO suggest.

The EU, meanwhile, has no plans to cut the U.K. a share of its $4 billion in duties allowed by the WTO ruling, according to officials familiar with the matter.

“Businesses across the country will welcome the government’s steps to de-escalate the tariff war that’s been going on for far too long,” said Andy Burwell, director of international trade at the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), in a statement.

Burwell pointed out that “tariffs are having a detrimental impact” on British industries. The U.S. retaliation in the Airbus-Boeing dispute saw punishing tariffs of 25 percent imposed on single malt Scotch whisky, cheese, British-made clothing and equipment like excavators.

Britain’s new strategy “shows the U.K. government’s determination to de-escalate the damaging transatlantic trade disputes that have seen Scotch whisky exports to the U.S. fall by over 30 percent in the past year,” said Karen Betts, chief executive of the Scotch Whisky Association.

“The U.S. government’s removal of Airbus retaliation on Scotch could, in turn, justify the U.K. removing tariffs on U.S. whiskey under the steel and aluminum dispute,” Betts said. “Moves such as these pave the way for both governments to intensify efforts to reach a final resolution to both the Airbus/Boeing and steel and aluminum disputes, which have caused real disruption to businesses and raised costs for consumers in both countries.”"

The Ultima-DT is the latest solution from Orolia’s ELT line, based on its proven Kannad technology. It was developed in response to recent aviation safety mandates to enhance global aircraft tracking, following the MH370 and AF447 accidents. As per the ICAO Global Aeronautical Distress and Safety Systems (GADSS) recommendation and European Union mandate, all new aircraft delivered from January 2023 shall be able to autonomously report their location anywhere in the world and determine the end of flight location to help rescue teams rapidly locate the aircraft and recover flight recorders.

Unlike traditional automatic fixed ELTs which are stand-alone units, the Ultima-DT is tightly connected to the avionics system. It activates upon detection of a potential distress condition and starts transmitting automatically while the aircraft is still in flight. This next-generation ELT autonomously acquires the aircraft’s location and sends a 406 MHz message in real time, including the accurate location, to the Cospas-Sarsat distress alert organization.

Orolia CEO Jean-Yves Courtois said, “We are extremely proud to be selected by Airbus to provide with the world’s first aircraft manufacturer compliance with the latest safety regulations. A single-source, multi-year program selection for the delivery of mandatory equipment is a testimonial to our innovation capabilities, the reliability of Orolia as a critical equipment manufacturer, and our know-how in terms of large and complex program management.”

Orolia’s Ultima-DT will be installed on a standard basis on all Airbus commercial aircraft programs, including the A220, A320 family, A330 and A350. First units will be delivered to Airbus for final assembly line installation in 2022, ensuring that aircraft delivered from January 2023 meet the autonomous distress tracking requirements.

The Ultima-DT also allows operators to fully comply with the latest EASA/FAA safety requirements applying to non-rechargeable lithium battery powered equipment. As part of its efforts to support airlines in their regulatory compliance projects, Orolia is also offering its portable Ultima-S ELT which meets these special conditions.

Effective Jan. 12, the US will slap a 15% tax on fuselage, wing and tail components shipped from France and Germany to Mobile for final assembly on A320s and A321s.

This is a setback in what appeared to be progress in resolving at long last the trade war over subsidies to Airbus deemed illegal by the World Trade Organization.

The US also will apply tariffs on helicopter parts imported from France and Germany for Airbus assembly sites in Mississippi and other US locations.

Airbus response

“The USTR’s expansion of tariffs to include components for aircraft manufactured in the U.S. – by American workers – is counterproductive in every way. We regret that USTR has decided to escalate this dispute by taking a step that hurts US manufacturing, US workers, and US consumers. This will not contribute to a climate of trust to create a negotiated solution. Airbus trusts that Europe will respond appropriately to defend its interests and the interests of all European companies and sectors, including Airbus, targeted by these unwarranted and counterproductive tariffs.”

US airlines, including Delta, Spirit, JetBlue, Frontier and American, have been taking delivery of Mobile-assembled A320s and A321s that up to now have been exempt from tariffs. Similar airplanes received from France and Germany were subject to tariffs.

Delta, using a loophole, avoided tariffs by first operating the European-made airplanes through third countries, according to a press report.

The USTR also extended tariffs to more European goods at a rate of 25%.

European retaliation

The EU has the authority to levy tariffs on Boeing airplanes and goods imported from the US. The EU previously levied a 15% tariff on airplanes. No announcement has been made about retaliation to the USTR’s action, which was revealed this week.

Airbus Helicopters boosts the mission capabilities of its H135 helicopters - Airbus,"Thu, 17 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMC0xMi1haXJidXMtaGVsaWNvcHRlcnMtYm9vc3RzLXRoZS1taXNzaW9uLWNhcGFiaWxpdGllcy1vZi1pdHMtaDEzNdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Donauwörth, 17 December 2020 – The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has certified a new Alternate Gross Weight (AGW) for the latest version of the H135 family of helicopters. The new AGW enables operators to benefit from an increased maximum take-off weight of up to 120 kg (265 lb) and useful load. This increase can also be used to extend the range by up to 75 nm or the endurance by up to 40 minutes under standard conditions. The new AGW is available as an option and can be applied retroactively to all H135s equipped with Helionix.

Additionally, Airbus has recently certified a new single pilot IFR Helionix cockpit for its H135 helicopters. The modified cockpit enables customers to choose between removing the copilot side of the instrument panel to increase the field of view or to keep it in order to install specific STC equipment. The single pilot IFR cockpit of the H135 will further boost the capabilities of the H135 in several missions, including aerial work, utility and law enforcement.



To date, more than 1,400 helicopters of the H135 family have been delivered around the globe with more than 5.6 million flight hours.

Kourou, 2 December 2020 – The Earth observation satellite FalconEye was successfully launched last night from the European Spaceport (CSG) in Kourou, French Guiana by an Arianespace Soyuz rocket.

Owned and operated by the United Arab Emirates, FalconEye was developed by Airbus Defence and Space and Thales Alenia Space as co-prime contractors.



The FalconEye system will support the needs of the UAE’s Armed Forces. The satellite weighed 1190 kg at launch and will be raised to a helio-synchronous orbit of 611 km. Airbus Defence and Space was in charge of the satellite design, integration and test, and supplied the platform. Thales Alenia Space designed and supplied the optical instrument and the image processing chain.



“FalconEye will offer top quality Earth observation, providing our customer with the best of what space imagery can offer. The high-performance optical satellite system represents an important step in the cooperation between the United Arab Emirates and France,” said Jean-Marc Nasr, Head of Space Systems at Airbus. “Thanks to the trust of our Emirati customer and the support of the French government, we have been able to deliver a great team effort between Airbus and Thales Alenia Space.”

JetBlue Airways receives first ultra-modern Airbus A220 - Business Insider,"Thu, 31 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vamV0Ymx1ZS1qdXN0LXJlY2VpdmVkLWl0cy1maXJzdC1haXJidXMtYTIyMC0yMDIwLTEy0gFXaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9qZXRibHVlLWp1c3QtcmVjZWl2ZWQtaXRzLWZpcnN0LWFpcmJ1cy1hMjIwLTIwMjAtMTI_YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By clicking “Sign Up”, you accept our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy .

Christmas came a bit late for one airline as Thursday saw the first delivery of the Airbus A220 to JetBlue Airways, just in time for the new year.

Airbus handed the keys over to JetBlue for the first of 70 models, marking a new era for the 20-year-old carrier that will see its smallest aircraft retired and replaced with one of the newest aircraft currently flying.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

The new plane, which remains nameless for the time being but wears the registration N3008J, came painted in JetBlue's instantly-recognizable blue and white livery but sports a new tail design. The pattern is called ""hops,"" the term for the flights that make up a larger journey, as the curved lines resemble airline routes.

Each new JetBlue aircraft type receives a new tail design, a trend that started with the arrival of the Airbus A321 in 2013. Passengers seated near the wings of the A220 will also notice the design is also painted on the aircraft's wing attachments, known as winglets, in a first for a JetBlue aircraft.

Powering the aircraft are two Pratt & Whitney Pratt & Whitney Geared Turbofan engines, offering between 19,000 and 25,000 pounds of thrust while reducing fuel burn by 40% compared to the aircraft they'll be replacing, according to the airline. Their fuel efficiency is only matched by their quietness as their manufacturer says noise levels are reduced by half.

JetBlue hasn't yet unveiled the interior of the aircraft but customers won't likely be disappointed as the airline has been steadily improving its onboard product, as Business Insider found on a flight from New York to Fort Myers, Florida on a newly-refurbished Airbus A320. The new cabin experience will almost definitely include free in-flight WiFi, touch-screen entertainment screens, on-demand movies and television shows, and in-seat power outlets.

""The interior of JetBlue's A220 will be as impressive as the operating capabilities of the aircraft,"" the airline said in a statement. ""Customers will also enjoy an elevated inflight experience with wider seats, spacious overhead bins, and extra-large windows.""

The A220 is the fifth aircraft type to join JetBlue's fleet since its inception at the turn of the century. Its arrival comes at an exciting time for the airline as it introduces a new service offering for Mint business class and prepares to head overseas with service to London in the new year with a new aircraft slated to join the fleet in 2021, the Airbus A321neoXLR.

JetBlue is the second US carrier to fly the aircraft behind Delta Air Lines, which began flying the smaller A220-100 in February 2019 from New York to Boston and Dallas. Delta now flies the aircraft on routes across the country and just acquired the larger Dash 300 variant that JetBlue now flies.

Delta's order gave the A220's former manufacturer, Bombardier, the foothold it needed in the US but also prompted the trade dispute that resulted in Airbus taking over the project.

The A220 will also power JetBlue founder David Neeleman's new startup airline, Breeze Airways. And to the north, Air Canada began flying the larger A220-300 in January.

The first routes for the jet have not been announced but JetBlue's head of revenue and planning, Scott Laurence, told Business Insider in a prior interview that Boston will see the new jet first. Initial service will be on existing short-haul routes such as Boston-Washington so flight crews can get acquainted with the new plane.

""We're planning around making sure that the introduction is flawless and we want to give the airplane a bit of a boost in flying easily operated an easily operated initial network,"" Laurence said.

After that, Laurence said the plane will head further and further west, flying to cities like Austin and Denver before eventually serving the West Coast. The A220 has a cross-country range of 3,350 nautical miles that JetBlue intends to use to the fullest with eventual transcontinental service from Boston to cities like Sacramento, California and Portland, Oregon during the summer.

""That airplane is so flexible for us,"" Laurence said, as the aircraft can fly nearly every route JetBlue operates in the US and most of its current international routes. New York will also see the aircraft on routes to cities like Albuquerque and the A220 will serve to aid JetBlue's new hybrid route network.

The pandemic has seen JetBlue launch new routes to secondary markets like Charleston, South Carolina, Raleigh, North Carolina, and Richmond, Virginia to cities as far as Las Vegas and Los Angeles. They're called ""long, thin routes"" as demand is often middling but the right aircraft can make the route viable. And the A220 has the economics to make them work.

""We're going to stretch the legs of this airplane,"" Laurence said. ""It produces great seatbelt cost on long routes, and that's something that we could not do with our E190 fleet.""

The A220 will also be deployed to hard-to-reach airports including Key West, where the runway is just shy of a mile long at a mere 5,076 feet. JetBlue is launching non-stop flights to the Lower 48's southernmost city in 2021 from New York and Boston with the Embraer E190 and is forced to limit the number of seats it sells to meet the airport's standards.

But for the A220, it's nothing the aircraft can't handle.

""As we start integrating the A220 in the network, some of our more performance challenged airports will become priorities for the A220,"" Laurence said. ""Key West is likely one of them."""
The “HForce” is with Hungary's H145Ms - Airbus,"Fri, 18 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIwLTEyLXRoZS1oZm9yY2UtaXMtd2l0aC1odW5nYXJ5cy1oMTQ1bXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The H145M joined the fleet of the Hungarian Air Force one year ago. This helicopter, which is currently being fitted with the HForce weapon management system, has changed the way Hungary’s Defence Forces fly. As of the end of 2020, three H145Ms have been upgraded with two more planned for March 2021.

We spoke to Tamás Bali, Deputy Base Commander of the Hungarian Air Force, who has more than 30 years of experience flying helicopters.

For many decades, Hungary used Mi-8 and Mi-17 helicopters for utility missions and Mi-24 helicopters for attack roles. “We used those helicopters for as long as we could, but we were flying a technology that was created 60 years ago,” said Tamás. “We had to renew our fleet to communicate and work properly with the Hungarian Land and Special Forces. There were many helicopters in the European market, but the H145 was at the top of the list. Going from the Soviet helicopters to the H145M has been a big step up: it’s like a brand new era for us.”

Jumping into the digital era

“This military version of the H145 gives us the performance our Defence Forces need. Previously, our transport and attack helicopters didn’t have any sensor capabilities. We’ve jumped into the digital era with the H145M,” said Tamás. “Nowadays, the operational environment is digital. Helicopters that can’t connect with this digital environment are simply out of date. That’s the biggest difference I see today.”

Going from the Soviet helicopters to the H145M has been a big step up.

- Tamás Bali, Deputy Base Commander of the Hungarian Air Force

The H145Ms of the Hungarian fleet are also equipped with a fast roping system, high-performance camera, dual cargo hook, hoist, disaster management kit, ballistic protection and an electronic countermeasures system to support the most demanding operational requirements. “The H145M will allow us to take over the SAR missions currently assumed by transport helicopters in Hungary. It will also be used for Special Forces missions. We’ll be able to perform reconnaissance missions and command and control (RC2) using the sensors to communicate in real time with the teams on the ground.”

A new way of flying

“From a pilot’s point of view, the biggest difference I noticed when I flew the H145M was its stability. Soviet helicopters have what they call an ‘autopilot’, but it really isn’t one! With the H145M, the stabilisation is so sophisticated that you can make a 60-degree turn without touching the cyclic and the collective… before it was hard to even turn with a 30-degree bank angle! I honestly think the H145’s stabilisation system is the best in the world,” he said.

“Secondly, the automation: previously we didn’t have a Flight Management System, which significantly eases the pilot’s workload. For example, IFR flight is fully automated now; the H145 flies itself,” he said. “And finally, the performance: the power margin is just amazing. It means this helicopter can provide a much wider range of performance capabilities.”

Mission readiness of the H145Ms already in service is above 95 percent.

Extensive training package

Together with the helicopters, Airbus is providing training for pilots and maintenance personnel. In total, 50 pilots will receive H145 training at the Donauwörth site, of which two thirds have already received their certificates. These pilots also need to complete VFR and IFR training courses, while instructor pilots will also receive Night Vision, Check Pilot and Hoist Crew training to increase the capabilities of the team once back in Hungary. Finally, the pilots will receive HForce training so they are fully versed in this new weapon system.

“The contract also includes training for 70 maintenance technicians. They will complete Level B1 and B2 training in Donauwörth and will then continue with on-the-job training back at our base. Airbus mentors will also spend an additional year with us,” said Tamás.

HForce: ready to go

The Hungarian Air Force will operate a total of 20 H145Ms, of which 16 are already at the Szolnok Base in Hungary. They are fitted with the HForce weapon management system developed by Airbus Helicopters, which allows Hungary to equip and operate their aircraft with a complete range of ballistic or guided weapons. “We’ve already received the systems but the training will start next year, around June. We should then be ready to use the HForce system by around July.”

The HForce weapon system is modular and incremental, and can be fitted onto any military version of Airbus’ commercial helicopter range (H125M, H145M, H225M). It offers a large array of weapons, modern and easy target acquisition and a high level of targeting accuracy, features formerly reserved for high-end attack helicopters.

Thrustmaster TCA Sidestick Airbus Edition review - TechRadar,"Fri, 04 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hyYWRhci5jb20vcmV2aWV3cy90aHJ1c3RtYXN0ZXItdGNhLXNpZGVzdGljay1haXJidXMtZWRpdGlvbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Thrustmaster TCA Sidestick Airbus Edition is the perfect fit for Microsoft Flight Simulator. It’s a good quality, reasonably priced flight stick based on real-world Airbus hardware. The price rises significantly if you buy the impressive Quadrant add-ons, but there’s no need for dabblers to do this on day one.

Why you can trust TechRadar We spend hours testing every product or service we review, so you can be sure you’re buying the best. Find out more about how we test.

Two-minute review

The Thrustmaster TCA Sidestick Airbus Edition is a flight stick made in the image of an Airbus sidestick. It’s an officially licensed tie-in. And as well as the base controller you can get a throttle set and a pack of additional modules that add a real sense of authenticity to sims like Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020.

Good news on that front: the Thrustmaster TCA Sidestick Airbus Edition is “plug and play” ready for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. You won’t need to spend an hour or five configuring its button layout.

However, if you want the stick alone, the Thrustmaster TCA Sidestick Airbus Edition is very similar to the long-standing Thrustmaster T.16000M.

These are plastic flight sticks, made to last but not with the weight and construction quality of a Thrustmaster Warthog. But at a third of the price, what else do you expect?

Give yourself a minute to get over the relatively light all-plastic build and let the quality of the stick itself take over. The Thrustmaster TCA Sidestick Airbus Edition is an incredibly smooth, dead zone free flight stick that offers sim-grade control to compete with any mainstream joystick at any price.

(Image credit: Future)

Add the Quadrant throttle if you want even more of an Airbus flavour. The quality and specificity of the controls on these outboard modules blow away those on the flight stick’s base.

No other joystick feels as tailor made for Flight Simulator 2020 as the Thrustmaster TCA Sidestick Airbus Edition. And, sure, you can use it for any other suitable PC game too.

The Thrustmaster TCA Sidestick Airbus Edition is made to a budget, but the attention to detail is excellent.

Price and availability

The Thrustmaster TCA Sidestick Airbus Edition launched in June 2020. It costs $69.99/£64.99, and has spent much of the rest of 2020 out of stock.

Thrustmaster followed up the stick itself with the TCA Quadrant, a $99.99/$89.99 throttle add-on that connects to your PC using a separate USB port.

There’s more too. The Quadrant Add-On pack offers even more controls that screw into the throttle module. It adds a parking brake and landing gear controls, and levers for flaps and speed brakes.

The TCA Quadrant Add-on costs an additional $99.99/£89.99.

Tally that all up and you can spend $270/£245 on the full Thrustmaster TCA setup. This is still a lot lower than the £400 of the Thrustmaster HOTAS Warthog.

Thrustmaster’s Officer Pack is probably the best buy for most flight sim fans. It nets you the flightstick and throttle module for $159.99/£149.99.

Read on to find out more about all three products.

An excellent deadzone-free stick

First off, let’s deal with the most important core part of the Thrustmaster TCA Airbus family, the stick itself. It’s excellent.

It may not look all that high-end, but its motion is extremely smooth and the moderate spring-based lets you make fine-grain movements with total confidence.

There is also effectively zero deadzone. In the Windows 10 setup app you have to move it with the force of a mouse’s breath to avoid any input the system recognises.

This alone puts the Thrustmaster TCA Sidestick Airbus Edition right near the top of its class in terms of real-world use.

(Image credit: Future)

Tension is non-adjustable, but the default level is well-chosen. There’s enough spring-back to make you want to adjust the plane’s trim so you don’t have to hold the Thrustmaster TCA Sidestick Airbus Edition in place constantly. But not so much kids can’t use the thing without complaining about getting sore forearms in three minutes.

The ergonomics of the stick are more than sound, too. There’s only minor contouring but it fits your grip perfectly and is large enough to seem like a “serious” sim controller.

Build quality

Some of you are doubtless going to be a little disappointed by the Thrustmaster TCA Sidestick Airbus Edition’s build. Just about everything here bar the screws and internal spring is plastic.

There are no rubberized parts to the stick’s grip, no metal panels anywhere. Of course, this is the norm for a flight stick at this level. And we have no reason to believe it won’t last for years, even if you do end up throwing the Thrustmaster TCA Sidestick Airbus Edition at a wall a couple of times after messing up a landing five times in a row.

Thrustmaster says the TCA Sidestick Airbus Edition’s sensor style helps on this front too. The non-button controls use magnetic hall sensors with no moving parts, so there’s no wear as the years pass by.

There aren’t even any decals on the base’s buttons to gradually wear off. The difference between a new Thrustmaster TCA Sidestick Airbus Edition and one five years old is most likely to be a result of the spring inside losing some tension.

(Image credit: Future)

We’re not quite as keen on some of the Thrustmaster TCA Sidestick Airbus Edition’s buttons. The stick’s top buttons and triggers all have a very similar, shallow click.

We aren’t pilots. Perhaps the Airbus A320’s stick buttons feel just like these, but to our fingers they come across a little cheap.

The 12 buttons on the base also have a slightly stodgy action. Still, we’d much rather have a great stick and so-so buttons than the other way around.

Ambi-dextrous buttons

Thrustmaster also proves these buttons haven’t just been stuck on here without much thought. The two primary non-trigger buttons on the stick’s top can be swapped around. Each comes on its own little plastic module. You can unscrew them, and there are mirror image replacements in the box. When fastened in, there’s zero wobble, no sign these are switchable.

(Image credit: Future)

This makes the Thrustmaster TCA Sidestick Airbus Edition an ambidextrous stick. There's another angle here too, though.

In an actual Airbus plane you’d have one set of controls for the captain, another for the co-pilot. And each uses a different hand to grasp the stick, hence the reserved controls. A third config, that of a centrally positioned stick, uses the taller red buttons on both sides. It’s another little win for the Thrustmaster TCA Sidestick Airbus Edition’s authenticity.

Built-in throttle

We may be reviewing the Thrustmaster TCA Sidestick Airbus Edition as a full package, with the separate throttle and flaps controls, but the main stick alone has all you need.

As well as moving in normal joystick fashion, the stick twists. This offers rudder control, meaning you don’t need Thrustmaster’s relatively expensive rudder pedals. Want to use them? There’s a button that locks off twist motion very effectively on the stick itself.

(Image credit: Future)

See that little ridged black thing towards the back? That’s a little throttle. It sets the Thrustmaster Airbus family up as something you can get involved with without spending too much money. And if your casual interest in flying sims takes off, you an upgrade without needing to get rid of what you bought in the first place.

It’s much like the Thrustmaster wheel family in this respect. But perhaps even better in this case as you could remap the throttle to do… something else. Planes aren’t exactly short of controls to map.

The actual experience of using the Thrustmaster TCA Sidestick Airbus Edition’s built-in throttle is mixed. There’s a good amount of resistance to this slider, letting you set the engine power precisely even though the control only has a few inches of movement. There's also a tiny little click feedback as you each the bottom 20%.

However, at the very bottom of this control’s travel, it becomes a switch that sets the engine to reverse. And there’s not enough resistance or positive feedback to this to help you avoid doing so accidentally.

Still, we absolutely think you can get by with the Thrustmaster TCA Sidestick Airbus Edition alone if your interest in flight sims only started with Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020.

TCA Quadrant Airbus Edition

Want to get serious? You’ll need the TCA Quadrant Airbus Edition. This companion to the flight stick is actually a separate peripheral, with its own USB connection to your PC and its own entry in the Control section of games like Microsoft Flight Simulator.

(Image credit: Future)

It consists of two separate throttle controls, for dual engine planes, two chunky switches to turn the engines on and off, and an engine state switch. You can even buy two, for control of 4-engined planes, if you want to dive headfirst into “sim land”.

(Image credit: Future)

Using the TCA Quadrant Airbus Edition is likely why we have a slightly dim view of the stick’s own buttons. These feel much better and have a real sense of the tactile immersion that is the primary reason to buy a dedicated controller like this.

Sure, the TCA Quadrant Airbus Edition is still made of plastic and the throttles don’t have as much resistance as the real thing. But there are light clicks of feedback as you reach each milestone on the throttle, and a great release catch behind each throttle lever that lets you put the engines into reverse thrust.

Some of you may find the dedicated engine switches are somewhat wasted in their default roles, but they can be remapped to do whatever you like. It’s one of the bonuses of PC gaming.

TCA Quadrant Airbus add-on pack

Thrustmaster’s Add-on pack doubles the width of the Quadrant throttle controller. It comes in two parts, which can be arranged either way around, with the base of the modules screwing into the main one with the help of some little plastic bridges. And it connects to the throttle part using SATA cables just like those currently connecting your SSD or hard drive to your motherboard.

These two extra modules add throttle-style controls for the flaps and air brake and two of the most charming controls of the whole Thrustmaster Airbus setup, the parking brake and landing gear. They delightfully nerdy, with a very specific design that begs not to be remapped, and genuinely adds to the virtual flying experience.

(Image credit: Future)

It’s odd that an ostensibly thin enhancement, like a control that operates a little differently to the rest, can level-up your experience. But it really does.

The flaps and brake controls are good too. They move smoothly, but will only sit at 25% increments. You’ll feel tactile feedback as they move past each of these points.

Beyond not messing up the fundamentals of the control units inside, the job of peripherals like the TCA Quadrant Airbus Add-on Pack is to boost a sim’s suspension of disbelief factor. The way a lever feels as you push it doesn’t just matter, it’s kinda the whole deal. And while these may be lighter, smaller and necessarily flimsier than the real deal, they are a pretty effective simulacrum.

Still, we kinda wish the main Quadrant throttle unit had the lovely parking brake control, if only because we love it but can’t quite face the full cost of the full Thrustmaster Airbus rig.

(Image credit: Future)

Buy it if...

You want a fantastic controller for Microsoft Flight Simulator

The Thrustmaster TCA Sidestick Airbus Edition is clearly made primarily for Microsoft Flight Simulator. Sure, it plays nice with Elite Dangerous and many others too, but with a design based on real flight controls it has a veneer of realism most other sets lack. That veneer only gets thicker if you buy the Quadrant throttle controller and its Add-on pack. This stick also works perfectly with Microsoft Flight Simulator, without further customization.

You want a reasonably affordable flight stick

Sure, the Thrustmaster TCA Sidestick Airbus Edition costs mount up if you buy every accessory going. But you only really need the stick itself, particularly as there’s a built-in throttle control, and it doesn't cost that much more than a first-party PS5 gamepad. The beauty of the Thrustmaster system is you can add to it should your interest in flight sims expand, and its kit holds its value very well if you don’t fall in love with this kind of game after all.

Your current joystick doesn’t seem smooth or precise enough

There’s a lot to like about the Thrustmaster TCA Sidestick Airbus Edition, but the number one core appeal is simple. The stick itself is excellent, with a very smooth, precise feel that is not dulled by any annoying dead zones. You don’t necessarily need to upgrade to a hugely expensive model if your current, perhaps very old, stick does not stack up anymore.

Don't buy it if...

You want a flight stick for consoles

The Thrustmaster TCA Sidestick Airbus Edition is for PC only. We tried plugging it into an Xbox One and PS4: no joy. The stick does not appear to be recognised by either."

The latest passenger jet from Airbus just began flying passengers, placing it among the most exclusive airliners currently flying.

Kuwait Airlines took delivery of two Airbus A330-800neos in late October, the first arrivals of an eight-aircraft order from the flag carrier. The jet can now be found flying on the Kuwait City-Dubai route exclusively, according to Flightradar 24 data, as Kuwait Airways and its flight crews become acquainted with Airbus' latest innovation.

Known as the ""entry-level wide-body,"" the A330-800neo is the smallest in the A330neo family. Its 2018 list price of $259.9 million makes it the second-cheapest wide-body aircraft in the Airbus lineup behind the jet's predecessor, the A330-200.

Airbus, however, had little reason to celebrate the aircraft's entry into service as the jet is proving to be a commercial flop. Only three airlines have publicly ordered the aircraft with Airbus failing to break even 20 orders, paling in comparison to the larger A330neo that's seen orders from the likes of Delta Air Lines and TAP Air Portugal.

Airbus launches line-fit Wireless IFE - PaxEx.Aero,"Tue, 08 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vcGF4ZXguYWVyby9haXJidXMtbGF1bmNoZXMtbGluZS1maXQtd2lyZWxlc3MtaWZlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The new Titan Airways A321LR includes Airbus’s Open Software Platform on board, with Bluebox Aviation Streaming IFC

The Airbus “Open Software Platform” (OSP) is now ready to fly. Conceived as a core part of the Airbus Connected Experience concept, the OSP uses Airbus-supplied hardware to facilitate networking on board, allowing airlines and suppliers to focus on the content and user experience while ensuring that the gear is fully integrated to the aircraft manufacturing process.

Titan Airways took delivery of the first aircraft fitted with the system in late October. The A321LR (G-XATW) includes Bluebox Wireless IFE software running on the OSP kit.

The OSP solution includes Airbus’ embedded servers, routers, Wi-Fi access points, and a software platform designed to be extensible and usable by existing IFE/C suppliers. A handful of players, including Bluebox Aviation Systems, Inflight Dublin, Collins Aviation, and Display Interactive, are already signed on to participate. Others are expected to join.

The hardware comes pre-certified by Airbus and, if chosen by the customer, installed at the factory as part of the aircraft final assembly. Having the system integrated into the aircraft build also means it no longer consumes valuable overhead bin space in the cabin.

Wireless IFE companies often competed on factors like battery life, device size, and the number of streaming clients supported in the cabin. With a common hardware platform in use all those considerations are wiped away leaving the end-user experience as the true differentiating factor.

It also reduces the friction associated with changing suppliers. Because OSP can run w-IFE systems from multiple suppliers an airline can switch out providers without changing any of the gear on board. Even compared to a small, portable box in the overhead bin this is an improvement.

Titan Airways is one of five launch customers for the offering.

Going forward, Airbus and its partners intend to extend the platform’s scope for IoT-based value-adding services as part of the Airbus Connected Experience –previously showcased as a mock-up demonstrator at APEX EXPO.

Familiarising students with the latest Airbus aircraft technology and maintenance procedures - Airbus,"Thu, 03 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIwLTEyLWZhbWlsaWFyaXNpbmctc3R1ZGVudHMtd2l0aC10aGUtbGF0ZXN0LWFpcmJ1cy1haXJjcmFmdC10ZWNobm9sb2d5LWFuZNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Success continues for the academic training solution ‘Airbus Competence Training (ACT) for Academy’, with the signature of two new agreements in Turkey and Singapore. These additional agreements demonstrate the role that Airbus, as a leading aircraft manufacturer, is playing in ensuring closer links between the academic world and the aviation industry.

Two more schools have joined the list of universities using the ACT for Academy in their curriculum. The seven universities which signed agreements in recent months include: the Indian Institute of Aeronautics (IIA) Group in India; WSU Tech, Broward College and Aviator College in the United States; CFAI Provence, an Industry Apprentice Training Centre in France, and most recently the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) in Singapore and the Atilim University in Turkey.

‘ACT for Academy’ is a maintenance training software solution under the Airbus’ Training Services that aims to familiarise students with the latest Airbus aircraft technology and maintenance procedures, in a classroom environment. The solution helps to prepare young aerospace students for a career in the aviation industry, equipping them with the necessary skills to meet their career challenges.

‘ACT for Academy’, which complements the basic aircraft training currently available in the curricula of ITE and Atilim University classes, is an operationally oriented, scenario-based tool focused on a ‘learning by doing’ approach. It includes:

3D virtual Airbus aircraft, including virtual cockpit, virtual engines and a walk-around trainer;

Scenario-driven exercises to perform typical aircraft systems’ maintenance tasks;

General familiarisation on Airbus aircraft courseware to present and explain the aircraft and its systems.

By working on real case scenarios, students not only gain first-hand knowledge and expertise, they also become more ‘operational ready’, hence more attractive for future employers.

These additional two agreements demonstrate how Airbus adapts to expand into tertiary education institutions and engage a wider population of future engineers and pilots.

“This partnership with Airbus reinforces our efforts to create industry-relevant and authentic learning experiences for our students. By enabling students to work on real-case scenarios, the ACT for Academy training solution allows them to gain first-hand knowledge and expertise of Airbus aircraft. More significantly, it equips them with ‘work-ready’ skills that are relevant to the changing demands of the aviation industry,” said Mr Suresh Natarajan, Principal, ITE College Central.

""We are one of the leading Universities in Turkey which uses this solution in Civil Aviation Education. It will make our graduates highly distinguished and mostly prefered among other Aircraft Maintenance technicians and engineers,"" said Nafiz Alemdaroğlu, Director, School of Civil Aviation, Atılım University."

Saab deploys private 5G network from Nokia at Airbus / Boeing factory in Sweden - RCR Wireless News,"Tue, 15 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJjcndpcmVsZXNzLmNvbS8yMDIwMTIxNS81Zy9zYWFiLWRlcGxveXMtcHJpdmF0ZS01Zy1uZXR3b3JrLWZyb20tbm9raWEtYXQtYWlyY3JhZnQtZmFjdG9yeS1pbi1zd2VkZW7SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Aerospace and defence company Saab has deployed a factory-wide private 5G network at a manufacturing plant in Sweden. The facility in Linköping, in the south of the country, produces ‘aerostructures’, notably for Airbus and Boeing.

The deployment has been organised by Swedish tech consultancy Combitech using 5G equipment from Finnish telecoms vendor Nokia. Combitech, based in Östersund, has had handled spectrum frequencies and project management, it said, including the relationship with Nokia. Local system integrator Vinnergi has been engaged to handle the network engineering itself.

The project is starting with LTE in the upper part of the 1.8 GHz band, which works for indoor coverage; it will migrate to 5G in the second quarter of 2021, according to Combitech, as the Swedish Post and Telecom Authority (PTS) releases spectrum for industrial usage, expected to be at 3.72-3.8 GHz (band N78).



Combitech commented: “Initially the network is [being] put into operation on LTE, but we will switch to 5G as soon as PTS releases the planned frequency space for private networks for Swedish industry and business. The plan for this is the second quarter of 2021; tools and other devices that are connected will need to support 5G.”

Seperately, 25MHz of the 2.6 GHz band in Sweden is sub-licensed to Edzcom, formerly Ukkoverkot, which is being deployed for industrial LTE betworks. Nokia has a close working relationship with Edzcom. Network operator Three is also renting out 50MHz of its 2.6 GHz frequency holding in Sweden in bid to boost local industry – and to stop regulator PTS carving-up the 3.5 GHz band for private usage.

Saab’s 5G setup, being used in the manufacturing of aircraft doors and wing structures for various companies in the space and defense industries, is billed as the first “full-scale” manufacturing plant to be equipped with private 5G in Sweden. The Linköping plant claims a reputation for “lean” and highly-automated manufacturing.

Combitech said the newly 5G-equipped production facility invites “more and more automated processes and self-driving vehicles”, and enables the facility to “collect large amounts of production data to analyze and automate” and track material flows, monitor machine usage, and run predictive and preventative maintenance. The need to retain manufacturing data on site was a key consideration for the deployment, it said.

The firm commented: “Security requirements are becoming increasingly important in a world where hacking and cyberattacks are on the rise. Data generated by IoT solutions in a facility [and] between people is a business-critical asset. The possibility of control and security are two crucial factors when industry and business choose private mobile networks, where you can keep all business data and hardware on-site.”

Magnus Bergström, head of Saab’s aerostructures business unit, said: “We are building the next generation of smart production systems. With a fully connected factory, we get the opportunity for a better working environment and a more efficient production.”

Per Åkesson, business area manager at Combitech, said: “Treating large amounts of data, from different devices, often in real time, requires a really fast, secure and stable mobile connection. With private mobile networks, Saab now gets a complete platform for a connected factory, which meets those requirements. It is only with your own mobile network that you can really take full advantage of the possibilities of digitalisation and realize Industry 4.0.”

Combitech works in the manufacturing industry, defence sector, and public sector. Vinnergi calls itself a “new-generation” technology consultant, geared towards “smarter”, and more “energy-efficient” and “efficient” industrial communication and infrastructure deployments. Nokia claims to have deployed 220 private LTE and 5G networks, with the lion’s share coming in the past 12 months.

Speaking to Enterprise IoT Insights in the latest episode in the new Private Wireless Podcast series, Stephane Dauble, head of marketing for enterprise solutions at Nokia, said: “Between 2015, when we started on this road, and the end of 2019, Nokia managed to secure around 120 customers for private wireless; that is 120 customers in four years while in 2020. In just nine months in 2020, we have almost doubled that number, to well over 220. It shows how fast things have moved in 2020.”

Saab sold its automotive business in 1990 to General Motors; it had jointly-owned the unit with commercial vehicle manufacturer Scania for two decades. General Motors took full control from private equity firm Investor AB in 2000, and sold the business to Dutchmanufacturer Spyker Cars in 2010. Saab continued with aerospace manufacturing in Sweden, retaining the right also to use the original griffin logo."

JetBlue Will Ring in the New Year with Its New Airbus A220-300 Aircraft - Business Wire,"Thu, 31 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc3dpcmUuY29tL25ld3MvaG9tZS8yMDIwMTIzMTAwNTIzNC9lbi9KZXRCbHVlLVdpbGwtUmluZy1pbi10aGUtTmV3LVllYXItd2l0aC1JdHMtTmV3LUFpcmJ1cy1BMjIwLTMwMC1BaXJjcmFmdNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--JetBlue (NASDAQ: JBLU) today announced it has formally taken delivery of its first Airbus A220-300 aircraft, marking the start of a new era for the airline's fleet. The aircraft – tail N3008J – is scheduled to arrive at JetBlue's home at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) this evening from Airbus's U.S. production facility in Mobile, Ala. It is the first delivery of 70 A220 aircraft JetBlue has on order, which will be phased in to ultimately replace the existing fleet of 60 Embraer 190 aircraft.

""The A220 is a next-generation aircraft our customers and crewmembers will love, featuring impressive range and superior economics to support critical financial and operating priorities along with new network planning flexibility,” said Robin Hayes, chief executive officer, JetBlue. ""And as we evolve our fleet for the future, the A220’s significant reduction in per-seat emissions supports our ongoing commitment to carbon neutrality for all our domestic flights, and moves us closer to achieving our pledge of net zero carbon emissions across all operations by 2040.”

The A220 boasts a nearly 30 percent lower direct operating cost per seat than the current E190. Lower seat costs come from both fuel and non-fuel savings. The A220 fleet will also help to further reset JetBlue's maintenance costs well into the decade. The airline anticipates the A220 fleet, with improved reliability and longer maintenance intervals, will have a maintenance cost per seat that is more than 40 percent lower than E190s.

With a range of up to 3,350 nautical miles and a 40 percent lower fuel burn per seat than JetBlue's E190 aircraft, the favorable economics open the door to new markets and routes that would have been unprofitable with JetBlue's existing fleet. The A220 covers a wide mix of new and existing market possibilities with excellent economics on short, medium and even potentially transcontinental markets. This will allow for better overall aircraft utilization and provide a competitive advantage for JetBlue in short haul markets.

""JetBlue has revolutionized air travel, and we at Airbus are proud that our 20-year relationship has played a role in the airline’s many successes,"" said C. Jeffrey Knittel, Chairman & CEO Airbus Americas, Inc. ""This first A220-300 delivery creates new route possibilities for JetBlue, and raises their passenger experience to even higher standards.""

The A220 is powered exclusively by Pratt & Whitney GTF engines, which deliver double-digit improvements in fuel and carbon emissions. Optimizing fuel burn is an important first step in JetBlue’s cost-conscious sustainability strategy, and prioritizing fuel-efficient aircraft and engines aligns with JetBlue’s approach to reducing emissions. Earlier this year, JetBlue became the first major U.S. airline to achieve carbon neutrality for all domestic flights, and later announced its plans to achieve net zero carbon emissions across all operations by 2040. The A220’s significant reduction in per-seat emissions will help JetBlue meet and maintain its sustainability commitments.

“This delivery marks another big milestone for JetBlue and Pratt & Whitney,” said Rick Deurloo, chief commercial officer and senior vice president at Pratt & Whitney. “We are honored that JetBlue has operated Pratt & Whitney-powered aircraft since the very beginning – and that JetBlue has selected GTF-powered aircraft for the airline’s next-generation fleets. We look forward to supporting JetBlue’s expansion and their commitment to sustainable aviation.”

The interior of JetBlue’s A220 will be as impressive as the operating capabilities of the aircraft. Customers will also enjoy an elevated inflight experience with wider seats, spacious overhead bins and extra-large windows. JetBlue’s fleet features the most legroom in coach (a) and free Fly-Fi®, the fastest broadband internet in the sky (b). JetBlue will reveal details of its custom-designed A220 cabin – featuring thoughtful, customer-friendly touches throughout – in January 2021.

JetBlue continues to navigate the new travel environment with a steady hand and a long-term view on recovery. The investment in the A220 allows the airline to continue to execute its low cost business model, and enables JetBlue to continue to offer low fares to more customers.

Alaska Airlines orders more Boeing 737 MAXs to replace most of its Airbus jets - Anchorage Daily News,"Tue, 22 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFkbi5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MtZWNvbm9teS8yMDIwLzEyLzIyL2FsYXNrYS1haXJsaW5lcy1vcmRlcnMtbW9yZS1ib2VpbmctNzM3LW1heHMtdG8tcmVwbGFjZS1tb3N0LW9mLWl0cy1haXJidXMtamV0cy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A Boeing 737 MAX-9, built for Alaska Airlines, undergoes testing as it flies past the Boeing factory in Everett Washington on March 23, 2020. (Mike Siegel/The Seattle Times/TNS)

SEATTLE — Alaska Airlines said Tuesday it has ordered another 23 Boeing 737 Maxes, bringing its total order to 68 Maxes that over the next three years will replace most of the Airbus aircraft in its fleet.

The financial terms Boeing offered would have been difficult to pass up. In an interview, Alaska Air Group chief executive Brad Tilden said the airline will have to pay no additional money for the 13 Maxes it will take next year.

“This does not actually require any capital spending during 2021,” he said.

That’s because Alaska had already paid significant pre-delivery deposits on its pending orders of Maxes before the plane was grounded in March 2019. Boeing has now restructured the terms with discounts to compensate the airline and encourage the follow-on order.

The cheap Boeing Maxes will replace all of Alaska’s 51 Airbus A320s and 10 smaller A319s, most of which are on expensive leases inherited from Alaska’s acquisition of Virgin America. And since the Maxes are 20% more fuel efficient and new jets should require less maintenance, Alaska expects to reap big operational cost savings.

“With each delivery, our ownership costs go down, our maintenance costs go down, our fuel costs go down, and the revenue should go up because the Max 9 has 28 more seats than the A320,” said Tilden. “The economics are going to be fantastic.”

For Boeing, such discounts on the Max provide compensation to its customers for months of delayed deliveries, without actually giving out cash. And the deals help build sales momentum to arrest this year’s collapse of the Max order backlog.

Alaska plans to have its first Max enter service in March, with five more by summer 2021 and another seven by year end.

The plan is to speed deliveries in 2022, with Alaska taking 30 Maxes, followed by another 13 in 2023 and 12 in 2024.

The total includes 13 it is leasing from Air Lease Corp. in a deal announced last month. The rest Alaska will purchase directly from Boeing.

Prior to the 2016 Virgin acquisition Alaska was an all-Boeing carrier, and the Max deal will bring it almost back to that by 2023.

Alaska said it will keep its 10 larger, longer-range Airbus A321neos. Those jets largely will be used to fly the more popular transcontinental routes due to their superior performance over Boeing’s 737 Max 10 model.

Alaska has already begun running its Airbus pilots through the retraining necessary to fly the Max. Each must complete about 80 hours of training.

The airline acquired about 900 pilots when it bought Virgin, about 830 of whom are still with the airline. Alaska Airlines has about 2,850 mainline jet pilots in total. Tilden said that by 2023, the number of Airbus pilots will be reduced to about 145, flying the A321neos.

Doubling down on the Max now illustrates Alaska’s contrarian strategy of investing in the midst of a historic air travel downturn so as to emerge stronger — “zigging while the others are zagging,” as Tilden put it.

He noted how Alaska expanded flights to the East Coast during the airline downturn that followed the 9/11 terrorist attacks and introduced flights to Hawaii during the global financial crisis of 2008.

Tilden said the airline’s relative strength in available cash, its low fares and its fleet of efficient single-aisle jets — with no exposure to the long-haul international market flown by the bigger widebody jets — will see it through the coronavirus crisis and leave it ready to grow once the pandemic ends, taking market share from carriers that are forced to shrink.

While the 68 Maxes on firm order are purely for replacing aircraft that will be retired, should air travel recover well and allow for growth, the agreement with Boeing also includes options to buy another 52 MaxS on good financial terms later.

Alaska has about 200 mainline jets in its fleet today, down from 237 before the pandemic. With the Maxes on firm order, it will go back up to about 230 mainline jets for the next four years. And if Alaska takes advantage of the Max purchase options, the fleet could grow to 300 aircraft by 2026.

In a statement, Boeing Commercial Airplanes chief Stan Deal said Alaska “is well positioned to return to its growth trajectory and strengthen its standing as one of the top U.S. airlines.”

Tilden said the terms of the deal also take account of the risk that the pandemic’s effects may be more prolonged.

“Boeing has been flexible in terms of the timing of payments and timing of deliveries should the recovery from the crisis not be what we expect,” he said.

“We are bullish. No airline would choose to play this hand we are playing right now,” Tilden said. “But if you have to play it, Alaska is probably better positioned than any other airline.”

Tilden added that as well as being good for Alaska, the deal will help Boeing emerge from the Max crisis, bolstering jobs and the region’s economy.

“We’re pleased to be standing side- by side with Boeing,” he said."
Qatar Airways A350 is the ultimate Airbus aircraft - Airline Ratings,"Tue, 01 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyYXRpbmdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL3FhdGFyLWFpcndheXMtYTM1MC11bHRpbWF0ZS1haXJidXMtYWlyY3JhZnQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Quite simply she is the best commercial aircraft flying today crammed with technology for the pilots and comfort plus for the passengers.

She is the Airbus A350 and Qatar Airways has the world’s largest fleet with 52, which has enabled the airline to fly through the pandemic carrying home to loved ones millions of stranded passengers.

Born as Airbus’s competitor to the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, the A350 has also become a dream machine with Qatar Airways being a major influence on the design

The A350 fits perfectly between the slightly smaller 787 and the larger 777-300ER and she is the ultimate Airbus aircraft that incorporates all the lessons of the last 50 years since Airbus was formed.

The extra width of the cabin and very large windows results in an outstanding cabin that has the widest seats for passengers in all cabins.

The A350 also has the quietest cabin of any twin-aisle aircraft that includes a draft-free air circulation system resulting in a low ambient cabin noise level for a more peaceful and healthier journey.

The A350 series is made of 53 percent composite material, which because of its much lower weight – but extra strength – allows for lower fuel consumption and carbon emissions per passenger.

The composite structure, combined with other design and engine technologies gives the A350 fuel consumption per passenger 25 percent lower than the aircraft it replaces.

That means 25 percent less CO2.

And Qatar Airways passengers can offset their CO2 emissions with the airline’s Carbon Offset Program.

Compared to the Airbus A380 the savings are even more dramatic with the giant super jumbo emitting 95 percent more CO2 per block hour than the A350 on some long-range routes such as Doha to Melbourne.

Commenting on the airline’s commitment to travelers and green aircraft Qatar Airways Group Chief Executive, His Excellency Mr. Akbar Al Baker, said: “As one of the only airlines to continue taking delivery of new aircraft at this time, our strategic investment in modern, fuel-efficient twin-engine aircraft has enabled us to continue flying taking over 2.3 million people home on more than 37,000 flights since the start of the pandemic.

“Due to COVID-19’s impact on travel demand, we will continue to fly greener and smarter by keeping our fleet of Airbus A380 grounded, as it is not commercially or environmentally justifiable to operate such a large aircraft in the current market.”

And the savings on the A350 don’t end there as the aircraft requires 40 percent less maintenance because it is made of composite material, titanium, and modern aluminum alloys and which result in an airframe that is corrosion and fatigue-free.

And passengers on the A350 arrive fatigue-free because of a combination of the composite fuselage and state-of-the-art HEPA filters.

The composite fuselage, with its much greater strength, means airlines can lower the cabin altitude from the typical 8000ft to 6000ft which eliminates mild altitude sickness which impacts a few passengers.

And because the fuselage doesn’t corrode the A350 a higher humidity level is possible eliminating that “dried out feeling.”

The HEPA filters, part of the A350’s air purification system, were developed to help eliminate airborne particulates such as dust, alcohol and perfume fumes, allergens, fungi, bacteria, and viruses from the air.

The result is an environment that is operating theatre clean.

The A350 comes in two models the -900 and -1000 and Qatar Airways has them both. Many of the A350-900s have 36 of the new award-winning Qsuites and 247 economy seats and in the larger -1000 model, all have 46 Qsuites and 281 economy seats.

From Australia, Qatar Airways flies the A350 from Melbourne, Adelaide, and Perth, and throughout its vast network that now extends to over 100 cities across the globe."
Airbus-built CSO-2 French military Earth observation satellite launched successfully - Airbus,"Tue, 29 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMC0xMi1haXJidXMtYnVpbHQtY3NvLTItZnJlbmNoLW1pbGl0YXJ5LWVhcnRoLW9ic2VydmF0aW9uLXNhdGVsbGl0ZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Second of three next generation very high resolution optical observation satellites

Kourou, 29 December 2020 – Airbus-built CSO-2 (Composante spatiale optique) Earth observation satellites for the French Armed Forces, has been successfully launched on a Soyuz launcher from the Kourou European Spaceport in French Guyana.

CSO-2 is the second of the three-satellite CSO constellation, which will provide extremely high resolution geo information intelligence to the French Armed Forces and to its partners in the frame of the MUSIS cooperation programme (Multinational Space-based Imaging System for surveillance, reconnaissance and observation). The CSO satellites are equipped with a very agile pointing system and are controlled via a secure ground control operations centre. The constellation will offer 3D and very high resolution imaging capability, in visible and infrared bandwidths, enabling acquisition during night and day and maximize the operational use.

The CSO-2 satellite, identical to CSO-1, will however be placed on a lower polar orbit at 480 km altitude, to fulfil the identification mission of the programme.

As prime contractor for the CSO satellites programme, Airbus has provided the agile platform and avionics, and was also responsible for the integration work, testing and delivery of the satellite to CNES. Thales Alenia Space provided Airbus with the very-high resolution optical instrument.

Airbus teams will also continue leading the User Ground Segment operations, as they do currently with operating legacy programmes (Helios, Pleiades, SarLupe, Cosmo-Skymed).

Airbus was awarded the CSO contract at the end of 2010, by CNES, the French space agency acting on behalf of the Armament General Directorate (DGA). The contract included an option for a third satellite, which was activated after Germany joined the programme in 2015.

“Thanks to our close partnership since the beginning of the French Space adventure with the French MoD, now including the Space command, CNES and DGA, as well as the tremendous support across industry and partners, especially Thales Alenia Space, we did it…again! Providing the most modern and efficient observation capability for the safety of our citizens, as well as the sovereignty and independence of France and Europe, CSO is a real game changer in terms of resolution, complexity, safety of transmission, reliability and availability: only a couple of nations can claim such a capability,” said Jean-Marc Nasr, Head of Airbus Space Systems.

The satellite's tremendous agility and stability enable it to quickly provide users with extremely high-quality images from the Thales Alenia Space instrument, even for the most complex acquisition schedules.

Airbus has built on the decades of experience innovations and success which led to Helios 1, Pleiades, and Helios 2, and also made use of the latest generation of gyroscopic actuators, fibre optic gyroscopes, on-board electronics and control software to optimise weight and inertia and significantly increase the pointing speed.

However, Airbus went after the 757 in order to secure its own position as the true middle-market narrow-body with the A321. And it finally did it in October 2020.

What was the Boeing 757, though? Was it just that: an aircraft with an unusually high thrust-to-weight ratio, capable of operating out of airports with shorter runways or those that were more affected by either cold or hot weather?

Boeing’s double wild bet

There is no doubt that the Boeing 757 was a one-of-a-kind aircraft at the start of its production run. On January 1, 1983, Eastern Air Lines introduced it into commercial service. A few months prior, in September 1982, the Boeing 767 entered service – the two aircraft, despite being single and twin-aisle, respectively, shared the same type rating upon entry. Boeing had done what Airbus always aimed to do, a family of different sized aircraft with pilots and other crew being able to transition between them easily.

“The 757 and the 767 were developed concurrently, so both shared the same technological advances in propulsion, aerodynamics, avionics and materials,” reads the historical description of the Flying Pencil by Boeing.

Though the sales of the narrow-body never truly kicked-off. While its wide-body brother cannot boast an impressive order book, at least it is still produced as a freighter. Ever since its pre-production design period, the 757 was a big question mark for Boeing.

“The design boys wanted a specific number. I said no: A number would imply we know what the hell we’re going to build and we don’t. So the 7X7 is whatever we’re going to do next,” Thornton Wilson, Boeing board chairman and chief executive stated in 1973.

The 7X7 turned out to be the 757. Together with Eastern Air Lines and British Airways, the first customers of the aircraft, it was finally launched in 1978.

But the decision to launch the two aircraft simultaneously was not because Boeing wanted the 757 and 767 to build a home, plant a tree and retire with grandchildren of their own.

“Frankly, our ability to forecast is so lousy that the only way you can survive is to cover all your bets,” the Seattle Times quoted Boeing vice president Kent Holtby.

The company wanted to cover its ground for decades to come, yet was hesitant to go all-in on one product. Its offering was not as diverse at the time – after all, it had just recently released the Boeing 747 into service, another wide-body jet. As fuel prices spiked, its path forward was only lit up by the fact that Boeing knew it had to build a twin-jet and avoid three or four engines.

At the wrong time?

Some criticized the company that the aircraft was not well-suited to their needs at the time.

The industry was not what it was back then. If 2019 was once again a record-breaking year in terms of passenger numbers, 1983 started with the fresh scars of the 1979 energy crisis and a subsequent recession. The world’s population was less globally connected as the Iron Curtain was still up. In general, the 1980s was a very different time for the aviation industry and the Boeing 757 could be the perfect example of that.

If in the 1980s and the 1990s the hub-and-spoke model was as relevant as ever, the late 2010s shifted that situation. Low-cost carriers, which ballooned in size in the beginning of the 21st century, showcased that point-to-point could also work and work very well. Legacy airlines faced a harsh reality that low-cost carriers were able to undermine them by simply cutting ticket prices, which consumers were more than happy to pay.

Slowly, more leisure travel focused-routes were introduced into legacy carrier’s systems. For example, American Airlines (A1G) (AAL) had plans to expand its international network in Summer 2020. In its announcement, the carrier announced its first route in Africa: Philadelphia to Casablanca, Morocco, with a Boeing 757. The seasonal route was supposed to start in June 2020, but we all know what happened next.

Delta Air Lines could also be used as an example of how relatively important the 757 still was.The Delta aircraft (registered N543US) sustained a very hard landing in the Portuguese islands of Azores in August 2019. Upon landing in João Paulo II Airport (PDL), excessive nose movements resulted in “damage on the primary fuselage structure with deformed frames, stringers and skin, as well as permanent nose landing gear axle deformation,” read a report by Portuguese aviation accident investigators (Gabinete de Prevenção e Investigação de Acidentes com Aeronaves (GPIAAF). The Boeing 757, delivered to Northwest Airlines in April 1996, was already 23 years old at the time. Surprisingly, the narrow-body returned to service in December 2019 to serve within the Atlanta-based carrier’s network.

Yet United Airlines could be highlighted as the most prominent example of how the Boeing 757 was simply built at the wrong time. In December 2019, the airline announced an order for 50 new Airbus A321XLR aircraft which will enable United Airlines “to begin replacing and retiring its existing fleet of Boeing 757-200.”

“The new Airbus A321XLR aircraft is an ideal one-for-one replacement for the older, less-efficient aircraft currently operating between some of the most vital cities in our intercontinental network,” stated United Airlines executive vice president and chief commercial officer (CCO) Andrew Nocella. The company expected the aircraft to arrive in 2024, allowing the airline to explore routes in Europe from its East Coast hubs, namely Newark and Washington.

Perfect time for the Airbus A321?

Seemingly, the A321XLR fits the former 757 operators’ needs like a glove. In order to truly take the position of the Boeing 757, Airbus and the A321 family of aircraft had to come a long way. It made its final and undisputed claim in October 2020, when a new derivative entered service.

After Airbus introduced its A320 family, its next move was to stretch the aircraft by almost seven meters, improve the wingspan by four square meters and modify the wing itself. The new variant was dubbed the A321. While the A320 remained the most popular variant of the current engine option (ceo) offering, the rules of the game changed when Airbus introduced the new engine option (neo). Much like with the Boeing 757, the first iteration of the Airbus narrow-body came out at a very different era of aviation.

The A321ceo was an underperformer compared to the 757. Airbus order numbers also showcase that the A321 was the less popular variant in the family. The A319ceo, A320ceo and A321ceo amassed a total of 1,486, 4,770 and 1,791 orders, respectively.

With the new engine on the narrow-body, the demand shifted towards larger aircraft. The A319neo became the unwanted child with only 84 total orders, while airlines signed up for 3,916 and 3,450 A320neo and A321neo aircraft, respectively, according to Airbus Orders and Deliveries data as of September 30, 2020. The newly introduced A321XLR, with an even bigger range than the A321neoLR (long-range), one-ups the 757 even more. More than the Boeing narrow-body, the Airbus product is a point-to-point connection facilitator that allows airlines to operate thin routes that are further away with much lower operating costs. At the end of the day, the A321neo is equipped with technology that is much younger than the 757’s, including state-of-the-art engines that are much more fuel-efficient.

Yet the A321, whether the ceo or the neo, could not take on the Boeing 757 in one area – cargo. The Seattle-built narrow-body has been also delivered as a freighter starting from 1987, and passenger-to-freighter conversions began in 2001. In February 2018, the situation began to shift towards Airbus narrow-body.

Taking on the freighter market and the Boeing 757

But the A321 conversion program was a long time coming. The European manufacturer announced the program during the Paris Air Show 2015, for both the A320 and the A321.

During Singapore Airshow in February 2018, Elbe Flugzeugwerke (EFW), a joint venture between Airbus and ST Aerospace, announced that it finally secured a launch contract with Vallair Solutions Sàrl (Vallair) for the Airbus A321 passenger-to-freighter (P2F) conversion. EFW would initially convert 10 A321s and deliver them to the Luxembourg-based aviation asset management company.

“When we were developing the A320P2F program, if we had gone to the competition of it, it would have been the most wonderful, the most beautiful the most performing P2F program that you could ever imagine,” now-former Airbus chief operating officer Tom Williams stated during the Paris Air Show 2015. According to him, the manufacturer came to the conclusion that it “overdesigned the solution.”

“At the time, and I am talking about five years ago, the residual values of the A320s were really running against us in terms of finding enough feedstock,” said Williams.

Another thing has shifted – while Airbus was primarily the driver behind the first attempt at a P2F conversion program, now the Singapore-based ST Aerospace was the leading partner. Nevertheless, Airbus provided access to the second-hand market, and provided help on the technical side, added Williams.

“It is really important for us to have a good P2F program because it really helps us in terms of selling new aircraft and managing residual values.”

Andreas Sperl, the current president and chief executive officer of EFW and former chief financial officer (CFO) at Airbus, added that the “A321 we will also take market share from the segment of 30 to 40 tons, which is currently dominated by the Boeing 757.”

“The Airbus A321P2F is an ideal candidate to replace the aging 757 freighters,” said Sperl.

The Toulouse-designed narrow-body has another advantage – the feedstock for freighter conversions is almost 700 units larger than the 757. Boeing concluded the deliveries of the Flying Pencil with 1,050 units delivered, while Airbus has delivered 1,760 units of the A321ceo so far. Theoretically, airlines are still able to order more – but it is unlikely that the theory will materialize into practice, considering the fact that the A321neo is widely available at the moment.

A321 freighter sees light of day

The culmination of the program came on October 27, 2020. On the day, the first Airbus A321P2F entered service with Qantas Freight, delivering packages and mail on behalf of Australia Post.

The conversion began when one A321 (registered D-ANJA at the time) was shipped to ST Aerospace facilities in Singapore in November 2018. It was finished in early-October 2020 and began its journey to Qantas on the 14th.

Now registered as VH-ULD, the aircraft so far has flown back and forth between Melbourne Airport (MEL) and Brisbane Airport (BNE), Australia, flightradar24.com data shows. The consortium is hopeful that the market will remain hot – not only to replace aging aircraft but to also cater to the growing freight market that has remained intact, unlike its passenger market counterpart. So much so, that ST Aerospace plans to increase the rate of conversions from nine to 23 per year. The company plans to supplement conversion facilities in Dresden, Germany and Singapore with its ST Engineering Aerospace Guangzhou Aviation Services in China and VT Mobile Aerospace Engineering in Mobile, Alabama sites.

“We recognize a strong and growing interest from the market,” in a statement to AeroTime News stated an EFW representative. The company’s conversion slots are fully booked until mid-2022 and EFW is “in different levels of contract discussions, including Memorandums of Understanding (MoU) and Letters of Intent (LoI)” for further orders, the media spokesperson added.

“An update to our order numbers should come in Q1 2021,” the EFW representative wrote.

The Singapore-led joint venture has sprawled competition. Precision Aircraft Solutions and Air Transport Services Group (ATSG) joined forces to launch its own conversion program of the A321 aircraft in August 2017. SmartLynx, a Latvia-based Aircraft, Crew, Maintenance, and Insurance (ACMI) company used the increasing competition to initially order two units from both conversion programs. The two A321P2Fs will be operated by SmartLynx Malta. The airline plans to add additional eight aircraft to its freight operations by 2023.

Boeing 757 staying alive?

But the Boeing 757 is still jamming to Bee Gees’ tune Stayin’ Alive. On October 7, 2020, Icelandair announced that it sold three 757s to an unidentified customer to convert them into freighters. The Icelandic flag carrier received $21 million, a sum that is between $2 and 3 million above book value, according to its press release.

Two of the sold 757s were manufactured in 1994, while the third was rolled out of the factory in 2000, stated Icelandair. As the airline aims to phase out its Flying Pencils, more feedstock could be released into the conversion market – yet again, the fact that Boeing completed the production of the Boeing 757 in 2005 comes back to haunt it. Airbus, as of September 30, 2020, still has 31 A321ceo aircraft in its backlog and potentially even more if an (unlikely) order is to happen, which would facilitate more cargo conversions further down the road.

After all, one of the consequences of the current crisis is the fact that aircraft across the board, especially older airframes, have lost value. Subsequently, more conversions can happen, as the economics of converting an aircraft makes even more sense than previously."

The A350: Two Models

The A350 comes in two models, the 900 and the 1000. The 1000 model is longer than the 900 — but length is difficult to gauge unless you're comparing them side by side. Like the Boeing 777, the A350-1000 features three sets of two wheels on the main landing gear. In contrast, the A350-900 has only two sets of two wheels, like the Dreamliner. That's the easiest way to spot the difference between the 900 and the 1000.

The Boeing 787 Dreamliner comes in three different models, the -8, -9 and -10. The difference between the aircraft is simply the length, with the 787-10 being 38 feet longer than the 787-8. The easiest way to tell the difference? The Boeing 787-10 has more windows between the wing and the cockpit than the 787-8 or -9.

The Wingtips

The easiest way to spot the A350 in the wild? Their beautiful, stark upward-curving wingtips. From the side profile, you can tell they are upward curving, but the curve looks subtle. Head-on, however, they have a very distinctive curvature. In this way, they almost create an optical illusion: all of a sudden — wham — and that wingtip has a sharp curve upwards. The point, of course, is to reduce wingtip vortices.

In contrast, the Boeing 787 has raked wingtips. Boeing designed a wing so aerodynamically efficient that the added weight of winglets or wingtips would outweigh the fuel savings from reducing vortices. Still, the Boeing 787 wing is unique, particularly when gazing out at it from inside the airplane, or from head-on. They seem to trail upwards and backwards just so.

The Nose

The nose of the Dreamliner is very modern looking, and makes a sleek upward curve to the fuselage. It looks like an airplane version of a bullet train. In contrast, the A350 is less sharp; indeed, it is ""derived from the A380,"" Airbus says, and even underwent a nose job during the design phase to increase the radius near the top of the fuselage.

The Cockpit Windows

A Boeing 787 Dreamliner shot for Boeing.

From the front, count the windows. The Boeing 787 is unique among wide-bodied aircraft; it has only four sleek cockpit windows, an innovation from Boeing in terms of weight reduction.

Not to be outdone, when the A350 was released, Airbus' marketing materials showed a sleekly curved cockpit window that looked like a single piece of glass — something designed but never implemented in the actual aircraft. In reality, six windows form a ""frowning brow,"" or a squiggly letter ""m,"" and the windows themselves are surrounded by a black border. To match the marketing materials, Leeham News says that Airbus surrounded the cockpit windows with a painted black border. Leeham also speculates that because the windows are changed from the outside, the black border helps prevents dings to the aircraft livery. This border is referred to as its ""raccoon eyes.""

And it's becoming an Airbus identifier. The A320neo and A330neo also have raccoon eyes. As more of these aircraft come online, the cockpit windows will help you determine whether the aircraft is an Airbus or a Boeing, but not between variants such as the A350 and A330 in particular, which look similar in this regard.

In a word, the cockpit windows on the A350 are badass.

The Engine Nacelle

A close-up view of the engine and landing gear of Boeing's 787 Dreamliner aircraft.

The Boeing 787 sports the GEnx engine, and the nacelle has a sawtooth pattern on the rear portion, called chevrons. The point is to reduce noise and eliminate excess sound insulation. Other than the raked wings themselves, this is the easiest way to spot a Boeing 787 in the wild.

The Name is On The Dreamliner

At the back of the fuselage, the word Dreamliner is printed prominently. I wish other Boeing aircraft would do the same. It seems like an easy marketing exercise for Boeing, but the airlines also want to control the look and feel of their own livery, and likely do not want to blatantly advertise for their makers.

Keeping Eurofighter at the leading edge of combat aircraft technology - Airbus,"Thu, 10 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDIwLTEyLWtlZXBpbmctZXVyb2ZpZ2h0ZXItYXQtdGhlLWxlYWRpbmctZWRnZS1vZi1jb21iYXQtYWlyY3JhZnQtdGVjaG5vbG9nedIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"With more than 500 Eurofighters delivered to date and 500,000-plus flight hours logged worldwide, this swing-role combat aircraft’s future is brighter than ever – backed by a slate of new-generation enhancements currently under development and planned in the years to come.

Production of the twin-engine jet fighter is assured at least until 2030 based on orders booked to date, including the German Air Force’s recently-announced contract for an additional 38 aircraft, which are to be equipped with the world's latest electronic radar, future-proof hardware and software, and unlimited multi-role capability to engage both air and ground targets.

Additionally, a Eurofighter order is expected from Spain, while the aircraft has been proposed for procurements in Switzerland, Finland, Poland and Canada.

“Eurofighter will remain at the forefront of our customers’ fleets for decades to come.”

Kurt Rossner, Airbus Head of Combat Aircraft Systems and Chairman of the Eurofighter GmbH Supervisory Board

Ongoing upgrades include the integration of additional weapons system capabilities – as achieved on Royal Air Force Eurofighters for the UK, and under implementation for the German Air Force. This includes stepping up from a mechanically-scanned radar to a more modern electronically-scanned (E-Scan) sensor. E-Scan adds an advanced antenna to provide an unrivalled field of radar coverage, along with multi-target tracking, improved missile guidance and more.

Other planned enhancements will involve an adapted avionics structure, including the latest state-of-the-art hardware and software to keep Eurofighter at the leading edge of combat aircraft technology. In parallel, this development stream will be used in risk reduction for the Next Generation Weapon System, providing a bridge for Europe’s Future Combat Air System (FCAS), and placing Eurofighter as one of its main components.

“Eurofighter is about to enter its next era and will remain at the forefront of our customers’ fleets for decades to come,” explained Kurt Rossner, Airbus Head of Combat Aircraft Systems and Chairman of the Eurofighter GmbH Supervisory Board.

A mission-proven solution from Europe

Eurofighter is based on the collaboration of four European nations and capabilities of their aerospace/defence industries: Germany, Spain, the UK and Italy. Airbus, which has the largest stake in the Eurofighter industrial grouping, produces aircraft at its facilities in Germany and Spain.

Dirk Hoke, the CEO of Airbus Defence and Space, said the Eurofighter’s latest Tranche 4 version – which is the configuration recently contracted by Germany – will have a service life well beyond 2060, and the aircraft’s technical capabilities will allow its full integration into the European Future Combat Air System.

A total of nine countries have ordered Eurofighters to date: Germany (currently the largest customer), the UK, Spain, Italy, Austria, Oman, Qatar Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia. The aircraft has proven its capabilities during military operations in Libya, Iraq and Syria – demonstrating high reliability in challenging climates and conditions."
"China’s commercial jet aspirations overblown, US think tank finds - South China Morning Post","Thu, 10 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL2Vjb25vbXkvY2hpbmEtZWNvbm9teS9hcnRpY2xlLzMxMTMyMDkvY2hpbmFzLWNvbW1lcmNpYWwtcGxhbmUtYXNwaXJhdGlvbnMtYXJlLW92ZXJibG93bi1hbmQtbm_SAXNodHRwczovL2FtcC5zY21wLmNvbS9lY29ub215L2NoaW5hLWVjb25vbXkvYXJ0aWNsZS8zMTEzMjA5L2NoaW5hcy1jb21tZXJjaWFsLXBsYW5lLWFzcGlyYXRpb25zLWFyZS1vdmVyYmxvd24tYW5kLW5v?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The findings were the result of more than two years of research, including a field visit to the Comac factory in Shanghai, said Kennedy, who is also the trustee chair in Chinese business and economics at the think tank. The research results, in the form of a video and blog, were published on Monday. This followed a Reuters report late last month saying that the US Department of Commerce had drafted a list of 89 Chinese and 28 Russian companies, including Comac , that the United States determined were “military end-users” – a designation that means US suppliers must request a licence to sell products to them.

“Comac has received massive state funding and global attention, but it is not in the same league as the world’s top commercial aircraft manufacturers – Boeing, Airbus, Embraer and Bombardier,” Kennedy said in a note published on Monday. Comac is not even as capable as its Russian counterparts, including Ilyushin, Sukhoi, and Tupolev, which have more advanced technology but have still struggled commercially, he noted.

While Beijing has pumped at least US$45 billion into the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac) to make commercial planes, including the C919 passenger jet, the odds that China can make the project a success “are between slim and none”, said Scott Kennedy, a senior adviser at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies who is responsible for the research.

Beijing’s plan to make its own commercial aircraft to break up the duopoly of Boeing and Airbus remains a costly pipe dream, according to a Washington-based think tank.

It could be devastating for China’s C919, as the plane relies on imports of a number of crucial parts, from its engines to its flight-control systems, so access to US suppliers such as General Electric (GE), Honeywell International and Rockwell Collins is vital for future deliveries of the new model, which is expected to take place in 2021.

On China’s commercial aviation industry, Kennedy said: “I’ve examined a lot of industries in China, and this is definitely the most pathetic sector I’ve ever encountered.” And he went on to call Comac “a true dumpster fire of an organisation”.

Kennedy also said it is “misleading to call the C919 a Chinese plane, because almost all of its components, including everything that keeps the plane aloft, are imported”.

Comac did not respond to faxed questions on the status of the C919 and potential US sanctions.

The C919 has yet to receive certification from the country’s aviation regulator, the Civil Aviation Administration of China.

At the same time, since Comac appears to be an overblown story, it does not seem in line with US interests to punish it, based on Kennedy’s findings.

“Not only is the C919 not a serious commercial threat to the [Boeing] 737 or [Airbus] A320, its development is not substantially aiding China’s military,” Kennedy said.

Sanctions on Comac would be “counterproductive” because China could retaliate by not buying from US companies such as Boeing, while speeding up self-reliance and moving away from the current aerospace technology hierarchy led by the US and Europe, Kennedy added.

Earlier this year, Washington was weighing whether to deny GE’s latest licence request to provide the CFM LEAP-1C engine for the narrow-body Comac jet, which is expected to go into service next year.

But the US government eventually approved the licence for the jet engine sale after President Donald Trump said that the US should not prevent companies from supplying jet engines and other components to China.

Boeing last month raised its rolling forecast for China’s aircraft demand to 8,600 new planes through 2039, up from its previous estimate of 8,090, given the damage that the coronavirus pandemic has had on the global aviation market.

“While Covid-19 has severely impacted every passenger market worldwide, China’s fundamental growth drivers remain resilient and robust,” said Richard Wynne, managing director in charge of China marketing at Boeing Commercial Airplanes."
Emirates and Airbus A380: no love at first sight - AeroTime,"Mon, 07 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm90aW1lLmFlcm8vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjY2MDktZW1pcmF0ZXMtYWlyYnVzLWEzODAtaGlzdG9yedIBSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm90aW1lLmFlcm8vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjY2MDktZW1pcmF0ZXMtYWlyYnVzLWEzODAtaGlzdG9yeS9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"While Emirates has become synonymous with the Airbus A380 and is, despite the current unfavorable circumstances, optimistic about the aircraft’s future, the relationship was not as rosy as it might appear at first sight. While the story has developed into a beautiful marriage, whereupon the A380 has become a beautiful, white swan to Emirates, others have rejected it to be an ugly duckling as the current crisis raged on.

“A very serious issue“

In events that shocked nobody, the Airbus A380 program ran into delays. And delays meant trouble for operators that planned to have the aircraft by a certain time, as expansion plans were drawn up beforehand.

The Dubai airline was no exception. When the European manufacturer announced more delays to the deliveries of the aircraft in October 2006, Emirates’ own President Tim Clark had enough.

“This is a very serious issue for Emirates and the company is now reviewing all its options,” Clark stated at the time. The executive argued that the delivery delays would slow down the airline’s ambitious plans. Upon the initial order of the double-decker, it expected to receive them in September 2006, a month prior to Clark’s comments.

“If there is a further delay, as our first delivery is now set for August 2008, there may be cancellations down the line,” Clark reiterated his point in mid-October 2006. “I hope Airbus puts their house in order,” he affirmed, as Emirates had “invested a lot in ground facilities so we have to stick with the order for now.” Furthermore, the A380 was in a league of its own regarding its capacity and with ambitious growth plans, as at that point, there was nothing that came close to the double-decker, added Clark.

Unfortunate crisis and fat shaming

The aircraft finally reached Dubai upon delivery in July 2008, when A6-EDA arrived in the United Arab Emirates city. Yet it had a problem and it was shamed for it.

“We have not yet engaged with Airbus as regards not only the delay but the fact that it is overweight,” Clark commented on the situation in late-October 2006. While hindsight is always 20/20, that was a huge problem at the time – the 2008 financial crisis was oncoming, and with it, a huge spike in oil prices. Steadily rising since the early-2000s, they peaked in July 2008 at $147 per barrel. Flying such a behemoth with four engines, coupled with a sharp increase in fuel costs, became a costly affair. Fuel-related expenses spiked for Emirates, as it outlined in its FY2008 financial report that fuel comprised 36.2% of its operating costs, an increase of 18.8% compared to FY2007.

“In the financial year 2008/09, the group met these awesome challenges with determination, improved efficiency and fresh, market-leading initiatives,” commented on the year’s results chairman and chief executive of Emirates Ahmed bin Saeed Al-Maktoum in May 2009.

Slimming down the A380, amidst the rapid surge in fuel prices, was “immense pressure,” Tom Williams, a now-retired executive of Airbus, stated in July 2008. All in all, the manufacturer wanted to trim as much as three tons off the weight of the Super Jumbo in order to improve the overall package of the A380.

Nevertheless, Emirates always knew that they had found a jewel.

“The Emirates A380 double-decker launched a new era, evoking the leisurely travel of cruise ships, with a Shower Spa in First Class, the first-ever for a commercial airline and a spacious onboard Lounge for premium passengers,” Clark added to Al-Maktoum’s comments of May 2009.

Even with the announced weight issues in October 2006, the British executive remarked that the aircraft “will still be a hugely potent profit generator for us,” and that the A380 would remain an integral part of the airline’s future.

Running its course

While it has so far remained an integral part of the airline’s fleet, much like every relationship between an aircraft and an airline, it slowly has begun to run its course.

The Airbus A380 might have its advantages, but it also has its fair share of downsides. The high operating and acquisition costs, relative inflexibility in terms of where it can be deployed to remain profitable make for a bad combination in a world where one must remain flexible in order to weather the crisis. After all, Emirates paused its Super Jumbo operations for four months between March and July 2020, as simply put there were not enough passengers to employ the A380. In addition, the double-decker can hold up to 88 cubic meters of cargo in its belly, while the Boeing 777-300ER – up to 125 cubic meters. Cargo was a major driver of revenue throughout the crisis.

“The revenue we’re getting from cargo is substantial. Not only it allows us to cover our operating costs, but it also allows us to make profits,” said Tim Clark.

Throughout the 2010s, Emirates pushed hard for Airbus to introduce a stretched or a re-engined variant of the Super Jumbo.

Alas, it never materialized. The A380 had run its course even before the current crisis began. On the saddest Valentine’s Day to #AvGeeks in 2019, the manufacturer and the airline agreed to reshuffle the latter’s order book, reduce the total order for the A380 from 162 to 123 aircraft and instead, take up 40 Airbus A330-900neo and 30 Airbus A350-900 aircraft.

Still, Clark remains optimistic. Despite the current downturn, and the lackluster demand for international travel, Emirates expects to fly its whole fleet of A380s by 2022, the same year their last delivery is now scheduled to take place.

“My own view, and it’s always an optimistic view, is by end of next calendar year or the first quarter of 2022 we’ll have all our A380s flying.”"
Hydrogen-powered Airbus ZEROe to feature 'pods' - Asia Times,"Wed, 16 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vYXNpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS8yMDIwLzEyL2h5ZHJvZ2VuLXBvd2VyZWQtYWlyYnVzLXplcm9lLXRvLWZlYXR1cmUtcG9kcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Aerospace giant Airbus is one step closer to developing an eco-friendly hydrogen-powered concept aircraft with the release of its new, innovative ZEROe design.

Airbus engineers have devised a new configuration that consists of six eight-bladed “pods” mounted beneath the aircraft wing, AINonline reported.

One of several configurations under consideration as part of Airbus’s ongoing R&D, the design features a series of standalone propulsion systems based on hydrogen fuel cell technology.

Studies now center on determining to what extent the pod configuration, among others, could apply to large commercial aircraft, AINonline reported.

“The pod configuration is essentially a distributed fuel cell propulsion system that delivers thrust to the aircraft via six propulsors arranged along the wing,” explained Matthieu Thomas, ZEROe aircraft lead architect.

“Hydrogen fuel cells have very different design considerations, so we knew we had to come up with a unique approach.”

The pod’s eight-bladed propellers, made of composite materials, are shaped to provide added thrust during the takeoff and climb-out phases of flight for the ZEROe. The advanced airfoil design is expected to lead to improved efficiency and performance. Credit: Airbus.

Smaller experimental hydrogen aircraft, carrying up to 20 seats, can rely on a traditional fixed-wing configuration with two propellers. But more passenger capacity and longer range require another solution, AINonline reported.

The pod configuration represents one possible way to create enough scale to power larger aircraft.

Each pod would consist of a propeller, electric motors, fuel cells, power electronics, a liquid hydrogen tank, a cooling system, and a set of auxiliary equipment. The design uses hydrogen and air supplied to the fuel cells to generate electric current.

Power electronics convert the current to power the electric motors, which, in turn, rotate the motor shaft and turn the propeller, AINonline reported.

Airbus calls the pod configuration’s removable fixtures a “striking feature” that allows disassembly and reassembly in “record time,” allowing for rapid maintenance and, potentially, hydrogen refueling at airports.

Airbus plans to publish a patent application for the pod configuration by the end of the year, 18 months after its initial submission.

The company said that it expects to submit several more patent applications over the coming months and years as R&D continues on the ZEROe program. Airbus plans to render a final decision on which configuration it launches first in 2025."

Airbus AI Introduces Natural Language QA System for Flight Crews - Synced,"Tue, 01 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vc3luY2VkcmV2aWV3LmNvbS8yMDIwLzEyLzAxL2FpcmJ1cy1haS1pbnRyb2R1Y2VzLW5hdHVyYWwtbGFuZ3VhZ2UtcWEtc3lzdGVtLWZvci1mbGlnaHQtY3Jld3Mv0gFpaHR0cHM6Ly9zeW5jZWRyZXZpZXcuY29tLzIwMjAvMTIvMDEvYWlyYnVzLWFpLWludHJvZHVjZXMtbmF0dXJhbC1sYW5ndWFnZS1xYS1zeXN0ZW0tZm9yLWZsaWdodC1jcmV3cy9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus AI researchers have developed a system that uses natural language understanding to improve question answering (QA) performance when flight crews search for aircraft operating information.



The aerospace industry relies on technical documents such as Aircraft Operating Manuals (AOM), Aircraft Operating Instructions and particularly Flight Crew Operating Manuals (FCOM) to guide flight crews on aircraft operations under normal, abnormal, and emergency conditions. FCOMs are issued by aircraft manufacturers and cover system descriptions, procedures, techniques, and performance data. They are the references used to develop standard operating procedures to improve safety and efficiency.



Most government aviation administrations have authorized the use of tablet computers by commercial carrier pilots and flight crews to access FCOM information. The Airbus AI researchers note however that existing electronic flight bag (EFB) systems used for this purpose are in practice little more than pdf viewers with keyword search functionality. The new Smart Librarian (SL) system instead uses natural language understanding and interactive search to boost QA performance on FCOMs.

Airbus AI’s SL FCOM QA system has three main components: a dialogue engine, a retriever (search engine), and a QA module.

The system uses the natural language-based, open-source Rasa framework as its dialogue engine, enabling it to recognize high-level user utterances, predict the next best action, and identify users’ questions based on dialogue state. The retriever system was built under a classic QA system architecture, with an overall documents filter function designed to source answers within a limited timeframe. The retriever also leverages the probabilistic relevance framework BM25 as an indexing scheme to enhance performance.



With the dialogue engine and retriever filter search system in place, the researchers’ next challenge was triggering the QA modules to give a correct and final answer in natural language. To do this, they leveraged large Google BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) models, a DrQA model, a multi-task Learning approach and an XGBoost.

In interactive user experiments, the SL system outperformed the EFB’s FCOM keyword search functionality, finding answers with higher accuracy and in less time either with or without the inclusion of keywords in the queries.

The Airbus AI team identifies future areas for improvement to the SL system as increasing the amount of in-domain data to enable further fine-tuning of the QA engine, as well as improving the system’s ability to extract answers from FCOM tables.

Single Air Greenland A330-800 gives Airbus first long-haul order in months - Flightglobal,"Fri, 18 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYWlybGluZXMvc2luZ2xlLWFpci1ncmVlbmxhbmQtYTMzMC04MDAtZ2l2ZXMtYWlyYnVzLWZpcnN0LWxvbmctaGF1bC1vcmRlci1pbi1tb250aHMvMTQxNjc3LmFydGljbGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Air Greeland has formally placed its order for a single Airbus A330-800, nearly a year after disclosing it had selected the twinjet to replace its A330-200.

The carrier will receive the aircraft in time to ensure long-haul continuity between Greenland and Denmark from the end of 2022.

Chief executive Jacob Nitter Sorensen says the aircraft is a “fundamental part” of its fleet, and the A330-800 will be the “perfect fit” for the service.

“We’re pleased to see Air Greenland renew its confidence in the A330 family,” adds Airbus chief commercial officer Christian Scherer.

Air Greenland’s current A330 is a 1998 airframe, registered OY-GRN, powered by Pratt & Whitney PW4000 engines.

Modernisation to the A330neo will involve a change of engine supplier as the new aircraft is exclusively fitted with Rolls-Royce Trent 7000s.

Airbus has experienced a rough year for long-haul aircraft business. The agreement is its first for a widebody since the end of March.

It had not secured any A330 orders for 2020 by the end of November. While it had listed orders for 21 A350s – from Air France, Air Lease, and an undisclosed customer – the cancellation of previous agreements for 22 A330s and A350s left the manufacturer with a widebody net order deficit."

Weighing approximately 300 kg. each, these satellites will be launched together as co-passengers on a single flight and deployed into polar orbit at an altitude of 500 km. The mission is scheduled for 2023 from the Guiana Space Center, Europe’s Spaceport in French Guiana, using a Vega C launch vehicle.

The CO3D constellation is comprised of four identical satellites, built on an all-electric platform developed by Airbus. As a result of the CNES and Airbus partnership, CO3D will deliver stereoscopic images of the Earth at a resolution of 50 cm, with a high revisit rate. This data will be fed into an Airbus digital processing system, which will integrate advanced algorithms from CNES to quickly produce ultra-precise 3D maps of our planet’s surface.

Vega is the new-generation, highly versatile member of Arianespace’s launcher family, alongside the heavy-lift Ariane 5 and medium-lift Soyuz, deployed from the Guiana Space Center. Vega is a European Space Agency (ESA) program, with Colleferro, Italy-based, Avio as the industrial prime contractor.

The performance and versatility of Vega allows Arianespace to provide the best possible launch solutions in LEO for small- and medium-size payloads, spanning a wide range of applications (EO, science, education, defense).

With Vega C, Arianespace will offer increased performance and volume under the payload fairing for its passengers. The inaugural launch of Vega C is scheduled for 2021.

Following the signature of this contract, Stéphane Israël said, “With several months to go before the first Vega C launch, this new-generation European light-lift launcher has reaffirmed its ability to meet users’ innovative needs in low orbit, especially with the ability to carry multiple payloads – benefitting from the improved performance. For Arianespace, this is a further sign of the renewed confidence in the Vega system by our long-time partners of Airbus and CNES.”"
