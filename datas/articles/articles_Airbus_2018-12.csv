MADRID, Dec. 4, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) and Airbus have signed an agreement to jointly explore opportunities to meet the growing demand for aerial refueling for U.S. defense customers.

The companies will seek to provide aerial-refueling services to address any identified capacity shortfall and to meet requirements for the next generation of tankers capable of operating in the challenging environments of future battlespace.

""Reliable and modernized aerial refueling is an essential capability for our customers to maintain their global reach and strategic advantage,"" said Lockheed Martin Chairman, President and CEO Marillyn Hewson. ""By combining the innovation and expertise of Airbus and Lockheed Martin, we will be well-positioned to provide the United States Air Force with the advanced refueling solutions needed to meet 21st century security challenges.""

""The U.S. Air Force deserves the best aerial-refueling technology and performance available under the sun and this great industry team, Lockheed Martin and Airbus, will offer exactly that,"" said Tom Enders, Airbus CEO.

The companies are taking a cooperative approach, with the Airbus A330 Multi Role Tanker Transport (A330 MRTT) at its heart, to examine a broad spectrum of opportunities. These may range from ways to support critical near-term air-refueling needs, such as a fee-for-service structure to conceptualizing the tanker of the future.

Airbus Defence and Space Head of Military Aircraft Fernando Alonso said, ""The A330 MRTT has been selected by a dozen nations around the world. It is extensively proven in live operations and has been repeatedly praised by major air forces. We are convinced that the combination of Airbus' tanker expertise with Lockheed Martin's extensive U.S. presence, has the potential to provide highly effective solutions for current and future U.S. military aerial refueling requirements.""

Lockheed Martin has a long and successful history of systems integration, manufacturing and maintenance, repair and overhaul operations with large airlift and tanker aircraft. When combined with Airbus expertise in this competitive space, the two companies will field a strong team to address future air refueling needs.

""Airbus is an industry leader in the aerial refueling area, and Lockheed Martin is known for cutting-edge defensive technologies and capabilities,"" said Michele Evans, executive vice president, Lockheed Martin Aeronautics. ""This is a great opportunity for our two companies to combine our expertise – cooperating to develop world-class solutions for critical needs around the world.""

Lockheed-Airbus venture ups the pressure on Boeing to deliver its US Air Force tankers - Defense News,"Wed, 05 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZWZlbnNlbmV3cy5jb20vYWlyLzIwMTgvMTIvMDUvbG9ja2hlZWQtYWlyYnVzLXZlbnR1cmUtdXBzLXRoZS1wcmVzc3VyZS1vbi1ib2VpbmctdG8tZGVsaXZlci1pdHMtdXMtYWlyLWZvcmNlLXRhbmtlcnMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"WASHINGTON and COLOGNE, Germany — Lockheed Martin and Airbus have agreed to develop a new aerial-refueling service aimed at the U.S. Air Force, upping the pressure on incumbent Boeing to deliver its KC-46 tankers on time.

The two companies, industry behemoths on each side of the Atlantic, hailed the pact for combining Airbus’s A330 Multi-Role Tanker Transport (MRTT) plane with Lockheed Martin’s systems-integration expertise and “presence” on the U.S. defense market. In essence, the joint venture could provide Airbus with another bite at the massive Air Force air-tanking apple after rival Boeing won the bid to build a fleet of new aircraft in 2011.

“The companies are taking a cooperative approach, with the Airbus A330 Multi Role Tanker Transport (A330 MRTT) at its heart, to examine a broad spectrum of opportunities,” reads a Dec. 4 joint Lockheed-Airbus statement. “These may range from ways to support critical near-term air-refueling needs, such as a fee-for-service structure to conceptualizing the tanker of the future.”

RELATED

The partnership comes as the Air Force is eager to get more tanking assets to meet the demands of the new U.S. National Defense Strategy. In September, the service announced that it will need at least 14 additional tanker squadrons by 2030.

The Air Force plans to buy 179 KC-46 tankers from Boeing so that it can begin phasing out older models, but the company has missed key delivery dates multiple times — most recently this October. And even after Boeing begins delivering planes at a steady clip, there may be a requirement for more than a hundred new tankers beyond the KC-46 program of record.

One thing to watch will be whether the Air Force is amenable to the proposed fee-for-service model involving planes from outside its own fleet.

On one hand, the service has gotten more comfortable in paying companies for flying hours used to help accomplish critical missions where there is an aircraft shortfall, said Doug Birkey, executive director of the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies. One example is the forthcoming deals with private companies to provide aircraft and pilots posing as enemies during air-battle drills, which are anticipated to be awarded next year.

But on the other hand, “in the scheme of acquisition and the Department of Defense, the KC-46 is really not doing that bad at all,” Birkey said.

RELATED

Richard Aboulafia, a defense analyst with the Teal Group, argued the Airbus-Lockheed agreement makes a lot of sense.

However, it comes with two huge questions: Who pays for the planes that are used to fly missions for the U.S. Air Force, and what kind of a contract is the Lockheed-Airbus team expecting?

“Airbus and Lockheed [could] team up to take that risk. Lockheed is not famous for taking commercial risks. Quite the opposite,” Aboulafia said.

Another confusing note is the companies’ stated desire to begin “conceptualizing the tanker of the future,” according to the news release. Lockheed and Airbus have different core competencies — Airbus as a massive producer of commercial airliners able to divert that technology to low-risk solutions, and Lockheed as a developer of cutting-edge, military-specific aircraft, Aboulafia said.

If the Air Force’s future tanker is a “stealthy, high-tech military aircraft, then Lockheed certainly doesn’t need Airbus,” he said. If the partnership is to build the KC-Y, another airliner-based tanker to follow the KC-46, Airbus has a lot of technology to bring to the table, “but I’m not sure what’s in it for Lockheed.”

Three airlines are first users of new Airbus/NAVBLUE technology for landing safety - Airbus,"Wed, 12 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDE4LTEyLXRocmVlLWFpcmxpbmVzLWFyZS1maXJzdC11c2Vycy1vZi1uZXctYWlyYnVzbmF2Ymx1ZS10ZWNobm9sb2d5LWZvci1sYW5kaW5n0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Nordic-based carriers will introduce the Braking Action Computation Function (BACF) on A320 Family aircraft

A new functionality for Airbus jetliners literally turns an aircraft into a moving sensor during landing – providing real-time data on potentially challenging or dangerous runway conditions created by rain, snow or freezing water.

Developed through a project of Airbus and its NAVBLUE subsidiary for airline operations software, this technology enables pilots to more accurately evaluate the braking action the aircraft experienced during landing.

Called the Braking Action Computation Function (BACF), it highlights Airbus and NAVBLUE’s commitment to safety and accident prevention. This technology helps address the biggest category of accidents, which are so-called “runway excursions,” when an aircraft departs the runway. Runway excursions often occur when the runway is contaminated, particularly with standing water, snow and/or ice – which is where BACF is expected to help.

First BACF adopters: Finnair, SAS and Novair

In time to meet cold winter conditions, a trio of Nordic airlines – Finnair, Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) and Novair – are the first to sign up for the full BACF solution. This facilitates a controlled entry-into-service on their Airbus single-aisle A320 Family jetliners, enabling the build-up of experience before the system’s wider roll-out in 2019.

“It’s great that our first customers are those with some of the most challenging winter conditions,” said Eric Le Roux, the BACF Project Leader at Airbus. “It’s going to be very exciting to work with Finnair, SAS, Novair and their airports to see how they adapt their operations using this technology.”

The BACF functionality uses data from an aircraft’s deceleration during landing, comparing this information against different reference runway conditions. Additionally, using GPS information from the aircraft navigation systems, it is possible to identify which section of the runway the aircraft is on when a runway state is identified.

More users = better data on runway conditions

This information is displayed on the cockpit’s Multifunction Control & Display Unit (MCDU), enabling pilots to radio their inputs to air traffic controllers, to be shared with the crew of incoming planes landing at the airport. The calculated BACF data also is sent automatically by digital link to NAVBLUE, which collects and displays the results on its RunwaySense web application. The RunwaySense technological approach is similar to mobile apps that allow drivers to see and avoid traffic jams.

Users of RunwaySense are expected to include airports, airlines’ operational centres, and air traffic controllers, enabling them to view runway condition information across an entire airport or on individual runways. By sharing reports in real-time, the applications’ users will better understand how runway conditions are trending, and airports can anticipate and mitigate slippery conditions. As additional aircraft participate in data sharing, the better the real-time mapping of conditions becomes.

As Logan Jones, NAVBLUE’s runway safety specialist, explained: “With BACF, each aircraft is supplying a piece of the puzzle, and the RunwaySense platform we’ve built allows airports to see the picture come together. The more aircraft that send reports, the better the map of conditions becomes, and the easier it is for airports to know when to take action to mitigate slippery conditions.”

Access to BACF for airlines, airport and air traffic controllers

Airlines that contribute to BACF will have basic access to the RunwaySense web platform to visualise and track all the reports sent by their aircraft; they also can choose to receive additional information about flight conditions at key airports across their route network. For airport and ATC users, access to RunwaySense will be possible through a paid subscription.

RunwaySense continues Airbus and NAVBLUE’s ongoing commitment to improving safety by exploiting the capabilities of the latest technologies, including its recent development of the Runway Overrun Prevention System (ROPS) which alerts pilots when the runway length could be exceeded while landing."
OPINION: Lockheed pact fuels Airbus tanker ambitions | Opinion | Flight Global - Flightglobal,"Fri, 07 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vb3Bpbmlvbi9vcGluaW9uLWxvY2toZWVkLXBhY3QtZnVlbHMtYWlyYnVzLXRhbmtlci1hbWJpdGlvbnMvMTMwNTg0LmFydGljbGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Tradition states that after tasting the disappointment of defeat, one should try and try again.

For Airbus, a more than decade-old ambition to provide one of the US Air Force’s most critical frontline capabilities is for the third time prompting it to step forward to promote the A330 multi-role tanker/transport (MRTT).

Lockheed Martin

But this time it is different. Rather than partnering with a local prime contractor lacking sector experience – as it did with Northrop Grumman for the KC-30 bid briefly selected by the USAF in 2008 – or going it alone, as it did with a follow-on KC-45 attempt led by EADS North America, the European giant has teamed with a true airlift heavyweight in Lockheed Martin.

An Airbus/Lockheed collaboration should be of real concern to Boeing, and their announcement’s timing – shortly after their rival’s 767-based KC-46A missed its latest target for a long-delayed first delivery to the USAF – can have been no coincidence.

It should not be overlooked that the A330 MRTT also faced significant technical problems and lengthy schedule delays before becoming an operational success with the air forces of Australia, Saudi Arabia, the UK and the United Arab Emirates. First deliveries to France, Singapore and South Korea during 2018 have added to that already impressive customer list, but a successful campaign for the USAF would truly elevate the product in terms of units sold.

While his tenure as Airbus chief executive will come to an end in 2019, Tom Enders will be among those keenest to see an A330 MRTT eventually rise in USAF markings. Convinced by the quality of its design, the company was hit hard by its two losses in the KC-X battle. Speaking between the contest decisions in June 2010, he said: “We know we have the better aircraft, and the USAF knows we have the better aircraft.”

It is now up to Boeing to prove the capability of its long-troubled KC-46A: handing over a first example as planned before the end of 2018 will be a small but important first step towards regaining its customer’s faith in the product.

Despite its lofty position as the world’s number one aerospace company, Boeing already knew it would face stiff competition from second-placed Airbus when the USAF replaces the rest of its aged KC-135 fleet and larger KC-10s. By joining forces with third-ranked Lockheed, its European rival – which already has a growing commercial footprint on home soil – is now fully fuelled for a potential boom in sales.

How 3D printers are transforming flying - CNN,"Fri, 14 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAxOC8xMi8xNC90ZWNoLzNkLXByaW50ZXItcGxhbmUtYWlyYnVzL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAT9odHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi8yMDE4LzEyLzE0L3RlY2gvM2QtcHJpbnRlci1wbGFuZS1haXJidXM?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"London CNN Business —

The next time you hop on a plane, there’s a good chance some of its parts will have been made using a printer.

The world’s top aerospace firms are increasing their use of 3D printers in order to speed up the manufacturing process, save money and make aircraft that burn less fuel.

3D printers could help Boeing (BA) and Airbus (EADSF) to reduce their massive order backlogs. But they’re also capable of producing parts that are superior to those made using traditional methods.

“The technology allows us to manufacture parts of a complexity that was just not achievable by means of standard cutting,” Grazia Vittadini, Airbus’ chief technology officer, told CNN.

The first Airbus plane to use a part made with a 3D printer took off in 2014. The component was a small titanium bracket, part of the pylon used to hold the aircraft’s heavy engine in place.

Now the technology is a vital tool for aircraft manufacturers that are racing to meet skyrocketing demand for new planes.

How to print in 3D

3D printers deposit material layer by layer to create a solid object. Plastic is the most commonly used material, but printing with titanium, stainless steel, ceramics and sand is becoming more popular.

Also known as “additive manufacturing,” the technology is used across industries to make prototypes, personalized items and small batches of products that would otherwise require molds or specialist machines.

For aircraft manufacturers and their suppliers, 3D printing helps reduce the need for expensive tools and casts.

“Casts and molds have to be manufactured very much in advance and they are not always modifiable,” said Vittadini. “You invest a lot of time and money into tools, which then you may need to redo from scratch.”

Part of an overhead storage compartment made with a 3D printer. airbus

Boeing has so far used 3D printing to make 60,000 parts for its planes. That’s a tiny percentage (a typical Boeing 747 has 6 million parts), but the US rival to Airbus is investing heavily in the technology.

“Additive manufacturing offers great potential to reduce the cost and weight of aircraft structures,” the company said in a statement.

Boeing invested in 3D printing company Digital Alloy in August, saying the move will allow it to produce metal aerospace parts more quickly and at a higher volume.

Airbus has partnered with Materialise, a 3D printing company headquartered in Belgium.

Speeding up production

The International Air Transport Association is expecting the number of passengers to double over the next two decades to 8.2 billion in 2037.

That means a lot more planes need to be built — a challenge that 3D printing can help with.

“We have growing production rates and we have learned a lot of lessons,” said Vittadini. Airbus struggled this year with engine shortages which slowed deliveries of its narrow-body A320neo.

Airbus had an order backlog of 7,337 aircraft at the end of November, or nine years worth of production at current rates. Boeing’s commercial aircraft backlog was 5,849 at the end of September.

Reducing emissions

The use of lighter materials made possible by 3D printing should also help the environment.

“Every 15 years, the worldwide fleet doubles — that is a fantastic business case,” Vittadini said. “The problem: twice as many emissions, twice as much noise, twice as much carbon fuel consumption … this is just not sustainable.”

You invest a lot of time and money into tools, which then you may need to redo from scratch.” Grazia Vittadini, chief technology officer, Airbus

The case for reduced emissions is simple: Lighter aircraft burn less fuel.

“We can go up to 55% weight saving, thanks to the fact that we can really just put material where we need it,” said Vittadini.

Is it safe?

Some experts worry that hackers could sabotage 3D printers and intentionally insert flaws that weaken parts.

A group of academic researchers demonstrated the danger in a 2016 experiment in which they crashed a drone by hacking a 3D printer and introducing a flaw into its propeller.

Both Boeing and Airbus say they will only use 3D printers in ways that have been certified as safe by regulators."
Airbus Looks to Pounce As Boeing Struggles to Deliver First Tanker - Defense One,"Tue, 04 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VvbmUuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMTgvMTIvYWlyYnVzLWxvb2tzLXBvdW5jZS1ib2Vpbmctc3RydWdnbGVzLWRlbGl2ZXItZmlyc3QtdGFua2VyLzE1MzI2My_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus is teaming up with Lockheed Martin to pitch a new refueling aircraft to the Pentagon, looking to pounce as Boeing struggles to deliver its KC-46 to the Air Force.

The new partnership between Europe’s largest aerospace company and the world’s largest defense firm are early shots in what could become another bitter battle to build tankers.

“The companies will seek to provide aerial-refuelling services to address any identified capacity shortfall and to meet requirements for the next generation of tankers capable of operating in the challenging environments of the future battlespace,” Airbus and Lockheed said in a joint statement Tuesday.

In September, the Air Force said it needed 14 more tanker squadrons to meet the requirements of the National Defense Strategy, which calls for a force able to defeat Russia or China. While the Air Force has not said how many planes that would take, industry officials believe it could amount to at least 140 new aircraft.

Airbus and Lockheed officials say their pitch is largely focusing on this new requirement and the hundreds of planes that the Air Force plans to buy after Boeing delivers a planned 179 KC-46 tankers — suggesting that it is not an attempt to persuade service officials to curtail those plans.

Boeing officials view it the same way, a person familiar with the situation said.

Airbus and Lockheed are pitching the A330 tanker — the same aircraft that lost to Boeing’s KC-46 in 2011.

“The companies are taking a cooperative approach, with the Airbus A330 Multi Role Tanker Transport (A330 MRTT) at its heart, to examine a broad spectrum of opportunities,” the Airbus-Lockheed statement said. “These may range from ways to support critical near-term air-refueling needs, such as a fee-for-service structure to conceptualizing the tanker of the future.”

The Air Force flies about 400 Eisenhower-era KC-135 Stratotankers and 59 of the larger KC-10 Extender tankers. The KC-46 is supposed to replace about half of the KC-135s, while an effort called KC-Y is supposed to replace the remaining Stratotankers.

Boeing was supposed to deliver 18 KC-46 tankers last year. Thanks to numerous development problems, it has delivered none, and has not said when it will start. Asked if Boeing would deliver the first tanker by year’s end, Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson said, “We will work through with Boeing to get the equipment that works.”

The KC-46 still has “a couple major deficiencies,” Wilson said Nov. 15 at the Defense One Summit.

She mentioned a problem with the plane’s remote vision system, the cameras that allow the refueling boom operator to see other aircraft arriving to take on fuel. There is also a problem with the boom itself, which sometimes does not disconnect as designed when bent by the plane it’s refueling.

These problems others have led to Boeing eating more than $3 billion on the project. The Air Force signed a fixed-price contract for the planes, meaning the firm must pay for any overruns.

“We are completely focused on delivering KC-46 to the Air Force,” Todd Blecher, a Boeing spokesman, said in an emailed statement. “The KC-46 will be the backbone of global mobility for generations to come. It offers multi-role capabilities the likes of which the Air Force hasn’t ever had in its tanker fleet and can’t get anywhere else.”

The Air Force has placed orders for 52 KC-46 tankers from Boeing. More than a dozen have been completed, but they remained parked at Boeing’s facilities at Everett, Washington, and elsewhere. Japan has also ordered one KC-46, to expand its fleet of four 767-based tankers.

The Air Force has been trying to replace the KC-135 for nearly 20 years. In the early 2000s, it planned to lease 100 tankers, based on its popular 767 airliner. That fell apart when it was revealed that former Air Force acquisition chief Darleen Druyun cooked deals for Boeing, helping the firm win billions of dollars in Pentagon deals and landing herself an executive position with the company. She pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges in 2004 and was sentenced to nine months in prison.

A few years later, the Air Force held a competition for new tankers. Airbus teamed up with Northrop Grumman to enter its A330 against a Boeing 767 derivative. The Air Force selected the Airbus-Northrop plane in in February 2008, but that award was negated after the Government Accountability Office sustained a Boeing protest.

Three years later, the Air Force finally finally chose Boeing’s KC-46 over Airbus’ A330 — in a contest in which the European firm did not use an American partner.

Since then, Boeing has yet to deliver a KC-46, while Airbus has received 60 orders from foreign government for its A330. Airbus tankers flown by U.S. allies have refueled American coalition aircraft striking Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria since 2014."
I Toured Delta's Brand New Airbus A220 — Here's What to Expect - The Points Guy,"Sat, 01 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9ndWlkZS9kZWx0YS1haXJidXMtYTIyMC10b3VyLXdoZXJlLXRvLXNpdC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"If you're just now learning of the A220-100, here's the skinny: it was designed to fly routes presently run by Delta Connection carriers — routes like Boston (BOS) to New York (LGA), Dallas (DFW) to New York (LGA) and Houston (IAH) to Detroit (DTW). The A220-100 is a workhorse, replacing other aging workhorses like the CRJ700/CRJ900 and Embraer E-175. In other words, it'll be on plenty of routes, as Delta already has a firm order for 75 units in place.

Delta's very first Airbus A220, designated N101DU, at its Atlanta headquarters.

Delta took the standard Airbus plans for the interior and largely tossed them aside. Instead of the 135 possible seats, there are 109 in a more spacious 2-3 configuration. And rather than perpetuating the race to the bottom when it comes to economy seat pitch and width, Delta installed the widest Main Cabin seats in its entire fleet. Instead of forcing you to bring your own entertainment, there are 10.1-inch IFE screens in coach and 13.3-inch panels in first class. I'll be onboard two A220 flights on its first day of passenger service, Jan. 31, 2019, to bring you a comprehensive review.

In the meantime, I was granted access to tour Delta's very first A220 aircraft while tucked away in its Atlanta headquarters — an impressive facility I toured a few months prior. This is ship N101DU, delivered to Delta just a few weeks back. Let's take a look around, shall we?

Cockpit

Two things grabbed my attention when making my way to the captain's chair. The first was ""SO. MANY. SCREENS!"" Comparing this to an MD-88, for example, was hilarious. So many switches and knobs had been replaced with displays. There was even a grip with a trackball to navigate software libraries.

The second was the view. Especially for a narrow-body plane, pilots of the A220 will be blessed with outrageous views from the generous windows installed. One could easily imagine the joy a pilot would experience gazing down on the Grand Canyon from the massive window to his or her left.

Beyond the seats reserved for the captain and first officer, there was a nifty slide-out jump seat that blocks entry into the cockpit when in use.

First Class

There were a dozen first class seats on Delta's A220, with three rows configured as 2-2. I was greeted with a C Series welcome as soon as I stepped onboard — a move I expect more plane manufacturers to make in a bid to make AvGeeks of us all. (C Series is the name the Airbus A220 had before Airbus bought the product line from Canada's Bombardier. The CS100 became the A220-100, and the CS300 is now the A200-300.)

Of course, I'd prefer a fourth row of first class seats, as the 12:109 ratio lags behind the 12:76 ratio on the CRJ900 and Embraer E-175. Those on the hunt for a complimentary Medallion upgrade will find them harder to come by on this aircraft than the regional jets it will replace given the larger overall passenger count vying for said upgrades.

The A220 will have roughly the same upgrade chances as the 110-seat Boeing 717, but better chances than the 124-seat Boeing 737-700.

Each seat was 20.5 inches wide, which is exactly the same width as first class seats on Delta's 737-700 and half an inch wider than those found on the Boeing 717, CRJ900 and Embraer E-175.

Unlike Comfort+ and Main Cabin, first class seats were graced with padded black armrests on both sides, which were quite supple.

Each seat had access to a 110v power port and USB ports (fixed to the IFE display). Row 1, the bulkhead row, had its power ports neatly tucked just beneath the inner armrest. A very nice touch.

The aisle armrest had a new switch that lowered it entirely flush with the bottom seat cushion. Delta reckons that larger passengers who want a bit more breathing room will opt for these seats.

Below the inner armrest was a fabulous storage nook. More storage is never a bad thing. There was plenty of room here for a binder, paperwork, a few magazines and phone or tablet. My only concern here was that objects would be left behind. I'm pretty well used to shuffling through the seatback pocket for my belongings prior to deplaning, but I'd need to form a new memory muscle to also check beneath my inner armrest. The inner armrest flipped vertically for easier access to the storage beneath.

The outer armrest (the larger of the two) was home to a double-flip tray table. As proof of Delta's attention to detail, there was no more ""fish for the hook and pull up.""

Instead, there was a pull tab that gently pushed the tray table upward for easy grabbing. In what would become a theme for this plane's interior, it's the little things that add up, and triggering that table was quite satisfying.

Even the recline button had been modernized. Rather than a nondescript round button, there was a clearly labeled toggle that was, in my opinion, located in a far superior place compared to most other planes.

The windows were positively enormous, and each first class row was well positioned for window sitters to get a great view of the world below.

Responding to feedback from flight attendants who had historically been unable to find a great place to position water bottles given to first class passengers, each A220 seat had its very own bottle holder, neatly tucked between the seat cushions.

The overhead featured the usual twist-to-close air vent, but the reading light was a hyper-bright LED. The flight attendant call button left no question about its purpose.

The overhead bins were gigantic — again, responding to society's increasing adoration of mondo carry-on bags — and were supported on the way down with a soft-open mechanism.

Legroom wasn't an issue, the seatback pocket stretched way back (enough to cram a large Yeti in there) and there was even a bit of storage just beneath the IFE display.

Comfort+

There were 15 total seats in Comfort+, Delta's ""in between"" seat product. These seats were identical to economy seats in terms of width and layout, but offered a few more inches of legroom as well as complimentary alcohol and upgraded snacks.

Seats were arranged in a 2-3 layout, with the A/B port side having a slightly shallower overhead bin than the C/D/E starboard side. Each seat was 18.6 inches wide, which is the widest economy seat on any Delta plane. Believe me, you could feel it. Comfort+ was a perfectly fine place to hang out on the A220, especially on the 2-2 side. Those coming from the 17.3-inch seats found on the Boeing 737 and 757 won't believe how roomy these feel.

Row 10, the first row of Comfort+, was a mixed bag. I personally loved this row, as there was no hard bulkhead divider between the last row of first class and the first row of Comfort+.

This translated into an almost comical amount of legroom, yet there was still underseat storage to be had to slide a purse or backpack underneath the last row of first class.

The downsides to Row 10? Fixed armrest dividers, which couples and families may not dig, as well as IFE screens that flipped up from between the armrest on a pivoting arm.

In my opinion, the pros outweighed the cons on Row 10, and I'd recommend booking this row if you love legroom and place a high value on not being reclined into. Yes, you'd need to stow your IFE screen for takeoff and landing, but it was the same sized unit (10.1 inches) as found elsewhere in Comfort+ and the Main Cabin.

Another nifty part about the bulkhead row? There was a built-in monitor in the top corner, near the air vents and reading lights, where safety videos played for those in Row 10.

There was no memory foam here, as we're eagerly awaiting on Delta's A330-900neo, but padding was robust, all things considered. The armrests were plastic, however, and gently arced so I couldn't keep my elbow there for too terribly long.

Each seat had access to an underseat power port (which, frankly, wasn't super easy to find when the row was full) and a standard USB charging port beneath the IFE panel. Windows were the same size as those in first: huge.

Main Cabin

Standard economy seating began at Row 13, terminating at Row 28 on the port side and Row 29 on the starboard side. The 2-3 configuration continued all the way back, save for the exit row.

From front to back, each Comfort+ and Main Cabin seat had a comparably massive 10.1-inch IFE display. Each panel had a USB charging port and a standard 3.5mm headphone jack (which are vanishing from new smartphones, so time will tell how that plays out).

Main Cabin windows were delightful, and the seatback pockets were very expandable. Great for stuffing water bottles and knicknacks.

Legroom was a bit tight in economy, as you'd expect, but the roomy 18.6 inches of width definitely helped ease the claustrophobia.

Let's touch on the exit row. Row 15 was unique, as it was the only non-first class row with a 2-2 configuration. These seats did indeed have added legroom compared to other economy seats, but passengers would have to deal with a hard armrest divider. Unlike Row 10, however, Row 15 had seatback IFE screens rather than articulating arm screens.

Seat 16E will also be highly coveted. It was the window seat on the starboard side just behind the exit row, which meant there was no seat in front.

That gave this passenger several feet of unobstructed legroom.

I appreciated that the required emergency gear, which is stored in the bulkhead row of first class far too often, was repositioned to the very last overhead bin — above Row 29. If ever you've been upgraded to a bulkhead seat in first class, you'll understand the emotion. You're stoked that you've been moved to first, but you're distraught that you probably won't have any room for your bags. Folks who have been there will dig this move very much.

Main Cabin overhead bins were just as large as those up front, which was a welcome change from regional jets that have smaller/larger bins in first/economy.

Seats on the port side end at Row 28, though room was left for these passengers to recline (and sans guilt from encroaching, no less).

Inflight Entertainment (IFE) and Wi-Fi

As airlines such as American and Alaska scale back or rip out seatback entertainment screens to save on weight, costs and maintenance headaches, Delta Air Lines is doing exactly the opposite.

On the A220, first class passengers were treated to 13.3-inch touch panels, while the rest of the aircraft was outfitted with 10.1-inch units. Each screen had a standard USB charging port and a 3.5mm headphone jack.

Given that ship N101DU was still two months out from flying paying passengers, the final software wasn't loaded. So, what you see here was just a snippet on what you can expect. While games and movies were loaded, screens like audio and maps would be ready by Jan. 31, 2019.

In my tour, all touch functions were snappy and playback was crisp. What will have to wait for the full review, however, was the secret sauce underneath. In September of 2017, Delta touted a ""modular in-flight entertainment (IFE) system for its upcoming C-Series aircraft deliveries.""

At first blush, nothing looked radically different about the IFE units I saw on the A220, but clearly something was different. Delta representatives weren't ready to divulge any new details, but one could expect a deeper understanding by the time passenger flights began.

Given that this aircraft was in a TechOps hangar, the Gogo 2Ku Wi-Fi wasn't active. Suffice to say, business travelers would have plenty of bandwidth to look forward to if current 2Ku performance on other aircraft could be used as a baseline.

Lavatories

The A220 was equipped with three lavatories. One was reserved for first class customers and was also home to the one and only changing table. It was also wheelchair accessible.

Believe it or not, the FAA still requires that new commercial jets have a cigarette disposal bin on lavatory doors. At the forward lavatory, there was one on the inside and one on the exterior. Bizarre on every level. That said, the door handle was pretty suave.

Two bathrooms were located in the aft, with the port side lavatory being the one that a passenger would most likely consider taking a selfie in. That was because it was home to a window. Not just a port hole; a full-sized, genuine, bona fide window.

As a huge fan of natural light, this quirky inclusion went a long way toward making that lavatory feel bigger than it was. I could actually catch an excellent view of the wing from the throne.

The forward lavatory and the windowed lavatory were both surprisingly roomy. The starboard aft lavatory was a tighter fit, but still serviceable.

All three did a solid job of using the curvature of the aircraft to their advantage, and mood lighting was a welcome touch.

Given that this bird hadn't spent too much time in the sky, she was gleaming in the hangar.

There would be no doubt as to which airline is operating N101DU, as planespotters would see the Delta name and logo painted on its belly.

If you were watching it pull it up to your gate from the terminal, you'd see CS100 underneath the nose cone — a nod to its original moniker.

Powered by Pratt & Whitney's latest geared turbofan PW1500G engine, the A220 took advantage of advanced technology and composite materials designed to ""deliver an expected 20 percent improvement in fuel efficiency over similar-sized aircraft when it enters service with Delta.""

Up close and personal with the power plant.

Overall Impression

This was not a typical airplane. In fact, almost nothing about the Airbus A220 was conventional. Even its name had a backstory, as evidenced by the ""CS100"" emblazoned beneath the nose cone and ""C SERIES"" imprinted in the entryway — both reminders that this project began as the Bombardier C Series. It's rare that we're made giddy by a new narrow-body plane, but Delta's spin on the A220 gives those who aren't planning any far-flung adventures on the A350 or retrofitted 777 a chance to still fly in something special.

While I'd prefer a few more first class seats, it was difficult to categorize this as anything other than a passenger win given the aircraft it would replace on medium-haul routes. Wide economy seats, IFE screens throughout, Gogo's speediest satellite-based Wi-Fi, LED lighting, a bathroom with a window in it, enlarged overhead bins, a 2-3 coach seating configuration, water bottle holders and even more visibility for the captain and first officer. All were very good things, indeed.

I look forward to flying two legs on opening day between New York (LGA) and Dallas (DFW), where I'll get a better feel for service, meals, Wi-Fi performance and overall comfort when the aircraft is loaded with other passengers.

European aircraft manufacturer Airbus said Wednesday that an investigation had found improper settings to have been one factor behind the deadly 2017 crash of a German military helicopter in a UN operation in Mali.

Two German UN peacekeepers were killed in July 2017 when their Tiger helicopter crashed as they were monitoring fighting in northern Mali.

UN sources in the area quickly ruled out it was shot down, and the German Army has since been looking into the reasons for the crash.

""This investigation, carried out by the Bundeswehr with the support of Airbus Helicopters, has ruled out any design issue with the Tiger helicopter,"" Airbus said in a statement.

""Airbus Helicopters has taken note that an improper setting of the helicopter controls was identified by the investigation as one of the factors in the chain of events which have led to this catastrophic outcome,"" it added.

Airbus said precautionary measures have been implemented to prevent any reoccurrence.

Due to pending proceedings in the case, Airbus said it would refrain from any further comment.

The new helos, enabled with anti-submarine warfare (ASW) and search-and-rescue (SAR) capabilities, are designed to replace the Polish Navy’s Kaman SH-2G Super Seasprite copters, according to First Deputy Defence Minister Wojciech Skurkiewicz. Local observers have also said the new helos could replace the Navy’s Soviet-designed Mil Mi-14 copters.

The companies will seek to provide aerial-refuelling services to address any identified capacity shortfall and to meet requirements for the next generation of tankers capable of operating in the challenging environments of the future battlespace.

“Reliable and modernized aerial refuelling is an essential capability for our customers to maintain their global reach and strategic advantage,” said Lockheed Martin Chairman, President and CEO Marillyn Hewson. “By combining the innovation and expertise of Airbus and Lockheed Martin, we will be well positioned to provide the United States Air Force and allies around the world with the advanced refuelling solutions needed to meet 21st century security challenges.”

“The US Air Force deserves the best aerial-refuelling technology and performance available under the sun and this great industry team, Lockheed Martin and Airbus, will offer exactly that,” said Tom Enders, Airbus CEO.

The companies are taking a cooperative approach, with the Airbus A330 Multi Role Tanker Transport (A330 MRTT) at its heart, to examine a broad spectrum of opportunities. These may range from ways to support critical near-term air-refuelling needs, such as a fee-for-service structure to conceptualizing the tanker of the future.

Airbus Defence and Space Head of Military Aircraft Fernando Alonso said: “The A330 MRTT has been selected by a dozen nations around the world. It is extensively proven in live operations and has been repeatedly praised by major air forces. We are convinced that the combination of Airbus’ tanker expertise with Lockheed Martin’s extensive US presence, has the potential to provide highly effective solutions for current and future US military aerial-refuelling requirements.”

Lockheed Martin has a long and successful history of systems integration, manufacturing and MRO operations with large airlift and tanker aircraft. When combined with Airbus’ expertise, the two companies will field a strong team to address future air refuelling needs.

“Airbus is an industry leader in the aerial refuelling area, and Lockheed Martin is known for cutting-edge defensive technologies and capabilities,” said Michele Evans, Executive Vice President, Lockheed Martin Aeronautics. “This is a great opportunity for our two companies to combine our expertise – cooperating to develop world-class solutions for critical needs around the world.”

[Photo by Liu Xin/For China Daily]

The Shenzhen-based Airbus China Innovation Center has signed an agreement with China Mobile Intelligent Mobility Network Technology Co to co-develop in-flight Wi-Fi services, fueled by the growing demand for greater in-air connectivity.

""The cooperation will develop an end-to-end solution and create new in-flight high-speed connectivity, leveraging the favorable policy on the use of portable electronic devices on board and the upcoming 5G technology,"" said Luo Gang, CEO of the Airbus China Innovation Center.

The Airbus and China Mobile subsidiaries did not disclose further details.

In January, the Civil Aviation Administration of China lifted curbs on the use of mobile devices on domestic flights. Passengers can now use mobile phones, tablets and laptops during the entire flight, as long as they have airplane mode switched on.

The in-flight Wi-Fi market in China is expected to enter a rapid growth period in the next few years. Most domestic routes are yet to be equipped with Wi-Fi services, due to technology and cost limitations.

Opening last year, Airbus' Shenzhen innovation center is its first such facility in Asia, and its second globally after the one in Silicon Valley. China Mobile Intelligent Mobility Network was launched in June. The company will focus on the transportation industry and 5G, and deepen its R&D in smart transportation fields, including automated driving and in-flight connectivity.

Currently, in-flight Wi-Fi mostly relies on the Ku band signal channel, which makes it susceptible to instability during flights.

The latest high-speed in-flight Wi-Fi operates on the Ka band, meaning the internet speed will be much faster than the currently available options. Both technologies rely on satellites, which restrict them to satellite orbit resources, making them more expensive than air-to-ground communications.

""Another approach to in-flight Wi-Fi connectivity depends on air-to-ground communications－a ground-based channel. Air-to-ground connections send signals to planes from on-ground signal towers, instead of from satellites directly as L band and Ku band do. The resources of on-ground signal towers are richer and more stable, and relatively easier to build,"" said Xiang Ligang, CEO of telecom industry website Cctime."

But the Super Guppy proved them wrong.

On September 19, 1962, the bizarre new aircraft took to the skies near Los Angeles. When former Air Force pilot Jack Conroy took off and safely landed this specially modified hulk of a plane without a hitch, he inaugurated a new age of airborne transport lead by Aero Spaceline's Guppy family of aircraft.

This shiny silver monster, then known as the Pregnant Guppy, looks more like an airship than an aircraft. It's the epitome of the design philosophy ""go big or go home."" Today, despite being fifty years old, this frankenplane can still transport monstrous cargo, even outmatching the C-5 Galaxy by volume. Along the way, that cavernous cargo space would make the Guppy an indispensable part of humanity's journey to the Moon.

Birth of a Frankenplane

Today's Super Guppy is only the latest iteration in a series of specially-built aircraft made by Aero Spacelines, Inc. Its nickname ""Frankenplane"" is a literal one, because the the Guppy is actually made of elements from other aircraft.

The idea was hatched one evening in 1960 when Conroy was talking with aircraft broker Leo Mansdorf, who had just acquired a number of old Boeing Model 377 Stratocruisers that he hoped to resell. The propeller-driven Stratocruiser, based on the B-29 bomber, had been Boeing’s first post-war airliner and was now obsolete thanks to new jet aircraft like the Boeing 707.

Conroy had heard that NASA was transporting components for future spacecraft from manufacturers on the West Coast to launch sites on the Eastern seacoast. This was usually a laborious journey via the Panama Canal, taking at least 18 days. Instead Conroy wanted to stretch and expand the Stratocruiser's fuselage to transport rocket boosters and other bulky space hardware by plane.

It was a crazy idea. Most of the people who looked at it said the thing would never fly with one NASA official saying the design looked like a pregnant guppy—the name stuck. But Conroy was determined, he mortgaged his house to create Aero Spacelines International and began modifying the first Stratocruiser.

Two years later, after the Pregnant Guppy had flown at Van Nuys, Conroy obtained special permission to fly the uncertified aircraft to NASA’s Manned Space Flight Center in Houston for a demonstration. Permission was given but required him not to fly over population centers.

NASA officials were dubious that this ungainly aircraft (which they had not requested) was safe enough to transport they're expensive cargo. Although the Pregnant Guppy was only 3,000 lbs. heavier than the original Stratocruiser, the aerodynamics were far worse, and the cruise speed was reduced by extra drag.

Conroy appealed personally to the MSFC’s Director, space scientist Wernher von Braun. Von Braun insisted on going up himself for a test flight, where Conroy showed him the plane’s ability to fly and remain stable even with two of its four engines out. Von Braun was sold.

The Pregnant Guppy cut the delivery time from factory to the launch site from 18 days to 18 hours, and immediately began transporting components for the Gemini space program. In fact, NASA says they would not have been able to get a man on the moon by 1969 without the help of the Guppy.

Extreme Modifications

The Pregnant Guppy was made from not one but two Stratocruisers, with a section of fuselage sawed off one and added to another to stretch it by sixteen feet. The custom-built cargo bay was nineteen feet in diameter, sized to carry stages of the Saturn V rocket.

To access the Pregnant Guppy’s cargo bay, the entire tail section (basically the rear half of the plane) was unbolted and rolled back on a wheeled trolley, and getting the two sections to join up again was not simple. Fred Austin, a Pregnant Guppy Loadmaster in the 60s, says that usually it was just a matter of moving the trolley backwards and forwards, but on one occasion when the tail section was brought forward again it was out of alignment. Getting the two to rejoin took some time.

“It was quite a show trying to look like we knew what we were doing, with no idea of what we were doing,” recalls Austin on the AllAboutGuppys website.

After that the trolley was fitted with tillers, so the tail section could be steered easily into place each time.

Soon one Pregnant Guppy was not enough for NASA’s needs, and it was quickly followed by the Super Guppy in 1965. Unlike the Pregnant Guppy, the Super Guppy is pressurized, making it possible to fly above weather.

The Super Guppy also benefited from upgraded engines, which are the same as those in Lockheed's P-3 Orion anti-submarine aircraft, though its cruising speed of 250 mph is sluggish by modern standards. The propellers come from Lockheed's C-130 Hercules, and the nosewheel is from a Boeing 707—a true frankenplane.

Unlike its predecessor, the Super Guppy loads in the front with a nose section that swings open 110 degrees. Opening requires a series of cables and locks to be disengaged in the proper sequence, and getting it closed again is ”definitely an art,” according to Guppy flight engineer David Elliott. This is because the change of weight makes it difficult to align the locking pins, resulting in what Elliott terms an “interesting” situation.

While the C-5 Galaxy (also a badass plane) can carry four times more weight at over 200,000 lbs., the Super Guppy wins by volume. Its payload bay is 25-feet high, 25-feet wide, and 111-feet long. That gives the Super Guppy a whopping 39,000 cubic feet of usable space, compared to the C-5’s 35,000. While the C-5 may be the go-to carrier for heavy loads like main battle tanks, the Super Guppy can taker bigger, relatively light cargo like space components.

Even the Antonov-225, the world’s biggest cargo aircraft cannot take some of the loads which the Super Guppy can haul, because its cargo bay is ""only"" 15-feet high.

It’s What’s Inside That Counts

Manchester Daily Express // Getty Images An Aero Spacelines Super Guppy transports wings for Airbus’ first airliner, the A300.

After carrying boosters and other components in the early days of the space race, Airbus used four Super Guppies starting in the early 1970s to carry airliner components for assembly in their base in Toulouse, France. Airbus later built their own cargo plane for outsize loads, the A300-600 ST Super Transporter, generally called Beluga, a design that's very similar to the Guppy.

After working a spell for the European Space Agency, the Super Guppy was sold back to NASA, and began transporting elements of the International Space Station to the launch site. In 2016 it took the Orion spacecraft, and this year it carried the Crew Module for NASA’s Exploration Mission-1, due to blast off in 2020, as well as newly restored parts historic Mission Control in Houston.

The Super Guppy has been used for plenty of other missions as well. It often transports NASA's T-38 trainer jet, and other loads have included DH-10 airliner fuselages, an entire SH-3 Sea King helicopter, Rockwell’s prototype XFV-12A vertical takeoff and landing prototype, and a ‘large composite structure’ as part of NASA’s PRSEUS program.

While these Guppies have found success in the small niche of aerospace transport, it wasn't enough to keep Conroy's business airborne.

“Airlift your boat, trouble free and damage-free, to your delighted customer,” runs one Aero Spacelines sales brochure, with a photo of a substantial vessel packed snugly aboard a Guppy. But the company had no luck with the wider market, and only one Pregnant Guppy and five Super Guppies were ever built. Conroy ceased operations in 1972.

The lack of a production is one reason why a section of the airframe of the original Pregnant Guppy was cannibalized, and is part of NASA’s sole remaining Super Guppy.

The Super Guppy Today

NASA NASA’s Super Guppy at Langley Air Force Base, 2014.

The Super Guppy was built in the 1960s and it remains a 1960s aircraft—without any modern electronics. Flying with a crew of six or seven: two pilots, two flight engineers, a load master, and one or two maintenance technicians.

Most aircraft do not need flight engineers to control engine power levels but managing the heavy engine levers is not practical at the same time as wrestling with the controls, which lack the power assistance of more recent rigs. In addition, the Super Guppy control layout does not allow the pilot to see all the controls, so engineers are mandatory.

NASA's single Super Guppy is based at Ellington Field near the Johnson Space Center, and the space agency has no plans to retire or replace the plane, stating that it offers “fast, economical transport for outsize cargo….provides flexibility in transportation planning, virtually removing constraints such as railroad and highway overpasses, long time legs, such as barge or sea transport, and transport to or from remote regions.”

It may be old, awkward, and even a little bit ridiculous, but the Super Guppy remains an irreplaceable, badass flying warehouse."
Closing the loop with Helionix Step 3 - Airbus,"Fri, 07 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDE4LTEyLWNsb3NpbmctdGhlLWxvb3Atd2l0aC1oZWxpb25peC1zdGVwLTPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Article: Heather Couthaud. Adapted from Rotor magazine #113.

Airbus’ Helionix avionics system for helicopters was designed for greater mission flexibility and operational safety. Today, its Step 3 upgrade encompasses all that its developers envisioned, and more.

In-house avionics

In 2006 when Airbus Helicopters first began developing its in-house avionics solution for helicopters, no such system existed for rotorcraft. “It was obvious that we had to develop our own avionics,” says Jean-Jacques Mevel, head of the Helionix programme at Airbus Helicopters. To ensure pilots got the best performance out of the helicopters, “we decided to develop our own autopilot and vehicle management system, because these functions are too closely linked with our design,” he says. “Nobody else knows the performance, characteristics, and intricacies of our machines.”

The resulting system, Helionix, broke the mould for intuitive, pilot-friendly avionics. Distinguished by an innovative cockpit layout which includes two to four multifunction screens, only the most pertinent details of a flight phase are displayed at any given time. “The key to Helionix is that it filters and presents the most relevant information when the pilot needs it,” says Mevel. As a pilot prepares to take off, for instance, Helionix brings up only that data (engine health, wind direction, traffic warnings, etc.) specific to the task, removing anything unnecessary and distracting.

With Step 3, we have done what we first intended to with Helionix.

- Jean-Jacques Mevel, head of the Helionix programme at Airbus Helicopters

Step 3

Customer requests were also at the heart of new features in Helionix Step 3— the system’s latest upgrade, first introduced in 2017 on an H175 delivered to NHV. “With Step 3, we have done what we first intended to with Helionix,” says Mevel. The software contains everything its developers initially envisioned, and more. The synthetic vision system (SVS), a standard on any avionics, now updates - in real time - 3D maps of the terrain with texture to help pilots tell woods from trees, for example. An assisted landing feature, Rig ‘n’ Fly, significantly aids approaches to offshore oil platforms. And the SAR mode enhances search and rescue missions with an optronics system and search radar.

The family concept

One of its more remarked-on attributes is the suite’s family concept; equipping not only the H175 and H145, it was recently certified on the H135 and is planned for the H160. “The feedback we get is fantastic,” says Jean-Jacques Mevel, head of the programme. “Helionix reduces the pilot’s workload, optimising the time he has for the mission and contributing to safety. But the most unexpected comment was about its universality. Pilots still find the same interface, the same look and feel, whatever the helicopter.”

“The decision to make Helionix a family concept was driven by safety,” says Mevel. “Even if some solutions were expensive to develop, the benefit to flight safety was so important that we just did it.” Helionix’s culmination, at least for now, goes so far as to let customers add their own obstacles (pylons, cranes, buildings) to the avionics’ terrain and warning system, matching what their pilots are actually seeing.

In their own words: operators speak about Helionix

At the end of 2018, more than 320 Airbus helicopters will be flying with Helionix, reaching a possible 180,000 flight hours. Below, some operators share their experiences using the new avionics in their daily missions."
Major fire to delay Airbus production - SamChui.com - Sam Chui,"Sun, 30 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vc2FtY2h1aS5jb20vMjAxOC8xMi8zMC9tYWpvci1maXJlLXRvLWRlbGF5LWFpcmJ1cy1wcm9kdWN0aW9uL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Major fire to delay Airbus production

Premium Aerotec, a subsidiary of Airbus based in Augsburg, Germany, was left without their plant on Friday night when a fire broke out, causing tens millions of euros worth of building and equipment damage.

Preliminary reports from witnesses and media indicate the fire initiated in a surface treatment area before rapidly spreading to nearby goods. At the time, no one was in the building, leaving no injuries behind, however dozens of firefighters spent the night in the heat battling the blaze until it was under control.

Investigations are underway as to what caused the fire, specifically focusing on workplace safety and conditions as well as any intentional acts.

As a consequence of this fire, Airbus has been left in a difficult position as they state “virtually all Airbus models” will now be delayed. With Premium Aerotec being a tier-one supplier for Airbus, the company has no choice but to accept the delays and scramble their backup plans into place.

The fire-claimed facility specializes in producing completed fuselage and aircraft sections for Airbus defense and commercial offerings, including the A400M, Eurofighter Typhoon and A350. Award winning titanium and composite components have been produced at the facility, which are all implemented on the mentioned aircraft.

In statements to media, Airbus has outlined the delays could last several months before parts at the Augsburg plant could be completed and installed into aircraft pieces.

With over 4000 employees situated at the plant, Airbus will have to utilize them to get things temporarily up and running before the plant can be restored and outfitted with replacement equipment. Options include moving operations to Premium Aerotec’s other facilities in Romania and four others in Germany.

Airbus is already under enough pressure, with engine issues causing strife withn the A320neo Family. Workers are hammering away harder than ever with the push to meet the company’s 2018 goal of 800 aircraft – a reduction from the 820 figure. Additionally, Airbus has included the A220 to cover up potential shortfall in deliveries.

Despite these unfortunate events, Airbus remains positive about 2019, stating the hunt for orders is on and greater developments within the company are being prepared. Additionally, work on the A220 program is said to dramatically increase, with smoother production and new facilities being developed."

ANA has firm orders for three A380s, becoming the first customer for the superjumbo in Japan. The airline will take delivery of the first A380 at the end of the first quarter of 2019 and will operate the aircraft on the popular leisure Narita-Honolulu route.

The three ANA A380s will be painted in a special livery depicting sea turtles which are native to Hawaii. The first aircraft is blue, the second will be green and the third orange. The ANA A380 livery is one of the most elaborate ever painted by Airbus. It took 21 days for the Airbus team to paint a surface of 3,600m2 using 16 different shades of color.

The aircraft will now have completion of its cabin and enter a final phase of ground and flight tests in Hamburg, during which all cabin systems will be thoroughly tested, including air flow and air conditioning, lighting, galleys, lavatories, seats and in-flight entertainment. In parallel, Airbus will also undertake advanced aircraft performance tests before it flies back to Toulouse for preparation of its delivery and ferry flight.

As one of the world’s most prestigious airlines, ANA will be able to benefit from the A380’s proven operating economics and unrivalled passenger appeal. Offering more personal space than any other aircraft, the A380 is the most efficient solution to meeting growth on the world’s most heavily travelled routes, carrying more passengers with fewer flights at lower cost and emissions.

At the end of November, Airbus has delivered 232 A380s, with the aircraft now in service with 14 airlines worldwide.

ACJ display points way to future of business aviation - Airbus,"Tue, 04 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOC0xMi1hY2otZGlzcGxheS1wb2ludHMtd2F5LXRvLWZ1dHVyZS1vZi1idXNpbmVzcy1hdmlhdGlvbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Echoes trend toward more spacious cabins

Airbus Corporate Jets (ACJ) is exhibiting an ACJ319 at the MEBAA show[1], highlighting the comfort and space on offer and echoing the trend towards larger cabins in new-generation business jets.

Operated by Acropolis Aviation of the UK, which is upgrading to an ACJ320neo to benefit from improved fuel efficiency and range, the aircraft is offered for VVIP charter flights.

“What you get in the cabin, and being able to fly when and where you want, is the bedrock of business aviation, and being able to stand upright and move around freely – a trademark feature of Airbus corporate jets – makes a huge difference to enjoyment and productivity,” says ACJ President Benoit Defforge.

Airbus ACJ320 Family aircraft have the widest and tallest cabins of any large business jet, while being about the same size and delivering similar operating costs.

New members of the family, such as the ACJ319neo and ACJ320neo, feature new engines and wingtip-mounted Sharklets, enabling even longer intercontinental flights in the best comfort and space that money can buy – as well as saving fuel and reducing operating costs.

The first of these new aircraft, an ACJ320neo for Acropolis Aviation, successfully completed flight trials in November, and will be delivered for outfitting in the coming weeks. It will join more than 500 A320neo Family aircraft that are already in widespread airline service.

A total of 11 ACJ320neo Family aircraft have been ordered to date, from customers that include Acropolis Aviation, Comlux, K5 Aviation and undisclosed customers.

Continuous improvements mean that the ACJ319neo can fly eight passengers 6,750 nm/12,500 km or more than 15 hours, while the ACJ320neo can transport 25 passengers 6,000 nm/11,100 km or more than 13 hours.

The Middle East is one of the biggest business jet markets in the world and was where Airbus sold its first corporate jet in the mid-1980s. Around 60 ACJs are currently flying in the Middle East, comprising about 40 ACJ320 Family aircraft and some 20 VIP widebodies.

It is thus a key market for Airbus’ VIP widebodies – such as the new ACJ330neo and ACJ350 XWB – which can carry even more passengers and fly nonstop to the world.

More than 190 ACJs are in service today, delivering the robust reliability and worldwide support that comes from their airliner heritage, plus services tailored to corporate jet needs.

The first A320 Family customer aircraft has been equipped with the ‘XL Bin’ – a key component of Airbus’ new Airspace cabin for the A320 Family. In late October, an A321neo in production was the first to be fitted with these new spacious overhead luggage bins as part of series installation for new-build aircraft in Hamburg. Development of the XL Bin, which offers around 40 percent greater storage space for carry-on bags compared with current bins, was launched in June 2017. The new design not only encompassed the new bins and ceiling panels, manufactured by supplier FACC, but also included local structural reinforcements on the aircraft as well as modifications to the electrical and air conditioning systems.

Simultaneously, the first XL Bin for retrofit – a separate offering for in-service A320 Family aircraft – will also enter service.

A330 “ACE” trainer now available for customers; coming soon for A320

The Airbus Cockpit Experience (ACE) Trainer, a virtual and interactive cockpit simulator used in Airbus training centres for Flight Crew Licensing courses, is now available for A330 operators. Building on the success of the A350 flight training devices, the recently completed development of the A330 ACE Trainer has been welcomed by airlines, with agreements already signed by several customers in Asia, Africa and Europe. The same approach is currently being developed for A320 aircraft, with an entry-into-service of the A320 ACE Trainer and the A320 ACE Suite service planned in 2019. Benefits of the ACE Trainer include: selfpaced study from day-one in a virtual cockpit; better knowledge retention; significant time savings on higher level training devices / simulators; and free play simulation for systems practice. ACE Trainer is a key pillar of the new Airbus flight training philosophy introducing “competency-based training” and simulation at an early stage.

Airbus inaugurates first Level-D qualified A320neo simulator in the Americas

Airbus’ newest training centre in Denver, USA, is now home to the first A320neo full-flight simulator (FFS) in the Americas, which recently achieved Level-D certification from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). This simulator complements the two existing A320 Family, FAAcertified Level-D FFS in the Denver Airbus Training Centre. The latest FFS was produced by L3 Commercial Aviation, which will also supply the new training centre with an additional FFS and two flat-panel training devices for the A320 Family. The Denver Training Centre is a 38,000 square-foot training complex and is the second customised Airbus training facility in the USA (the first being located in Miami). At full capability, the new centre will operate six full-flight simulators to support customers in the Americas.

Airbus Manufacturing Execution System brings a fully digital shopfloor even closer

Airbus is further accelerating the rollout of digital shopfloor processes which are enabling operators to directly interact in real-time with Airbus’ “Manufacturing Execution System” (MES) – based on Airbus’ continuous improvement principles. The result is that ever more Airbus Commercial Aircraft shopfloor operators can now visualise the workflow in real-time on smart connected devices, while speeding-up problem solving and simplifying work planning. Helping to drive this uptake is a focussed training programme for MES users. In the past operators relied on traditional paper documents, which were manually filled-in, stamped and collected and analysed. Now the digital progress system enables much shorter and quicker feedback loops. Today MES is deployed at over 30 production lines at 10 plants and final assembly lines, covering the A320, A330 and A350 XWB programmes. By the end of 2018, some 6,000 users were already benefitting from its functionalities using digital devices and smartphones. That number is likely to double by the end of 2019.

Leading the initiative is Airbus’ Hamburg site which is seeing the largest ongoing MES deployment: Around 2,100 operators across the plant's single-aisle, A330 and A350 XWB equipment installation and structure organisations will be connected to the system during 2019. Hamburg operators already receive work orders in sequence through MES, providing a detailed view right down to work station level. Meanwhile, at the Getafe plant in Spain, the A350 XWB ‘Section-19’ team began using MES during summer 2018, where it now eases operator workloads as it provides them with a quick and full view of work status for each aircraft section. It also affords a clear picture of what they need in order to perform a task, and helps them to track parts and tools.

Airbus ramps-up A320neo pylon assembly at its St-Eloi Toulouse factory

Productivity at Airbus’ dedicated pylon factory at Saint-Eloi in Toulouse is being transformed, with three new parallel pylon-equipping ‘pulse’ lines to meet the demands of rising A320neo Family production rates. The lines, which were up and running by the end of 2018, each feature six workstations which replace the traditional static assembly methods for pylon structure and equipping. Pylons now move forward between workstations every five hours, meaning that Airbus can equip up to 18 pylons at the same time. Making the change from static assembly to a pulse line for both structure and equipping will help Airbus to meet current and future aircraft production targets.

Amprius' Silicon Nanowire Lithium Ion Batteries Power Airbus Zephyr S HAPS Solar Aircraft - PR Newswire,"Tue, 04 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcm5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2FtcHJpdXMtc2lsaWNvbi1uYW5vd2lyZS1saXRoaXVtLWlvbi1iYXR0ZXJpZXMtcG93ZXItYWlyYnVzLXplcGh5ci1zLWhhcHMtc29sYXItYWlyY3JhZnQtMzAwNzU5NDA2Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"SUNNYVALE, Calif., Dec. 4, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Amprius, Inc., a leading manufacturer and developer of high energy and high capacity lithium-ion batteries, announced today that the company is supplying advanced lithium ion cells to the Airbus Defence and Space Zephyr Program. Using Amprius' cells, which contain a 100% silicon anode, the Zephyr S flew more than 25 days, setting a new endurance and altitude record for stratospheric flight.

Amprius’ Silicon Nanowire Lithium Ion Batteries Are Powering the Airbus Zephyr S HAPS Solar Aircraft

The Zephyr platform is a new class of unmanned air vehicle that operates as a high-altitude pseudo-satellite (HAPS) enabling affordable, persistent, local satellite-like services. Combining solar power and lithium ion batteries, the Zephyr aircraft holds world records for endurance as well as altitude, flying at 70,000 feet or higher. This stratospheric platform can fly for months at a time and combines the persistence of a satellite with the flexibility of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The platform is expected to be used in a wide range of emerging applications, including maritime surveillance and services, border patrol missions, communications, forest fire detection and navigation.

""Our collaboration with Amprius in the application of their silicon nanowire based lithium ion cells to the Zephyr has been important to the success of the HAPS program,"" said Sophie Thomas, Airbus HAPS Program Director. ""The high specific energy of Amprius batteries enable the Zephyr to fly uninterrupted in the stratosphere which would not be possible with lower performance batteries. This will further extend the capability and utility of the Zephyr platform for our customers.""

Amprius has pioneered and perfected the application of silicon for lithium ion anodes. Based on its proprietary silicon nanowire technology, Amprius has demonstrated breakthrough performance in energy density and cycle life. Silicon anodes have much higher specific capacity compared to graphite anodes which are used in conventional lithium ion batteries. However, in particle or film structures silicon is not stable and lasts only a few recharge cycles. Amprius' silicon nanowire structures overcome this instability and thereby enable hundreds of cycles with specific energies of over 435 Wh/kg and energy densities in excess of 1200 Wh/liter.

""We are extremely pleased to be working with Airbus and participate in the Zephyr development effort,"" said Jon Bornstein, COO of Amprius. ""The recent Zephyr flight is a remarkable accomplishment by Airbus and is an exciting beginning to a new stratospheric unmanned aircraft platform. It also represents the first long-endurance flight of a HAPS aircraft powered by Amprius' 100% silicon nanowire anode-based lithium ion batteries and is an important validation of this technology.""

Marks the start of various Zephyr flight campaigns to be undertaken from the site with different customers

Launch site is a key milestone in bringing real operational capability with the Zephyr S, the world’s leading solar electric, stratospheric UAV

Perth 3 December 2018 – Airbus Defence and Space announced the opening of the world’s first High Altitude Pseudo-Satellite (HAPS) flight base serving as the launch site for the Zephyr UAV in Wyndham, Western Australia.

This site has been chosen due to its largely unrestricted airspace and reliable weather and is the result of significant investment by Airbus into its Zephyr programme.

Zephyr is the world’s leading, solar electric, stratospheric Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). It harnesses the sun’s rays, running exclusively on solar power, above the weather and conventional air traffic; filling a capability gap complimentary to satellites, UAVs and manned aircraft to provide persistent local satellite-like services.

“I am delighted to welcome the Airbus team and their Zephyr project to Western Australia. This is the culmination of almost a year of hard work by Airbus and my Government to bring this exciting and innovative technology to our state. The Zephyr aircraft provides new capabilities to commercial and military customers and will bring an economic boost to the East Kimberley region,” said Premier of Western Australia, Hon. Mark McGowan MLA.

“The official opening of the Airbus Wyndham launch site in Western Australia, the world’s first operational HAPS site, marks the start of a new era for Zephyr. We are proud to see Australia become part of the Zephyr operational network. The site is our gateway to the stratosphere and will be the main flight base for Zephyr going forward.” said Jana Rosenmann, Head of Unmanned Aerial Systems at Airbus.

Zephyr will bring new see, sense and connect capabilities to both commercial and military customers. Zephyr will provide the potential to revolutionise disaster management, including monitoring the spread of wildfires or oil spills. It provides persistent surveillance, tracing the world’s changing environmental landscape and will be able to provide communications to the most unconnected parts of the world.

About the Airbus Zephyr Programme:

The original target mission of the Zephyr is to provide local persistence at an affordable price with a re-usable solar-powered aircraft, providing a wide scope of applications, ranging for example from maritime surveillance and services, border patrol missions, communications, forest fire detection and monitoring, or navigation. Operating in the stratosphere at an average altitude of 70,000 feet / 21 kilometers, the ultra-lightweight Zephyr has a wingspan of 25 meters and a weigh of less than 75kg, and flies above weather (clouds, jet streams) and above regular air traffic, covering local or regional footprints.

Ideally suited for ""local persistence"" (ISR/Intelligence, Surveillance & Reconnaissance), the Zephyr has the ability to stay focused on a specific area of interest (which can be hundreds of miles wide) while providing it with satellite-like communications and Earth observation services (with greater imagery granularity) over long periods of time without interruption.

Airbus tests market for A321XLR jet launch by mid-2019: sources - Yahoo Finance,"Thu, 20 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9haXJidXMtdGVzdHMtbWFya2V0LWEzMjF4bHItamV0LTEwMjMwMDk5MC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Tim Hepher

PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus (AIR.PA) is talking to airlines about a longer-range version of its best-selling narrowbody jet family with a view to launching it by mid-2019 as it tries to head off a potential Boeing competitor, people familiar with the matter said.

Pre-marketing of the so-called A321XLR comes as Boeing (BA.N) contemplates an all-new aircraft to serve mid-market demand worth hundreds of billions of dollars, with a final decision on both aircraft expected in 2019.

Airbus has stepped up a gear and is actively ""testing the market"" for a newly defined XLR, one industry source said.

Initial plans for the A321XLR were first reported by Reuters in June. It would sit at the top of a narrowbody range driving most Airbus profits.

The upgrade would boost the A321's take-off weight to some 101 tonnes for the A321XLR compared with 97 tonnes for the longest-range A321LR, which can carry 206 people 4,000 miles in two classes and went to its first customer last month.

It would rely on more powerful engines already offered as an option, giving 33,000 pounds of thrust instead of 30,000 pounds.

An Airbus spokesman said the A321 ""still has lots of potential"" and declined comment on product strategy.

Until now, Airbus has kept Boeing guessing on how it might respond to its plans for a New Mid-Sized Airplane (NMA) with 220-260 seats between traditional small and large jet segments.

Among Airbus's top targets will be the major U.S. airlines, who could use the A321XLR to serve transatlantic routes with premium seats and who are also likely to be wooed by Boeing for its new jet. Their decisions could influence the fate of both projects.

The A321XLR would be less attractive for low-cost carriers who could not exploit the extra range without giving up part of their 240-seat preferred layout due to structural limits.

The contest for the middle of the market is expected to dominate the commercial jet industry in the coming year.

Boeing aims to define a new corner of the jet market with a wide-cabin aircraft capable of operating as cheaply as the workhorse single-aisle planes like the A321 and its own 737.

Story continues

Without an all-new design on its drawing board, Airbus is trying to squeeze its rival by tweaking profitable models above and below the NMA, but has had limited success with its larger A330neo and is directing effort where it has the most advantage.

With its A321XLR, Airbus aims to ""shoot at the NMA from below,"" a person familiar with the plans said. However, it has already shelved plans for a much more extensive redesign.

Analysts say some questions remain about its performance, while the industry also faces an unresolved debate over how long passengers will sit in narrower fuselages as medium-haul jets get more and more range to complement dedicated long-haul jets.

The companies will seek to provide aerial-refuelling services to address any identified capacity shortfall and to meet requirements for the next generation of tankers capable of operating in the challenging environments of the future battlespace.

“Reliable and modernized aerial refuelling is an essential capability for our customers to maintain their global reach and strategic advantage,” said Lockheed Martin Chairman, President and CEO Marillyn Hewson. “By combining the innovation and expertise of Airbus and Lockheed Martin, we will be well positioned to provide the United States Air Force and allies around the world with the advanced refuelling solutions needed to meet 21st century security challenges.”

“The US Air Force deserves the best aerial-refuelling technology and performance available under the sun and this great industry team, Lockheed Martin and Airbus, will offer exactly that,” said Tom Enders, Airbus CEO.

The companies are taking a cooperative approach, with the Airbus A330 Multi Role Tanker Transport (A330 MRTT) at its heart, to examine a broad spectrum of opportunities. These may range from ways to support critical near-term air-refuelling needs, such as a fee-for-service structure to conceptualizing the tanker of the future.

Airbus Defence and Space Head of Military Aircraft Fernando Alonso said: “The A330 MRTT has been selected by a dozen nations around the world. It is extensively proven in live operations and has been repeatedly praised by major air forces. We are convinced that the combination of Airbus’ tanker expertise with Lockheed Martin’s extensive US presence, has the potential to provide highly effective solutions for current and future US military aerial-refuelling requirements.”

Lockheed Martin has a long and successful history of systems integration, manufacturing and MRO operations with large airlift and tanker aircraft. When combined with Airbus’ expertise, the two companies will field a strong team to address future air refuelling needs.

“Airbus is an industry leader in the aerial refuelling area, and Lockheed Martin is known for cutting-edge defensive technologies and capabilities,” said Michele Evans, Executive Vice President, Lockheed Martin Aeronautics. “This is a great opportunity for our two companies to combine our expertise – cooperating to develop world-class solutions for critical needs around the world.”"
A Chat With The Manager of Finnair’s Airbus A350 Fleet - Airline Reporter,"Wed, 05 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAxOC8xMi9hLWNoYXQtd2l0aC10aGUtbWFuYWdlci1vZi1maW5uYWlycy1haXJidXMtYTM1MC1mbGVldC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"We love getting a glimpse behind the scenes at the people behind airline operations. So when we flew to Helsinki to learn about Finnair, we sat down for a chat with Sara Mosebar, the queen of the airline’s Airbus A350s! Well, formally her title is “A350 Program Manager.” But she may as well be aviation royalty based on her rsum. After getting her aerospace engineering degree at the University of Texas at Austin, she started her career at Boeing. And just a few years after joining Finnair’s A350 team as a Fleet Engineer, she was promoted to head the airline’s entire A350 program. It’s a big role, since the A350 is the flagship of Finnair’s long-haul fleet.

Here in part one of our interview, we discuss Sara’s responsibilities as person-in-charge of Finnair’s A350 fleet, her experience transitioning from Boeing to Airbus airplanes, and the highlights of the Finnair A350 passenger experience. We also see how her team tackled teething problems with new aircraft, as well as plans for expanding Finnair’s A350 route network. If you’re an AvGeek, consider it required reading!

We sat down with Sara at Finnair’s headquarters at Helsinki Airport. We were joined by Satu Haataja, one of the airline’s communications representatives.

Q: How did you become a fleet engineer?

Sara: I have a bachelor’s in aerospace engineering, and after my university studies I went on to join Boeing as a fuel systems specialist. After that I had the opportunity to move to Finland and come work for this airline as an A350 fleet engineer. As a mechanical systems specialist for fleet engineering, I was responsible for technical knowledge, upkeep, and airworthiness of all mechanical systems on board, like the fuel systems, hydraulics, ventilation basically anything that has moving parts, we are responsible and answerable for. For me, that meant getting to learn how all the systems work. When I was hired, I took a type course where I went through the aircraft system by system, component by component, and learned how every piece of the airplane works.

Q: What was it specifically that attracted you to come work at Finnair?

Sara: It’s the perfect size of airline for me. It’s not a small airline, but it’s not too big. I really wanted to work with the airplanes, and I get to sit in the hangar looking out at the airplanes every day. When I want to check on a system or go work with mechanics, my airplanes are right there, which is not a luxury that fleet engineers at some other airlines have.

BONUS: How to Apply, Interview, and Land An Airline Job!

Q: Before you joined Finnair you worked at Boeing. How transferrable were the skills you built there when it comes to working on the Airbus A350?

Sara: The skills were quite transferrable. The basics of an airplane don’t change from system to system. How Airbus or Boeing may implement their solution may have some differences, but overall, a fuel pump will be a fuel pump regardless of what aircraft it is on. An air conditioner will be an air conditioner. It’s a matter of being familiar with the technology on that airplane.

Q: Who on the Finnair team do you spend most of your time with?

Sara: Especially now as a program manager, I work with all the divisions within the company. My work extends from the initial delivery of an aircraft all the way to maintenance, planning, and production. I work with dispatch controllers, pilots, and with all the people doing aircraft maintenance. I get to see and work with every part of the company. My main role in life is to support the A350 and make sure it is safely operated for our consumers and our airline.

Q: Walk me through a day in your life.

Sara: It normally starts in the office, talking with maintenance control and asking how operations went during the evening. I work with the fleet engineers who support me to make sure regular maintenance tasks are completed, and to plan how we can improve efficiency and the customer experience. I will go talk with the cabin engineers and ask how things are going on board the airplanes. Mostly it is a coordination role. By noon my whole schedule is usually derailed and it’s a matter of managing whatever comes up.

Q: What did the airline do to celebrate the entry of the A350 into the fleet?

Satu Haataja: We had a very nice delivery ceremony in Toulouse, which we took many of our employees to. One special element was that we had a raffle for employees and we took altogether three flights full of employees with the A350 to Lapland to meet Santa Claus there. The employees really appreciated it it was very special.

BONUS: Reactions After My First Airbus A350 Flight

Q: When you first started taking delivery of the planes, how was it decided which routes the A350 would fly?

Sara: We were trying to phase out the A340s, which were operated primarily to our Asian destinations. So as one A350 came in, an A340 went out. After the replacement of the A340s we had eight of them at the time we started expanding our destinations within Asia. Now that we’re in a growth phase, we’re looking to open new destinations with the A350, starting next year in March with Los Angeles. So we will finally get to serve the American market with the A350.

Video Caption: While the A350 handles Finnair’s routes to Asia, its A330s are responsible for routes to the US.

Q: From the perspective of the aircraft maintenance teams, was it a big process training people to work on the A350?

Sara: Prior to entry into service, Finnair started working with Airbus to make preparations for the A350’s introduction. It’s not just a matter of maintenance staff; it’s also about training flight crews, and every element of the company. The maintenance personnel go to a type course that is ten weeks long, where they get familiarized with all the elements of the A350. After that, it’s fairly similar work to what they were doing before. There is some difference in the level of technology onboard the A350, and the maintenance philosophy is a bit different on the A350, but the systems are often fairly similar to what they were working on before.

Q: When a new plane rolls out, there are sometimes issues that come up. Were there any that arose for your team with the A350, and if so, how did your team address them?

Sara: Finnair was lucky in that we were one of the earliest customers of the A350. We had #18 off of the assembly line. Finnair had an ambitious approach to get the A350 into service. We used it to replace our A340s because we saw a possibility to increase our fuel efficiency and reduce our emissions by about 25%. We immediately started phasing out our A340s as soon as we got our A350s. When you take a new product, there will always be teething problems. We had to work closely with our partners, like mechanics at outstations and Airbus, to adapt to this new aircraft. There were challenges in the early months when we had only one or two airplanes. But we moved forward and we’ve recently celebrated our three-year anniversary and we’re matching worldwide A350 reliability levels despite having one of the highest daily utilization rates.

One of the really unique things about doing entry into service for the A350 and being one of the earliest operators is seeing how close the A350 community is within the airlines. Most of the airlines operating it talk to each other on a regular basis to work together and support the fleet across airlines. It’s like being part of a community, especially now that there are about twenty operators.

Q: When you take delivery of a new A350, what do you have to do to get it ready to enter service?

Sara: We will be taking delivery of our next aircraft in December. After the aircraft is delivered from Airbus, we take it into our hangar for post-delivery modifications, where we install the Finnair-specific decals and our Marimekko interiors all the finishing touches that make the Finnair A350 unique. That process takes about a day, and the next day the aircraft can enter service.

Q: What makes the A350 special in terms of the passenger experience?

Sara: We’ve actually worked with a Finnish design company to bring the unique ’œNordic Experience’ onboard, which is essentially a feeling of openness, lightness, and nature. We also have, for the first time on the A350, a customized light scheme where the lights dim very gradually as we take off, and come on gradually on arrival, like a sunrise. In addition, we have an aurora borealis experience onboard, which I think is really cool!

Q: Is the plan for the A350 to start taking over routes that are operated today by the A330?

Sara: We don’t have any plans to change our A330 fleet at the moment. The A350s we will receive will be growth opportunities for expanding Finnair.

Q: We saw recently that Finnair plans to launch a true Premium Economy product. Will that be coming to the A350?

Sara: Yes, it will be coming to the entire widebody fleet.

BONUS: SAS Plus: Taking the Edge Off Economy Class Travel

Q: How many more A350s are going to be delivered to Finnair?

Sara: Currently we have a fleet of eleven aircraft. We will be receiving eight more: one in December, and the rest between 2019 and 2021.

Q: Might more A350s be added to the fleet at a later date?

Sara: We’re always reviewing our opportunities for growth and future strategy building. At this time we don’t have any plans for a new order, but we’re always considering how we will expand in the future.

Update 12/11: We have now published the second part of the interview and give you a chance to win a model of a Finnair A350 in a special Marimekko livery!

insight by Alasdair Whyte 13 December 2018 Print this page

The City Airbus VTOL concept

The best-known company in urban aviation is Uber. Its Uber Elevate project has captured the imagination of many of the public – and also many reporters. But the company leading the market is arguably Airbus.

Airbus, one of the two largest commercial aviation companies in the world, already has more than 12,000 helicopters in service with more than 3,000 customers worldwide.

The company has been slowly building up an urban air mobility (UAM) division since 2014 – starting with several air taxi concepts, traffic management and launching its helicopter air taxi initiative. It also has three VTOL concepts – Vahanna, Pop.Up Next and City Airbus.

Airbus has also established a Silicon Valley subsidiary to tap into the tech world.

We reached out to Airbus’s head of programs and strategy for urban air mobility Jörg Müller to find out more about Airbus’s urban air mobility plans and what to expect from the company over the next few years.

HI: How did you get into the VTOL market?

Jörg Müller: “Via our helicopters division, Airbus has been present in the VTOL market for decades– our long-standing portfolio consists of a broad range of helicopters for different missions. But when we look towards the future, we are thinking beyond today’s markets and products.

“Electric VTOL (eVTOL) – along with autonomous flight, digitalisation and urbanisation—are trends and technologies we see disrupting our industry. In order to position ourselves at the forefront of this, Airbus created an Urban Air Mobility (UAM) unit earlier this year, which, among other UAM initiatives such as Voom, our on-demand helicopter mobility service; air traffic management and infrastructure development; and other partnership-building and pilot projects, steers the development of Airbus’ ongoing eVTOL technology demonstrators, Vahana and CityAirbus. This is also one reason we founded A3 as our Silicon Valley outpost for innovative, disruptive projects.”

HI: How long has Airbus been looking at passenger VTOLs?

Jörg Müller: “Since we have a pioneering spirit embedded in our DNA, there have been isolated ideas for innovative air vehicles and mobility concepts being circulated throughout our helicopter division, chief technology office, and other parts of the company for nearly a decade. In a company-wide effort to consolidate this expertise, in late 2014 we created our first vision of how we see ourselves making an impact in this new market opportunity and harnessing the potential of air mobility to transform our cities for the better.

“Today, we are driving several passenger VTOL projects such as CityAirbus (a four-seater, all-electric, VTOL multicopper air taxi); Vahana (single-passenger, all-electric, fully-autonomous, VTOL air taxi demonstrator with tilt-wing configuration); and Voom our on-demand helicopter mobility service operating in Sao Paulo and Mexico City. With these projects and our infrastructure studies we are able to explore and demonstrate all bricks of the end-to-end mobility solution and a broad technical design space in eVTOLs.

“But we aren’t merely embarking on the development of vehicles. We are on a quest to co-create an entirely new market that sustainably integrates urban air mobility into the city context while addressing environmental and social concerns. Airbus believes that the hurdles are less about technology and business models, and more about urban integration, public acceptance and automated air traffic management.”

HI: What is next on the agenda for the Vahana, CityAirbus and Pop.Up Next?

Jörg Müller: “To date, Vahana has performed more than 40 flight tests as it continues to move through flight testing. We expect our other technology demonstrator, CityAirbus, to have its first flight early 2019. Pop.Up Next is a multi-modal ground and air vehicle concept which is still at the preliminary study stage. We see certified eVTOLs operating in cities as early as mid-next decade.”

HI: Everyone from Silicon Valley AI companies to legacy aircraft manufacturers are working on VTOLs. With so many disparate people, are there any difficulties working together?

Jörg Müller: “There’s no doubt that the stakes are high when we look at the exploding variety of new technologies and new competitors, but the challenge of making UAM a reality is bigger than any one company. It requires close cooperation between private and public stakeholders to set up the necessary infrastructure and regulatory frameworks that will ensure society benefits.

“The ecosystem of UAM is forming around us as we speak—there’s never been a more exciting time to be in aerospace. We think Airbus is uniquely positioned to make UAM a reality given its credibility with authorities, potential partners and passengers, its longstanding aerospace expertise and its global reach. It is a big advantage and a privilege that we can combine Silicon Valley style start-up spirit with the experience of a traditional aircraft manufacturer.”

HI: Is Airbus targeting the air taxi market or private customers first?

Jörg Müller: “As the market for UAM services is about to emerge, it makes sense to follow several different paths to be able to cater the needs of as many potential end-users as possible. But our motivation goes beyond the end user. Airbus firmly believes in the potential of air mobility to transform our cities for the better. By pushing the limits of technology in the fields of connectivity, artificial intelligence, autonomous systems and electric propulsion, our aim is to develop sustainable mobility systems that bring minimum environmental impact and maximum societal benefit. To this end, Airbus is harnessing its expertise across the company to develop solutions that offer viable alternatives in congested cities and help connecting cities and regions.

“One example of this is Voom, which has been operational for the past 18 months, and is currently available in Sao Paolo and Mexico City. Voom is not only a B2C effort on our part, but it’s providing us with rich information and insight to better understand passenger and operational requirements in today’s evolving market. While Voom is currently operating traditional machines (i.e. helicopters), the data collected will be instrumental in the development of the future UAM market.”

HI: With so many established companies jumping into the VTOL market, will start-ups be able to keep up?

Jörg Müller: “It’s important to realize that this effort is not just about developing new VTOL vehicles. In some ways, that’s the simpler part for a company like Airbus which has been designing, manufacturing and certifying flying platforms for nearly 50 years. The real challenge lies in safely integrating this new class of vehicles in the urban environment—the certification of the vehicle and the overall transport system, operational security, and the regulations for commercial operation in cities. We believe these are some of the challenges newcomers in this space will be faced with.”

HI: Airbus recently struck an agreement to trial the Pop.Up Next in Hamburg. Are you talking to other cities?

Jörg Müller: “In 2017, Airbus was appointed to lead the UAM Initiative of the European Innovation Partnership on Smart Cities and Communities (EIP SCC), and thus far, Hamburg and Ingolstadt have joined. Although this initiative is still in a very early stage, the “Smart City” UAM concept trials are platform-agnostic. Accordingly, any choice of a vehicle would depend on the mission and the availability of the platform. Airbus has no agreement with Hamburg in the frame of the “Smart City” initiative and the Hamburg trial is not focused on passenger transport. More German and European cities and regions have joined this initiative meanwhile with different scenarios, not all of them involving eVTOL solutions.

“On a broader scope, the EIP SCC is a city-centric, citizen-driven initiative focused on UAM which interfaces with public transport; ATM/UTM concepts for UAM and its integration in view of single sky operations; determining the required UAM infrastructure; and mobility as a service. The initiative aims to give rise to partnerships that will facilitate project applications and could lead to applied demonstrator studies in EU cities. To date, 17 European cities are onboard, with 12 projects scheduled to start in 2019, ranging from an exploration of air taxi use to how drones might benefit logistics hubs or deliver critical medical supplies.”

HI: How are the talks with regulators going? What countries are most willing to accept VTOLs (private or commercial)?

Jörg Müller: “We have had preliminary discussions and are working with regulatory bodies to bring future eVTOLs to cities across the globe that experience traffic congestion. We are encouraged by the dialogue that has taken place to date. The three biggest aspects of legislation and regulation that are presently evolving are aircraft certification, airspace integration, and air traffic management. Airbus has ample experience in aircraft certification—we know how long it takes to get an aircraft certified and what resources are needed. We are targeting to type certify our aircraft and are working hand-in-hand with regulators and standards bodies to develop a model for managing large-scale automated flight within urban environments.”

HI: What have we got to look forward to from Airbus in 2018?

Jörg Müller: “In late October we achieved the first “power on” for CityAirbus, which we’re proud of, and we anticipate the first flight to be early next year. The next major milestone for Vahana follows the testing of the cruise and landing phase hazard detection system, the transition to cruising flight. We’re also looking forward to rolling out Voom in cities in Asia and beyond.”

HI: Are you worried about peoples’ willingness to fly in an autonomous vehicle?

Jörg Müller: “At Airbus, our mission is not moving ahead with autonomy as a means to an end, but to connect and protect people– public acceptance and comfort are principles that are at the core of everything we do.

“Consequently, it’s worth noting that the principle of autonomous systems has long-existed. We saw “piloted” trains and elevators eventually give way to automated ones, and in fact autonomy, or at least unmanned remotely-controlled vehicles, are already a reality today across Airbus’ entire portfolio.

“As we look forward, we recognise that we are not only building transportation solutions for our current generation, but also for our children’s for whom autonomy will be synonymous with convenience and safety. That said, as we are pursuing a variety of strategies in the UAM organisation and we have the flexibility to adapt to customer needs.”

Airbus wins December deliveries some breathing room after busy November - Business Insider,"Fri, 07 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vci1haXJidXMtd2lucy1kZWNlbWJlci1kZWxpdmVyaWVzLXNvbWUtYnJlYXRoaW5nLXJvb20tYWZ0ZXItYnVzeS1ub3ZlbWJlci0yMDE4LTEy0gF1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9yLWFpcmJ1cy13aW5zLWRlY2VtYmVyLWRlbGl2ZXJpZXMtc29tZS1icmVhdGhpbmctcm9vbS1hZnRlci1idXN5LW5vdmVtYmVyLTIwMTgtMTI_YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"An Airbus A330neo is pictured on its final assembly line at Airbus headquarters in Colomiers, near Toulouse Thomson Reuters

PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus has left itself a slightly less challenging task on deliveries for the final weeks of the year than 2017's record surge in December, but only after trimming the target with its most recent results, company data showed on Friday.

Airbus said it had delivered 673 aircraft up to the end of November, leaving 109 aircraft still to be delivered in December in order to reach a core target of 782 deliveries - excluding the recently acquired Bombardier CSeries, now selling as the A220.

Airbus in October said it maintained a target of 800 deliveries for 2018, but that these would now include 18 A220 models previously been excluded from the goal - a move equivalent to cutting the core Airbus target by 2 percent to 782 aircraft.

Had it not done so, it would have had to repeat last year's record feat of 127 deliveries in December, after taking into account a 20 percent rise in deliveries last month.

Airbus recently took formal control of the former Bombardier A220 after buying it to bolster its lineup of larger jets and thwart a possible sale of the project to China, a future aerospace rival.

Still, it has been struggling to keep its own deliveries on track this year due to a combination of engine delays and industrial problems.

Most industry sources have estimated it will hit the recently softened target, but with a razor-thin margin for error.

November saw an acceleration of deliveries to airlines linked to China's debt-laden HNA Group, including five for Beijing Capital airlines, directly or via leasing firms.

Related stories

Reuters last month reported Airbus was set to resume stalled deliveries of jets to HNA Group.

November also saw the first delivery of the upgraded A330neo long-range range model to TAP Portugal.

Further A330neo deliveries have been slowed by snags at engine maker Rolls-Royce and Airbus's incoming chief executive said last month those delays should be re-absorbed by end-2019.

Emirates took two A380 deliveries in November.

On the order front, Airbus sold 40 planes commercially plus three internally for conversion to air tankers.

Its January-November tally of 439 gross orders - or 380 after cancellations - leaves it well behind rival Boeing Co's totals of 821 gross and 642 net orders up to the end of October, the latest period for which figures are available.

Earlier on Friday, leasing firm Avolon firmed up an order for 100 A320-family aircraft that will appear in the year-end order count, due to be released in mid-January.

Airbus celebrates opening of the world's first Zephyr Solar High Altitude Pseudo-Satellite operating site - sUAS News,"Tue, 04 Dec 2018 06:04:14 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdWFzbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxOC8xMi9haXJidXMtY2VsZWJyYXRlcy1vcGVuaW5nLW9mLXRoZS13b3JsZHMtZmlyc3QtemVwaHlyLXNvbGFyLWhpZ2gtYWx0aXR1ZGUtcHNldWRvLXNhdGVsbGl0ZS1vcGVyYXRpbmctc2l0ZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus celebrates opening of the world’s first Zephyr Solar High Altitude Pseudo-Satellite operating site

Airbus Defence and Space announced the opening of the world’s first High Altitude Pseudo-Satellite (HAPS) flight base serving as the launch site for the Zephyr UAV in Wyndham, Western Australia.

This site has been chosen due to its largely unrestricted airspace and reliable weather and is the result of significant investment by Airbus into its Zephyr programme.

Zephyr is the world’s leading, solar electric, stratospheric Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). It harnesses the sun’s rays, running exclusively on solar power, above the weather and conventional air traffic; filling a capability gap complimentary to satellites, UAVs and manned aircraft to provide persistent local satellite-like services.

“I am delighted to welcome the Airbus team and their Zephyr project to Western Australia. This is the culmination of almost a year of hard work by Airbus and my Government to bring this exciting and innovative technology to our state. The Zephyr aircraft provides new capabilities to commercial and military customers and will bring an economic boost to the East Kimberley region,” said Premier of Western Australia, Hon. Mark McGowan MLA.

“The official opening of the Airbus Wyndham launch site in Western Australia, the world’s first operational HAPS site, marks the start of a new era for Zephyr. We are proud to see Australia become part of the Zephyr operational network. The site is our gateway to the stratosphere and will be the main flight base for Zephyr going forward.” said Jana Rosenmann, Head of Unmanned Aerial Systems at Airbus.

Zephyr will bring new see, sense and connect capabilities to both commercial and military customers. Zephyr will provide the potential to revolutionise disaster management, including monitoring the spread of wildfires or oil spills. It provides persistent surveillance, tracing the world’s changing environmental landscape and will be able to provide communications to the most unconnected parts of the world.

About the Airbus Zephyr Programme:

The original target mission of the Zephyr is to provide local persistence at an affordable price with a re-usable solar-powered aircraft, providing a wide scope of applications, ranging for example from maritime surveillance and services, border patrol missions, communications, forest fire detection and monitoring, or navigation. Operating in the stratosphere at an average altitude of 70,000 feet / 21 kilometers, the ultra-lightweight Zephyr has a wingspan of 25 meters and a weigh of less than 75kg, and flies above weather (clouds, jet streams) and above regular air traffic, covering local or regional footprints.

Ideally suited for “local persistence” (ISR/Intelligence, Surveillance & Reconnaissance), the Zephyr has the ability to stay focused on a specific area of interest (which can be hundreds of miles wide) while providing it with satellite-like communications and Earth observation services (with greater imagery granularity) over long periods of time without interruption."
"Airbus, Lockheed Join Forces to Pursue US Military Refueling Orders - Business Insider","Tue, 04 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vci1haXJidXMtbG9ja2hlZWQtam9pbi1mb3JjZXMtdG8tcHVyc3VlLXVzLW1pbGl0YXJ5LXJlZnVlbGluZy1vcmRlcnMtc291cmNlcy0yMDE4LTEy0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Europe's Airbus is teaming up with a new US partner, Lockheed Martin, to try to crack the US military air tanker market nearly eight years after losing out to rival Boeing in a bitter battle to supply refueling planes to the US Air Force.

Airbus and Lockheed, the biggest US arms maker, said on Tuesday they had signed an agreement to meet the growing demand for aerial refueling for the US military.

The agreement marks Airbus's first major foray into the huge US military market since its failed 2012 bid to merge with Britain's BAE Systems and its large US unit.

It kicks off a rerun of an epic battle between Airbus and Boeing, the world largest planemakers, that stretched for nearly a decade and saw two former Boeing executives sent to federal prison for ethics violations.

Airbus

Airbus, previously teamed with US weapons maker Northrop Grumman Corp, in 2008 had won a $35 billion contract to build its MRTT aerial refueling tankers for the US Air Force, only to see the deal overturned amid political pressure.

The US Air Force re-ran the competition and Boeing ultimately won a $49 billion contract in 2011 to build 179 767-based tankers for the US Air Force, but it has missed deadlines on the resulting KC-46A program and piled up some $3 billion in costs.

Now Airbus will work with Lockheed and go after the next possible aircraft and refueling service orders.

""By combining the innovation and expertise of Airbus and Lockheed Martin, we will be well-positioned to provide the United States Air Force with the advanced refueling solutions needed to meet 21st century security challenges,"" said Lockheed Chief Executive Marillyn Hewson in a statement.

Militaries rely on tankers — which are essentially flying gas stations — to extend their reach by refueling combat aircraft during military exercises or military missions. Demand has grown given the large number of longer-range military operations underway around the world.

Airbus is banking on the international success of its A330-based Multi Role Tanker Transport (MRTT), which has been selected by 12 countries, including Australia, Britain and South Korea. The aircraft is already refueling or capable of refueling most major US combat airplanes, including the stealthy F-35 fighter jet.

Lockheed, builder of the F-35 and the C-130J transport plane that can also be used as a tanker, will give Airbus a strong partner for future US bids, the companies said.

The U.S. Air Force, which wants to ultimately replace its entire fleet of over 400 tankers, is examining ways to meet growing demand for aerial refueling with possible fee-for-service arrangements, purchases of hundreds of additional aircraft, and the future development of a stealthy tanker.

Senior executives from Airbus and Lockheed agreed in Madrid to jointly explore all those opportunities, but are still working on details of their future cooperation, according to sources familiar with the matter.

China Eastern expands fleet with next-generation Airbus - China Daily,"Sat, 01 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoaW5hZGFpbHkuY29tLmNuL2EvMjAxODEyLzAxL1dTNWMwMjI1ZjdhMzEwZWZmMzAzMjhjMzcyLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The first A350-900 aircraft is delivered to China Eastern Airlines on Friday at the Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport. YIN LIQIN/CHINA NEWS SERVICE

China Eastern Airlines took delivery of its first A350-900 airplane at the Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport on Friday, in its latest bid to capture flyers in the premium long-haul intercontinental flight market.

China Eastern is set to receive two A350-900 aircraft in 2018, with 18 more scheduled for 2022, according to Liu Shaoyong, chairman of China Eastern. The delivery takes the size of China Eastern's fleet up to 700 aircraft.

""China Eastern carries more than 400,000 passengers across the world on a daily basis, and every year takes more than 120 million air travelers to 1,074 destinations in 174 nations and regions. All these safe and sound trips cannot be made without quality aircraft and engines,"" said Liu.

The introduction of the new model is also a response by the Shanghai-based airline to meet the exacting demands of today's passengers.

As a new generation flagship model, the A350-900, with an average list price of $317.4 million according to manufacturer, is the first Airbus to be built primarily using a carbon fiber reinforced polymer, helping to reduce weight and fuel costs. It also comes equipped with China Eastern's latest global leading passenger service system, adding up to a more spacious, greener and quieter air travel experience.

The cabin is divided into three parts: a business class section with 40 seats including four premium business seats, a super economy class area with 32 seats, and 216 economy class seats.

China Eastern is also using the plane to introduce its signature premium business class ""Air Living Room"", which features new seats, the airline's largest in-flight touch screen, a new generation in-flight entertainment system, full function bar, optimized cabin scene lighting, NFC (near field communication) reader for in-flight shopping and a Bluetooth earphone module, said Tang Bing, vice-president of China Eastern.

The airline has also upgraded its next generation services, ranging from service procedures to dining and in-flight amenities to elevate the travel experience.

China Eastern was the first Chinese airline to order an Airbus, and today oversees Asia's biggest Airbus fleet, with 300 A320 and nearly 60 A330 aircraft.

The first A350-900 will launch its maiden flight from Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport to Beijing Capital International Airport on Dec 4.

Flights will then gradually expand to other major destinations including Guangzhou, and Chengdu, before flying international long-haul routes from Shanghai to Europe, Australia and North America in January, 2019."
Airbus begins construction of new A220 facilities - SamChui.com - Sam Chui,"Wed, 05 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vc2FtY2h1aS5jb20vMjAxOC8xMi8wNS9haXJidXMtYmVnaW5zLWNvbnN0cnVjdGlvbi1vZi1uZXctYTIyMC1mYWNpbGl0aWVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus begins construction of new A220 facilities

With the majority acquisition of the Bombardier CSeries, which is now known as the Airbus A220, Airbus has been working with Bombardier engineers to determine the problems with the production of the type and has since come up with an extensive list of things to do.

Currently the A220 is manufactured in the same buildings as the Bombardier CRJ is built in Mirabel, causing issues with space, parts organisation and roll-out. Before Airbus took over the A220 program in July, Bombardier was keen on building 90-120 of the aircraft per year, however it was clear from the beginning that large changes would be required if that goal was to be achieved.

Now that the issues have been assessed, Airbus has confirmed construction of two new buildings at the Mirabel facility has commenced, enabling an increase in production once complete. The buildings, which Airbus are calling dome structures, are set to be completed by Spring 2019.

Looking at current figures, Bombardier only delivered 17 of the aircraft in 2017, with 2018 seeing just over 25 so far. Once complete and all tooling is set up in the new buildings, Airbus expects a steady rate of production to be achieved with a ramp up expected shortly after.

With Delta recently introducing the first of their 75 A220s into their fleet and airlines such as Air Canada and JetBlue set to receive them in the near future, Airbus is moving forward with their plans to include the A220 to their Mobile facility in Alabama, which currently builds A320 Family aircraft. Soil is expected to be turned for new assembly halls in early 2019 for the Mobile site, with full scale production to commence a few years after.

As Airbus continues to work with Bombardier in ensuring the aircraft remains competitive and efficient to produce, the greater output means more production slots will be available sooner, unlocking the potential for new orders. The announcement of the new facilities this soon after the acquisition outlines Airbus’ commitment to the type, which compared to before the purchase, told various airlines the A320 Family was the better option.

402 orders is a substantial backlog for an aircraft of this category and this backlog can only be maintained in both production and new orders if Airbus can get the aircraft to airlines on time."

“We are extremely excited to begin flying our new H145. We were immediately drawn to this striking helicopter when we saw it at the Heli Expo trade show in Las Vegas earlier this year,” said Luddy. “What really impressed us with the H145 was its large cabin capacity, high performance, safety features, stylish design, and configuration versatility, all of which make it an invaluable asset as we build our new business and expand others.”

The H145 was delivered out of Airbus Helicopters’ industrial facilities in Columbus, Mississippi, and will serve as the lead rotorcraft for SoCal Air Services out of Carlsbad, California. The company will operate the helicopter for charter flights, movie work, real estate operations and to support Luddy’s other business interests, including the World TeamTennis League, a sports property he owns with Billie Jean King.

Offering full-spectrum, mission-fit capabilities, the H145 is a modern and efficient twin-engine solution for corporate customers in the U.S. and worldwide. The latest model in the proven H145 family incorporates Airbus Helicopters’ advanced cockpit design and innovative Helionix avionics suite. Payload and range, along with a large cabin, allow for a superior transport experience, and the aircraft’s low sound levels enable neighborhood-friendly operations in urban areas. With capacity for up to nine passengers, the H145 is the perfect asset for any business or passenger transport mission.

“Airbus Helicopters is proud to welcome Fred and the entire SoCal Air Services team to the Airbus family, and we know that the H145 is going to be a perfect addition to their fixed wing fleet operations,” said Airbus Helicopters, Inc. chief operating officer Romain Trapp. “Providing a superior customer service is our main objective, and we sincerely look forward to supporting SoCal Air Services in the future.”

In North America, private and business helicopter operations represent the second largest civil market and nearly a quarter of the company’s projected bookings in the coming years. This segment has the most new operators, both new to Airbus and new to rotorcraft, of which most fly a fixed-wing aircraft."
Airbus tests market for A321XLR jet launch by mid-2019: sources - Yahoo!

By Tim Hepher PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus is talking to airlines about a longer-range version of its best-selling narrowbody jet family with a view to launching it by mid-2019 as it tries to head off a potential Boeing competitor, people familiar with the matter said. Pre-marketing of the so-called A321XLR comes as Boeing contemplates an all-new aircraft to serve mid-market demand worth hundreds of billions of dollars, with a final decision on both aircraft expected in 2019. Airbus has stepped up a gear and is actively ""testing the market"" for a newly defined XLR, one industry source said. Initial plans for the A321XLR were first reported by Reuters in June. It would sit at the top of a narrowbody range driving most Airbus profits. The upgrade would boost the A321's take-off weight to some 101 tonnes for the A321XLR compared with 97 tonnes for the longest-range A321LR, which can carry 206 people 4,000 miles in two classes and went to its first customer last month. It would rely on more powerful engines already offered as an option, giving 33,000 pounds of thrust instead of 30,000 pounds. An Airbus spokesman said the A321 ""still has lots of potential"" and declined comment on product strategy. Until now, Airbus has kept Boeing guessing on how it might respond to its plans for a New Mid-Sized Airplane (NMA) with 220-260 seats between traditional small and large jet segments. Among Airbus's top targets will be the major U.S. airlines, who could use the A321XLR to serve transatlantic routes with premium seats and who are also likely to be wooed by Boeing for its new jet. Their decisions could influence the fate of both projects. The A321XLR would be less attractive for low-cost carriers who could not exploit the extra range without giving up part of their 240-seat preferred layout due to structural limits. The contest for the middle of the market is expected to dominate the commercial jet industry in the coming year. Boeing aims to define a new corner of the jet market with a wide-cabin aircraft capable of operating as cheaply as the workhorse single-aisle planes like the A321 and its own 737. Without an all-new design on its drawing board, Airbus is trying to squeeze its rival by tweaking profitable models above and below the NMA, but has had limited success with its larger A330neo and is directing effort where it has the most advantage. With its A321XLR, Airbus aims to ""shoot at the NMA from below,"" a person familiar with the plans said. However, it has already shelved plans for a much more extensive redesign. Analysts say some questions remain about its performance, while the industry also faces an unresolved debate over how long passengers will sit in narrower fuselages as medium-haul jets get more and more range to complement dedicated long-haul jets.

ANA has firm orders for three A380s, becoming the first customer for the superjumbo in Japan. The airline will take delivery of the first A380 at the end of Q1 2019 and will operate the aircraft on the popular leisure Narita-Honolulu route.

The three ANA A380s will be painted in a special livery depicting sea turtles which are native to Hawaii. The first aircraft is blue, the second will be green and the third orange. The ANA A380 livery is one of the most elaborate ever painted by Airbus. It took 21 days for the Airbus team to paint a surface of 3,600m2 using 16 different shades of color.

The aircraft will now have completion of its cabin and enter a final phase of ground and flight tests in Hamburg, during which all cabin systems will be thoroughly tested, including air flow and air conditioning, lighting, galleys, lavatories, seats and in-flight entertainment. In parallel, Airbus will also undertake advanced aircraft performance tests before it flies back to Toulouse for preparation of its delivery and ferry flight.

As one of the world’s most prestigious airlines, ANA will be able to benefit from the A380’s proven operating economics and unrivalled passenger appeal. Offering more personal space than any other aircraft, the A380 is the most efficient solution to meeting growth on the world’s most heavily travelled routes, carrying more passengers with fewer flights at lower cost and emissions.

At the end of November, Airbus has delivered 232 A380s, with the aircraft now in service with 14 airlines worldwide."

The “Pop.Up Next” prototype drone, being developed by aviation giant Airbus, automaker Audi and the Italdesign design house is made up of three separate modules — a chassis with wheels, a two-seat capsule for passengers and a four-rotor drone. The concept has been shown before, but a one-quarter-size scale model made its maiden public flight at the Amsterdam Drone Week convention.

First, the drone flew across the hall and landed on a black parking spot. Then, a small car drove itself underneath the drone and its passenger capsule was lifted up to latch onto the underside of the drone. Once the two were docked, the drone lifted off again and flew back to its starting point, where the capsule was lowered onto another set of wheels to continue its journey.

The model’s test flight went off without a hitch, but don’t plan on hailing such an airborne ride any time soon. There are several steps to be taken before the Pop.Up Next — or a future iteration of the drone — is ready for commercial use.

“For this, we need to tick a list of boxes — the vehicle is one, safety is the overarching one, infrastructure is one, acceptability is another one,” said Airbus executive Jean Brice Dumont. “I think it will take more than a decade until a real significant, massive deployment of an air taxi system” is ready.

One serious competitor plans to be ready even earlier.

Uber unveiled an artist’s impression a year ago of a sleek machine it hopes to start using for demonstration flights in 2020 and to have in service in 2023. Uber’s battery-powered aircraft looks like a cross between a small plane and a helicopter, with fixed wings and rotors.

Meanwhile, a Dutch company has developed its own flying vehicle called the PAL-V Liberty that is a three-wheeled, two-seat car and gyroplane rolled into one.

At the Amsterdam convention, European regulators also are discussing how to keep the continent’s airspace safe as more and more drones take to the skies.

European Union rules are expected to come into force next year harmonizing drone regulations across the 28-nation bloc.

“As this industry is rapidly expanding, it is important for us to anticipate market developments and be prepared for change,” said Patrick Ky, executive director of the European Aviation Safety Agency."

After what seemed to be a slow and uncertain flight test campaign, Airbus has finally received certification for the smallest variant of the A320neo Family, the A319neo, marking the end for the three major developments in the line.

The initial variant, powered by CFM LEAP-1A engines, received simultaneous certification from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) after completing over 500 hours worth of flight testing since March 2017.

Certification for the other engine variant, the Pratt and Whitney PW1100G Geared Turbofan, is expected towards the end of 2019 and will use the same aircraft, MSN 6464, by removing the CFM engines and adjusting the aircraft software and engine mounting architecture. Airbus expects around 200 hours of flight testing will be required for the type.

As mentioned above, the A319neo is the third and final of the original and major variants of the A320neo/ceo line, however an impressive figure worth noting is this is the fifth aircraft/engine varient of the NEO Family certified over a three year period.

Orders for the A319neo aren’t huge, however, as Airbus currently only displays 53 for the type, of which, 17 are confirmed to be for CFM powered units and the remaining 36 with unidentified engine selections. A single ACJ319neo has been ordered, which Airbus states offers a range of 6,750 nautical miles or roughly 15 hours with eight passengers on board.

Although we’ve seen Airbus discuss further developments of the A320 Family, its likely the A319 will be the next of the legacy A320 designs to bid farewell, with the last being the A318 and its similar unpopularity to the 737-600, due to the market being covered by aircraft such as the Embraer E-Jet lineup.

Despite this and the fact that the Airbus A220 is a modern and somewhat overlaying aircraft for the market, the A319neo will be welcomed by the skies for years to come, with some airlines admiring the dedication Airbus has towards the family and the commonality it offers with existing A319s and their larger family members.

REUTERS/Regis Duvignau

PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus (AIR.PA) on Friday named services boss Philippe Mhun as its next head of programmes, succeeding defence and commercial aerospace veteran Didier Evrard, who is scheduled to retire.

The move completes a tandem of top-level industrial changes at Europe's largest aerospace group after Airbus last month hired Bosch appliances executive Michael Schoellhorn to replace soon-to-retire Chief Operating Officer Tom Williams.

Mhun, 56, is currently senior vice-president of services at Airbus - a fiercely competitive marketplace in which both Airbus and Boeing are targeting increases in revenue as they place after-market activities at the centre of future developments.

He began his career in engineering at the now defunct French airline UTA and followed it into Air France when UTA was absorbed into the French national carrier in the early 1990s.

In July, Mhun confirmed plans for Airbus to triple revenue from commercial aircraft services - such as spare parts and predictive maintenance data - to $10 billion in the next decade.

Boeing has said its possible next development, a mid-market jet carrying 220-260 passengers, will allow it to speed up the introduction of digital design methods so that future services revenues are factored in from the earliest planning stage.

Sources said Mhun's appointment will bring a customer perspective and an after-market emphasis to Airbus, which is also investing in digital tools to draw more business from the full life cycle of a jet, from design to retirement.

""It means that services will be driven deeply into programmes,"" a person familiar with the company said.

Evrard is credited with the execution of two of Europe's most ambitious aerospace projects, the Storm Shadow/SCALP cruise missile and A350 jetliner, with relatively few delays compared to past programmes such as the A380 superjumbo.

He had been due to retire earlier in 2018 but agreed to stay until year end, along with Chief Operating Officer Tom Williams, in order to tackle recent industrial and supplier problems.

The first serial-production H160 performed a flight demonstration at the Airbus Helicopters base in Marignane yesterday (17 December) after a seven-year development process.

Three previous prototype aircraft have already accumulated more than 1,000 flight hours.

The H160 will be delivered to launch customer Babcock in 2020. The aircraft took its first test flight on the 14th December. Babcock was first revealed as the H160 launch customer back in March at Helitech 2018 in Las Vegas.

The precise number of aircraft ordered was not revealed. Babcock will be using the aircraft for EMS and other critical-service missions, firstly in Europe, then deployed across Babcock’s bases worldwide.

A second prototype of the H160 finished a year-long demo tour – displaying capabilities for a variety of markets and end-users across the US.

The H160 was first expected to start deliveries in 2018. but this was pushed back to 2019. Now Babcock will be receiving its first H160 in 2020.

In early 2011, the H160 was debuted as a concept aircraft under the name Eurocopter X4. The helicopter was initially meant to be introduced in two stages, with an interim aircraft introduced in 2017 and an advanced version in 2020 which would feature further modifications.

The H160 is a medium-class helicopter and is considered as a direct competitor to Leonardo’s AW139 which has become the go-to helicopter for offshore oil and gas operations. The first AW139 was delivered in 2015.

The H160 seats two pilots and up to an extra 12 passengers, and has a maximum take of weight of 5,670kg. The aircraft cruises at 155kts and a maximum range of 460nm and promises 15% less fuel burn that current generation helicopter engines.

With low-cost transatlantic carriers digging into the bottom lines of major airlines, the response by many has been to reduce services and increase revenue through ancillary fees. However, the International Airlines Group (IAG), the parent company of airlines such as British Airways, Iberia and Aer Lingus, had decided to take a different approach by starting its own transatlantic low-cost airline, LEVEL.

One of the newest airlines to enter the low-cost transatlantic realm, the airline is the successor to OpenSkies, IAG premium-focused airline operating between the New York area and Paris, though with an expanded scope. LEVEL operates from European bases in Paris and Barcelona, serving popular destinations in North and South America, with limited short-haul flights within Europe.

Only starting transatlantic operations last year with backing from IAG, LEVEL has proven to be one of the most unique low-cost carriers flying the skies between Europe and the Americas. Just three months after replacing OpenSkies on the route, I flew on LEVEL from Newark Liberty International Airport to Paris’ Orly Airport and back in both economy and premium economy to see what’s its like to fly on an IAG transatlantic low-cost carrier.

The Flight in Economy

LEVEL began operations from Paris to Newark on Sept.4, coinciding with the closure of OpenSkies, on a four-times-weekly basis. While OpenSkies had focused on premium passengers with a small economy section of about 15 tows, LEVEL would be catering to the masses with an all-economy aircraft, though including a small premium economy cabin.

As the airline only operates one flight on the route, I was booked on LV8010 to Paris for the outbound flight departing at 10:40 p.m. and arriving in Paris at 12:10 p.m. Competing with a slew of airlines on the route such as Norwegian (until Jan. 10, 2019 when it exits the route), United and La Compagnie, LEVEL would have its work cut out for it on the Newark to Paris route.

The Airport

Having flown out of Newark Liberty International Airport just three months prior on the same route on Primera Air, I was confident about what to expect. I planned to arrive at check-in 2-hours before departure, enough time to check-in and clear the massive security lines at Newark’s Terminal B that form at that time of night. I figured that since LEVEL only operates one flight from Newark, check-in wouldn’t take long at all.

Arriving at Terminal B, there was very little LEVEL signage, with most official airport signs still referring to the airline as OpenSkies, which wasn’t technically wrong since the flight was still operated by an OpenSkies crew flying on an OpenSkies Air Transport Certificate. Though, I’m sure the scores of travelers taking the flight were not aware of that, undoubtedly leading to confusion.

However, LEVEL’s check-in desks were located on Level 1 of the terminal, exactly where Primera Air’s check-in counters were when I flew them in September. My guestimation that check-in would be a breeze was quickly proven wrong when I saw a seemingly unmoving and long line snaked around the ground floor of the terminal, wait times were about 30-45 minutes. There was also a separate line for Premium Economy passengers with no wait.

I wasn’t checking a bag but I needed a seat assignment as I couldn’t check-in online due to a glitch on the website. There were approximately four agents working the counter for what would be a completely full flight. I’d advise getting to the airport well in advance if you haven’t purchased a seat assignment if you want to try and score an aisle or window seat since LEVEL randomly assigns seats during online check-in.

Unlike Norwegian and Primera, there were no signs or placards about upgrades to Premium Economy. Typically, airlines sell cheap upgrades at the counter as a last minute way to score extra revenue, but I didn’t see any of that at LEVEL’s desk.

After getting my ticket, I headed to security at the far end of Terminal B in the high 50 and 60 gates, a favorite among low-costs since Norwegian also operates out of that part of the terminal and so did Primera when they were in operation.

With a wide array aircraft including a SWISS Airbus A330-300, LOT Polish Airlines Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner and Privilege Style Boeing 777-200, among others, operating from the terminal that night, the security line was quite long and was easily another 30-minutes at least. Again, arriving early is key since the flight was delayed to wait for passengers still in the security line.

Boarding for the overnight flight to Paris began promptly 40 minutes before departure. LEVEL uses a zone boarding system consisting of four zones, a welcomed change to the free for all on other low-costs I’ve experienced. A quick walk down the jetway and I was on a LEVEL aircraft for the first time.

The Aircraft

Currently, LEVEL’s fleet consists of two aircraft types, the Airbus A330-200 for long-haul flights and Airbus A321 for intra-European flights. The aircraft that would be taking us across the pond would be F-HLVL, delivered directly to LEVEL in May. LEVEL’s A330 fleet is split between French and Spanish registered aircraft, with Barcelona-based aircraft registered in Spain and operated by Iberia while Paris-based aircraft are registered in France and operated by OpenSkies.

Despite the various airlines operating the flights, its all within the IAG family and the crews and aircraft wear the blue and green colors of LEVEL. The aircraft wearing Spanish registrations were previously operated by Iberia before being shifted over to the LEVEL operation, a cost-saving measure than buying new aircraft as Norwegian Long Haul did with its Boeing 787 Dreamliners, though the A330 isn’t as fuel-efficient.

The first thing that struck me about the aircraft was how incredibly modern it was. The seats were exactly the same as I saw on Iberia’s Airbus A350-900 XWB product I toured in October and TAP Air Portugal’s Airbus A330-900neo, aside from legroom differences. While other low-costs have retreated from in-flight entertainment as a cost-saving measure, LEVEL fully embraces it and stands alongside Norwegian by offering seatback in-flight entertainment.

LEVEL’s Airbus A330-200s have blank seats in total in an all-economy configuration. Despite the addition of a 3-row premium economy cabin in the front of the aircraft, all seats in economy are the same pitch and width of 30-inches and 18 inches, respectively. There’s no extra legroom section besides the exit row or bulkhead seats throughout the aircraft.

With WOW air retiring its long-haul fleet of Airbus A330s, LEVEL stands as the primary transatlantic operator of low-cost Airbus A330s. Having flown previously on Norwegian’s Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner and Boeing 737 MAX 8, WOW air’s Airbus A321 and Primera Air’s Airbus A321neo, flying on an Airbus A330 was a welcomed experience since I’m a fan of the aircraft’s 2-4-2 configuration since its easier to get out from the window seat.

However, the A330 doesn’t have the passenger-friendly amenities of today’s ultra-modern aircraft such as increased humidity, lower cabin altitudes and ambient mood lighting, as found on aircraft such as the Boeing 787 Dreamliners operating for Norwegian.

The Seat

My seat for the flight was 29L in the aft economy cabin. Sitting down in it, I felt no different than when on the two previously mentioned aircraft. LEVEL was unique in that it used these seats instead of slimline seats or other lower density seats commonly found on low-cost carriers. Economy seats range from 30-34-inches of pitch, depending on location, with a width of 18-inches.

The seat featured above average amenities for a low-cost carrier including an adjustable headrest, folding and latched tray table, USB charging port and 110v AC power outlet, as well as a high definition in-flight entertainment system and in-flight WiFi. Additionally, the recline was quite generous and no different from a standard aircraft seat, which would prove useful on the overnight flight. This was clearly the most amenity-packed seat I’ve sat in on a low-cost carrier and was very impressive.

While the seat was comfortable, perhaps the style and thickness of the seat combined with the slight reduction in legroom made it seem quite cozy. However, I had ample room and had no complaints about legroom.

In-Flight Entertainment

LEVEL joins Norwegian Long Haul as one of the few transatlantic low-cost carriers to offer complimentary in-flight entertainment, offered through a seatback high definition screen. The system offers various entertainment choices such as movies, television shows and audio, but is not wide-ranging.

The screen is slightly smaller than standard, though was fine for movie watching. The movie page featured less than 30 movies and offered a mix between new releases and movies from past years, though the selection was good despite the limited quantity. The audio page, however, mostly contained a European selection.

I experienced complete rarity for a transatlantic low-cost airline when I saw that LEVEL offered in-flight WiFi. I recalled when I boarded my Norwegian flight from London to New York in premium when my seatmate was shocked when I told her there was no WiFi onboard. However, much to my dismay, the WiFi was inoperative and I would not be able to use it during the flight.

While there was flight information listed such as altitude, speed and arrival time, there was no moving map available, as found on Norwegian. Although flight information was continuously updated, a moving map is a useful tool when crossing the Atlantic.

The Service

Our departure from the gate was delayed nearly an hour as we waited for the remaining passengers stuck in the long security line. At first, I was surprised that a low-cost airline was willing to stick around for a few passengers; though, it makes sense since LEVEL doesn’t operate this flight daily and since its still new to the market, would want to ensure positive customer feedback.

Once all were on board, it was time to head to Paris. A quick pushback and taxi saw us in the air about 10-minutes after pushback. Once airborne, the seatbelt sign was turned off almost immediately, a commonality on European carriers that I’ll never understand since we were still banking when it was switched off and couldn’t be greater than 5,000 feet, if that.

Around 45-minutes into the flight, the meal and drink service was offered. LEVEL is able to offer a quicker service because of the on-demand buying system. Trolleys only stop at seats where a passenger has ordered a meal which reduces the time for the service and allows for more sleep on the 6-hour transatlantic hop.

LEVEL doesn’t supply complimentary pillows and blankets in economy, only in premium economy, though they can be purchased from the onboard shop. In a unique system, passengers select items via the in-flight entertainment system and complete the purchase on their mobile phone. The on-demand system eliminates the trolley services, with only pre-purchased meals distributed via trolley.

However, as the WiFi was inoperative on our aircraft, flight attendants came around to take orders manually using a credit card scanner. When it works, LEVEL is the only transatlantic low-cost airline to offer in-flight WiFi, undoubtedly helpful on some of the airline’s longer flights.

For those who hadn’t purchased a meal, the a la carte menu was quite extensive and ranged from 2.5 to no more than 10 euro from a wide array of snacks, drinks and meals. Hot meals were 9 euro, sandwiches and snack boxes 6 euro and snack items were no more than 5 euro. Soft drinks were 3 euro, water was 2.5 euro and alcohol ranged from 4 euro for beer to 6 for wine and no more than 9 euro for specialty drinks, with the exception of a 12 euro bottle of champagne.

Surprisingly, I had three options to choose from when selecting a meal: chicken, beef or pasta. I chose the chicken meal. Whether in premium economy or economy, the meal is served the same way, in a box with plastic utensils, containers and cups. I was eager to try the food since I heard nothing but good things from a fellow aviation writer who flew LEVEL last month and I was not disappointed. The meal consisted of a curry chicken with potatoes for the entrée, potato salad for the appetizer with a chocolate mousse cake for dessert with a dinner roll.

Although I skipped the potato salad and the dinner roll was a bit hard and cold, the main entrée and dessert were absolutely delicious. The chicken was incredibly flavorful and reminded me of a dish I hadn’t had in years, although the potatoes were a bit average. The chocolate mousse cake was a great finish to the meal. No complaints from me here.

Following the dinner service, the cabin settled down for overnight crossing. While I was excited about the deep recline of the seat, it was a double edged sword as the seat in front of me also had such a recline. When the seat in front is in full recline, it can be a little tight. The combination of a reduction of legroom and a deep recline do not really mix, but I managed to find a comfortable position and dozed off for a few hours.

Since we were due to arrive in the afternoon and were behind schedule, the sun came up about halfway through the flight. The pre-landing meal came quite early, about an hour and 30-minutes prior to landing, and consisted of strawberry yogurt and a wheat roll with jam served, again, in a box with a drink.

With eastbound service where passengers are trying to eek in every minute of sleep they can, I can see how this might’ve been an inconvenience. Had I been sleeping, I wouldn’t have wanted to be woken up that early prior to landing to eat.

Arrival in Paris

Despite a late departure, we arrived at Paris’ Orly Airport only 15-minutes late. This was my first time at Orly Airport and had no idea what to expect. In typical low-cost fashion, we taxied to a remote hardstand and deplaned via airstair.

However, this doesn’t appear to be a given since I saw other LEVEL aircraft at jetway-equipped gates. I always appreciate the airstair deplaning, though it took longer than expected since passengers were transported one bus at a time.

Arriving at passport control, the line was quite long but took no more than 20-minutes. Once on the other side, it was a quick OrlyBus ride to downtown Paris, far quicker and more convenient than Charles de Gaulle Airport, thus completing the first leg of my journey on LEVEL.

Final Thoughts on LEVEL Economy

While most low-cost carriers constantly remind you that you’re flying on a low-cost carrier, whether it be the seat or an aspect of the service, LEVEL was surprisingly in that it felt like a major carrier. If one purchases a meal and gets an aisle or window seat assignment, not uncommon on the A330 with middle seats existing only in the center aisle, there’s practically no difference between LEVEL and an airline like Iberia.

What impressed me the most were the seat amenities and the food. I’d never seen a more modern and well-equipped seat on a low-cost carrier than on LEVEL, which really makes a difference when flying these long-haul flights. Additionally, the food was some of the best I’ve experienced in all my travels, not only on low-cost carriers.

The mixed American and European crew was also incredibly friendly, making for a great in-flight service, and did not push ancillary items as much as other low-costs do. Having said that, however, LEVEL does charge for more things than other low-costs, such as water, and restricts the potential of a free sale by operating the on-demand shop.

While I’m not sure if the flight attendants would charge you if you wondered to the back and aspect for a cup of water, you weren’t going to get a free drink during the standard trolley service because it doesn’t exist. However, at the prices LEVEL is offering the tickets at, the onboard menu features reasonable prices and a wide variety of snacks and meals.

Would I take this flight again in economy? Absolutely.

The Flight in Premium

Returning from Paris to Newark, I was able to fly in LEVEL’s premium economy cabin, located in the first three rows of the aircraft. With Primera Air no longer in operation, Norwegian Long Haul and LEVEL stand alone as the only two low-cost transatlantic carriers to operate a premium economy class.

As LEVEL only operates one flight between the two cities, I was flying flight LV9 from Orly Airport to Liberty Airport on a Thursday night. The flight was scheduled to depart Paris at 7:00 p.m. and arrive in Newark at 9:50 p.m. Despite the near-9-hour flight time due to headwinds, this is the shortest westbound flight in LEVEL’s route network, though I had ample time to truly experience the product.

The Airport

Having only experienced passport control and baggage claim on my first visit to Orly Airport, I was excited to see what the rest of the airport looked like. An odd quirk is that LEVEL operates its long-haul flight from Orly while operating its intra-European service to Vienna out of Charles de Gaulle Airport on the other side of Paris, bad news for Austria-bound travelers.

LEVEL utilizes the West Terminal at Orly, used by long-haul operators at the airport including Air France among others. LEVEL’s check-in desks were fairly well managed compared to Newark, I had arrived exactly 2-hours before departure as I did in Newark and the line was shorter, though Paris is a LEVEL hub so that is to be expected.

At the check-in counter, I was able to use the separate premium economy line which had no wait. I had held off on checking in online because of a quirk in the LEVEL system where even premium economy passengers must pay for an advance seat assignment. Even during online check-in, a premium economy passenger must pay a fee to select a seat or accept a randomly assigned seat for free.

I was assigned a middle seat so I opted to not complete the check-in process online and wait until the counter, where I was given a window seat. I was surprised to be assigned a middle seat considering the large number of aisle and window seats open in the cabin when I boarded the plane.

Since our flight’s departure was scheduled for later in the evening and was one of the few flights to North America departing from Paris, there was virtually no wait for security or passport control, a problem I experienced at Charles de Gaulle Airport with Primera Air. Luckily, our aircraft had a gate with a jetway so we wouldn’t have to board via bus.

Long-haul widebody operations make up a small part of the airport’s operation and require going through exit passport control so long-haul airlines are relegated to a few gates and remain pretty constant. Our gate was 31, located in a small part of the terminal where only a handful of other flights, mainly Air France widebodies heading to France’s overseas territories, were operating from.

The post-security area of the terminal was nothing special, with only a few shops and an Air France lounge available to passengers in the terminal. For those who like to browse and shop before a flight, Orly’s pre-security offerings did not disappoint and featured a variety of stores. Additionally, premium economy passengers do not have access to lounges included with the ticket.

At the gate, initial boarding announcements were made 45 minutes before departure as passengers began to line up based on their zones. Ample signage helped assist the zone boarding process, but numerous passengers required an additional screening before the flight, so they get to head down the jetway first.

Boarding began on time, but once we headed down the corridor leading to the jetway, we were forced to wait in a holding area just before the jetway. The delay was due to a late arriving crew that was still prepping the aircraft. While we were waiting in the holding area, boarding continued and we were in a basic free for all with the zone process completely out of the window. We didn’t end up stepping onto the plane until 15 minutes prior to departure.

The aircraft was the same exact one that had taken us to Paris three days prior. Since then, it visited Montreal and Pointe a Pitre.

The Cabin and Seat

LEVEL’s premium economy is nearly identical to those found on major carriers, consisting of three rows and 21-seats in total in a 2-3-2 configuration. Coming in at 20-inches of width and 37-inches of pitch, the seat is actually 1-inch bigger than premium economy seats found on sister airline Iberia’s Airbus A350-900 XWB, according to SeatGuru.

While some low-cost carriers do not but walls between their economy and premium cabins, LEVEL’s premium economy was completely separated from economy via walls and curtains, giving it an exclusive feel. Flight attendants were even diligent about economy passengers using the forward lavatory and coming through the premium cabin.

In stark contrast to my flight on Primera’s premium cabin on the same route, a majority of the seats in premium economy on this flight were occupied. Out of the 21 seats, only eight were left unoccupied, a good load factor compared to what I’ve seen in the past. Additionally, this is an entirely separate cabin from economy so passengers cannot be randomly placed into these seats at check-in, unlike with WOW air’s bigseat product.

I was seated in 2L, a window seat on the right side of the aircraft facing forward. I had more than enough room in this seat, comparable to domestic business class in the United States, and felt fine as we prepared for the 9-hour flight to Newark.

The seat had all the same amenities as the economy seat including an adjustable headrest, USB charging port, 110v AC power outlet, folding tray table and high definition in-flight entertainment system, but also came with a footrest, water bottle holder, tethered remote, larger in-flight entertainment screen and a seatback coat hanger. However, the tethered remote had limited functionality and it was easier to use the touchscreen.

LEVEL provides a pillow and blanket on every seat, perfect for long-haul flights. Most of the amenities that come standard in premium can be purchased back in economy, including the amenity kit.

The Service

The premium economy cabin was serviced by one flight attendant dedicated to the cabin. Despite one person serving 13 people, the service was always quick and efficient. After taking our seats, premium economy passengers were offered a non-alcoholic pre-departure beverage with still water, sparkling water and orange juice as options.

Following the pre-departure beverage, amenity kits were distributed to premium economy passengers. The kits were one of the most unique, yet interesting that I’ve seen in all my travels. Instead of a bag or pouch, the casing of the amenity kit was a plastic, reusable water bottle with the contents. The kit contained the standard amenities such as a sleep mask, socks, headphones, hand sanitizer, dental kit, earplugs and a pen.

The kit was one of the most unique and including amenities I rarely see such as a pen and hand sanitizer. As a frequent traveler, the water bottle aspect comes in handle plus its environmentally friendly as the kits/water bottles can be reused instead of being thrown up after they’re used.

Departing from Orly Airport around an hour behind schedule, meal service began around 45-minutes into the flight. I had fallen asleep in that time and when I awoke, the attentive flight attendant immediately came around to take my order. Again, there were three options: beef, chicken or pork. Having had such a good chicken experience on the way in, I went for it again.

The dinner consisted of a chicken breast with gravy, string beans, mushrooms and mashed potatoes for an entrée, a small cold squash dish for an appetizer and a chocolate cake for dessert with a dinner roll. Just as on the outbound flight, I was absolutely blown away by the food quality. No complaints from me here. Additionally, we had the option to choose any drink, alcoholic and non-alcoholic, during the service.

After dinner, it was time to relax as we began our transatlantic crossing heading to Newark and our flight attendant came around to offer coffee and tea. The film selection had not changed and I decided to watch The Grand Budapest Hotel to pass the time, eventually drifting off again for four hours in the very comfortable seat before waking up over Canada. The screen was larger than in economy and great for watching movies.

About an hour and 15-minutes before landing in Newark, the pre-arrival snack service began. We had a choice of two sandwiches: ham and cheese or tomato and cheese, I chose the latter. The sandwich was the size of a dinner roll and was served hot with a KitKat bar and apricot Muesli bar on the side. Although a basic meal, it was more of a pre-arrival meal that I’ve had on other airlines, including major airlines, and was very tasty and filling.

The remainder of the flight consisted of the approach into Newark. The in-flight entertainment system was automatically turned off about 20-minutes prior to landing, I assume to make sure people are alert in case of an emergency. However, I felt as though it was too early since we still had a ways to go and we ended up going around on the first landing attempt, so passengers were without the in-flight entertainment for an extended period.

After landing, it was a quick taxi to our gate at Newark’s Terminal B and thanks to Global Entry, I was curbside in less than 10 minutes after the engines turned off. My journey on LEVEL was complete.

How LEVEL Stacks Up to Other Low-Costs

Having flown on every transatlantic low-cost airline, I can say that LEVEL was one of the most unique by far. Before the flight, I didn’t do much research into the in-flight product, besides my initial article on the airline when it first starting transatlantic operations, and found myself surprised that I was flying on a low-cost.

LEVEL offers in-flight WiFi, HD in-flight entertainment screens at every seat, an on-demand buy-on-board service and a slew of in-seat amenities, which makes it the most modern product, in my opinion, with the exception of the aircraft type used.

Economy

LEVEL’s economy product, by far, is the most surprising that I’ve seen. The seats are almost exactly the same to what can be found on some of the newest aircraft flying today, which I mentioned above. Although the seats are slim with less recline, they have ample cushioning and an adjustable headrest for increased comfort.

Additionally, the seats have no shortage of amenities from in-seat power to the in-flight entertainment system and everything in between, including a good recline. With regards to seat pitch, though, the 30-inches was only a bit tight when the person in front of me was in full recline. Otherwise, I had no problem with the seat pitch.

One problem that I foresee was the lack of seat diversity. WOW air and Primera Air, when it was still operating, had a choice between legroom types for those who didn’t mind paying more for greater seat pitch. On LEVEL, all seats are 30-inches of pitch, except bulkhead and exit row seats. Those a standard pitch makes for greater seat density, it doesn’t do much for helping ease the concerns of some passengers who aren’t comfortable with 30-inches.

As for the aircraft type, the A330-200 is a great aircraft in that the 2-4-2 configuration is great for window seat lovers, but it doesn’t have the amenities found on ultra-modern aircraft that make long-haul travel more bearable. Norwegian’s 787 fly comparable routes to LEVEL, but those aircraft have a slew of amenities to help ease the strain.

Premium Economy

As with economy, the premium economy cabin was identical to that found on major airlines. The seats were spacious and featured all the standard amenities, complete with a dedicated flight attendant and amenity kit. I had no complaints at all about the seat

The only airline to compare to is Norwegian since WOW air doesn’t feature a true premium economy cabin. Having a great experience on both airlines in their premium cabins, this was a hard decision to make, especially since they have a very similar product. However, what I liked about LEVEL more was the seatback HD in-flight entertainment screen as opposed to Norwegian’s in-arm IFE screen and the amenity kit.

Where Norwegian does win, however, is with off-the-plane amenities, such as lounge access and fast track security lane access, and a complimentary advance seat assignment. I don’t put as much weight into the off-the-plane amenities because when it comes down to it, the flight is the most important aspect.

Verdict on LEVEL

For the onboard experience alone, I give my vote to LEVEL. The aircraft offered a great experience, complemented by a great crew. However, both of my flights were delayed by about an hour for seemingly controllable reasons. Although the crew are experienced, it doesn’t appear the airport staff are, with the airline outsourcing to ground service companies. I would recommend the airline improve in those areas.

Additionally, the airline is truly ancillary fee based to the maximum. When booking, only one fare type is offered per cabin with no additional fare types with included amenities, as other airlines have done. I didn’t like that even though I was booked in premium economy on the way home that I couldn’t choose my seat in advance, leading me to cut my trip short by an hour to get to the airport as early as possible to ensure a favorable seat. Some low-costs have at least offered complimentary water, but LEVEL chose not to.

LEVEL is also an exception in the low-cost market because of its IAG backing, which explains how its able to offer such a product. While the product is great, the airline isn’t a homegrown low-cost transatlantic airline as its counterparts are, although that might be coming back to bite them as both Norwegian and WOW are having financial difficulties. Despite the IAG backing, though, the airline is offering passengers a good product and that’s all that matters.

Editor’s Note: The writer flew to Paris as a guest of LEVEL. However, all opinions are his own.

Author Thomas Pallini Tom has been flying for as long as he can remember. His first flight memory was on a Song Airlines 757 flying from LaGuardia to Orlando. Back then, he was afraid to fly because he thought you needed to jump off the plane in order to get off. Some years later, Tom is now a seasoned traveler, often flying to places just for the fun of it. Most of the time, he'll never leave the airport on his trips. If he's not at home or at work as a Line Service Technician at Long Island MacArthur Airport, he's off flying somewhere, but only for the day."

Safran Nacelles' latest large-sized nacelle enters airline service with the Airbus A330neo jetliner - Safran,"Sat, 15 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zYWZyYW4tZ3JvdXAuY29tL25ld3Mvc2FmcmFuLW5hY2VsbGVzLWxhdGVzdC1sYXJnZS1zaXplZC1uYWNlbGxlLWVudGVycy1haXJsaW5lLXNlcnZpY2UtYWlyYnVzLWEzMzBuZW8tamV0bGluZXItMjAxOC0xMi0xNdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"December 15, 2018

Safran Nacelles’ newest engine nacelle has entered service on Airbus’ A330neo with TAP Air Portugal’s introduction of the A330-900 – marking another important milestone underscoring Safran Nacelles’ position as an industry leader for nacelles that equip the world’s most modern jetliners.

This twin-engine aircraft is one of two A330neo (New Engine Option) versions equipped with Safran Nacelles-supplied nacelles, which benefit from the company’s experience in proven large-sized nacelle systems. Features of the A330neo nacelle include the extensive use of composite materials for lighter weight, enhanced performance through the optimization of its aerodynamics, and lower noise with the application of improved acoustic treatment.

Complete responsibility for A330neo nacelles

From design to engine integration, Safran Nacelles has complete responsibility for nacelles on the A330neo – which is offered by Airbus in the A330-900 version (seating 287 passengers with a typical three-class layout), and the shorter-fuselage A330-800 variant (accommodating 257 passengers in a similar three-class configuration).

With the A330neo’s nacelle sized at an external diameter of 3.65 meters, it is in the same very large category as the Safran Nacelles-built nacelles used on one of the largest passenger aircraft in service today – the Airbus A380.

Launch customer TAP Air Portugal inaugurated its A330neo service on the carrier’s 10-plus-hour route linking the Portuguese capital city of Lisbon to São Paulo, Brazil.

To date, Airbus has booked more than 220 firm orders for A330neo jetliners from airlines and leasing companies around the world – including U.S. based customers Delta Air Lines and Air Lease Corporation, along with operators and lessors in Europe, Asia, the Middle East and Africa. Airbus foresees strong new sales opportunities for the A330neo, taking into account the growing demand for longer-haul capacity in such key regions as China (the world’s fastest-growing air transport market), and well as replacements for aging twin-engine across the globe."

Investigators have released information to the public about an incident that occurred with a Brussels Airlines Airbus A330-200 that lost power in both of its engines.

The aircraft, registration OO-SFU, was performing flight SN358 from Kinshasa to Brussels on the 10th of December when the pilots received an Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor (ECAM) notification stating the left hand engine had failed/shutdown.

Upon notification, the pilots reduced their cruising altitude from 40,000 feet to below 27,000 feet to comply with single engine operation guidelines. Diversion options were put in place and a PAN-PAN was declared to air traffic control.

After completing all necessary actions, the pilots were able to relight the engine and progress with the flight, climbing back up to their desired cruising altitude.

No further issues came to the attention of the pilots for the duration of the flight until the approach phase, where the right hand engine failed while descending. The engine continued to relight and shutdown automatically, however was powered upon touchdown.

Additional information is limited and the airline is still carrying out checks to identify any damage within the engines and aircraft systems. The investigators are listing this incident as serious and will continue to work with the airline and its associated crews as well as Airbus.

The aircraft involved is powered by two Pratt and Whitney PW4168A engines and was delivered to the airline in 2013, however was manufactured in late 1999. In between manufacture and Brussels Airlines, airlines such as Lufthansa, Swiss International and the now non-existent Air Australia operated the aircraft.

Due to the extreme rarity of dual engine failures, investigators and the airline are suspecting fuel contamination from Kinshasa.

A notable incident to refer to regarding dual engine failure on an Airbus A330 is Air Transat flight 236, where both of the Rolls-Royce Trent 700 engines flamed out due to fuel starvation. The pilots were able to successfully glide the aircraft down to an air base, however causing substantial damage to the aircraft due to the reduced hydraulic and electronic equipment required for braking.

Investigations highlighted improper maintenance caused a fuel leak, which was worsened when the pilots tried to correct a fuel imbalance warning using the cross feed system.

Although this Brussels Airlines flight did not suffer from a fuel leak, the circumstances are similar, with power being lost to both of the engines, causing uncertainty in the pilots flying the aircraft, hence why this incident is regarded as serious."
Saudi Airline Flyadeal Abandons Airbus in Deal with Arch-Rival Boeing - paddleyourownkanoo.com,"Fri, 21 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBhZGRsZXlvdXJvd25rYW5vby5jb20vMjAxOC8xMi8yMS9zYXVkaS1haXJsaW5lLWZseWFkZWFsLWFiYW5kb25zLWFpcmJ1cy1pbi1kZWFsLXdpdGgtYXJjaC1yaXZhbC1ib2Vpbmcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Saudi Arabian airline Flyadeal has today announced a deal worth as much as $5.9 billion USD with American aerospace giant Boeing for up to 50 of its next-generation 737MAX narrowbody aircraft. The low-cost airline, which is a subsidiary of State-owned Saudia Airlines, has only been operating for little more than a year and has, until now, operated an all Airbus fleet of A320 aircraft.

The deal will prove a major blow to the Toulouse-based Airbus after the European aircraft manufacturer courted the Saudi Arabian upstart airline. Flyadeal took delivery of its ninth A320 a couple of weeks ago and Airbus had been in talks with the airline since 2016 to grow its fleet as it expands its presence in Saudia Arabia.

Traditionally, budget carriers have tended to operate a single aircraft type such as either the Airbus A320 family or Boeing 737 family in order to keep costs as low as possible. Other low-cost airlines have experienced quite a few problems from taking on rogue aircraft that have joined their fleet from a merger or acquisition, so it will be really interesting what Flyadeal decides to do with its A320 aircraft.

Flyadeal has placed a firm order for 30 Boeing 737Max aircraft and has options for 20 more. The list value for 50 aircraft stands at $5.9 billion although its likely that Flydeal won a significant discount from Boeing – especially when you consider the fact that the airline will have to overcome some significant hurdles from abandoning Airbus.

The 737MAX is Boeing’s next-generation version of the worlds most popular single-aisle aircraft. Boeing claims its MAX family aircraft are more fuel efficient, more environmentally friendly and have a greater range than traditional 737 aircraft. Airbus also offers an A320NEO option which is designed to provide an enhanced passenger experience with lower operating costs. The NEO stands for New Engine Option but Flyadeal decided not to take options on this variant of the aircraft.

Flyadeal’s current Airbus aircraft seat 186 passengers in an all-economy layout. The Jeddah-based airline is currently recruiting both male and female cabin crew."
TAP Air Portugal Adds Airbus A330neo to First US Route - The Points Guy,"Fri, 07 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9uZXdzL3RhcC1hMzMwbmVvLWZpcnN0LXVzLXJvdXRlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"TAP Air Portugal recently became the world's first airline to take delivery of the new Airbus A330neo, which will launch on the Lisbon (LIS) to Sao Paulo (GRU) route on Dec. 15. From there, the carrier has added the -900neo to four other Brazil destinations, including Belo Horizonte (CNF), Brasilia (BSB), Rio de Janeiro (GIG) and Salvador (SSA), with service launching to all four cities in 2019.

Now, we know when the airline will be bringing its new wide-body plane to the US — per @Airlineroute, TAP will begin flying the neo between Lisbon and Miami (MIA) on March 1, 2019.

Per ExpertFlyer, on that date, the aircraft configuration jumps from an older A330, with 2-2-2 angle-flat seating...

...to a brand-new neo, with a staggered 1-2-1 config.

Business travelers will notice the difference right away — the cabin is more spacious, with far more privacy throughout.

Economy seats maintain their 2-4-2 configuration, but feature more advanced inflight entertainment systems and an updated design.

As One Mile at a Time points out, TAP tends to offer excellent one-way business-class fares from Scandinavia, giving you an affordable option to check out this new aircraft. A one-way flight from Copenhagen (CPH) to Miami, with an overnight stop in Lisbon, will set you back just over 700 bucks.

Currently, TAP's showing both the A330-900neo and a mix of older A330s and A340s assigned to the LIS-MIA route — while it's possible the airline's working to add the neo to all upcoming Miami flights beginning March 1, 2019, it's just as likely that it'll operate a mixed fleet for some time on that route.

TAP recently announced new service to Chicago (ORD) and Washington, DC (IAD), both launching in June 2019. These new flights, in addition to TAP's existing routes to Newark (EWR) and New York (JFK), are expected to eventually shift to the A330-900neo as well.

220 Hours Flying The Airbus A220 – AVIATION ANALYST - Aviation Analyst — Alex Macheras,"Sun, 30 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb25hbmFseXN0LmNvLnVrLzIwMTgvMTIvMzAvMjIwLWhvdXJzLWZseWluZy10aGUtYWlyYnVzLWEyMjAv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"As the sun begins to set on the year 2018, I have now passed the ‘220-hours onboard flying hours of one of the world’s newest short-haul jets, the Airbus A220, in 2018’ mark.

It’s the aircraft that quickly became my favourite short-range jet to fly, a jet that combines genuine passenger comfort with aerodynamic efficiency, slick design, and new levels of ‘hushed’ engine tones.

I’ve flown the jet on its shortest routes (intra-Switzerland ) and on some of its longest (Malaga, Spain to Riga, Latvia, almost five hours flight time with headwinds). On this flight, pilots stumbled during their onboard announcement when it came to welcoming passengers onboard the ‘C Seri…—Airbus A220’.

The name change came after Airbus took a majority stake in the C Series program earlier this year, meaning European planemaker could establish a second aircraft final assembly line in Alabama, where it currently builds larger A320 family jets for U.S. airlines. The acquisition means C Series (now A220) aircraft destined for U.S. customer airlines are now “made in the USA” — which protects the aircraft program from any sudden tariffs from the Trump administration.

In addition to my 220 hours+ on the jet this year, I’ve had one of the most unique experiences a person on this earth can have, while on the A220. I was the only person (aside from the flight crew) onboard an Airbus A220 during an air performance, whereby my A220 jet performed ‘aerobatic’ manoeuvres through the snow-filled valleys of St. Moritz, during the yearly Ski Championships final.

In case it wasn’t thrilling enough — the ‘Patrouille Suisse’ (Swiss Military) joined us on each side of the aircraft, as ‘aerobatic escorts.’

If you’re yet to take flight on this quiet bird…here are some observations from this year’s flights onboard the A220.

“It’s essentially a ‘Baby’ version of the A350 XWB”

Which is ironic, as the jet started its life with no association to Airbus, and now finds itself a firm member of the Airbus family.

From my hundreds of flights onboard the aircraft, I’m continuously impressed by the true feeling of space, thanks to the cabin structure, and design of cabin features including the curvature of the overhead lockers.

Bombardier set out with a vision when creating this jet: a narrow-body jet, that feels like a wide-body jet — and it’s exactly what they achieved.

The A220 serves the 100-135 seat market, and while it’s found on short-range routes across the world, I’d feel happy crossing the Atlantic in such an aircraft, given its genuine cabin comfort.

“The ‘Different’ Physical Feeling of ‘Flight’ Is Noticeable”

Climbing to cruising altitude in the A220 isn’t comparable to any other single-aisle aircraft. It’s incredibly smooth, and as a result, feels faster. When the aircraft banks left or right, the aerodynamic motion of the turn is again, much like a larger jet. It’s also…silent. There isn’t a vibration to be felt, nor an obvious acceleration noise. Instead, the aircraft is much like a glider, gently climbing with very little sound.

The A220 is an incredibly capable jet. It has a takeoff field length as short as 1,460 metres. As a result, it’s the largest aircraft able to operate in the constrained environment of London City Airport, in the United Kingdom.

I’m not just fond of the aircraft from a flight performance perspective, but as a passenger, I have a sense of appreciation of the cabin decisions in the creation of this aircraft, which have been truly top-notch.

Large windows, similar to those on the 787 Dreamliner, have enabled me to see the world in a greater capacity…even on the Ski Championship performance flights.

The size of these windows is a key contributor to the ‘airy’ feeling I’ve been aware of on all 220+ hours of my A220 flights in 2018.

SWISS, the national airline of Switzerland, designed an entire cabin around the rarity that is this: the cabin doesn’t require any illumination during daylight hours.

In 2016, at the delivery of the first SWISS ‘Bombardier C Series” (as it was known), the aircraft impressed European spectators with its ‘futuristic’ look. A lady from the Swiss Chamber of Commerce told me “I’ve never seen such an ‘attractive plane!'”

It’s possible that, while I was standing at the door of this new aircraft at a typically-Swiss Delivery in Zurich, I may have underestimated the simple fact that this short-haul jet is truly in a league of its own. While commercially, it’s yet to be a success — aircraft orders for the A220 are making steady progress. Delta Air Lines, Air Tanzania, and Korean Air are all customers — but an upcoming 2019 Airbus-led sales boost campaign is set to target new airline customers in Asia, the Middle East, and South America.

Having joined Air Baltic for the delivery of their first C Series, I think back to how the airline executives beamed at the excitement of being able to enjoy an immediate 21% lower fuel burn for the CS300, compared with the airlines’ 32-year-old Boeing 737-300s.

Fuel remains among the highest of costs to an airline — and even the smallest percentage in savings is desperately sought after by airlines worldwide.

Earlier this year, following a 4+ hour flight onboard the A220 to the home of Air Baltic, I sat down with Air Baltic CEO Martin Gauss and his colleagues, of whom couldn’t have been clearer: they’re betting on this jet.

The airline is determining route networks, frequencies, and profitability forecasts based on the performance of its A220-300s — which continue to join the fleet every three weeks.

In my 220+ hours of A220 flight this year, have I found aspects of the aircraft I’m not so keen on? Of course. A minor, but a somewhat important example: the volume of the cabin chime, more commonly known as the ‘ding’ that can be heard in the cabin. Unlike the long haul A350, and A380 (which have a more gentle, discreet chime) it’s very loud and quickly becomes an annoyance. Every push of the cabin attendant button (one ‘ding’), every phone-call between galleys-cockpit (two ‘dings’), every seatbelt sign status change (one ‘ding’ per on/off), is at an unusually high volume, and enough to wake a sleeping passenger — I know this first hand. On another flight between Riga and Malaga, I counted 17 chimes in one hour. The flight was over four hours. You get the idea.

However, on the whole, I’ve disembarked the aircraft appreciating the A220’s place in modern day, short-range aviation.

There are air vents, large bathrooms, and even overhead screens — the same cannot be said for the likes of the Airbus A320neo, or Boeing 737MAX.

While I’ve found this aircraft to be continuously reliable, the aircraft will perform better this winter. That’s because the A220 has been certified to a higher autoland capability by the European safety regulator.

Both the A220-100 and -300 have been approved for low-weather minima autoland operations down to Category IIIa and IIIb. These type of approaches allow decision heights to be as little as zero, with specific minimum requirements for runway visibility, in the event of fog.

Final Thought

In the Summer of 2016, I joined the Bombardier teams for a test flight, on a ‘flight test vehicle’ C Series aircraft ‘FTV5’ — a test plane, belonging to the manufacturer. Executives explained how the aircraft was based on a clean-sheet design while incorporating advanced materials combining corrosion and fatigue-free composites, titanium and latest aluminium-lithium alloys for a lighter (and therefore more cost-efficient) aircraft — but for passengers, I wondered — would this jet make a real difference to the way we fly short-haul routes?

I often explain to passengers that the aircraft is a blank canvas, and it’s the airline who paint it. But with the largest overhead stowage in its class, the highest ceiling, the largest cabin, the widest seats, the widest aisle, the largest lavatories and the largest windows — this aircraft is the most beautiful ‘blank canvas’ in the modern age, short-haul aviation — prior to any airline involvement."
Cathay Airbus service thrives to Boeing's Seattle heartland - Airline Ratings,"Wed, 05 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyYXRpbmdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2NhdGhheS1haXJidXMtc2VydmljZS10aHJpdmVzLWJvZWluZ3Mtc2VhdHRsZS1oZWFydGxhbmQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Cathay Pacific will move quickly to boost its new Seattle service to daily flights in 2019 as it responds to “thriving demand”.

The new service will launch on March 31 as a four-times weekly operation but the response has been such that Cathay will add Monday, Wednesday and Friday flights from Hong Kong from July 1.

They will return from Seattle, the home of Boeing as well as technology companies Microsoft and Amazon, to the Asian financial hub the following day. Seattle, set in the scenic Pacific Northwest, is also a popular tourist attraction and cruise port.

READ: Cathay says no sign of hacked passenger details on dark web.

The airline will use its growing fleet of A350-900 aircraft on the route, which is its eighth to the US. Cathay also flies to Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York (JFK), New York (Newark), San Francisco and Washington DC.

The Seattle boost is among a number announced for next year’s northern summer

Cathay Pacific announced in October it would boost frequencies to Frankfurt and Madrid in response to feedback from customers.

The increases from Cathay’s Hong Kong hub see Frankfurt moving to 10 times weekly — an additional three flights a week from March 31, 2019, leaving Tuesdays, Fridays and Sundays.

Madrid moves to daily Cathay flights between June and October 2019 with two additional flights on Mondays and Wednesday using A350-900s.

The Hong Kong carrier announced a record nine new destinations in 2018 with new routes to Brussels, Copenhagen, Dublin, Nanning, Jinan and Washington D.C., Cape Town, Davao City and Medan.

Expanded business class menus, an aggressive roll-out of inflight wi-fi and new economy seating are among the changes Cathay Pacific passengers have been seeing as the airline battles increased competition and restructures its operations.

The Hong Kong-based carrier has a three-year transformation program underway as it moves to recover from two years of losses, including an $HK1.25 billion ($US160 million) net loss for the 2017 financial year.

It has been affected by fundamental changes that saw increased competition in many of its markets, including an aggressive expansion by mainland Chinese carriers.

Cathay’s October group traffic figures showed an increase in both the number of passengers and cargo compared to the same month in 2017.

Cathay Pacific and Cathay Dragon carried a total of 2,950,532 passengers in October, an increase of 0.9 percent compared to October 2017.

In the first ten months of 2018, the number of passengers carried grew by 1.9 percent while capacity increased by 3.1 percent.

Although load factors increased, Cathay commercial and cargo director Ronald Lam said economy class yields remained under pressure due to unfavorable currency trends and an increased mix of lower fares."

PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus has launched a strategic review to outline changes under incoming chief executive Guillaume Faury as it faces industrial challenges and prepares for overdue modernisation, industry sources said.

The ""Airbus Next Chapter"" review involves a team of planners working outside the normal strategy organisation in pursuit of a break from years of industrial problems, management feuds and an ongoing bribery scandal.

It is being led by investor relations chief Julie Kitcher in what one insider described as a signal to financial markets that profits will be embedded in strategy, as the once state-sponsored European project marks its 50th anniversary.

Planemaking boss Faury, who becomes CEO when Tom Enders retires next April, ""wants to go fast and introduce a new state of mind; he wants to turn the page on the past,"" a person familiar with the company said.

Airbus declined comment on the review, which is designed to war-game strategic decisions and possible structural changes.

Founded in 1969, Airbus <AIR.PA> has risen to compete on a par with Boeing and is one of Europe's leading exporters.

But its growth has been punctuated by Franco-German tensions, personal rivalries and most recently a crippling bribery investigation that accelerated management departures.

The review may address how Airbus can meet demand by sharply ramping up production of jets like its A320. One previous taboo that may come up for discussion is a fragmented production system securing jobs in Britain, France, Germany and Spain.

The A320 is the lifeblood of Europe's largest aerospace group, described by operations chief Tom Williams, who retires later this month, as the ""golden goose"".

Executives are warning Airbus must not find itself lacking in proven technology for the A320's successor after 2030, as it had been in wide-bodies when Boeing launched its 787.

For now, Airbus is winning a bigger slice of the market on the A320 but some analysts say it has fallen behind Boeing in manufacturing techniques - a gap that could grow if Boeing launches a mid-market jet with a new factory system.

Story continues

The review may study how Airbus can compete with Silicon Valley for talents in the digital era, while handling a wave of departures through retirements and a board-driven clearout.

Spurning global firms that typically work for Airbus, Faury has brought in Zurich-based consultants Egon Zehnder who are better known as head-hunters.

The roll-call of scheduled retirements continued this week as Alberto Gutierrez was named head of military aircraft as Fernando Alonso steps down after stabilising the troubled A400M.

Programmes chief Didier Evrard, who led two of Europe's most ambitious projects, the Storm Shadow/SCALP cruise missile and A350 jetliner, is due to retire this month and will be replaced by an internal candidate from services or engineering.

Some changes are happening already, with Airbus switching its quality-control chief this week after a series of snags.

In depth: Airbus' Racer fast helicopter set for 2020 test flight - Aerospace Testing International,"Tue, 11 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm9zcGFjZXRlc3RpbmdpbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlcy9pbi1kZXB0aC1haXJidXMtcmFjZXItZmFzdC1oZWxpY29wdGVyLXNldC1mb3ItMjAyMC10ZXN0LWZsaWdodC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"There is a lot of excitement and interest in Racer (Rapid And Cost-Efficient Rotorcraft) helicopter, a technology demonstrator being developed by Airbus Helicopters. The clock is ticking towards a planned first flight at the start of 2020 and Airbus engineers are working hard to meet the deadline.

The Racer demonstrator is a compound helicopter designed to be 50% faster than conventional helicopters, with a cruise speed of up to 400km/h (250mph), while being around 25% cheaper to run. The Racer project also aims to reduce the noise footprint and the fuel consumption compared to conventional helicopters by 15% and double the possible range achievable in one hour.

Compound helicopter’s key characteristic is that they are faster than conventional helicopters in horizontal flight. The performance improvement is achieved through the use of fixed wings and lateral rotors in combination with the traditional main rotor.

Racer features a box-wing design that provides lift in cruise mode while isolating passengers during ground operations from the pusher lateral rotors, which generate thrust in forward flight. The design builds on research carried out on the Airbus Helicopters’ X3 demonstrator.

The box wings are joined at the tips by the propellers’ bullet-shaped casing and are a key part of the helicopter’s design. The wings enable a good cruise efficiency, while they also have a small surface area above, which minimizes their interaction with the main rotor wake when the aircraft is in hover.

The two lateral propellers provide thrust for high-speed cruise and counteract the main rotor’s torque effect in hover, replacing the role of the tail rotor. While hovering, the asymmetric tail boom benefits from the interaction from the main rotor wake to provide a significant contribution to the anti-torque function.

Racer transitions from vertical to horizontal flight gradually. As the helicopter’s speed increases, the wings progressively take over the job of producing lift and the lateral propellers take over for forward motion.

Airbus Helicopters hopes Racer will be used by the police and search and rescue and emergency services, as well as for passenger transportation.

In development since 2017, the helicopter’s key subsystems passed a preliminary design review (PDR) during October 2018.

Tomasz Krysinski, head of research and innovation at Airbus Helicopters said, “The PDR was a major achievement for the Racer program because it allowed us to freeze interfaces and 3D definitions of the main subsystems, prior to detailed design and manufacture of the key components.”

Key components

At the time of writing, the first parts of the rotorcraft are being manufactured, with final assembly of the prototype scheduled to start towards the end of 2019. Airbus Helicopters has already started producing the lateral drive shaft, one of the Racer’s most complex components.

Meanwhile, several companies from across Europe are producing parts for the aircraft. Italy’s Avio Aero, a GE Aviation Business, is producing the lateral gear box’s housing, while Hamble UK based GE Aviation Integrated Systems is making the wing’s titanium cradle. Romania’s INCAS/Romaero is manufacturing the Racer’s composite side panel and Spain’s Aernnova the tail part’s primary structure.

A two-phased, 200-hour program of flight testing for Racer is expected to begin at the start of 2020.

The first phase of flight testing will focus on the progressive opening of the flight envelope and on assessing key performance objectives as well as speed, handling qualities, stability and aerodynamics.

The second phase will aim at demonstrating the aircraft’s suitability to carry out potential missions with increased speed and efficiency. These include emergency medical services, search and rescue and private transport. This second flight testing phase will also develop low-noise flight procedures.

Test challenges

There are both challenges and opportunities for engineers in Racer’s testing program. The innovative nature of the rotorcraft means that the testing program requires advances in flight test instrumentation (FTI) and data acquisition (DAQ) units.

One of the toughest parts of the testing setup has been identified as the acquisition of data between the rotating parts of the helicopter and the fuselage. The system has to acquire and transmit 64 data parameters from the main rotor, 32 per lateral rotor and also data from within the transmission shaft inside the wings.

The main use for the data obtained will be to optimize the operation of the rotors on the prototype.

Speaking at an event in Paris, France, during May 2018, Marc Seznec, head of FTI architecture and measurement for Airbus Helicopters said, “The question is, can we innovate to enable the transfer by wireless of a large amount of data in the flight test domain of the helicopter, so we can take into account such a high number of parameters.”

After a tendering process the task of developing and supplying the data acquisition units for Racer’s wireless data acquistion system was awarded to French firm Zodiac Aerospace as part of an EU-funded project called HIRIS (Helicopter Innovative Rotating Instrumentation System).

HIRIS is being tested before its use in Racer. The first test flight for HIRIS is planned to take place before March 2019.

Three different devices are being developed for Racer’s rotors and the drive shaft system. The devices will use a hybrid solution of proven technologies to ensure energy transmission on rotating parts and be contactless and wireless.

The main rotor has 64 parameters that have to be acquired, with a unit on the rotor head. The connection between the sensors and the DAQ is wired. “It’s a large amount of data, 64 parameters. That data will then be transferred wirelessly to a gateway on the FTI table within the main structure of the helicopter,” said Seznec.

Engineers have provided a wireless supply of power between the fixed part of the instrumentation and the rotating parts. “This power supply is monitored so we know the status of the sensor. We need to know if it is working and if we are at risk of losing power,” said Seznec.

Instrumentation for the lateral rotors’ uses a similar approach to the main rotor, except that the acquisition unit is fitted on to the side of the casing. The devices also transmit data to a gateway on the table and power is wirelessly transmitted to the fixed part from the rotating parts.

Seznec said, “The instrumentation in the shaft system is different. On each side there are three different shafts. One inputting power from the engine, one outputting power and the driveshaft. We are using soft-coupling and each has to be equipped with two quarter bridge sensors and one temperature sensor.”

The DAQs have to be able to withstand 2000rpm on the main rotor, 1500rpm on the lateral rotors and up to 9000rpm within the driveshaft, with margins for overspeed as well as temperatures of up to 100˚C and zero effect drift.

The team also has to verify that all of the sensors are in the correct position and calibrated, while allowing for the possibility of any electromagnetic interference and ensuring that the power supply remains consistent.

“We will take particular care where there is high speed rotation, because the shaft must be balanced. At the end we have to balance every shaft with the equipment attached, which is difficult,” said Seznec.

Space and weight

There are also constraints on space and weight for the data acquisition system. In total, the Racer FTI consists of 15 DAUs wirelessly linked with a capacity of 1200 lines of parameters and a weight of below 300kg.

“There has to be 15 data acquisition units and a few hundred lines of parameters for RACER,” said Seznec. “Despite this, the high number of innovations mean it is necessary to increase the capacity of the FTI.”

Engineers plan to install four DAQs in the fuselage, with one by the engine block. Six units are being placed in the gearbox.

“This is a big opportunity to innovate in terms of both helicopters and to improve wireless technology for test instrumentation in the future. This program will improve data transfer for large amounts of data.

“The next breakthrough for the next generation of device will be to use less power.”

The main pressure on Seznec and his team now is time. “We must fly by the end of 2020. There is no choice. Any new technology has to be proven in flight before then. It’s a big job.”"
Airbus rolls out first A380 for ANA - SamChui.com - Sam Chui,"Thu, 13 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vc2FtY2h1aS5jb20vMjAxOC8xMi8xMy9haXJidXMtcm9sbHMtb3V0LWZpcnN0LWEzODAtZm9yLWFuYS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus rolls out first A380 for ANA

After a many updates from All Nippon Airways (ANA) and Airbus about the status of their A380 order, the first aircraft for the airline has finally rolled out.

The aircraft, MSN 262, registration F-WSSH, is the first of three Rolls-Royce Trent 900 powered A380s the airline has on order and will undergo additional assembly before beginning its customer test flights prior to delivery.

ANA has firm orders for three A380s, becoming the first customer for the superjumbo in Japan. The airline will take delivery of the first A380 at the end of Q1 2019 and will operate the aircraft on the popular leisure Narita-Honolulu route.

The three ANA A380s will be painted in a special livery depicting sea turtles which are native to Hawaii. The first aircraft is blue, the second will be green and the third orange. The ANA A380 livery is one of the most elaborate ever painted by Airbus. It took 21 days for the Airbus team to paint a surface of 3,600m2 using 16 different shades of color.

The aircraft will now have completion of its cabin and enter a final phase of ground and flight tests in Hamburg, during which all cabin systems will be thoroughly tested, including air flow and air conditioning, lighting, galleys, lavatories, seats and in-flight entertainment. In parallel, Airbus will also undertake advanced aircraft performance tests before it flies back to Toulouse for preparation of its delivery and ferry flight.

The aircraft is set to fly from Japan to Hawaii 3x a week starting on May 24, 2019 with service on Tuesdays, Fridays and Saturdays. The service will increase 10x weekly as of July 1, 2019 when the second A380 enters service.

The aircraft will feature four cabins with five different seating options spread out in the following configuration:

Cabin Number of Seats First 8 Business 56 Premium Economy 73 Economy 383 Total 520

LAF renews HCare Infinite contract for AS365 N3 Dauphin helicopters - Airforce Technology,"Tue, 11 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmZvcmNlLXRlY2hub2xvZ3kuY29tL25ld3MvbGFmLWFpcmJ1cy1oY2FyZS1pbmZpbml0ZS1kYXVwaGluL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Lithuanian Air Force’s Dauphin AS365 N3+ search and rescue helicopter. Credit: © Ieva Budzeikaite / LAF.

The Lithuanian Air Force (LAF) has renewed the HCare Infinite material management contract with Airbus for its AS365 N3 Dauphin helicopters for another three years.

The contract renewal follows after the LAF’s fleet of three Dauphins attained 97% average availability over three years.

In October 2013, the Lithuanian Armed Forces signed a $58.14m contract with Airbus Helicopters (formerly Eurocopter) for three Dauphins.

The three Dauphin AS365 N3+ search and rescue (SAR) helicopters entered service with the LAF in 2015.

The contract included a three-year full warranty and Airbus’ commitment to maintaining at least an 80% fleet availability rate.

Šiauliai Air Base commander lieutenant colonel Antanas Matutis said: “Airbus has far exceeded the availability rate agreed upon in the HCare Infinite support and service contract, achieving near-perfect 97% fleet availability.

First American Airlines A321neo Flights Now Bookable - The Points Guy,"Sun, 16 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9uZXdzL2ZpcnN0LWFhLWEzMjFuZW8tZmxpZ2h0cy1ib29rYWJsZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"American Airlines has officially loaded the first batch of Airbus A321neo flights into the airline's schedule. The A321neo will be delivered to American in early 2019, and once test flights are completed, regularly scheduled passenger flights are scheduled to begin on April 2nd, 2019.

The Airbus A321neo is intended to serve as a versatile workhorse and will slowly replace other aircraft on a variety of North American routes. Initially, the aircraft will serve a set of fixed routes, mainly non-premium transcontinental flights, with flights to Hawaii and Anchorage also receiving the new Airbus in the summer months.

American Airlines Airbus A321neo's First Flights

Based on American's most recent schedule update, the first Airbus A321neo flight will take place on April 2nd, 2019, departing Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) for Phoenix Sky Harbor (PHX) at 6:05am, arriving in Phoenix at 7:35am. The first flight will be operated as American Airlines flight AA1895.

Other flights on April 2nd include:

Los Angeles (LAX) to Phoenix (PHX) : AA1895; Departing at 6:05am and Arriving at 7:35am

: AA1895; Departing at 6:05am and Arriving at 7:35am Phoenix (PHX) to Orlando (MCO) : AA682; Departing at 8:45am and Arriving at 3:52pm

: AA682; Departing at 8:45am and Arriving at 3:52pm Orlando (MCO) to Los Angeles (LAX) : AA219; Departing at 4:57pm and Arriving at 7:35pm

: AA219; Departing at 4:57pm and Arriving at 7:35pm Los Angeles (LAX) to Orlando (MCO) : AA2361; Departing at 7:20am and Arriving at 3:08pm

: AA2361; Departing at 7:20am and Arriving at 3:08pm Orlando (MCO) to Phoenix (PHX) : AA1022; Departing at 5:05pm and Arriving at 6:55pm

: AA1022; Departing at 5:05pm and Arriving at 6:55pm Phoenix (PHX) to Los Angeles (LAX): AA820; Departing at 8:05pm and Arriving at 9:40pm

These flights will continue to be operated with the Airbus A321neo for the foreseeable future, with additional A321neo flights likely being added into the current schedule as American takes delivery of additional aircraft and works to finalize its summer schedule.

Summer Flights Operated By the Airbus A321neo

In addition to the slew of domestic flights mentioned above, American has assigned the airline's new Airbus to longer domestic flights in the summer months. Flights from Phoenix to Hawaii and flights to Anchorage, AK (ANC), from Dallas and Phoenix will eventually receive NEO service late in the summer of 2019.

Flights that will see the A321neo later in the summer include:

Phoenix (PHX) to Anchorage (ANC) : Beginning on June 6th: Daily as AA1413; Departing at 6:50pm and Arriving at 11:30pm

: Beginning on June 6th: Daily as AA1413; Departing at 6:50pm and Arriving at 11:30pm Anchorage (ANC) to Phoenix (PHX): Beginning on June 7th: Daily as AA1372; Departing at 12:59am and Arriving at 7:39am

In an internal memo, American Airlines also says that ""later in 2019"" the A321neo ""will fly PHX to Hawaii as it replaces retiring Boeing 757s, and also from LAX to Hawaii.""

Booking the First A321neo Flights

The Airbus A321neo is proving especially hard to find in American's schedule. When the Boeing 737 MAX 8 was loaded into the airline's schedule, travelers could easily find the flights as the 737 MAX bears the equipment code ""7M8"", while all other Boeing 737s are noted by the code ""738"".

The A321neo originally shared the same code as not one but two other American Airbus aircraft. Both American's pre-merger Airbus A321-200 and Airbus A321-200T (transcon) are denoted by the code ""32B"", which was originally the code used to indicate the new Airbus A321neo. Now, American Airlines has updated the A321neo aircraft type to be ""32Q.""

American's Airbus A321neo aircraft are configured with 20 seats in the First Class cabin and 176 in the Main Cabin, for a total of 196 seats on board. 47 of the seats in the Main Cabin will be sold as Main Cabin Extra. When searching for the Airbus A321neo, click on the ""seat map"" link listed below each flight when searching on American's website. If there are five rows of first class arranged in a 2-2 configuration, that aircraft is an Airbus A321neo.

American Airlines has yet to load all fares into the airline's booking system, which means paid fares are almost entirely full fares. The first round of A321neo flights probably won't sell out for months unlike other inaugural flights so it's wise to wait a few hours for the fares to be adjusted.

Los Angeles to Phoenix on the First Airbus A321neo Flight for $743

Since fares aren't fully loaded yet, buying a ticket on the first flight is going to set you back more than $700 vs. $84 on other flights that day on the same route. It's actually a bit cheaper to purchase first class than economy:

The First Airbus A321neo Flights Are Not the Best Use of Miles

These flights are bookable with AAdvantage miles. However, as the fares aren't fully loaded, only full-fare AAnytime awards are available at this time. Considering the $743 cash price, this technically is more than 3.7 cents per mile in value. But again, we'd recommend waiting until the all fares are loaded.

What's the Big Deal With the Airbus A321neo?

American Airlines has 100 Airbus A321neo aircraft on order. These orders will be fulfilled through the 2020s. As American takes delivery of additional A321neo aircraft, it will become somewhat difficult to avoid flying the workhorse. Initially, American will use the A321neo on a variety of routes throughout North America. These routes will be similar to those which American has assigned longer non-premium routes with high passenger yields.

The Airbus A321neo is quite similar to American's Airbus A321-200s, though differs in one very specific way: NEO stands for New Engine Option. This is, as you might have guessed, where the two aircraft differ. The A321neo is more fuel efficient, features quieter engines and slightly updated avionics. Additionally, Airbus and the airlines operating the A321neo claim the aircraft is more passenger friendly.

For passengers on some airlines like Delta, this is definitely the case. For passengers traveling on American Airlines, the aircraft will likely be a slight upgrade over American's Airbus A321-200s that previously flew for US Airways. However, the A321neo will also be a noticeable downgrade from American's pre-merger Airbus A321-200s, which features seatback in-flight entertainment, fewer seats and power outlets at every seat.

The Airbus A321neo will feature power outlets at every seat and satellite-based Wi-Fi that's fast enough for passengers to stream content from sites like Netflix and Hulu. While that is certainly an improvement over the ex-US Airways Airbus A321s, the A321neo will still feature 9-15 more seats than other Airbus A321 configurations. The A321neo will also lack seatback entertainment and appears to have smaller lavatories than other A321 configurations. Two more improvements include mood-lighting and much larger overhead bins. Nevertheless, the Airbus A321neo is sure to receive mixed reviews from travelers.

This post has been updated since publishing to note that AA is now using the code ""32Q"" to signify the A321neo."

Hawaiian green sea turtles are painted on the aircraft. It is scheduled to be delivered to the Japanese carrier in Q1 2019.

ANA has firm orders for a total of three Airbus A380-800, which it placed in January 2016.

The first aircraft received the special livery in blue, while the turtles on the second one will be green and on the third one orange.

Airbus says it took the painters 21 days to paint the livery on a surface of 3600m². “The ANA A380 livery is one of the most elaborate ever painted by Airbus,” the aircraft manufacturer said in a press release. Next step for Airbus is to install the cabin in the ‘Superjumbo’. After that, flight testing will be carried out at Hamburg Finkenwerder, until the aircraft will be delivered to All Nippon Airways from Toulouse.

The Airbus A380s will operate exclusively on ANA’s route between Tokyo Narita and Honolulu, Hawaii, a very high demanded leisure route.

A319neo with CFM LEAP-1A engines wins joint Type Certification from FAA and EASA - Airbus,"Fri, 21 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOC0xMi1hMzE5bmVvLXdpdGgtY2ZtLWxlYXAtMWEtZW5naW5lcy13aW5zLWpvaW50LXR5cGUtY2VydGlmaWNhdGlvbi1mcm9t0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The A319neo powered by CFM International LEAP-1A engines has achieved joint Type Certification from both the US FAA and European EASA airworthiness authorities. This means that now all three aircraft models – the A319neo, A320neo and A321neo – are certified by the international authorities to operate with the CFM LEAP-1A engine option.

This latest achievement follows an intensive certification flight test programme since the A319neo’s first flight in March last year, with this variant having now accumulated over 500 flight hours. The A319neo with LEAP-1A engines is the fifth* airframe/engine variant of the NEO family certified over the last three years. Its certification also paves the way for the ACJ319neo (Airbus Corporate Jet) variant to enter service with VIP operators during the first half of 2019.

The A319neo is the shortened-fuselage member of Airbus’ game-changing A320neo product line. This airliner can seat 140 passengers in two classes or as many as 160 in a high-density layout with a range of up to 3,750 nautical miles, while its impressive takeoff performance enables it to operate from even the most challenging and remote airports. Meanwhile, the ACJ319neo’s ability to fly eight VIP passengers 6,750 nm or 15 hours will bring much of the world within non-stop range.

The A320neo Family offers a choice of two new-generation engine options (the PurePower PW1100G from Pratt & Whitney and the LEAP-1A from CFM International), as well as the incorporation of large, fuel-saving “Sharklet” wingtip devices. Moreover, the NEO Family is the world’s best-selling single-aisle product line with over 6,200 ordered from over 100 customers since its launch, capturing some 60% share of the market. Thanks to their wide cabins, all members of this family offer unmatched comfort in all classes and 18” wide seats in economy as standard.

*Note: Certification of the A319neo with LEAP-1A engines follows these previous variant Type Certifications:

Aircraft lessor, Avolon, has signed a firm order for 100 Airbus A320 Family aircraft in a deal worth $11.5 billion according to list prices and Avalon themselves.

The order consists of 75 A320neos and 25 A321neos, all of which without an engine selection, and takes Avolon’s total order with Airbus to 284 aircraft (240 single aisle and 44 widebody).

Chief Executive Officer of Avolon, Domhnal Slattery, reflected on the order in the following statement to media:

“Our order for 100 A320neo Family aircraft builds on our leading industry position and reflects our ambition to become the global leader in the sector.”

Continuing on, Slattery outlines the market state which led to the order:

“We continue to see robust demand from our customers for the A320neo Family globally. This is consistent with our own market research and global fleet forecast. This order affirms our belief in the medium-term market outlook and the strong growth prospects for our business and our shareholders.”

Avolon was quick to note to media their position within Airbus‘ backlog, stating they’re the largest lessor backlog customer, taking into account both widebody and narrowbody aircraft on order.

Jumping back to widebody aircraft, Avolon was present at the recent delivery of TAP Air Portugal’s first Airbus A330neo, and were joined by Rolls-Royce and, of course, Airbus. You can read about the delivery here."
American's New Airbus A321neo Will Load Into Their Schedule Tonight - And Cram In 15 More Seats - View from the Wing,"Sat, 15 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vdmlld2Zyb210aGV3aW5nLmNvbS9hbWVyaWNhbnMtbmV3LWFpcmJ1cy1hMzIxbmVvLXdpbGwtbG9hZC1pbnRvLXRoZWlyLXNjaGVkdWxlLXRvbmlnaHQtYW5kLWNyYW0taW4tMTUtbW9yZS1zZWF0cy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"American Airlines has 100 A321 ‘neo’ or ‘new engine option’ planes on order (22 of these deliveries have been deferred). Back in August we learned that American would take delivery of its first neo in January. It would be a new ‘dense’ configuration with more seats than the airline has ever put into an A321 before. And that it would become the template for going back and adding seats to existing Airbus A321s as well.

At the end of September I revealed the details of just how American would be squeezing more seats into their Airbus A321 fleet just like they are doing with their Boeing 737s as well as adding more first class seats.

Legacy American A321s (not the cross country A321Ts) get 15 more seats in the same amount of space while legacy US Airways A321s get 9 more seats.



A321neo aircraft will have 196 total seats (remember: one flight attendant per 50 passengers, one more row would have cost them more money to crew the planes).



It’s 20 first class seats (5 rows, rather than the current 4), 47 Main Cabin Extra seats, and 129 regular coach seats.

This new Airbus A321neo aircraft is going to be loaded into American’s schedule overnight tonight and the first flights will be bookable starting Sunday.



American Airlines Airbus A321

Less Space For Each Passenger Means More Passengers

You might think that the Airbus A321 is a smaller aircraft that carries fewer passengers than a Boeing 757. And that’s normally true. However this configuration would actually cram more people into a smaller airframe than the current dense 757 American uses for Hawaii flights which has 188 seats!

They accomplish this with less distance between seats, less padding for each seat, and smaller lavatories.

The planes also get bigger overhead bins and on a separate faster track also get satellite wifi. There will be no seat back video in these planes, replacing the screens on legacy American aircraft with streaming entertainment you watch on your own device. American says most passengers already have their own devices — and while I never watch the stuff myself, customers say watching movies on their phones isn’t the same as a seat back screen.

Even first class has less legroom, and the standard first class seat they’ve been using is less comfortable too.



American’s New Less Comfortable MiQ Domestic First Class Seat With Less Legroom

Here’s the seat map for the new configuration:

Note that the arm rests in rows 8 and 17 as well as seat 27B do not move.

Flight attendants won’t like the layout — more customers to serve, especially more first class customers without any extra crew. So the layout document highlights more jump seats and dedicated power for flight attendants to charge their devices.

American’s defenders will say that this plane has just 4 more seats than Delta’s Airbus A321s. Three years ago Delta had 195 seats (compared to American’s 196 in this layout) but took away 3 seats because it was just too many and didn’t leave crew enough room to work.

Indeed it was just January when American’s CEO Doug Parker mocked the 195 seat Delta configuration, that they walked back, joking that it required putting crew seats on the lavatory doors.

Where and When the Plane Will Fly

American bases a given aircraft type in a specific city when it can. Just like the Boeing 737 MAX heavily centered on Miami, the A321neo starts out on the West Coast, based in Phoenix and Los Angeles.

The goal is that these planes will fly Phoenix and Los Angeles to Hawaii and Los Angeles to the East Coast. Hawaii flying with the aircraft is expected to start in September.

The very first flights, though, are planned for April 2 — domestic flights out of Phoenix and Los Angeles including the super long Phoenix – Anchorage flight for the summer schedule .

American will be operating a Boeing 787-8 this summer Dallas-Fort Worth – Anchorage, with lie flat business class seats (albeit an uncomfortable 9-across in economy). Phoenix – Anchorage isn’t that much shorter and will get the new densified first class and extra legroom coach. I know which flight I’d rather connect onto.

The flight won’t be nearly as bad as American’s new Boeing 737 MAX Brazil service, though!

The first flights for the A321neo load into the schedule overnight and become bookable on Sunday, December 16th. Three and a half months out, though, and with a new aircraft type that the carrier hasn’t flown yet, these schedules shouldn’t be considered firm.

American’s new densified domestic fleet — becoming more and more Spirit-like each week — is becoming harder to avoid. There are now 17 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft in the fleet — and 37 Boeing 737-800s have been retrofitted to be just as uncomfortable as the MAX."
Airbus Corporate Helicopters makes Middle East debut | News | Flight Global - Flightglobal,"Wed, 12 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vaGVsaWNvcHRlcnMvYWlyYnVzLWNvcnBvcmF0ZS1oZWxpY29wdGVycy1tYWtlcy1taWRkbGUtZWFzdC1kZWJ1dC8xMzA2MjkuYXJ0aWNsZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Corporate Helicopters has made its Middle East show debut at MEBAA. The move comes 18 months after the unit was created by its parent company to focus its efforts in the business aviation segment and bring it into line with its sister fixed-wing operation.

The company – which sits alongside Airbus Corporate Jets as a sister brand – marked the occasion with the unveiling of a VVIP cabin mock-up for its ACH145, which it is targeting at the region's high-end operators.

Nitin Sareen, ACH head of marketing, global business, says the new division will deal with a range of corporate helicopter users, from owner-flyers to large corporations.

""We are raising our game,"" he says, ""by offering a tailored approach to our customers along with high levels of service, we are starting to see demand grow.""

Sareen says 2018 deliveries of corporate-roled ACH aircraft look set to outstrip the 54 units shipped in 2017. ""The trend will continue upwards into 2019 and beyond, as we continue to concentrate on customer outcomes,"" he says.

Sareen expects the Mercedes-Benz-designed VVIP interior on display at MEBAA to trigger ""significant interest"" in the four- to eight-passenger ACH145.

The aircraft is the latest version of the twin-engined helicopter series, which includes the BK117, EC145 and H145. Sareen estimates that there are 1,300 examples in service globally. The first ACH145 was delivered to a Brazilian owner in October.

""We are now seeking to drum up sales of this latest model in the Middle East, and will launch a regional demo tour with the aircraft in 2019,"" he adds.
