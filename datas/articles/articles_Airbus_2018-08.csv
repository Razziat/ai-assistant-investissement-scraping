Is the Airbus 380 the future of air travel or a relic of the past? - The Washington Post,"Sun, 19 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitQFodHRwczovL3d3dy53YXNoaW5ndG9ucG9zdC5jb20vbG9jYWwvdHJhZmZpY2FuZGNvbW11dGluZy9pcy10aGUtYWlyYnVzLTM4MC10aGUtZnV0dXJlLW9mLWFpci10cmF2ZWwtb3ItYS1yZWxpYy1vZi10aGUtcGFzdC8yMDE4LzA4LzE5L2Q5OGJhZTgyLTUzOWYtMTFlOC05YzkxLTdkYWI1OTZlODI1Ml9zdG9yeS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It was designed to become the grande dame of aviation, an enormous modern plane that could seat 544 passengers — 853 if you squeezed people in — on two decks, replacing the venerable Boeing 747 with a new standard of luxury in flight. Just 11 years later — almost a nanosecond in the life of a commercial airplane — two Airbus 380s can’t find a home and are about to be broken up and sold for parts.

The A380 may still be the future of aviation — Airbus makes that argument — or it may be the relic of an era from which aviation has spun forward with startling speed. But there is no question that the giant aircraft is hanging by a thread after it was first delivered in 2007 with fanfare that suggested it was the Next Great Thing.

Moreover, what happens to the largest commercial aircraft on Earth may reflect an evolution in air travel caused, to put it most simply, because smaller planes can fly longer distances.

If you live in a big city, which is pretty much any city that is home to two or more major professional sports franchises, it’s a safe bet you’re in a hub for at least one airline, and maybe several.

Most of the rest of America is in a spoke city.

The hub system is one reason a flight from Boston to Denver might go through Chicago on United Airlines, Dallas on American Airlines or Atlanta on Delta Air Lines.

The hub-and-spoke system isn’t going to evaporate from domestic travel anytime soon, but there are several signs that over time it may erode.

The chairman and chief executive of Southwest Airlines, Gary Kelly, likes to say that “point-to-point is a scheduling philosophy.” While Southwest has hubs in 10 big-city airports, its planes fly an average of six flights each day, so it also provides direct flights between a lot of cities that are spokes for the three other big U.S. airlines.

The Boeing 737 has been Southwest’s plane of choice since the outset, but today’s Boeing 737 Max is a very different airplane from the one that first flew 51 years ago. Among the biggest changes, the 737 Max has more than doubled the distance it can fly. The plane that once had to make a refueling stop to get across the United States can fly from Philadelphia to Dublin.

For Southwest, the range of the 737 means later this year or early next, there will be flights to Hawaii from four California cities that aren’t San Francisco and Los Angeles, the state’s two big airline hubs.

“What the Max does for us,” Kelly said in an interview, “is it’s 40 percent quieter, it burns 13 to 14 percent less fuel, so the range is extended from the current model by about 15 percent.”

Two other twin-engine, fuel-efficient, long-range planes have entered the commercial market recently. The Airbus A330 Neo (about 250 or more passengers with a range of 6,800 miles) and the Boeing 787 Dreamliner (upward of 240 passengers depending on seating configuration, and a range of more than 9,000 miles).

At a mega-airline show in Britain last month, Airbus sold 34 A330s to AirAsia, while Boeing signed orders for 52 of the 787 Dreamliners. Boeing says it has received 1,365 orders for the 787. Not a single A380 was purchased.

It costs more for airlines and passengers to land at a hub airport, with London’s Heathrow setting a record a couple of years ago when a slot changed hands for $75 million. It’s generally cheaper, particularly for low-cost airlines, to fly to U.S. cities such as Austin; Hartford, Conn.; Tampa; or Oakland, Calif.

Throw in Providence, R.I., and Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and that’s what Norwegian Airlines is doing with a fleet of primarily Boeing 787s and the Boeing 737 Max.

Although foreign airlines fly dozens of A380s to hub airports in the United States each day, none of the three major U.S. carriers has bought one, even as they phase out their use of the Boeing 747, relying mostly on another Boeing, the 23-year-old 777, which can carry close to 400 passengers.

Delta, United and American own hundreds of other planes built by Airbus, a European multinational corporation with headquarters in Toulouse, France, so it’s not an aversion to Airbus that keeps them from buying the ­A380.

“It just doesn’t make sense to have a single big airplane as much as it does to have something like a 777 that’s a meaningfully large airplane without being a huge airplane like the 380,” said a spokesman for one of the big U.S. carriers who spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk candidly. “Taking an airplane like a 777 really would be too big to fill just on local demand alone, but when you collect people from spokes all over the place, you can run an airline.”

He acknowledged, however, that foreign airlines are providing point-to-point service that “we have to compete with.”

The Boeing 747 and the A380 have three things in common: They can carry several hundred passengers, passenger volume demands that they fly to hubs rather than spokes, and they both are four-engine planes.

Airlines total their profits based on a per-passenger yardstick, and by that margin the ­A380 provides the best profit bang for the buck — if it is full.

“The most expensive part of the aircraft is the engine,” said Bijan Vasigh, a professor at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University’s Daytona Beach, Fla., campus. “The Airbus 380 has four engines. If you don’t fill it up with 550 passengers, you may have lost your profit share.”

Emirates Airlines, the Dubai-based carrier that has bought 102 of the 222 A380s delivered thus far, cast Airbus a lifeline to keep the plane alive in January, when it placed a firm order for 20 more of the aircraft and an optional order for an additional 16.

That will extend A380 production until about 2029.

Unless economic or global catastrophe of some sort intervenes, air travel is expected to increase exponentially in the next decade. By Airbus’s calculations there are 58 megacities with more than 50,000 long-haul daily passengers. By 2036, Airbus says, the globe will be dotted with 95 megacities, boosting the number in the United States to 16 from 11.

“The market is going to very much drive more customers to this aircraft,” said Frank Vermiere, the Airbus marketing chief for the A380. “If we look at [air] traffic worldwide, it usually doubles every 15 years. That certainly will continue going forward.”

Vermiere says 80 percent of the current 58 megacities face stifling airport congestion.

The solution for megacity airport congestion, he says, is the ­A380’s ability to deliver more passengers than any commercial plane."
Unleashing the power of data - Airbus,"Wed, 29 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDE4LTA4LXVubGVhc2hpbmctdGhlLXBvd2VyLW9mLWRhdGHSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In less than three years’ time, Skywise has evolved from a promising concept to the aviation sector’s most robust data asset, with more than 6,000 users around the world now benefitting from this innovative, Airbus-developed platform on a weekly basis.

Skywise – which provides a single access point for the sharing of operational and flight data – is about making the right information available at the right time. To do so, it leverages the massive amount of data previously locked in company and functional silos across the industry to improve operational performance and business results for aircraft operators, suppliers and Airbus itself, as well as support digital transformation efforts.

Skywise presentation show more show less Skywise aims to become the single platform of reference used by all major aviation players to improve their operational performance and business results and to support their own digital transformation. Learn more from Airbus VP Digital Transformation Programmes, Matt Evans.

The Skywise story is only just beginning…

By adopting Skywise, customers benefit from a supercharged and ever-evolving digital platform. The main outcome is efficiencies, savings and revenue opportunities achieved by reducing operational interruptions, anticipating and optimising maintenance, burning less fuel, operating more efficiently, reducing workload and leaving room for third-party services.

Despite the fast growth and progress so far, the Skywise story is only just beginning. To maximise the value created on an industry-wide basis, Airbus will continue to grow it as a true ecosystem – bringing together many more companies and stakeholders around the shared goal of more efficient, greener and more comfortable air transportation.

Accommodating airline customers

Airbus launched Skywise as an open data platform for the aviation industry at the 2017 Paris Air Show, with several different products available to meet various needs and address specific groups of users. Skywise Core is the backbone of the entire Skywise infrastructure. It is a platform that integrates and processes data coming from Airbus’ own aircraft, as well as operational data from participating airlines.

The more data that is shared with Skywise, the more accurate its predictions and models will be for all users.

Airbus offers Skywise Core on a “shared value” business model: airlines use it at no cost in exchange for sharing operational data about their Airbus aircraft with the manufacturer. It’s a win-win scenario for both sides: airlines get access to a valuable platform to help them improve their own productivity, while Airbus gets access to valuable operational data.

Among the highlights are the delivery of EasyJet’s first of 30 A321neo aircraft on order, the company’s media briefing on its Skywise open data platform (which has been extended to suppliers), the biennial event’s daily flying presentations, and more.





Other offerings include Skywise Digital Services, which leverage Airbus expertise to address common issues across airlines, with applications that include predictive maintenance, reliability and health monitoring; while Skywise Connect allows Airbus to get the most data in the best possible way from each and every one of its aircraft.

Over 40 different projects across Airbus sites and functions are running on Skywise. These applications support data-driven decision-making by providing contextual data to the right people at the right time. And because the Skywise platform allows for easy re-use of data and algorithms, project teams can get started and deploy applications in a matter of weeks in some cases.

Supporting rotary-wing aircraft

In a bid to work towards ever greater customer satisfaction and competitiveness, Airbus Helicopters initiated its first Skywise plateau in June 2018. It will support employees and customers by simplifying access to Airbus Helicopters’ relevant data and helping to accelerate data processing.

The platform also is being used to measure progress on production and/or sales campaigns, as well as to diagnose and establish meaningful forecasts. Additionally, the retrofit of the industrial chain with harmonized and connected next-generation tools will allow Airbus to feed better quality data into Skywise, amplifying its benefits.

Skywise for the supply chain

Airbus announced it was extending Skywise to the supply chain in July 2018, enabling unprecedented improvements in the reliability, quality and performance of suppliers.

Since late last year, the company has been working with selected suppliers during an early adopter phase to evaluate features and functionalities.

Multiple ‘early adopter’ suppliers are working with Airbus to test and help mature the new supplier-related components of Skywise. These participants represent a very broad spectrum of specialties, including cabin, propulsion, aerostructures, materials and equipment/systems."

Airbus introduced the A320neo M3A (Modular Multi-Mission Aircraft) concept in July 2018. It is a military derivative of the Airbus A320 new engine option (NEO) twin-engine commercial jet airliner, designed and developed by Airbus.

The A320neo M3A concept is being evaluated by Airbus for various applications, including maritime patrol, airborne early warning and control (AEW&C), signals intelligence (SIGINT), and VIP transport.

The aircraft will be capable of performing missions such as C4ISR (command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance), maritime patrol, anti-submarine warfare and medical evacuation (medevac), as well as transportation of troops, passengers, VIPs and cargo.

A320neo M3A aircraft design and features

The airframe of the A320neo M3A military aircraft is based on the A320neo commercial fixed-wing aircraft, which is 35.57m long and 11.76m high. The maximum take-off and landing weights of the base platform are 79t and 67.4t, respectively.

The aircraft will feature two main backwards-swept wings with a wingspan of 35.8m. The wings will be fitted with 2.4m-tall wingtip devices, which improve fuel efficiency and aircraft performance by reducing drag. It will have a conventional tail assembly with a single vertical stabiliser.

The base configuration can accommodate up to 165 passengers in two classes, while its maximum seating capacity is 194. The cabin is 27.51m long and 3.7m wide, the cargo volume is approximately 37m³ and the fuselage width is 3.95m.

The aircraft features modular roll-on / roll-off (Ro/Ro) capability, which allows for ease of loading and unloading of payloads for airlift missions.

The aircraft’s glass cockpit will be equipped with flight information and liquid crystal displays, as well as different image processing technologies to handle high-resolution imagery acquired by the on-board imaging sensors. It will also incorporate a digital fly-by-wire flight control system to provide safe and efficient flight performance.

A large bubble observation window will be fitted on both sides of the fuselage for visual observation.

Armament and self-protection

The anti-submarine warfare variant of the A320neo M3A aircraft will be armed with up to eight torpedoes, which can be launched from the internal weapons bay to attack enemy submarines and surface ships.

The weapons bay will also carry sonobuoys to detect, localise, identify and track hostile underwater submarines using acoustic signals.

A self-protection system, comprising missile warning sensors and decoys, will be installed in the nose section to provide protection from surface-to-air missiles.

Payloads and communications

The multi-mission aircraft will be outfitted with a payload pod with electro-optic / infrared (EO/IR) sensors beneath the nose to collect real-time imagery and video for ISR, maritime patrol and anti-submarine warfare roles. It uses a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) to create high-resolution images.

A magnetic anomaly detector will be mounted at the rear of the aircraft to identify, detect and locate magnetic variations of underwater objects such as submarines.

The aircraft will also be equipped with secure communication systems to support operations under and beyond the line of sight (LOS / BLOS) conditions.

Other mission-specific payloads carried by the aircraft will include a C4ISR suite, SIGINT system, electronic support measures (ESM), acoustic system and surface search radar.

Propulsion and performance

The base variant of the A320neo M3A aircraft has two engine options, specifically the Pratt and Whitney PurePower PW1100G-JM-geared turbofan and CFM International LEAP-1A turbofan engines. Located under the wings, the engines deliver long-range and increased flight endurance.

The aircraft is capable of carrying 23,730l of fuel and offers a range of 6,300km."
H145M Battlefield Support Helicopter - Airforce Technology,"Mon, 06 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmZvcmNlLXRlY2hub2xvZ3kuY29tL3Byb2plY3RzL2gxNDVtLWJhdHRsZWZpZWxkLXN1cHBvcnQtaGVsaWNvcHRlci_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The H145M is a multi-role battlefield support helicopter from Airbus Helicopters.

Airbus Perlan Mission II soars to the highest altitude ever reached on a glider - World Air Sports Federation,"Wed, 29 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZhaS5vcmcvbmV3cy9haXJidXMtcGVybGFuLW1pc3Npb24taWktc29hcnMtaGlnaGVzdC1hbHRpdHVkZS1ldmVyLXJlYWNoZWQtZ2xpZGVy0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Soaring over the snow-capped Andes yesterday 28th August 2018, the engineless Airbus Perlan Mission II flew to an incredible 65,605 feet pressure altitude (19.9km) using stratospheric mountain waves to beat the current record-breaking flight set in September 2017.

The FAI is waiting for the record claim documentation to ratify this performance as a new world record. If ratified the flight would set a new record in the absolute altitude on a glider. It is the second time in just a few days that the aircraft has reached over 60,000 to beat their own existing world record.

To achieve this high altitude flight, the purpose-built, pressurised high-altitude glider also passed the Armstrong Line, the point in the atmosphere at which human blood boils unless protected. The crew - Jim Payne and Miguel Iturmendi – use a specially designed closed-loop rebreather system, in which the only oxygen used is what the crew metabolizes. The aircraft’s wings designed to be able to fly in less than 3% of normal air density and at temperatures of minus 70 degrees C, conditions approximating the surface of Mars.

This unique glider is the result of the work of the Perlan Project, a team of volunteers whose aim is for an engineless aircraft to fly to the edge of space at 90,000 feet, and explore how weather phenomena called ‘stratospheric mountain waves’ impact the ozone hole and change global climate models. The surrounding air temperature and chemistry is unaffected by the engineless craft, making it easier to study the atmosphere.

El Calafate in Argentina was the location for the successful flight. This remote area of Patagonia is ideally placed for such high altitude soaring because the stratospheric mountain waves are particularly strengthened by the polar vortex, a phenomenon which occurs only for a brief period each year.

The Perlan Project team wish to provide education and inspiration for young people seeking careers of exploration and adventure in engineering and science. Embracing innovation and exploring the boundaries of science are at the heart of the enterprise. Ed Warnock, CEA of The Perlan Project commented:

“This is a tremendous moment for all the volunteers and sponsors of Airbus Perlan Mission II who have been so dedicated to making our nonprofit aerospace initiative a reality. Our victory today, and whatever other milestones we achieve this year, are a testament to a pioneering spirit of exploration that runs through everyone on the project and through the organizations that support us.”

The science behind the flight

Glider pilots have surfed on mountain waves since 1932. The process is like surfing on a wave in the ocean, except the glider is in the wave rather than on the surface of the wave. Einar Enevoldson, a NASA Test Pilot, saw evidence that in regions closer to the Poles, in winter, the waves could extend above the troposphere and well into the stratosphere. Previously, no one had searched for waves in the stratosphere in sub-polar regions in winter. From 1992 until 1998 he gathered more evidence that these waves existed, and discovered that they might be strong enough to lift a sailplane to remarkable altitudes. In 1998 Dr. Elizabeth Austin joined Einar in the search for an understanding of stratospheric mountain waves. She found that the Polar Vortex, and one of its principal components, the stratospheric polar night jet, existing only in winter, provided the high-speed wind in the stratosphere that powered incredibly high waves. The Perlan Project was formed to explore these waves and soar them to the edge of space.

The Airbus Perlan 2 is a pressurized sailplane designed to fly at the edge of space where the air density is less than 2% of that of sea level. It carries a crew of two and scientific instruments needed to explore the stratospheric mountain waves. The aircraft has a gross weight of 1,800 pounds (816kg) and a wing span of 84 feet (25.6m). Its true flight speed at 90,000 will be 350 knots (403 mph). The cabin will be pressurized to 8.5 psi (14,500 feet). The crew breathe pure oxygen provided by a rebreather system.

The Perlan 2 will fly to 90,000 feet at the edge of space to explore the science of giant mountain waves that help create the ozone hole and change global climate models. This will require the engineering of a spacecraft with glider wings that can fly in less than 3% of normal air density and at temperatures of minus 70 degrees C, conditions approximating the surface of Mars. These missions will provide education and inspiration for young people seeking careers of exploration and adventure in engineering and science.

Airbus venture arm backing LeoLabs to build the 'Google Maps' of satellites - CNBC,"Sat, 25 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMTgvMDgvMjUvYWlyYnVzLXZlbnR1cmUtYXJtLWJhY2tzLWxlb2xhYnMtdG8tYnVpbGQtZ29vZ2xlLW1hcHMtb2Ytc2F0ZWxsaXRlcy5odG1s0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vYW1wLzIwMTgvMDgvMjUvYWlyYnVzLXZlbnR1cmUtYXJtLWJhY2tzLWxlb2xhYnMtdG8tYnVpbGQtZ29vZ2xlLW1hcHMtb2Ytc2F0ZWxsaXRlcy5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LeoLabs concept art. LeoLabs

In the loud and crowded world of satellites, start-up LeoLabs is working toward offering both governments and companies alike a solution to cut through the noise. Tens of thousands of objects fly around the Earth many times faster than a bullet, capable of destroying billions of dollars in equipment. LeoLabs wants to offer an infrastructure of equipment and software to enhance the eyes on the sky with a new source of risk-assessment data. ""Ninety-five percent of the risk of being hit by a piece of debris is not being tracked,"" CEO Dan Ceperley told CNBC. LeoLabs' most recent round of funding raised $13 million, with Airbus Ventures and WERU Investment leading the round, joined by Space Angels and Horizons Ventures. The cash means LeoLabs will begin building next-generation ground systems overseas, adding to the two it has in Midland, Texas and Fairbanks, Alaska. ""Starting next year,"" Ceperley said, these phased-array radar ground systems ""will be providing the information that makes tracking that debris possible."" ""You're looking at the first company trying to accomplish a Google Maps around the Earth,"" Airbus Ventures partner Julien Etaix told CNBC. LeoLabs estimates there are about 250,000 pieces of debris orbiting the Earth that are both not tracked and potentially disastrous if they collide with a satellite. The U.S. military is tracking about 23,000 objects in space around the Earth, according to AGI, a company which provides software to commercial and government entities to analyze and track objects. AGI estimates the current public catalogs only account for about 4 percent of the objects in space around the Earth.

An animation of the history of space debris around the Earth. Source: AGI ""It's our mission to be a global platform,"" says LeoLabs vice president of business development Alan DeClerck. ""The real currency of what we're able to do with the radar is frequency of observations."" LeoLabs sees three potential customer groups in the space industry: Satellite companies (which, shortly after a launch, want to know where a satellite is and whether it is healthy), public agencies (especially on the licensing and regulatory side of the public sector which are trying to avoid increase risk to assets in space) and insurers (which underwrite launches and satellite operations in space). ""We specifically got into the business now because now is when the wave of developments are happening,"" Ceperley said. ""15,000 new satellites are being slated to go into low Earth orbit over the next three to five years."" With thousands of satellites set to launch, LeoLabs sees the insurance business as a potential boon – especially given the existing risks. ""If you have a big data set then we use that as an example of what developing future applications for space is going to look like,"" DeClerck said. ""They can write applications that will be worth millions and millions of dollars to the insurance industry."" Airbus Ventures had contributed to the $4 million LeoLabs raised in the last two years but in this latest round stepped up as co-lead with WERU, a Japanese firm. Etaix explained that Airbus Ventures is not structured ""like other aerospace VC funds,"" saying that the firm ""is quite independent from Airbus."" ""We can connect with Airbus but we don't really force the marriage with Airbus,"" Etaix said. Etaix added that LeoLabs is already working with the broader Airbus, due to the ""number of businesses"" that could benefit from this technology, he said. ""Primarily OneWeb, because OneWeb is a project Airbus is heavily involved with because they need the data,"" Etaix said.

Airbus to provide new NATO Public Key Infrastructure for improved secure communications - Airbus,"Tue, 28 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOC0wOC1haXJidXMtdG8tcHJvdmlkZS1uZXctbmF0by1wdWJsaWMta2V5LWluZnJhc3RydWN0dXJlLWZvci1pbXByb3ZlZNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"@AirbusDefence

Brussels, 28 August 2018 – The NATO Communications and Information (NCI) Agency has awarded Airbus the Enterprise NATO Public Key Infrastructure (E-NPKI) contract to design, implement and deliver a new framework of services for the management of public key certificates. The purpose is to improve secure communications among NATO organisations as well as between NATO and other organisations and countries.

The new E-NPKI system will provide accredited certificate services on NATO networks up to secret level. Full service support including a test facility and training will take place across more than 70 NATO sites. The contract includes setting up a dedicated E-NPKI Service Desk that operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. It will ensure system availability, incident and configuration management as well as certificate and digital identity card management.

The capability delivered through this three year firm fixed price contract will be incorporated into NCIA’s service catalogue and will enable NATO nations to procure the NATO approved service.

The purpose of a public key infrastructure (PKI) is to facilitate the secure electronic transfer of information between people and entities, utilising techniques of asymmetric cryptography. It enables security services, such as confidentiality, integrity, non repudiation, and authentication, by applying rigid processes of registration and issuance of digital certificates that bind public keys with respective identities of entities such as: people, services, devices and organisations.

An effective PKI is a combination of hardware and software products along with policies and procedures able to manage the life cycle of digital certificates including creation, storage, distribution, and revocation.

The E-NPKI project, together with the IT Modernisation Project and the NATO Communications Infrastructure Project, are part of the wider IT modernisation programme named Polaris, which aims to transform NATO's static IT infrastructure into a homogeneous enterprise.

Airbus was awarded the NATO Communications Infrastructure Project few months ago. This new contract strengthens Airbus’s position as a NATO supplier for communication systems and services.

"Airbus Perlan Mission II Soars to Over 62,000 Feet, Setting Second Altitude World Record and Crossing Armstrong Line - BioSpace","Mon, 27 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iaW9zcGFjZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9yZWxlYXNlcy9haXJidXMtcGVybGFuLW1pc3Npb24taWktc29hcnMtdG8tb3Zlci02Mi0wMDAtZmVldC1zZXR0aW5nLXNlY29uZC1hbHRpdHVkZS13b3JsZC1yZWNvcmQtYW5kLWNyb3NzaW5nLWFybXN0cm9uZy1saW5lL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"EL CALAFATE, Argentina--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Airbus Perlan Mission II, the world’s first initiative to pilot an engineless aircraft to the edge of space, made history again yesterday in El Calafate, Argentina, by soaring in the stratosphere to a pressure altitude of over 62,000 feet (60,669 feet GPS altitude). This set a new gliding altitude world record, pending official validation.

Airbus Perlan Mission II, the world's first initiative to pilot an engineless aircraft to the edge of space, made aviation history yesterday in El Calafate, Argentina, by soaring in the stratosphere in the experimental Perlan 2 glider to a pressure altitude of over 62,000 feet. (Photo: Business Wire)

The pressurized Perlan 2 glider, which is designed to soar up to 90,000 feet, passed the Armstrong Line, the point in the atmosphere above which an unprotected human’s blood will boil if an aircraft loses pressurization.

This marks a second glider altitude world record for Jim Payne and Morgan Sandercock, the same two Perlan Project pilots who soared the Perlan 2 to 52,221 feet GPS altitude on Sept. 3, 2017, in the same remote region of Argentine Patagonia. The 2017 record broke a previous record that was set in 2006, in the unpressurized Perlan 1, by Perlan Project founder Einar Enevoldson and Steve Fossett.

“This is a tremendous moment for all the volunteers and sponsors of Airbus Perlan Mission II who have been so dedicated to making our nonprofit aerospace initiative a reality,” said Ed Warnock, CEO of The Perlan Project. “Our victory today, and whatever other milestones we achieve this year, are a testament to a pioneering spirit of exploration that runs through everyone on the project and through the organizations that support us.”

“Innovation is a buzzword in aerospace today, but Perlan truly embodies the kind of bold thinking and creativity that are core Airbus values,” said Tom Enders, Airbus CEO. “Perlan Project is achieving the seemingly impossible, and our support for this endeavor sends a message to our employees, suppliers and competitors that we will not settle for being anything less than extraordinary.”

Another first-of-its-kind achievement this year for the Perlan Project was the use of a special high-altitude tow plane rather than a conventional glider tow plane. During yesterday’s flight, Perlan 2 was towed to the base of the stratosphere by a Grob Egrett G520 turboprop, a high- altitude reconnaissance plane that was modified for the task earlier this summer. Operated by AV Experts, LLC, and flown by chief pilot Arne Vasenden, the Egrett released Perlan 2 at around 42,000 feet, the approximate service ceiling of an Airbus A380.

To soar into the highest areas of Earth’s atmosphere, Perlan 2 pilots catch a ride on stratospheric mountain waves, a weather phenomenon created when rising air currents behind mountain ranges are significantly strengthened by the polar vortex. The phenomenon occurs only for a brief period each year in just a few places on earth. Nestled within the Andes Mountains in Argentina, the area around El Calafate is one of those rare locations where these rising air currents can reach to 100,000 feet or more.

Built in Oregon and home-based in Minden, Nevada, the Perlan 2 glider incorporates a number of unique innovations to enable its ambitious mission:

A carbon-fiber capsule with a unique high-efficiency, passive cabin pressurization system that eliminates the need for heavy, power-hungry compressors.

A unique closed-loop rebreather system, in which the only oxygen used is what the crew metabolizes. It is the lightest and most efficient system for a sealed cabin, and its design has applications for other high-altitude aircraft.

An onboard “wave visualization system” that graphically displays areas of rising and sinking air in cockpits. For commercial flights, following lines of rising air would allow faster climbs and save fuel, while also helping aircraft avoid dangerous phenomena such as wind shear and severe downdrafts.

Unlike powered research aircraft, Perlan 2 does not affect the temperature or chemistry of the air around it, making it an ideal platform to study the atmosphere. The experiments carried aloft in its instrument bay are yielding new discoveries related to high-altitude flight, weather and climate change.

This season, Perlan 2 is flying with experiments developed by The Perlan Project’s science and research committee, as well as projects created in collaboration with organizations and schools in the U.S. and Argentina. Perlan 2 research projects currently include:

An experiment measuring radiation effects at high altitudes, designed by students from Cazenovia Central School & Ashford School in Connecticut. This project is in coordination with Teachers in Space, Inc., a nonprofit educational organization that stimulates student interest in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.

A flight data recorder, developed by Argentina’s Instituto de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas para la Defensa (CITEDEF).

A second flight data recorder, designed by students at Argentina’s La Universidad Tecnológica Nacional (UTN).

A space weather (radiation) instrument.

An experiment titled “Marshmallows in Space,” developed by the Oregon Museum of Science & Discovery to teach the scientific process to preschoolers.

Two new environmental sensors, developed by The Perlan Project.

The Perlan 2 will continue to pursue higher altitude flights and conduct research in the stratosphere as weather and winds permit through the middle of September.

Winch Design Fulfills a Jet Owner’s Dream of Having a Home in the Sky - Robb Report,"Sun, 05 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vcm9iYnJlcG9ydC5jb20vbW90b3JzL2F2aWF0aW9uL3dpbmNoLWRlc2lnbi1hY2ozMTktaW50ZXJpb3ItaG9tZS1lZzE4LTI4MDk0ODgv0gFaaHR0cHM6Ly9yb2JicmVwb3J0LmNvbS9tb3RvcnMvYXZpYXRpb24vd2luY2gtZGVzaWduLWFjajMxOS1pbnRlcmlvci1ob21lLWVnMTgtMjgwOTQ4OC9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A private plane may be the most time-efficient means of travel, but even on a business jet like the Airbus ACJ319, passengers can spend up to 13 hours aloft, with long legs that can cover up to 6,900 miles—about the distance from New York to Beijing. Given that fact, many owners dream of a “flying home in the sky,” says Jim Dixon, head of aviation for Winch Design, a boutique studio in London. “Our clients now ask for an interior that replicates their homes or yachts.”

This is far from the first time we’ve highlighted a Winch Design, but we were intrigued by the desire of one recent customer who came to Winch seeking an ACJ319 interior that would provide “a space in which to feel comfortable and experience travel not as a chore but a fine art,” says Dixon. Such designs present a series of challenges as aircraft interiors must meet complex international standards for airworthiness and safety as well as minimize weight as much as possible. Every additional ounce results in more fuel burned, and a higher rate of fuel consumption means less range between stops.

To make the owner’s dream a reality, Winch’s team designed a space that’s not only functional but also creates its own aura of peace and tranquility. The cabin features panels decorated with hand-carved mother-of-pearl, buttery-smooth leather furnishings, a saddle-hide–inspired leather floor with contrast stitching, soft lighting, and a sofa that transforms into a large daybed—all invitations to relax into the journey. “It’s a space that entices you to pull up an armchair, switch on a reading lamp, pour yourself a drink, and delve into your favorite book,” says Dixon. A faux bookshelf—populated with fake tomes designed by Winch—that doubles as concealed doors separates the living area from the master suite.

While this ACJ319 was delivered five years ago, it is now for sale on the secondary market through Sparfell & Partners—ready to make a new owner’s dream come true."
Hiratagakuen strengthens Japan's aeromedical operations with Airbus fleet - Airbus,"Fri, 31 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOC0wOC1oaXJhdGFnYWt1ZW4tc3RyZW5ndGhlbnMtamFwYW5zLWFlcm9tZWRpY2FsLW9wZXJhdGlvbnMtd2l0aC1haXJidXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Tokyo, Kansai-based helicopter operator Hiaratagakuen has welcomed its second H145//BK117D-2, following the milestone delivery of its first unit in December 2017. Currently operating 14 H135s and one H145//BK117D-2, this new H145//BK117D-2 will join Hiratagakuen’s growing fleet to support emergency medical service (EMS) missions, and serves as a passenger and material transport. The first H145//BK117D-2 already entered service in June 2018 for aeromedical operations at the Nagasaki Medical Centre in Nagasaki Prefecture.

With Japan’s full-scale deployment of air ambulances in 2001, EMS helicopters, otherwise known as ‘Doctor Helicopters’, have taken on more prominent roles in the country, enabling rapid evacuation of casualties from affected sites, and providing critical care without delay aboard medically equipped helicopters, while in transit to the medical facility. In 2010, the Kansai government implemented region-wide EMS support network and Hiratagakuen became its main operator of these life-saving missions. Today, there are over 50 helicopters supporting emergency medical missions in 42 prefectures across Japan.

Mitsuhiro Hirata, Vice President, Aviation Operation Division of Hiratagakuen said at the delivery ceremony: “Operating in a time-sensitive EMS environment where every second matters, it is important for us to be equipped with the right helicopters for these demanding aeromedical missions. We have been well supported by a strong Airbus fleet for nearly two decades, especially with the recent introduction of the H145//BK117D-2 helicopters into our operations. We are confident that the timely addition of the second H145 helicopter will augment our aeromedical operations, as we continue to perform life-saving missions safely in the country.”

Olivier Tillier, Managing Director of Airbus Helicopters Japan commented: “Airbus is happy to play a supportive role in Japan’s EMS ecosystem, especially with the first EMS-configured H145//BK117D-2 entering service into Hiratagakuen’s fleet early summer this year, joining soon by its second unit for aeromedical operations. Given its flexibility, agility and high operational efficiency, we know that our H145//BK117D-2 will continue to lend capable support to Hiratagakuen’s every EMS mission.”

The H145//BK117D-2 is developed in co-operation with Kawasaki Heavy Industries to deliver excellent performance throughout the flight envelope. It comes with the state-of-the-art Helionix avionics suite and designed-in mission capability and flexibility, especially in high and hot operating conditions. With a large cabin, a compact airframe and powerful engines, the H145//BK117D-2 is the aircraft of choice for a variety of missions including EMS, air rescue, law enforcement and aerial work. More than 1,400 H145//BK117D-2 helicopters have been delivered worldwide, achieving close to 5 million flight hours.

A tale of two herringbones and a sleeper seat - Runway Girl Network,"Wed, 29 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTgvMDgvYS10YWxlLW9mLXR3by1oZXJyaW5nYm9uZXMtYW5kLWEtc2xlZXBlci1zZWF0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"I try to keep an eye on the Chinese market whenever possible: after all, it’s going to be the largest in the world in the not too distant future, and it has a number of unique characteristics that make its context a thought-provoking one.

After politicking around the certification and delivery of two Airbus A350-900s, Air China and Sichuan Airlines took their first of the plastic fantastics this month. Just how delayed were they? Well, the aircraft have been sitting in Toulouse for so long that some of the Airbus photos I noticed when selecting from the gigabytes Airbus shot, are dated 7 September 2017. There’s a 7/9/7 joke in there somewhere, but a year’s delay to 8/8/18 is astounding — especially at a time when cabins are aging faster than ever before.

Indeed, they were clearly sitting there so long that the regular interiors photographers (whose names many close observers of the industry will recognise) started getting very arty indeed with their shots.

I for one am delighted, not least because it makes it easier to figure out which company manufactured which product, but it’s not ideal for PaxEx or for the bottom lines of either Airbus or the airlines.

On to the seats, where both carriers chose outward-facing herringbone seats, which are on balance pretty much the best you can get in the sub-suite space these days. That more of the relatively lower-priced Chinese carriers are offering this level of seating now is notable: both because they become compelling options for international travellers, and because the local market passengers who choose them by choice will now expect something similar from international carriers.

Neither airline revealed which products they are, but the design language has some suggestions.

Rockwell Collins’ Super Diamond has the screens positioned flat ahead of the passenger with the tray table sliding out from underneath it.

Zodiac Aerospace’s Cirrus, meanwhile, has a swing-out mechanism for both monitor and table.

Super Diamond’s geometrical polygons on the armrest away from the aisle are also a handy reference point.

I’m struck by just how different the material and finish choices from the two airlines’ interiors look in the images, too.

Air China has clearly invested more in the interiors look and feel, with an attractive modern moquette to the seat fabric and carpets, textured materials on the vertical and horizontal structures of the seats, and the all-important mood lighting scene ability that’s shown off in the photos.

It’s not clear whether Sichuan Airlines has mood lighting turned off or if it wasn’t programmed for the snaps taken almost a year ago, but what is clear are the decades-old styling choices.

Yawnworthy beige thermoplastics, passé basic fake wood and a blue leather cover that not only looks worse than other airlines were installing ten years ago but will also be also sticky and uncomfortable when seated for long periods of time just don’t cut it.

Frankly, it’s most striking that neither the airframer nor the seatmaker were able to persuade the carrier into something a little better.

With a fantastic panda paintjob on the outside of the aircraft, it strikes me that more attention needs to be paid to the interior as well.

Turning to the shorter haul end of the market — aboard 37 Shenzhen Airlines Boeing 737 MAX aircraft — the carrier has chosen the Recaro CL5710 recliners, but in a very deep-reclining, legrest-enabled cradle sleeper configuration.

“It is the only business class seat for short and medium-haul routes that is electrically adjustable and approved for Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 aircraft,” says Recaro, and with quite a lot of dual fleeting going on in Chinese skies that’s certainly a selling point.

But taken together with the investment from longhaul carriers, is this the start of a substantial uptick in the passenger experience within the Chinese market? Is it time for some airline soft diplomacy, or a realisation that other airlines within what China perceives to be its sphere of influence are eclipsing its own carriers? I’ll certainly be watching for more data points in this most fascinating of markets.

Zambia Airways to acquire Airbus widebodies - Minister - ch-aviation,"Thu, 09 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoLWF2aWF0aW9uLmNvbS9uZXdzLzY5NzY2LXphbWJpYS1haXJ3YXlzLXRvLWFjcXVpcmUtYWlyYnVzLXdpZGVib2RpZXMtbWluaXN0ZXLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Zambia Airways (ZN, Lusaka) is reportedly planning to acquire widebody jets from Airbus (AIB, Toulouse Blagnac) in line with its proposed launch of longhaul flights.

Minister of Transport and Communications, Brian Mushimba, told The Lusaka Times earlier this week that Zambia Airways would deploy ""turboprops"" for domestic Zambian and regional African flights with B737s being used to serve further off destinations such as Dubai International. The Airbus, he said, will also be used to run flights to New York JFK, a route predecessor Zambia Airways (1964) (Lusaka) used to serve via Monrovia Roberts, Liberia using a DC-10-30 back in the 1980/90s.

During the same interview, Mushimba also dispelled reports that first surfaced in July last year claiming the Zambian government would acquire at least one SSJ 100/95 from Sukhoi Civil Aircraft (Zhukovsky).

“I have repeatedly refuted the Russian plane story. Not sure why it has persisted. Zambia Airways is not talking to Russia about any planes. Please take it from me. Those are conspiracy theories,” he said.

Zambia Airways is a 55/45 joint-venture between the Zambian Government and Ethiopian Airlines (ET, Addis Ababa International) which is expected to launch operations in October this year. Although the latter's chief executive, Tewolde Gebremariam, has previously said that the Zambian carrier would operate Dash 8-400s and B737-800s, he has never alluded to its use of widebody aircraft.

Should the acquisition of widebody aircraft indeed prove accurate, it would fall in line with regional governments' aspirations of tapping into the aviation market where, at present, foreign operators such as Ethiopian, Kenya Airways, South African Airways, and Emirates, have near total control of local, outbound international flights.

Aside from Zambia, other countries in the region where state-owned entities are in the process of acquiring/have committed to acquiring widebodies include Tanzania (where Air Tanzania has ordered two B787-8s), Zimbabwe (where Zimbabwe Airways has acquired two B777-200(ER)s), Uganda (where Uganda Airlines is set to acquire two A330-800s in late 2020/2021), and the Democratic Republic of Congo (where Congo Airways is in the process of acquiring an A330)."

“These technologically-advanced helicopters offer the Australian Defence Force the latest in troop transport, search-and-rescue and reconnaissance capabilities. These projects have resulted in extensive Australian industry development,” he said.

Recently the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) and Airbus’s A330-based KC-30A MRTT achieved a major milestone of more than 100 million pounds of fuel delivered via air-to-air refuels as part of Australia’s missions on Operation OKRA in the Middle East.

As part of a coalition including Australia, France, Britain and the United States, Australia’s MRTT has refueled a variety of aircraft including Eurofighters, Rafales, Harriers and Globemasters.

Airbus this year selected Wyndham airfield in Western Australia as the first flight base for its pioneering Zephyr solar-powered unmanned aircraft, or drone. Known as High Altitude Pseudo Satellites (HAPS), Airbus will begin flights of the Zephyr which is extremely lightweight and makes virtually zero noise as it leaves and returns to its base.

It typically flies for days or weeks at a time without landing and operates at very high altitudes, far above even commercial airliners. It weighs less than 165 pounds (75 kilograms) and flies by charging its batteries from sunlight during the day and maintaining its high altitude at night, all under control from the ground. It is uniquely capable of providing persistent surveillance over land or sea, and hosting communications links for civil or military purposes.

As well as for military operations, Zephyrs can be used for humanitarian missions, precision farming guidance, environmental and security monitoring, and to provide internet coverage to regions of poor or zero connectivity.

Fraser said the stand also featured a virtual reality simulation of the Airbus MRH90 Taipan helicopter allowing participants to explore and interact in a realistic MRH90 cabin.

“The simulation showcases the multi-role cabin configurations and Australian unique enhancements for troops, weapons and equipment for Aeromedical Evacuation, Special Forces, Troop transport and more,” he added.

The realistic 3D environment accurate to the real aircraft, allows the user to experience what it is like to work in that environment. This simulation has been used as part of the design and development for the Aeromedical Evacuation configurations for the MRH90. The simulation includes interactive role equipment:

Medical equipment;

Taipan gun mounts;

FRED (Fast Roping and Extraction Devices);

Center rappelling; and

Troop seats

Also on the stand is an interactive augmented reality display of the H145M Deployable Light Helicopter, MRH90 Taipan, and ARH Tiger, showcasing the capabilities of these aircraft.

Visitors will interact with a physical model of the MRH90 to see proposed MRH90 capability upgrades and Special Forces equipment, including: fast roping; rear window and other gun mounts; MRH Cap upgrades; and electro-optical sensor equipment.

Airbus has a strong industrial presence in Australia and the Pacific, with local operations overseeing the sale of its defense and space products in the region. Additionally, the company provides support to civil and military fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft in the region.

The Airbus stand is located in Hall 1, Stand number: 1Q16."
"AirAsia X talks Rockwell Collins, Mirus plans for A330neo - Runway Girl Network","Tue, 14 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTgvMDgvYWlyYXNpYS14LXRhbGtzLXJvY2t3ZWxsLWNvbGxpbnMtbWlydXMtcGxhbnMtZm9yLWEzMzBuZW8v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"When AirAsia X takes its 100 Airbus A330neo widebodies as part of a massive expansion in the long-haul arm of the bellwether low-cost carrier, it will update economy seats but eschew both changes to the premium seats in the pointy end and any form of premium economy, says the group’s chief executive officer.

Established just over a decade ago, AirAsia and its international airlines operate some two dozen Airbus A330-300 aircraft under the AirAsia banner, the standard configuration for which is a 377-seat high-density layout with 365 economy seats in the ultra-narrow 3-3-3 configuration, plus 12 Rockwell Collins angled lie-flat Minipod seats in what the carrier is in the process of rebranding from Premium Flatbed to just Premium.

Speaking to Runway Girl Network following the carrier’s upgauge of its Airbus A330-900neo order from 66 to 100 at the Farnborough Air Show, AirAsia X Group Chief Executive Officer Kamarudin Meranun noted that the airline has studied other options extensively — both in terms of seating and in terms of aircraft, having leveraged serious consideration of Boeing 787 Dreamliners and the airline’s existing orders of Airbus A320neo family jets against the A330neo deal.

“We were contemplating having shorter range [versions of the Airbus A330 family], where we would not have any business or Xtra seats in the front end, or premium economy,” Meranun said.

“There were discussions on whether some of the seats we’d be able to change,” Meranun noted, but highlighted that “you’ve got to think about the whole route big picture. If you change, then what about changing the aircraft from one route to the other? It gets a little bit complicated: rescue of aircraft and all that kind of thing. We’ve tried to maximise optimal operations. As of now, it’s still the same configuration.”

Meranun sait the airline has given its teams freedom to “look at all different possibilities, not only in terms of customer comfort but in terms of commercial availability”, including around newer fully flat seats, several of which offer a superior passenger experience at either the same or a more efficient seat pitch.

AirAsia X is one of the few airlines still to take an angled lie-flat seat in its premium cabin, with most other long-haul low-cost carriers opting for the current premium economy standard (recliners in a 2-3-2 layout on an A330 or 787 with approximately 37-38” of pitch and 19-20” of seat width) or one of the newer types of seats (like Stelia’s Equinox, as seen on Air Caraïbes’ Airbus A350, or the bespoke Lufthansa business class seat manufactured by Rockwell Collins, as seen on Eurowings’ Airbus widebodies).

Meranun said that the airline’s research weighted factors “not only in terms of customer comfort but in terms of commercial availability of such a seat. Some of them may offer a better customer experience, so it enhances your sales, but there is a cost to moving to them. It’s a totality.”

Premium economy was also discussed and, Meranun explained, rejected in favour of the tried-and-tested model. “The success in AirAsia is in sticking to what we know best. Obviously you will have to listen to new technology. We’re looking for lighter seats and all those things. All this is explored. Whether you should decide depends on more things than just getting the latest technology.”

Meranun also revealed that the airline is “very happy” with the shipments of seats it has received from UK seatmaker Mirus, which won contracts to supply both AirAsia’s fleet of Airbus A320 family narrowbody aircraft and the A330 family of widebodies. “So far,” Meranun said, “no complaints.”

Lastly, Meranun said in an aside, AirAsia X has no current plans to take the longer-range Airbus A321LR member of the neo family, although “we never rule out any possibilities”.

Airbus Achieves New Record for Longest Flight by a Drone - Drone Below,"Thu, 09 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vZHJvbmViZWxvdy5jb20vMjAxOC8wOC8wOS9haXJidXMtYWNoaWV2ZXMtbmV3LXJlY29yZC1mb3ItbG9uZ2VzdC1mbGlnaHQtYnktYS1kcm9uZS_SAVtodHRwczovL2Ryb25lYmVsb3cuY29tLzIwMTgvMDgvMDkvYWlyYnVzLWFjaGlldmVzLW5ldy1yZWNvcmQtZm9yLWxvbmdlc3QtZmxpZ2h0LWJ5LWEtZHJvbmUv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"0 ( 0 )

Airbus SE’s Zephyr High Altitude Pseudo-Satellite (HAPS) has set a record in drone history. The Zephyr remained airborne floating almost motionless at an altitude of 70,000 feet within the Earth’s atmosphere to 25 days, two-thirds more than the previous best. Airbus SE’s Zephyr drone has thus established a new record for the longest flight by a drone.

Post a happy and safe landing of the craft, Airbus reported the success of Zephyr’s maiden trip in which the first production version of the solar-powered pseudo-satellite spent more than three weeks in the stratosphere after taking off from Arizona on July 11, Wednesday.

The flight was aimed at establishing the drone’s credentials as a less costly, more nimble alternative to conventional satellites. This Zephyr flight surpassed the previous endurance record of 14 days set by a prototype Zephyr in 2015. Two of these crafts, with a 25-meter (82-foot) wingspan and 75 kilos (165 pounds) weight were ordered by Britain’s defence ministry. They were built at Farnborough.

Not only is the Zephyr solar powered, it uses batteries to fly at night and also flies at extremely high altitudes, in the stratosphere, above the weather and conventional air traffic, where only the Concorde, the U2 spy plane and Mach 3 SR-71 Blackbird were known to fly earlier, thus making a mark in a capability that was hitherto unique to satellites, UAVs and manned aircraft by providing persistent local satellite-like services. Only three people are required for the Zephyr’s launch given its ultra-light construction.

“This very successful maiden flight represents a new significant milestone in the Zephyr programme, adding new stratospheric flight endurance record which we hope will be formalised very shortly,” said Jana Rosenmann, head of Unmanned Aerial Systems at Airbus. “We will in the coming days check all engineering data and outputs and start the preparation of additional flights planned for the second half of this year from our new operating site at the Wyndham airfield in Western Australia.”

According to Airbus, further test flights are scheduled from a site in Western Australia. These trials aim to explore the roles Zephyr could play in remote communications, maritime surveillance, border patrols, gauging environmental change and monitoring the spread of wildfires and oil spills.

Uniquely designed for both military and commercial purposes, Zephyr can deliver numerous payload capabilities across two platforms. Zephyr S with its ability to carry payloads, offering voice, data communications both line of sight and beyond the line of sight, and line of sight high resolution optical imagery. Zephyr T carrying larger payloads offers the ability to bring more active payloads to the fore; for example, widespread, persistent internet coverage to remote areas of the globe, and active RADAR. Together they enable real-time mapping, internet and a number of surveillance opportunities to meet a broad range of requirements.

Boeing and Airbus meet Qantas' Sydney to London dream - Airline Ratings,"Thu, 23 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyYXRpbmdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2JvZWluZy1haXJidXMtbWVldC1xYW50YXMtc3lkbmV5LWxvbmRvbi1kcmVhbS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The era of the ultra, ultra, long-haul flights is about to dawn with Qantas’ dream of flying from Sydney to London non-stop getting the go-ahead from Boeing and Airbus.

Qantas’ chief Alan Joyce told AirlineRatings.com that both Boeing and Airbus can meet the airline’s challenge of an aircraft capable of flying from New York to Sydney non-stop with 300 passengers.

Boeing is proposing a tweaked version of its Boeing 777-8X while Airbus is pushing a similarly tweaked version of its A350 aircraft that Singapore Airlines has ordered.

What is not clear is how much each aircraft beats the 300 passengers mark and what the economics will be.

READ: Boeing’s giant Everett complex just got bigger

“Both will be bit different but will have enough seats to make it economical,” said Mr. Joyce

However, according to Mr. Joyce, the Airbus A350 is “more adaptable” being lighter for routes to Hong Kong and Los Angeles.

However, in the longer term, the 777-9X would be a better A380 replacement analyst suggest so commonality becomes an issue.

“Our teams are working the pros and cons which gives us the best overhaul business case.”

Mr. Joyce added however that both Airbus and Boeing keep “coming back with more seats and more capability.”

The A350 or 777-8X would be used on Melbourne and Sydney to London and New York as well as destinations such as Chicago.

“It is a two-horse race and we are telling them there is a lot to play for, said Mr. Joyce.

However, Qantas also has some hurdles to cross with a modified pilot agreement to crew the aircraft.

AirlineRatings.com understand that the operation will require an additional set of pilots to a total of 6.

“We are having very constructive dialogue with the pilots on modifying the EBA,” said Mr. Joyce.

There are also regulatory issues that have to be ticked off for the operation.

Mr. Joyce said that an RFP will be issued and he expects that to be completed by end of FY19 with the delivery of the first aircraft in 2022.

Qantas’ enthusiasm for the service is buoyed by the tremendous success of the Perth to London Boeing 787 non-stop which is achieving an incredible 92 percent load factor and 95 percent in premium classes."
Why You Can't Check a Pet as Cargo on Most American Airlines Domestic Planes - View from the Wing,"Fri, 24 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vdmlld2Zyb210aGV3aW5nLmNvbS93aHkteW91LWNhbnQtY2hlY2stYS1wZXQtYXMtY2FyZ28tb24tbW9zdC1hbWVyaWNhbi1haXJsaW5lcy1kb21lc3RpYy1wbGFuZXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"American Airlines Airbus narrowbody aircraft make up a majority of their domestic fleet. The airline has nearly 400 Airbus A319s, 320s, and 321s which is more than all of their 737s, 757s in domestic/Hawaii configuration, MD80s, and Embraer 190s combined. The domestic 757s and MD80s are being rapidly replaced.

And American Airlines does not allow pets to be checked as cargo on their Airbus narrowbodies. They are growing this fleet with A321neos that begin delivering at the start of 2019.

Airlines are cracking down on emotional support animals. Small pets can travel in the cabin for a fee, but larger pets need to be checked. Owners of larger animals then may be caught between Scylla and Charybdis unable to bring their animal on board as an emotional support animal, unable to bring them in cabin for a fee, and unable to check them when traveling on half the domestic fleet — and many destinations are served exclusively by these aircraft.

I knew this was the policy, but wasn’t aware of the reason. Legacy US Airways planes do not all have the heating and ventilation necessary to carry live animals as cargo.

American won’t spend the money to upgrade their planes for this

American’s IT is incapable of distinguishing between legacy US Airways and legacy American aircraft. American’s Airbus narrowbodies that were with the airline prior to the US Airways merger can support pets as cargo, but the airline’s systems can’t tell which planes those are.



American Airlines A319

American Airlines is “looking at system changes that would make it possible to distinguish between the two types of aircraft” and if they decide to move forward and implement this then it would be possible to check pets on legacy American Airbus narrowbodies, and not on legacy US Airways Airbus narrowbodies.

Of course since American Airlines once sent the wrong Airbus plane to Hawaii, a plane that wasn’t ETOPS-certified, even though their systems are supposed to be able to tell the difference I’m not sure I’d trust Fido to this IT upgrade."
First Airbus A330-200P2F delivered - SamChui.com - Sam Chui,"Tue, 07 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vc2FtY2h1aS5jb20vMjAxOC8wOC8wNy9maXJzdC1haXJidXMtYTMzMC0yMDBwMmYtZGVsaXZlcmVkL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"First Airbus A330-200P2F delivereD

The A330-200F is an aircraft developed from the popular A330 wide-body jet and can carry 65t of payload over a 7,400km distance. One thing you might find unusual on the A330-200F is the bubble under the nose gear. Since the A330 has a natural nose-down stance, Airbus adjusted nose gear mounting by changing brackets and and attachment points, hence the bubble fixture.

With the A330-200F selling rather terribly with only 42 ordered, Airbus set out to offer the A330-200P2F (Passenger to Freighter).

However, recently Airbus delivered a new “family” member of the Freighter aircraft: The A330-200P2F.

Recently, Airbus delivered the very first A330P2F to EgyptAir Cargo.

The aircraft completed all necessary test flights in June and has since received supplemental type certificates from the European Aviation Safety Authority (EASA) and the Egyption Civil Aviation Authority (ECAA).

Elbe Flugzeugwerke (EFW) and ST Aerospace, the companie in charge of the conversion process, were the ones responsible for converting a used A330-300 for DHL which was delivered in 2017.

In a statement to media, the two companies said the following:

“The timely redelivery of MSN 600 is a result of the excellent spirit of cooperation between the partners EFW, ST Engineering Aerospace and Airbus and the remarkable support by EASA, Launch Customer EgyptAir and the ECAA. To date EgyptAir Cargo has firm orders for three A330-200P2F units.”

Airbus intends the aircraft to be the perfect replacement for Boeing 767 based Freighters. Most A330s are still quite young so in a few years Airbus will have lots of used A330s coming out of service perfect for this application.

It was during the recent Farnborough Air Show that Airbus announced that they need to step up their freighter game. No announcements have been made yet, but the A330P2F is definitely apart of the family.

How you see the future of Airbus Freighters?"
Qatar Airways to operate Airbus A350-1000 to Singapore and Tokyo - Japan Today,"Fri, 31 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vamFwYW50b2RheS5jb20vY2F0ZWdvcnkvZmVhdHVyZXMvdHJhdmVsL3FhdGFyLWFpcndheXMtdG8tb3BlcmF0ZS1haXJidXMtYTM1MC0xMDAwLXRvLXNpbmdhcG9yZS1hbmQtdG9reW_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Qatar Airways has confirmed that it will operate the Airbus A350-1000, equipped with the airline’s new Qsuite, on flights to and from Changi Airport in Singapore from Nov 1.

The aircraft will also be introduced daily to Tokyo’s Haneda Airport from Jan 1, 2019.

The two cities will be the first of Qatar Airways’ growing Far East network to welcome the ultramodern A350-1000 equipped with Qsuite.

Powered by Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engines, Sichuan Airlines’ A350-900 aircraft features a comfortable two-class cabin layout of 331 seats: 28 business, and 303 economy. The airline will initially operate the new aircraft on its domestic routes, followed by its international “Panda Routes”.

Sichuan Airlines operates an all Airbus fleet of 135 aircraft, including 123 A320 Family aircraft and 12 A330 Family aircraft. The partnership between Sichuan Airlines and Airbus dates back to 1995 when the airline introduced the A320, becoming the first to operate an Airbus fly-by-wire aircraft on the Chinese mainland. It was also the first operator to take delivery of a Tianjin assembled A320 Family aircraft. In 2010, Sichuan Airlines received its first A330 aircraft, in 2016 it signed a Letter of Intent for leasing four A350-900s, and in 2018 it signed an agreement with Airbus to order ten A350-900s.

The A350 XWB is an all-new family of mid-size widebody long-haul airliners shaping the future of air travel, featuring the latest aerodynamic design, carbon fibre fuselage and wings, plus new fuel-efficient Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engines. Together, these latest technologies translate into unrivalled levels of operational efficiency, with a 25 per cent reduction in fuel burn and emissions, and significantly lower maintenance costs.

The Airspace cabin, in addition to aircraft spaciousness and quietness, provides better ambience, design and services, contributing to superior levels of comfort and well-being, and setting new standards in terms of flight experience for passengers in all classes.

By the end of July 2018, Airbus recorded a total of 890 firm orders for the A350 XWB from 46 customers worldwide, already making it one of the most successful widebody aircraft ever.

Airbus Just Flew Its Zephyr Solar Aircraft for a Record 26 Days - Digital Trends,"Fri, 10 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWx0cmVuZHMuY29tL2Nvb2wtdGVjaC9haXJidXMtemVwaHlyLXNvbGFyLWFpcmNyYWZ0LXJlY29yZC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A solar-powered aircraft built by Airbus recently broke the record for the longest continuous flight.

On its first outing, the unmanned Zephyr S stayed aloft for 25 days, 23 hours, and 57 minutes after taking off from Arizona on July 11.

Recommended Videos

The achievement smashes the previous record — set by an earlier Zephyr prototype several years ago — by 11 days.

The Zephyr S harnesses the sun’s rays to power motors that drive its two propellers, a system that allows it to operate entirely on solar power. At night, the vehicle relies on power stored by its onboard batteries during daylight hours.

The Airbus creation flies at an altitude of 70,000 feet, way above weather systems and conventional air traffic. “The only civil aircraft that used to fly at this altitude was Concorde, and only the famous military U2 and SR-71 Blackbird could operate at similar levels,” the aerospace giant said in a release.

Sporting a 25-meter (82-foot) wingspan and tipping the scales at just 75 kilos (165 pounds), the flimsy looking aircraft was built at a facility in Farnborough, England.

The ability of the Zephyr S to stay in the sky for such a long period of time — the goal is to keep it aloft for months at a time — has prompted Airbus to describe it as “not quite an aircraft and not quite a satellite,” preferring instead to call it a “pseudo-satellite.”

Indeed, the plan is to offer companies satellite services that are cheaper to launch and maintain than space-based options. The first customer for the aircraft has been confirmed as the U.K.’s Ministry of Defence.

Airbus says its solar-powered aircraft has the potential to provide a wide range of applications, including reconnaissance missions, maritime surveillance, border patrol missions, communications, and also disaster management, helping, for example, to monitor the spread of wildfires or oil spills.

“This very successful maiden flight represents a new significant milestone in the Zephyr program,” said Jana Rosenmann, head of unmanned aerial systems at Airbus.

Rosenmann added that the team will shortly begin preparations for further Zephyr S flights later this year from its new operating site at the Wyndham airfield in Western Australia. There are also plans to introduce a more powerful Zephyr T aircraft.

Building a machine of this nature is clearly no mean feat. Facebook, for example, recently ended development of a similar vehicle following four years of development. The aim had been to use the solar-powered “Aquila” aircraft to bring internet connectivity to communities in remote parts of the world, but numerous engineering challenges, as well as a crash during a test flight, prompted the company to abandon its program and instead seek partnerships for the project.

The airline revised its purchase agreement withAirbus concluded in November 2016, updating its order from 10 A320neos to eight A320neos and two A321LRs. The A321LR is the newest member of the A320 family of jets, the best-selling single-aisle jet in the world, and based on the A321neo.

The model boasts a range of 7,400 km, the longest in the world for a single-aisle jet, and will greatly extend Peach’s reach throughout Asia. Peach will be the first Asian airline to operate the A321LR. The two A321LRs covered in this purchase agreement are expected to be delivered in fiscal 2020.

As of 2020 and after completing the integration of Vanilla Air, the Peach fleet will consist of more than 50 aircraft, (including the A321LR), operated across more than 50 routes.

Peach CEO Shinichi Inoue had the following to say about the introduction of the A321LRs: “As Japan’s first LCC, Peach has grown earnings and generated profits for five consecutive years. However, Peach continues to transform itself and evolve. By taking on the challenge of establishing a middle-haul LCC business in Japan, we will continue to play a leading role in shaping the history of LCCs in Japan and Northeast Asia. The introduction of the A321LR in fiscal 2020 will be the next major step in the evolution of our business and will further accelerate Peach’s transformation into the leading LCC in Asia.""

By entering the middle-haul LCC business, Peach said it will expand its role as a bridge between Japan and Asia and greatly stimulate inbound demand to Japan in support of the Japanese government’s goal of 40 million foreign visitors in 2020 and 60 million in 2030.

That drone recently spent just three minutes shy of 26 days in the air without taking a single break for refueling. Airbus wants its solar drones to eventually be used as a cheaper replacement for satellites.

Airbus has been working on its Zephyr S drone since at least 2015, with the goal of providing a cheaper and more versatile replacement for satellites. The drone weighs only 165 pounds, about as much as a single person, and is powered by an 80-foot wingspan covered in solar panels. At high altitudes, Zephyr is uninterrupted by cloud cover or other air traffic, and can fly for months at a time.

Zephyr launched on its maiden voyage on July 11 and only recently touched down again, and Airbus says this long-duration flight is only the beginning. In the future, Airbus hopes to run much longer missions, starting later this year.

With this technology, plenty of governments, companies, and organizations have a cheaper option than satellites. Airbus envisions Zephyr used for airborne monitoring of disaster zones, long-term environmental studies, and even bringing wireless internet to underserved areas.

Norwegian Air Shuttle brings Airbus A380 superjumbo to the masses - The National,"Tue, 07 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW5hdGlvbmFsbmV3cy5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvYXZpYXRpb24vbm9yd2VnaWFuLWFpci1zaHV0dGxlLWJyaW5ncy1haXJidXMtYTM4MC1zdXBlcmp1bWJvLXRvLXRoZS1tYXNzZXMtMS43NTcxNDPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A second-hand Airbus superjumbo will fly for Norwegian Air Shuttle later this month, giving a model once seen as the epitome of luxury a first taste of discount travel.

The A380 has been drafted in to operate between London Gatwick airport and New York’s John F Kennedy hub after the grounding of some of Norwegian’s own Boeing 787s, according to a spokesman for the airline.

The transatlantic stint comes after the Scandinavian arm of Thomas Cook Group this week used the double-decker to fly holidaymakers between Copenhagen and Cyprus and Oslo and Majorca to help cope with its own plane shortage. The jet was released by Singapore Airlines after a decade of service and is the first used A380 to find a new role.

Norwegian plans to operate the world’s biggest passenger plane for several weeks as its sidelined 787 Dreamliners undergo maintenance to resolve glitches with Rolls-Royce engines.

“We are pleased to be able to offer this solution to our customers to ensure that their journeys remain unaffected,” the spokesman said. Norwegian is a pioneer in low-cost, long-haul flying after tapping the 787’s fuel efficiency to undercut rivals, though it has piled up debts and become a takeover target for British Airways owner IAG.

The 471-seat A380, registration 9H-MIP, is being offered for lease by charter specialist Hi Fly of Portugal, which has the plane under contract for six years.

Thomas Cook briefed startled passengers on the giant plane before they boarded its flights, with some allocated seats in the first and business-class cabins, although minus the gourmet meals that once accompanied the premium berths. As the first scheduled superjumbo to visit Larnaca the plane also created a stir on landing, with people jostling to snap “selfies”."

Qatar Airways Launching Tokyo And Singapore Airbus A350-1000 Flights (With QSuites)... - God Save The Points,"Tue, 28 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvZHNhdmV0aGVwb2ludHMuY29tL3FhdGFyLWFpcndheXMtYWlyYnVzLWEzNTAtMTAwMC13aXRoLXFzdWl0ZXMtdG9reW8tc2luZ2Fwb3JlLXFzdWl0ZXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A350 is plane code for “awesome”…

The contest for world’s best business class was once a tightly contested honor. With most airlines operating a variation of the same seat, the title came down to the finer points of the experience, such as service and other aspects, like food. In 2017, Qatar Airways went off script and uprooted the entire game, launching dine on demand, responsive service and fully private suites, which they affectionately call “first in business” – a double entendre indeed. As the airline rolls brand new Airbus A350-1000 planes out of the factory, they continue to upgrade flights to cities around the world, and this time – they’ve picked two of the best…

Airbus A350-1000

The Airbus A350-1000 is the newest and most advanced passenger plane in the sky, and Qatar Airways was the launch customer upon its debut on February 20th, 2018. In case you have any doubts about the impressive new features, here’s a tour of Qatar Airways first ever A350-1000, including 360° images of the famed QSuites.

Tokyo Haneda Upgrade

According to information obtained by Business Traveller, Qatar Airways will begin Airbus A350-1000 service from Doha to the far more convenient Tokyo airport, Tokyo Haneda, beginning January 1st, 2019. The aircraft will operate flights 812, 813 respectively and will offer the first private business class suite Tokyo has ever seen. As if you needed more reason to visit Japan.

Singapore Changi Upgrade

Singapore Changi was one of the first airports to receive the Airbus A350, and will enjoy a major upgrade to the brand new, extended version shortly. Beginning November 1st, Qatar Airways flight 944 from Doha to Singapore will be operated by the Airbus A350-1000, complete with QSuites. The return flight 945 on November 2nd, will mark the first service from Singapore to Doha. And it doesn’t stop there: Qatar Airways second daily services 946, 947 will feature the A350-1000 beginning December 1st.

Speculative Bookings

Whenever airlines switch to a new aircraft, there’s generally a magic window for speculative bookings using points. If you happened to find availability on a Qatar Airways flight with the flight numbers above, to either airport, from the dates described onward, chances are you’d end up on this brand new, truly exceptional plane. Of course, you’ll just need to beat everyone else who now has the same thought…

Will you test out the new Qatar A350-1000 to Singapore or Tokyo?"
AirAsia X evaluates the Airbus A321neo LR. - Airline Ratings,"Fri, 31 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyYXRpbmdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FpcmFzaWEteC1ldmFsdWF0ZXMtYWlyYnVzLWEzMjFuZW8tbHIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Long-haul low-cost operator AirAsia X is evaluating Airbus’ long-range version of the A321neo as it moves to target more destinations within a range of seven hours.

Powered by CFM International’s LAEP-1A engines, the A321neo LR, is due to enter service in the fourth quarter of 2018 and is designed to carry up to 240 passengers 4000 nautical miles.

AirAsia X Bhd confirmed Thursday it was evaluating “the potential introduction” of the 321neo LR for developing routes as it announced the group had moved into the red with a second-quarter net loss of RM57.5m, down from an RM47.4 net profit a year ago.

The group’s net operating loss deepened to $RM99.3 million from a loss of RM16 million in the equivalent quarter of 2017.

Revenue for the quarter rose 2 percent to RM1.05 billion as a 13 percent year-on-year boost in passengers outpaced a 6 percent increase in capacity to boost the load factor.

Officials blamed the fall in profitability on a range of factors including softer demand during Malaysia’s general election and the rise of fuel prices during a traditionally lean quarter.

READ Indonesia AirAsia passes major safety audit.

AirAsia X co-group chief executive Tony Fernandes said passenger traffic was expected to grow in the coming months but warned costs remained under pressure from higher fuel prices.

“However, the management remains focused on monitoring the other operating expenses to ensure further cost efficiencies to offset higher fuel expenses,’’ he said.

Fernandes said AirAsia X had cut loss-making routes since the start of 2018 and had moved away from single-route countries in favor of big countries with major cities.

He said these represented a bigger potential for the group to build up flight frequencies and higher-yielding “unique” routes.

“We will focus on routes within seven hours range as much as possible with the exception of a few routes such as Honolulu,” he said.

“Apart from the North Asia market, we are thrilled to grow India as one of our core market segments as well.

“ In the last seven months, we have added Jaipur and Amritsar into our fast growing network. Together with Jeju which was launched in December 2017, we have now launched three new routes into countries where we already have existing operations.

“In addition to that, we have removed Iran and (we’re) removing Nepal from our network, as we shift those capacities into North Asia.

“In a rather challenging period for the aviation industry, we view this move will give more cost efficiency to AirAsia X as we already have existing stations in China, South Korea and Japan.”

The group plans to increase its fleet to 36 Airbus A330s by the end of the year with five leased aircraft allocated to its Malaysian operation and one to AirAsia X Thailand.

Fernandes said the recent order A330neos also reaffirmed the commitment and confidence in the AirAsia X business model.

The group announced an order for an additional 34 A330neos at this year’s Farnborough Airshow, bringing the total number ordered to 100.

All of the aircraft are the bigger A330-900 model and deliveries are scheduled to start in the fourth quarter of 2019.

“The Airbus A330neo will give better fuel efficiency with improved flying range,’’ Fernandes said. “We are confident that the aircraft will allow AirAsia X to expand its value-based long-haul model with even lower operating costs.”"
Airbus sets gliding altitude world record - Australian Defence Magazine,"Thu, 30 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1c3RyYWxpYW5kZWZlbmNlLmNvbS5hdS9kZWZlbmNlL2Fpci9haXJidXMtc2V0cy1nbGlkaW5nLWFsdGl0dWRlLXdvcmxkLXJlY29yZNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus’ Perlan Mission II, the world’s first initiative to pilot an engineless aircraft to the edge of space, has risen in the stratosphere to a pressure altitude of over 62,000 feet (60,669 feet GPS altitude) above El Calafate, Argentina. This sets a new gliding altitude world record, pending official validation.

The pressurized Perlan 2 glider, which is designed to soar up to 90,000 feet, passed the Armstrong Line, the point in the atmosphere above which an unprotected human’s blood will boil if an aircraft loses pressurization.

This marks a second glider altitude world record for Jim Payne and Morgan Sandercock, the same two Perlan Project pilots who soared the Perlan 2 to 52,221 feet GPS altitude in September last year in the same remote region of Argentine Patagonia. The 2017 record broke a previous record that was set in 2006, in the unpressurized Perlan 1, by Perlan Project founder Einar Enevoldson and Steve Fossett.

“This is a tremendous moment for all the volunteers and sponsors of Airbus Perlan Mission II who have been so dedicated to making our non-profit aerospace initiative a reality,” Ed Warnock, CEO of the Perlan Project, said. “Our victory today, and whatever other milestones we achieve this year, are a testament to a pioneering spirit of exploration that runs through everyone on the project and through the organizations that support us.”

“Innovation is a buzzword in aerospace today, but Perlan truly embodies the kind of bold thinking and creativity that are core Airbus values,” Tom Enders, Airbus CEO, said. “Perlan Project is achieving the seemingly impossible, and our support for this endeavour sends a message to our employees, suppliers and competitors that we will not settle for being anything less than extraordinary.”

During the flight, Perlan 2 was towed to the base of the stratosphere by a Grob Egrett G520 turboprop, a high-altitude reconnaissance plane that was modified for the task earlier this summer. The Egrett released Perlan 2 at around 42,000 feet, the approximate service ceiling of an Airbus A380.

To reach the highest areas of Earth’s atmosphere, Perlan 2 pilots catch a ride on stratospheric mountain waves, a weather phenomenon created when rising air currents behind mountain ranges are significantly strengthened by the polar vortex. The phenomenon occurs only for a brief period each year in just a few places on Earth. The area around El Calafate is one of those rare locations where these rising air currents can reach to 100,000 feet or more.

To reach the highest areas of Earth’s atmosphere, Perlan 2 pilots catch a ride on stratospheric mountain waves

The Perlan 2 glider incorporates a number of innovations to enable its mission: a carbon-fibre capsule with a passive cabin pressurization system that eliminates the need for heavy, power-hungry compressors; a unique closed-loop rebreather system, in which the only oxygen used is what the crew metabolizes; and an on-board “wave visualization system” that graphically displays areas of rising and sinking air in cockpits.

Unlike powered research aircraft, Perlan 2 does not affect the temperature or chemistry of the air around it, making it an ideal platform to study the atmosphere. The experiments carried aloft in its instrument bay are yielding new discoveries related to high-altitude flight, weather and climate change.

The program is reminiscent of another Airbus project, the Zephyr high-altitude pseudosatellite. Airbus has selected Wyndham in WA as the location for Zephyr test flights thanks to the largely unrestricted surrounding airspace and reliable weather."
Airbus Corporate Jets finishes assembly of first ACJ320neo aircraft – Business Traveller - Business Traveller,"Fri, 17 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc3RyYXZlbGxlci5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MtdHJhdmVsLzIwMTgvMDgvMTcvYWlyYnVzLWNvcnBvcmF0ZS1qZXRzLWZpbmlzaGVzLWFzc2VtYmx5LW9mLWZpcnN0LWFjajMyMG5lby1haXJjcmFmdC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Corporate Jets has completed assembly on its first ACJ320neo aircraft, a variant of its commercial A320neo single-aisle aircraft that has been modified for the corporate jet market.

Already bearing the Airbus Corporate Jets livery, the aircraft is expected to undergo its first flight in the next few weeks ahead of its delivery to UK-based Acropolis Aviation in the last quarter of 2018. An Alberto Pinto-designed cabin will then be installed and the aircraft repainted.

So what can flyers expect from the new aircraft?

For starters, it has what Airbus claims are the widest and tallest cabins of any large business jet, capable of seating 25 passengers.

This should provide a more comfortable travelling experience for passengers – ideal as the aircraft’s new-generation engines and wing sharklets have enabled the aircraft to both reduce fuel consumption by about 15 per cent and also offer an extensive intercontinental range.

The ACJ320neo is designed to fly distances of 6,000 nautical miles (11,100 kilometres) or for up to 13 hours. This means routes such as London to Beijing are a distinct possibility.

This is shorter than the company’s ACJ319neo, which can fly greater distances for about 15 hours, but offers a greater capacity than the eight passenger limit in the Atelier Pagani Automobili-designed cabins on board the ACJ319neo.

Airbus Corporate Jets also launched its ACJ330neo last year, which can fly up to 20 hours and has a similar 25-passenger capacity."

We will have to wait and see which models industry and cities are willing to set up. New business models will have a tremendous impact on the ticket price of an urban air flight. Just by sharing helicopter rides combined with an efficient routing/flight operations we see that much lower ticket prices are possible even today. And our future business models will focus more on the end consumer.

What role do regulators have to play?

Regulators will be essential, especially in working with cities to adapt solutions to local specifics. Providing the right certification is key: safety is our top priority. There is no compromise on it to accelerate the pace of development. Control of airspaces is also key: currently 95% of helicopter flights are VFR (Visual Flight Rules), which will not be viable with hundreds flying over a city at the same time. Regulators will thus probably accelerate autonomous flight options to allow a truly integrated and unsegregated urban airspace.

How does city infrastructure development fit in?

Sufficient landing pads will have to be built – but with sufficient utilisation to justify the use case. Integrated autonomous systems will again be essential here to ensure vehicle availability, optimise routes, minimise waiting/hovering time/energy use, etc to minimise infrastructure requirements and investments.

The company is also the No. 1 European supplier of land command and control solutions as well as a lead supplier of ISR and Air Defense solutions to France, Germany and NATO. Based on more than 30 years’ experience in Earth Observation and Defence Systems, the company provides decision-makers with sustainable solutions to increase security, optimize mission planning and operations, boost performance, improve management of natural resources and, last but not least, protect our environment.

Airbus Intelligence is present around the Globe, with subsidiaries and offices in twelve countries across five continents. More than 140 authorized resellers are accredited worldwide, and selected partners operate their own direct receiving stations around the Globe. This ensures a premium customer service through local availability and expertise.In an exclusive, shares François Lombard, SVP, Head, Intelligence Business, Airbus Defence and Space in an exclusive interview.

What are the latest trends in the Earth Observation (EO) industry?

The EO sector is increasingly becoming a strategic, innovative and globally orientated sector, predominantly government-orientated though experiencing increased venture capital/private sector investment. As a consequence, it induces a diversification of funding models to support infrastructure needed due to private/public sector interaction. A related trend is the increased focus of capabilities on achieving societal, security and economic returns on investment.

In commercial terms, the market will increasingly be dominated by operators offering 30cm resolution imagery as standard serving defense intelligence applications as well as to the commercial and civil government sectors. The market will also constantly seek data that is updated and refreshed more consistently and delivered in near real time.

Such imagery will more and more be used as a core enabler within increasingly complex ecosystems: heterogeneous sensors and non-geospatial datasets. The updated imagery, refreshed datasets and multi-source assets have fuelled markets that specialize in analytics and predictive behaviours. At Airbus we are investing in the needs of the market and look towards the future and beyond, with the Pléiades Neo constellation to be launched in 2020, and Zephyr, the High-Altitude Pseudo Satellite which will provide below 20cm resolution and video capacity to help drive these new markets.

It is said the ability of satellites to transform businesses and quality of life is significantly more relevant today than ever. Can you elaborate? How is Airbus helping in this sector?

Satellite imagery and derived datasets have already had a transformative impact on a citizen’s quality of life. Urban density, land use, global warming, shorelines, natural disasters, development and retail activity are all examples that can be monitored by earth observation satellites. The quality and access to these datasets are improving, as well as the depth of analytics that can be derived from massive amount of data. As we listen to customer demands, we are expanding on our digital transformation to improve all facets of the geospatial business. Our OneAtlas platform will allow easy access to premium imagery, allow users to perform large-scale image processing, extract industry specific insights and benefit from Airbus assets to develop solutions. Together, OneAtlas will enable users, businesses and partners to build a better future.

There seems to be a lot of collaboration instead of competition between the satellite and EO players. What is driving this trend?

Collaboration brings more success, and more rapidly. As one resolution cannot fit all needs, one constellation cannot answer all revisit needs. That is why there is a commercial logic to collaboration where assets are complementary. When it comes to the development of new services, and especially analytics, the key is to find the right partners to work with, either the specialist in a given market or through technical compatibilities.

Our recent partnership with Planet is a good example of what can be achieved by combining forces. Our satellites are covering any place on Earth at least once a day at 0.5m and 1.5m, but are not capable of acquiring the entire landmass every day like Planet’s Dove constellation. We have complementary assets.

Where do you see the business coming from / developing? What is your business model?

In our former commercial satellite imagery business, we mostly used to support a range of business models for the deployment of satellites and their operation. But today, our customers do not want only pixels or systems. They want us to solve their problems and create efficiencies or, improvements in their daily activities and operations. Simply put, provide the right information to the right person and at the right time for the right decision, via simple and direct connections. To answer such market expectations, we are developing new services, new ways of doing business and new routes of going to market in order to deliver the actionable intelligence required by our customers.

We are currently in the process of rolling out a comprehensive range of Cloud-based digital solutions which will be made available via the OneAtlas platform. This includes data, processing, thematic services (for precision agriculture, forestry, maritime domain awareness, security and defense), analytics and much more. This platform will also allow easy API access and hosting ecosystem for our partners’ algorithms and analytics.

Our business models offer the ability for our customers to procure imagery either directly or through access to our satellites, with a telemetry contract, often as part of a multi-satellite package. We also leverage the quality of our data and expertise of our business by building value-added solutions that serve markets with specialized products. Some of these solutions include Field Maps for precision agriculture, Starling for no-deforestation commitments, Stack Insight for mining evaluations, and many others.

There has been a rise in the number of start-ups and new companies in the last few years. How is this changing the space industry and opening up further innovation? Do you think this speed of expansion is sustainable in the long run for smaller/newer players?

It is exciting to be in an industry that is hungry for innovation. In the long-run, the companies that will be successful will be those that are able to deliver on their commitments and deliver what the customer requires. Airbus is well positioned in this market by virtue of its own capabilities, experience, long-standing customer relationships as well as a willingness to partner to deliver sophisticated offerings to fit customer needs across international markets.

Do you think we are on the verge of new space race where the players, technology and services are as diverse as it is innovative?

Yes, there is clearly more involvement in space and this could be termed a new space race. We are not “on the verge” rather we are in the midst of this race. We are seeing a profusion of initiatives serving many sectors from a range of different technologies.

Do you think cheaper launches, better communication services, easy dissemination of information and new technologies like artificial intelligence have made data cheaper and more accessible?

I think that the key trend we have observed over the recent past is that we are moving from an era where applications were siloed, to a cross-collaborative ecosystem that drives success. There is no doubt that technology is increasingly making data more accessible and there is a general trend that data is less expensive. The challenge that we all face is how to make these enhanced capabilities provide services that are better valued.Airbus is a perfect example of a company who is into all these areas. Could you explain

Could you explain how your various divisions/platforms and interdependence have made data more accessible to people?

It is true that Airbus has a diverse portfolio and is positioned across the value-chain. Our business relies upon the ability of Airbus to produce world-class imagery, may they come from satellite, UAVs or Zephyr, and how we process and analyse them to transform them into actionable intelligence. Our remit is to work within the Airbus ecosystem and to maintain strong investment to grow our satellite constellation and our digital business though several industries. As an example, Pléiades Neo will offer enhanced performance and the highest reactivity in the market thanks to their direct access to the data relay communication system, known as the SpaceDataHighway, which is also developed by Airbus.

With so many satellites in space, do you think we have a deluge of data now which we do not know how to make sense of?

There has clearly been an expansion in the volume of data provision. It is also true that more and more emphasis is placed upon how to better process, fuse and analyse this data. Airbus is driving this activity with our efforts to deploy data processing capabilities on the Cloud through solutions like Pixel Factory Neo in the coming months. We are also developing our own multi-source and Cloud-deployed analytical capabilities to services industries such as defense, maritime surveillance or precision farming.

With Field Maps for example, customers can have direct access to satellite images acquired on their fields, as well as biomass and nitrogen information characterizing crop status, and which can easily be integrated into agrometeorological models to elaborate practical farming recommendations.

Access to lots of satellite data, with the capacity to go back in time is also valuable to establish abacus. That’s how we develop our Fodder Production Index for monitoring grass production, using more than 10-year archived imagery over France to estimate, month after month, the fodder development, and therefore determine thresholds for possible lack of production, which could lead to severe troubles for farmers. This index is already being used by most of the French insurance companies, with data being acquired every 10 days.

Do you think democratization and commercialization of data can go hand-in-hand?

There is no choice. We have to continue the innovation on business models that make this possible. An essential component of this will be continued engagement between the public and private sectors.

Singapore is first Southeast Asian city on the airline’s network to receive the A350-1000

Qatar Airways is delighted to announce that the world’s most technologically advanced passenger aircraft – the A350-1000 – equipped with the airline’s luxurious, award-winning Qsuite will be available on flights to and from Singapore’s Changi Airport from 1 November 2018. The aircraft will also be introduced daily to Tokyo’s Haneda Airport from 1 January 2019.

The two cities will be the first of Qatar Airways’ growing Far East network to welcome the ultramodern A350-1000 equipped with Qsuite.

Qatar Airways Group Chief Executive, His Excellency Mr. Akbar Al Baker, said: “We are tremendously excited to bring the world’s most technologically advanced passenger aircraft fitted with revolutionary Qsuite Business Class experience to our loyal customers in Singapore and Tokyo. The launch of the A350-1000 on these routes is a fulfilment of the promise we make to our passengers to provide them the finest experience available in the skies. We are confident that our A350-1000 flights and Qsuite cabins will be highly sought after, and look forward to bringing them to even more gateways throughout the Far East.”

Two of Singapore’s triple-daily A350-900 services will gradually transition to the A350-1000 starting from 1 November 2018. The route is expected to be served entirely with the A350-1000 by April 2019.

One of the latest additions to the Airbus family of twin-aisle, widebody jetliners, the A350-1000 offers 327 seats across two cabins – 46 Qsuite Business Class seats and 281 extra-wide 18-inch seats in Economy Class. Similar to the A350-900 – for which Qatar Airways was also the global launch customer – the high-performance A350-1000 boasts an advanced airframe with extensive use of composite materials. Coupled with a fuselage innovatively built with carbon-fibre reinforced plastic, the jetliner burns lesser fuel, reducing harmful effects to the environment. On the inside, LED mood lighting mimics a natural sunrise and sunset to help reduce the effects of jet lag.

Business Class passengers will be treated to the Qsuite experience, featuring the industry’s first-ever double-bed in business class. Sliding panels allow passengers in adjoining seats to transform their space into private cabins so business colleagues, families and friends can work, socialise and dine together during the flight. These revolutionary features led Qatar Airways to win the ‘Best Business Class Seat’ and ‘Best Business Class’ awards at the 2018 Skytrax World Airline Awards.

Review: Iberia (A350-900) in Economy From Madrid to NYC - The Points Guy,"Mon, 13 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9yZXZpZXdzL2liZXJpYS1hMzUwLWVjb25vbXktbWFkLWpmay_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Update: Some offers mentioned below are no longer available. View the current offers here.

On June 26, 2018, Iberia took delivery of its first of 16 Airbus A350-900 aircraft. After running the aircraft and its crew on training runs between Madrid (MAD) and London's Heathrow (LHR), Iberia launched its inaugural A350 transatlantic service between Madrid and New York-JFK on Aug. 4.

I just happened to need a flight across the pond just days after this inaugural service and was lucky enough to snag last-minute award availability in economy to check out the new aircraft.

Booking

I used Iberia's buggy award search tool to search for availability. The nonstop award flight on a peak date priced at 28,000 Avios plus $111 in taxes and fees. I used the Avios I had earned through the amazing 90,000 Avios promotion, as these Avios were going to expire if not used by Dec. 1, 2018. If I didn't have enough Avios in my account, I'd have transferred Chase Ultimate Rewards points, as Iberia was added as a transfer partner in November 2017.

To price out my options, I checked award availability for the same date using British Airways Avios and American Airlines AAdvantage miles. While Iberia award availability is supposed to be bookable on AA's website, this economy award availability didn't appear on either partner. However, if you can find availability, this one-way flight would cost 30,000 AAdvantage miles. On off-peak dates, it'll cost as little as 17,000 British Airways Avios, but there are much higher fuel surcharges.

TPG pays for review flights for staff, so we put the $111 of award taxes and fees on TPG's Platinum Card® from American Express. Had I booked this ticket myself, though, I'd have put the taxes and fees on my Chase Sapphire Reserve, as I value the 3x points, trip delay and baggage-delay protection over the potential 5x points I'd have gotten by charging the fees to the Platinum Card.

Boarding

International flights departed from the satellite building of Madrid's Terminal 4, and US flights departed from the far ends of this terminal. With check-in, security, the underground train to the satellite building, immigration, walking to the end of the terminal and US security interviews, there were a lot of steps between arriving at the airport and boarding the plane. In order to have enough time to make it through the airport maze, I knew I needed to arrive at least two hours before departure.

There was a long line at the immigration counters when I flew out.

Oneworld elite status shortened my wait at multiple points along the way, with priority check-in, a dedicated security area, priority line for the US security interview and, finally, priority boarding — which let me skip these lines:

Priority boarding went down a different jetway than economy boarding, and there was no way of crossing over after my boarding pass was scanned. Passengers were held at the boarding door, so the lines backed up down both jetways. By the time passengers were able to board the aircraft, it turned it out it would've been better for me to have boarded with the first group of economy than to have stuck to priority boarding.

You may unsubscribe at any time.

I wasn't able to figure out the boarding groups during my short time at the gate. Despite this sizable backup in the jetway, I still had plenty of time to photograph the rear economy cabin and stow my backpack in the overhead bin. So it seems possible that Iberia boarded economy from front to back.

Cabin and Seat

The economy cabin is configured with 34 rows of (mostly) 3-3-3 seating, divided across two cabins. The forward economy cabin contains rows 21 through 37, and the rear economy cabin continues from row 38 through 54.

Rows are spaced with 30 inches of pitch. After measuring this — and finding it different from the 31 inches advertised by Iberia – I started preparing myself for a long flight with my knees against the seat in front of me. Surprisingly, there was enough legroom for my 5 foot, 11 inch frame, possibly thanks to a lumbar curve built into the seats.

Seats measured 18 inches between armrests with 19-inch-wide seat cushions. While this certainly wasn't spacious, it was a critical inch more than what's found on Boeing 787 Dreamliners when configured in the common 3-3-3 arrangement or Boeing 777s when configured in the increasingly standard 3-4-3 arrangement.

Seat headrests could be adjusted vertically by up to 6 inches, and the sides could be folded inward to create a cradle for your head for more comfortable sleeping.

The seatbacks have two storage areas. There's a literature-only pouch measuring 13 inches wide and a couple inches deep just beneath the IFE screen. While partly filled with Iberia magazines, there was enough room for passengers to store passports, boarding passes, phones and other small items. Below this pouch is a 12-inch-wide standard seatback pocket. Thanks to the literature pouch, this pocket only contained the safety card and an air-sickness bag but was otherwise free for passenger storage.

To fit the literature pouch, the tray table is a bifold design, measuring 15.5 inches wide by 9 inches deep fully extended. The table extends a critical 1.5 inches, making working on a small laptop possible when the seat in front of me wasn't reclined. (Thankfully the passenger in front of me didn't recline at all during the flight... not all heroes wear capes.)

The only exception to the 3-3-3 seating arrangement is the exit row at the front of the rear economy cabin (Row 38) and the last row in the back of the rear economy cabin (Row 54). In both of these places, the window-side sections have only two seats instead of three.

The missing window seat in Row 38 creates two seats with extra legroom: 39A and 39L. They have the benefits of a window, lots of legroom and aisle access. While both seats were occupied for my flight, when I checked the seat map on ExpertFlyer about 90 minutes before boarding, these seats were still showing up as blocked.

Seats 21A through C and J through L also have plenty of legroom because there's no bulkhead between the premium-economy cabin and economy. Bassinet mounts were only in the middle seats at the front of each cabin (Row 21 and Row 38).

There are six bathrooms in total for the 293 economy-class seats: four between the economy cabins and two in the rear of the aircraft. Besides the galley in the front of the premium-economy cabin and the galley in the rear of the aircraft, there was no way of switching from one side of the aircraft to the other. And flight attendants snapped the galley curtains closed to try to prevent visitors from doing that. So passengers had to use the bathrooms on their side of the aircraft — unless they wanted to risk irritating the flight attendants.

The middle seats in rows 49 through 53 have significantly lower overhead bins and head space because of the crew rests built in above these seats. If you struggle to get your bags in the overhead bin, you may want to select seats in this area of the cabin. While the headroom was fine for seated passengers, the reduced height could lead passengers to hit their heads when crossing the middle seats.

Unlike Boeing's 787 Dreamliner, which came to market about the same time and features electronically dimmable windows, the A350 has standard window shades. This meant that passengers flooded the cabin with light every time they peeked outside while flight attendants were trying to keep a dark cabin for much of the flight.

Amenities

A bright, crisp 9.75-inch diagonal screen is built in to each seatback. The screen tilts a few degrees to make it clearly visible even when the seat in front is reclined.

I found a fairly extensive entertainment selection, including about 70 movies broken into a number of folders (six suggested, 38 trending, 12 kids, 32 classic, 15 Spanish cinema, four international, 14 action, 20 comedy, 16 drama, 12 family, eight thriller) with lots of overlap among the folders.

There were also 62 TV titles, each with somewhere between one and six episodes. The audio option included dozens of full albums (bonus points for Iberia including the newest album by my favorite DJs, Above & Beyond) and 23 hourlong mixes from a wide variety of genres.

Movies begin with approximately one minute and 15 seconds of advertisements, which I could skip with the fast-forward button on the IFE menu.

The headphone jack is just below the IFE screen. It's a dual jack, but you could use either outlet with your own headphones for full sound — no adapter needed. Next to these plugs are USB power outlets for each passenger.

Universal power outlets are also present under and between each seat. This means that there are just two outlets per three-seat row, so you're going to want to claim your outlet early. The power outlets provided enough amps that my nearly zeroed-out battery recharged quickly.

The Wi-Fi network was on from gate to gate, but the landing page inaccurately claimed that Wi-Fi wasn't available the entire time.

At boarding, seats were stocked with a plastic-wrapped bundle containing a bright-red cotton blanket and small but soft pillow.

As boarding concluded, flight attendants wheeled a cart down the aisles offering economy passengers a selection of Spanish-language newspapers. Then they passed through again with newspapers in hand, seemingly trying to find takers.

As we waited out a short delay blamed on air-traffic control, flight attendants handed out plastic-wrapped earbuds. While of rather poor quality, at least they were available for free for those passengers who forgot to bring their own.

No amenity kit was provided, and no amenities were provided in the lavatories.

Food and Beverage

While the cabin and service felt much more like that of a low-cost carrier than a mainline carrier, the food and beverage options were decent.

Lunch service started about an hour after takeoff with special meals. The last economy passengers got their meals about 35 minutes later. Lunch choices weren't announced, but when flight attendants got to the last few rows of the back cabin, where I was sitting, the choices were pasta or chicken. I chose the chicken.

The main course consisted of two large cuts of tender white meat served with grilled vegetables and covered with mushroom gravy. The main was complemented by a side salad containing quite a lot of cheese and a creamy vinegar-mustard dressing, as well as an unheated, but not stale, roll and brownie. Notably, lunch was served with real metal silverware.

Shortly after meals were served, flight attendants passed through the cabin with a drink cart offering sodas, juices, Spanish beer and Spanish wine.

Flight attendants finished off the meal service with a choice of tea or coffee, served from pots carried down the aisle.

Between meals, water and juice sat out in the back galley, seemingly for passengers. But because they were located deep into the galley and flight attendants kept the galley curtains buttoned closed, it was pretty awkward to ask for a drink.

About an hour before landing, flight attendants passed through the cabin handing out box lunches containing a cold ham-and-cheese sandwich, yogurt, biscuit and Kit Kat bar. From the same cart, FAs also offered another drink from the same selection as before (sodas, juices, wine, beer).

My interactions with FAs weren't notably warm or cold, but rather they were simply transactional. Outside of meal service, they had little interest in helping passengers — with one exception. When I approached the galley to inquire about the Wi-Fi connection during meal preparation, a flight attendant took a few seconds to try to help before seeing the no-connectivity error and concluding that we wouldn't have Wi-Fi connection this flight.

One concerning aspect of the service: The flight attendants didn't seem prepared at all for landing. On final approach and at 1,000 feet of altitude, one was retrieving items from an overhead bin and another was returning a bag to another overhead bin. Both emergency-exit doors that I could see from my seat were unmanned. Although all was settled by wheels down, it seemed concerning that they weren't at their stations sooner.

My Oneworld Emerald status wasn't recognized by the lead flight attendant, and I received no special service such as an early meal choice or a welcome drink. This isn't something that I expect in economy, but some Oneworld carriers (Cathay Pacific, Japan Airlines, Sri Lankan Airlines) have impressed me by adding this service element.

Overall Impression

For an economy flight across the Atlantic, Iberia's A350 isn't a bad option. There's plenty of in-flight entertainment, decent storage, better-than-average seat width, a well-designed headrest and good food to make the trip easier. However, the 30-inch pitch makes personal space a little tight, and flight attendants aren't going to make the trip a pleasure.

Japan is making a push to develop flying cars, enlisting companies including Uber Technologies Inc and Airbus SE in a government-led group to bring airborne vehicles to the country in the next decade. The group will initially comprise 21 companies and organizations, including Boeing Co, NEC Corp, a Toyota Motor Corp-backed startup called Cartivator, ANA Holdings Inc, Japan Airlines Co, and Yamato Holdings Co, according to a statement Friday from the trade ministry in Tokyo. Delegates will gather Aug 29 to help chart a road map this year, it said.

“The Japanese government will provide appropriate support to help realize the concept of flying cars, such as creation of acceptable rules,” the ministry said.

Flying cars that can zoom over congested roads are closer to reality than many people think. Startups around the world are pursuing small aircraft, which were until recently only in the realm of science fiction. With Japanese companies already trailing their global peers in electric vehicles and self-driving cars, the government is showing urgency on the aircraft technology, stepping in to facilitate legislation and infrastructure to help gain leadership.

The introduction of this next-generation aircraft to the route demonstrates our commitment to providing passengers travelling to and from the U.S. with the most modern and technologically-advanced aircraft available, ensuring that their experience is second-to-none. We look forward to welcoming all passengers travelling to and from the U.S. on board this spectacular aircraft.”

The A350-1000 offers a total of 327 seats across two cabins, with 46 award-winning Qsuite Business Class seats and 281 18-inch extra wide Economy Class seats. The aircraft provides enhanced levels of passenger comfort, thanks to the lowest twin-engine noise level of any aircraft, advanced air conditioning technology and full LED mood lighting.

Like the A350-900, more than 70 per cent of the A350-1000’s lightweight airframe is made from advanced materials combining composites (53 per cent), titanium and advanced aluminum alloys. The aircraft’s carbon fibre reinforced plastic fuselage results in lower fuel burn, as well as easier maintenance. The A350-1000 also features a distinctive all-new, six-wheel main landing gear and four per cent larger wings.

Qatar Airways’ A350-1000 features the airline’s patented, award-winning Business Class experience, Qsuite, which offers the industry’s first-ever double bed in Business Class, as well as privacy panels that stow away, allowing passengers in adjoining seats to create their own private room, a first of its kind in the industry. Qsuite is currently available on flights to and from JFK, as well as Washington, D.C., Chicago and Houston.

Qatar Airways is known for its commitment to innovation; in addition to being the global launch customer for the A350-1000, the airline was the global launch customer for the A350-900 in 2014. The airline also recently took delivery of its fourth Gulfstream G650ER executive aircraft, the fastest ultra-long-range business jet in the world, making Qatar Airways the largest owner-operator of Gulfstream G650ERs.

Qatar Airways serves 10 cities across the U.S., including Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. The award-winning airline provides double-daily flights from New York’s JFK airport.

A multiple award-winning airline, Qatar Airways was named ‘World’s Best Business Class’ by the 2018 World Airline Awards, managed by international air transport rating organization Skytrax. It was also named ‘Best Business Class Seat,’ ‘Best Airline in the Middle East,’ and ‘World’s Best First Class Airline Lounge.’

Qatar Airways is one of the world’s fastest-growing airlines, with a modern fleet of more than 200 aircraft flying to business and leisure destinations across six continents. The award-winning airline recently revealed a host of upcoming new global destinations, including Tallinn, Estonia; Valletta, Malta; Langkawi, Malaysia; and Da Nang, Vietnam."

Eleven years after it entered service, the world’s biggest passenger plane has finally been deployed on the planet’s premier long-haul route: London to New York.

But the secondhand A380 will fly the route for only three weeks.

The “SuperJumbo” has been chartered by Norwegian for its Gatwick-JFK operation. It is needed to cover for Boeing 787 Dreamliners which are out of service due to continuing problems with Rolls-Royce engines.

From 3 to 23 August one of Norwegian’s two daily services on the route will be operated by an A380 belonging to the Portuguese charter airline, Hi Fly.

As The Independent reported in April, Hi Fly has acquired one of the A380s formerly leased by Singapore Airlines.

It has re-painted the jet with a campaigning slogan “Coral Reefs Gone By 2050”.

According to Hi Fly’s publicity, the cabin configuration has remained the same, with 12 first class “suites”, 60 business class seats and 399 economy seats.

Passengers who have booked Norwegian’s premium economy are expected to be offered lie-flat business class seats.

A spokesperson for Norwegian said: “We have hired a Hi Fly A380 to operate our evening London-New York service for several weeks in August as continued issues with a specific Rolls-Royce engine type affecting our 787 Dreamliner fleet has reduced our aircraft availability. This is in line with other airlines that have been affected by similar problems.

“We are pleased to be able to offer this solution to our customers to ensure that their journeys remain unaffected, the A380 SuperJumbo offers a high-quality experience between London and New York courtesy of Norwegian.”

Airbus 'SuperJumbo' A380 finds a secondhand market

But the maiden flight on Friday evening is currently running four hours late due to “stand congestion” at New York JFK.

The Airbus A380 has so far been a commercial failure, with only 331 orders. In comparison, the Boeing 747 Jumbo jet has sold more than 1,500.

By far the biggest customer of the SuperJumbo is Emirates, with almost half the deliveries so far.

Virgin Atlantic, one of several airlines that originally ordered the plane, formally cancelled its order for six A380s earlier this year.

Airbus still believes there is potential for new orders for the jet because of the unrelenting growth of aviation and the fact that airport infrastructure is failing to expand at the same rate — especially at London Heathrow.

Yet while Emirates flies six A380s a day between Heathrow and Dubai, the plane has never been commercially deployed by any airline between London and New York – even though it is by far the busiest long-haul route in the world.

Pilot films A380 take-off from Heathrow

The SuperJumbo could potentially extract more value from “slot-constrained” airports, of which Heathrow and Gatwick are the most prominent examples.

British Airways, which has a dozen A380s, would be the obvious candidate. But instead it deploys a mix of 777s and ageing Boeing 747s from Heathrow. BA also flies a daily 777 from Gatwick to JFK in competition with Norwegian.

But the business travellers who pay handsomely – up to £6,000 one way – to fly between the world’s main financial capitals have always appeared more interested in frequency than scale.

The temporary deployment of the A380, though, may provide data on whether a budget service between London and New York using the giant jet could be viable. In turn, that would boost the prospects for the A380 if a meaningful second-hand market were to develop."
PAL Aerospace seeks talent for SAR operating bases - Skies Magazine,"Mon, 20 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vc2tpZXNtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvcGFsLWFlcm9zcGFjZS1zZWVrcy1pc3MtdGFsZW50LWZvci1yY2FmLXNhci1vcGVyYXRpbmctYmFzZXMv0gFaaHR0cHM6Ly9za2llc21hZy5jb20vbmV3cy9wYWwtYWVyb3NwYWNlLXNlZWtzLWlzcy10YWxlbnQtZm9yLXJjYWYtc2FyLW9wZXJhdGluZy1iYXNlcy8_YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Chris Thatcher | August 20, 2018 Chris Thatcher |

Estimated reading time 4 minutes, 59 seconds.

PAL Aerospace is on the hunt for maintenance, materiel, information technology and other support talent to staff the Royal Canadian Air Force’s (RCAF’s) four search and rescue main operating bases.

Twenty months after the federal government selected 16 Airbus CC-295W fixed-wing search and rescue aircraft to replace six CC-115 Buffalos and 12 CC-130 H-model Hercules, St. John’s, N.L.-based PAL is ready to hire the team that will deliver in-service support (ISS) for the new fleet.

“PAL Aerospace will be providing a wide assortment of program management services as we prepare to undertake the maintenance and logistics support, heavy maintenance, including a mobile repair team, and centralize supply chain management activities for this aircraft,” Eva Martinez, vice-president of ISS, told the Abbotsford Aerospace, Defence and Security Expo (ADSE) in August.

As a supplier to Airbus, PAL is responsible for maintenance and material support of the new fleet, providing an integrated team of aircraft maintenance engineers (AMEs), warehouse and tool crib personnel, a technical library and a contractor field office at four main operating bases in Comox, B.C., Winnipeg, Man., Trenton, Ont., and Greenwood, N.S. Each base will require around 11 people.

PAL will also establish and maintain a maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) facility in Winnipeg for heavy maintenance work. The shop will be co-located with its central warehouse, and will be home base for the mobile repair team. In total, PAL expects to hire around 28 people to staff the facility.

As for material, PAL will provide ground support equipment, a 30-day supply of aircraft consumables at each base, personal protective equipment, and shipping and handling of all aircraft spare parts, said Martinez, an aerospace engineer who served 13 years in the Air Force.

Through a joint venture with Airbus called AirPro, PAL will collaborate on the integration of all ISS services.

“Our hiring target as it stands right now is 73,” she said. “As we work with Canada and Airbus to fully define the maintenance tasks, we could see an increase in the level of effort required…for AMEs.”

That workload is based in part on RCAF plans to locate three CC-295W at each base. Two more will reside with the operational training unit in Comox while a final two will serve as floaters.

“They will be moved around depending on the induction into heavy maintenance as well as the operational tempo,” said Martinez.

Comox, which will include the RCAF’s new search and rescue training centre, will stand up in 2019 to coincide with the arrival of the first aircraft, expected by the end of next year. The front, mid and rear fuselage sections have been delivered to Airbus’s pre-final assembly line in Tablada, Spain, and the final aircraft is expected to roll out in the first quarter of 2019.

“Once the first wave of AMEs are hired, then we’ll be looking to hire the rest of the logistical and administrative staff to support the operations in Comox,” said Martinez.

Though the timelines may shift slightly, Trenton is expected to be ready by 2020, followed by Greenwood and Winnipeg in 2021. The central warehouse and MRO facility “will be fully set up by 2022, possibly earlier as there are talks of an earlier induction of the aircraft into heavy maintenance,” said Martinez.

In addition to the hiring blitz, Martinez said PAL is also exploring potential partnerships with suppliers “to help us meet our contractual obligations and our general supply chain requirements.”

As a tier 1 supplier to the Airbus contract, PAL is expected to meet the Canadian government’s industrial and technological benefit (ITB) requirements, which require investments in Canadian companies and industry and academic research equal to the value of the contract.

PAL has hosted several supplier engagement events across the country and is working with the Offset Market Exchange (OMX) procurement platform to inform and identify companies.

“We will be looking for Canadian suppliers that will help us meet those obligations,” she said."
A350-900ULR: Singapore Airlines could be the sole customer | CAPA - CAPA - Centre for Aviation,"Fri, 10 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vY2VudHJlZm9yYXZpYXRpb24uY29tL2FuYWx5c2lzL3JlcG9ydHMvYTM1MC05MDB1bHItc2luZ2Fwb3JlLWFpcmxpbmVzLWNvdWxkLWJlLXRoZS1zb2xlLWN1c3RvbWVyLTQzMTExMNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Summary

The first A350-900ULR has rolled out of the paint shop and is slated to enter service with Singapore Airlines in Oct-2018 as SIA resumes Singapore-Newark nonstop flights.

The A350-900ULR features an enhanced maximum takeoff weight and an aerodynamic performance improvement package that is also now available on standard A350-900s.

Iberia and Philippine Airlines have already taken delivery of A350-900s with the increased MTOW and aerodynamic performance improvement package, which PAL can benefit from as it launches new nonstop Manila-New York flights.

The A350-900ULR has increased fuel capacity but the extra fuel can only be realistically accessed if an airline opts for a low density configuration.

SIA may ultimately be the only A350-900ULR operator, given the uniqueness of its ultra long range requirement and its premium focus.

SIA gears up for A350-900ULR operations

As CAPA has highlighted in prior analysis reports, SIA plans to operate its new fleet of seven A350-900ULRs on 20 weekly nonstop flights to the US, which will all be launched during 4Q2018.

The first A350-900ULR route will be Singapore-Newark - which begins in Oct-2018 and enables SIA to regain the status of operating the world's longest route. The route is approximately 8,300nm and has a scheduled flight time (in the northern winter schedule) of 18hr30min from Newark. From Singapore the flight has a slightly shorter scheduled flight time of 17hr 50mins.

The rest of the A350-900ULR fleet will be used on the shorter Singapore-Los Angeles and Singapore-San Francisco routes. SIA has operated nonstop flights from Singapore to San Francisco since late 2016 using standard A350-900s. Nonstop flights from Singapore to Newark and Los Angeles were operated from 2004 to 2013 using A340-500s.

See related reports:

A350-900ULR range spec is based on low density configuration

Airbus lists the A350-900ULR as having a range of up to 9,700nm and capable of flying more than 20 hours. However, these range figures are based on an all-premium configuration. For all other aircraft models, including the standard A350-900, Airbus range figures are based on an average medium density three class configuration.



SIA is configuring its A350-900ULRs with only 161 seats, consisting of 94 premium economy and 67 business class seats. Even with only 161 seats, SIA expects payload restrictions will limit its ability to carry any cargo from Newark to Singapore during certain periods of the year. With a slightly longer route, SIA would likely not be able to sell all 161 seats.

SIA has 253 seats on its standard long haul configured A350-900s, which have a maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) of 275 tonnes. It now has some payload restrictions from San Francisco to Singapore using this aircraft, but would not have any payload restrictions if this aircraft had only 161 seats. SIA would also likely not have payload restrictions from San Francisco with the 253-seat configuration if it acquired standard A350-900s with an upgraded MTOW of 280 tonnes.

In addition, SIA would likely be able to operate Los Angeles-Singapore without any payload restrictions using 161-seat standard (non-ULR) A350-900. Los Angeles-Singapore is about 7600nm and has a scheduled flight time of 17hr 50mins, while San Francisco-Singapore is about 7300nm and has a scheduled flight time of 17hr 35mins (during winter months). The flights from Singapore to the US west coast are up to three hours shorter (depending on the time of year) due to tailwinds.

A350-900ULR provides extra fuel and several design improvements

The A350-900ULR essentially gives SIA an extra hour or two of range over the standard A350-900, assuming equal density.

The A350-900ULR has 24,000 litres of additional fuel capacity, which is 17% more than the fuel capacity on the standard A350-900. Airbus has been able to make this fuel capacity available by modifying the piping and valves in the A350-900 fuel system.

Additional tanks were not necessary, making the A350-900ULR a relatively cheap development programme; cheap enough that even if SIA ends up being the only customer, Airbus can justify the cost.

Airbus also designed some minor modifications, resulting in a small fuel burn improvement. These include larger winglets and changes to the wing (a slight twist), flap supporting fairings and overwing fairings.

However, as all these improvements are also now being offered on the standard A350-900s, the investment can be recouped across a much larger number of aircraft. The new increased MTOW of 280 tonnes is also now available on the standard A350-900.

Extra fuel benefit is only useful in a low density configuration

The additional fuel capacity is essentially the only unique benefit of the A350-900ULR. It is now available to any A350 customer that elects to acquire the A350-900ULR.

However, this extra fuel capacity can realistically only be used if a low density premium-focused configuration is selected. With a normal configuration (approximately 300 passengers), the A350-900ULR would be too heavy to take off when loaded with passengers and the extra 24,000 litres in fuel.

Therefore, the A350-900ULR is only useful for airlines that have a requirement to fly routes of 18 to 20 hours in a very low density configuration (100 to 200 seats, depending on the exact length of route). There are not likely any airlines with such a requirement, given there are not many - if any - markets similar to Singapore-US in terms of route length and premium mix.

Airbus increases range of standard A350-900

Airbus lists the standard A350-900 as having a range of up to 8,100nm based on a typical 325-seat three class configuration. The 8,100nm range is for an aircraft with the newly available MTOW of 280 tonnes.

The 275 tonne variant now operated by SIA has a published range of 7,750nm. The original 268 tonne variant of the A350-900, which was the only option when the A350-900 first entered service in 2014, has a published range of 7,270nm. Airbus also offers a 250 tonne option with a derated engine for regional operations.

A350-900 range by variant

Variant Range In-service date A350-900 MTOW 268-tonne 7,270nm 2014 A350-900 MTOW 275-tonne 7,750nm 2016 A350-900 MTOW 280-tonne 8,100nm 2018 A350-900ULR 9,700nm 2018

In late Jun-2018 Iberia took delivery of the first 280 tonne MTOW A350. This was the first A350 to feature the aerodynamic performance improvement package (larger winglets, wing twist, enhanced flap supporting fairings and modified overwing fairings) that had originally been designed for the A350-900ULR.

PAL to operate longest A350-900 non-ULR route

In mid Jul-2018 Philippine Airlines (PAL) also took delivery of an A350 with the aerodynamic improvement package and the 280 tonne MTOW. PAL initially ordered six A350-900s with an enhanced MTOW of 278 tonnes in 2016, and can benefit from the improvement package as it operates ultra long range routes.

Iberia does not have any ultra long range routes but will operate the A350-900 on long range routes of up to 13 hours (such as Buenos Aires). Iberia has selected a relatively high density configuration of 348 seats, and the increased MTOW could be useful from a cargo payload perspective on Spain-South America routes.

PAL has opted for a 295-seat three class configuration for its new fleet of six A350-900s and is now operating its first A350 on regional routes ahead of the 28-Oct-2018 launch of nonstop flights to New York. PAL also plans to use its first batch of A350s to replace 777-300ERs on the Manila-London route.

New York-Manila will become the longest route operated by the standard A350-900. The route is approximately 7400nm, making it slightly longer than San Francisco-Singapore. New York to Manila has a scheduled block time of 16hr 30mins. Manila to New York is one hour shorter.

PAL and other airlines do not have a need for the A350-900ULR

If PAL wants to operate a longer US route it would need to acquire the A350-900ULR. However, it would also need to reduce the density to accommodate the additional fuel. The US-Philippines market has a relatively low proportion of premium traffic, making such a configuration unviable.

PAL is now not planning to launch any longer US routes. The airline was earlier considering Miami-Manila, which is approximately 8,100nm. However, PAL is now instead only considering Chicago and Seattle for its final two A350s, which are slated for delivery in 2019. Chicago-Manila is slightly shorter than New York-Manila.

The PAL example highlights how difficult it will be for Airbus to find a second customer for the A350-900ULR. Thai Airways and Vietnam Airlines have a similar issue and would need high density aircraft for potential US nonstop flights, given the limited premium traffic in the Thailand/Vietnam-US markets.

There are currently 191 A350s in service (184 A350-900s and seven A350-1000s) spread across 20 operators, according to the CAPA Fleet Database. SIA is the third largest A350 operator after Qatar Airways and Cathay Pacific.

Southeast Asia is the region with the greatest number of A350s, with 52 aircraft in service spread across five operators (SIA, PAL, Vietnam Airlines, Thai Airways and Malaysia Airlines). Southeast Asia-US is an ideal market for the A350-900ULR from a range perspective, but only Singapore-US has the premium traffic for the type to be viable.

A350 in-service fleet by region: as of 1-Aug-2018

Airbus currently has 550 orders for the A350-900 (includes orders not yet confirmed), along with the seven orders for the A350-900ULR, according to the CAPA Fleet Database. It is unlikely that any of the A350-900 orders will be converted to ULRs."

Estimated reading time 11 minutes, 22 seconds.

As it launched into the blue, cloud-streaked sky over Farnborough International Airport in mid-July, the aircraft formerly known as Bombardier’s C Series CS300 seemed to blend in as much as it stood out.

It was just days removed from a major rebrand, after Airbus’ controlling stake in the C Series took effect on July 1, and the aircraft arrived at Farnborough in a simple, white-and-blue livery and with a new name painted on its side: Airbus A220-300.

Appearances aside, the A220-300’s arrival at the Farnborough International Airshow (FIA), which ran July 16 to 22, may have been a turning point in the program.

After a chaotic year, punctuated with the threat of massive tariffs from the United States that threatened the future of the C Series and prompted the deal with Airbus, the program is showing signs of life.

Airbus announced a memorandum of understanding (MoU) at Farnborough to provide 60 A220-300 aircraft to a new start-up airline backed by JetBlue founder David Neeleman.

That deal followed on the heels of a similar agreement with JetBlue itself for 60 A220-300s, announced just prior to Farnborough, which bills itself as the world’s largest airshow.

“After years of U.S. airline consolidation, the conditions are improving for a new generation of U.S. airline to emerge, focused on passenger service and satisfaction,” said Neeleman in a news release.

“The A220 will enable us to serve thinner routes in comfort without compromising cost, especially on longer-range missions.”

Deliveries to the start-up airline are set to begin in 2021, and JetBlue expects its first deliveries in 2020.

“This U.S. airline startup’s decision for the A220 as the platform on which to launch their new business model is a testament to the passenger appeal and operating economics of this outstanding aircraft,” said Eric Schulz, chief commercial officer for Airbus.

This was not the tsunami of new orders Airbus may have hoped for, but it was certainly a wave worth catching, and perhaps a sign of things to come.

LOOKING UP

While the A220 orders were a major story for Canadian aerospace–Bombardier still has a 34 per cent stake in the program, and Investissement Quebec owns about 16 per cent–they were symptoms of general optimism at Farnborough.

It was a remarkably successful show for many of the major OEMs, with more than 1,400 orders and commitments announced.

Boeing says it won a total of 673 aircraft orders valued at nearly US$100 billion.

Airbus confirmed agreements for 431 new commercial aircraft, although it did not disclose a corresponding value for those orders.

Embraer announced orders and commitments for 300 aircraft, valued at US$15.3 billion, while Bombardier added just one firm order for four CRJ900 aircraft to Uganda National Airlines.

“Boeing led the way at Farnborough,” said Dennis Muilenburg, the company’s chairman, president and CEO.

“We will continue to win in the marketplace thanks to our talented team.”

NEW FOCUS

Bombardier used Farnborough to refocus on its business jet and regional airline offerings, making several announcements that may boost sales down the line.

The company revealed its Challenger 350 business jet has achieved Transport Canada steep approach certification, allowing operators to land at the steep 5.5 degree approach angle, and on the short runway at London City Airport.

Both European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) steep approach certifications are expected this year.

Bombardier also unveiled its new Atmosphere cabin design for CRJ Series aircraft, in partnership with launch operator Delta Air Lines and supplier Zodiac Aerospace.

The company bills Atmosphere as a philosophy as well as a design, aimed at delivering a higher level of passenger comfort, convenience and accessibility while ensuring maximum branding opportunities for airlines.

Its features include spacious overhead bins, the largest windows in its class, Internet connectivity, and an accessible lavatory for passengers with reduced mobility (PRM). The CRJ Series is the first and only regional aircraft to offer a PRM lavatory option, according to Bombardier.

At Farnborough, the company also showcased its Q400 turboprop, in Ethiopian Airlines livery, and the Global 6000 business jet.

Bombardier announced during the show that TAG Aviation Europe, a leading private and business aviation service provider, is the first to offer the long range Global 5000 aircraft with Premier cabin, for charter to European customers.

GOVERNMENT PRESENCE

Canada’s federal government had a considerable presence at Farnborough, sending cabinet ministers Navdeep Bains, Marc Garneau and Carla Qualtrough to spread the word about Canada’s world-class aerospace industry.

Bains, who is minister of innovation, science and economic development, led the government’s charm offensive and highlighted the country’s globally-integrated, export-oriented and innovation-driven approach.

The three ministers accompanied a delegation of 420 representatives from more than 130 Canadian aerospace companies to the airshow.

Bains and his colleagues held meetings with leaders of aerospace companies based in Canada and around the world, according to a news release.

“I am proud to have had the opportunity to share with the world why Canada is a destination of choice for companies and investors in the aerospace industry,” said Bains.

“Canada is a world leader in aerospace innovation, and we want to keep that enviable position.”

CAE

Montreal-based CAE used Farnborough to launch the CAE 700MR Series flight training device (FTD), a next-generation platform designed specifically for military helicopter flight and mission training.

The CAE 700MR Series FTD is based on the CAE 3000MR Series full-mission helicopter simulator, but in a fixed-base platform with a dynamic seat for vibration and motion cueing.

Key features include an extreme field-of-view visual system with a CAE Medallion-6000XR image generator to provide an immersive training experience; computer-generated forces software for a realistic tactical synthetic environment; and support for military-specific training scenarios, including ship deck landings, night vision goggle training and confined area landing training.

“We listened to our customers to design and develop a high-end flight training device that addresses the highest priorities for military helicopter mission training,” said Gene Colabatistto, CAE’s group president, Defence and Security.

CAE also introduced its new Women in Flight scholarship program at Farnborough with the goal of helping women advance in the aviation industry.

Through the program, CAE intends to provide financial support to aspiring female pilots by awarding up to five full scholarships to one of the cadet pilot training programs in its global training network.

CAE also plans to give selected candidates access to their first job through the company’s global partners. Another objective is to elevate selected candidates to become aviation role models and inspire even more women to become pilots.

BELL

Bell announced at Farnborough it will collaborate with Subaru Corporation on a commercial enhancement of the Bell 412 EPI helicopter–type certified in July as the Subaru Bell 412EPX–in support of the Japan UH-X program.

Subaru was awarded the contract to replace Japan Ground Self Defence Force’s (JGSDF’s) current fleet of UH-1J aircraft with a militarized derivative of the Subaru Bell 412 EPX.

The 412 EPX will benefit from a more robust main rotor gearbox dry run capability, increased internal maximum gross weight to 12,200 pounds (5,533 kilograms) and mast torque output of more than 11 per cent at speeds below 60 knots.

A commercial prototype has undergone testing at Bell’s facility in Mirabel, Que., and it received Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification on July 5, 2018.

Bell also announced the Bell 429 global fleet has exceeded 330,000 hours of operation.

There are 325 Bell 429 aircraft operating in countries around the world, including Australia, Canada, France, Indonesia, Kuwait, Oman, Switzerland, Slovakia, Sweden, Turkey, Thailand, the United States and the United Kingdom.

P&WC

Pratt & Whitney Canada (P&WC) announced at Farnborough it has signed an agreement with Hawker Pacific that will see the two companies work together to enhance the delivery of customer services and solutions.

The agreement spans most P&WC engine models and diagnostics and prognostics products across all segments, including business aviation, general aviation, offshore, utility, regional aviation and defence and security.

Under the agreement, Hawker Pacific will provide an array of maintenance, repair, engineering and customer support services to P&WC engine customers, as well as mobile repair technician services.

The two companies will collaborate to deliver and install P&WC’s diagnostic, prognostics and engine health management solutions, including its FAST prognostics solution, under its Digital Engine Services portfolio.

P&WC also announced that China Southern Airlines has selected the APS3200 auxiliary power unit (APU) for the airline’s order of 104 purchased and leased aircraft from the Airbus A320 family.

The airline has signed a long-term, comprehensive support agreement with P&WC to cover APS3200 maintenance. With this contract award, China Southern will operate more than 250 Airbus A320 family aircraft with the APS3200.

OTHER PLAYERS

MDA announced during the show it has acquired Neptec Design Group Ltd., a leading electro-optical and electro-mechanical systems and high-performance intelligent light detection and ranging (LiDAR) company, for $42 million.

The transaction is comprised of about $8 million in cash, with the balance in Maxar common shares, according to a news release.

With Neptec, MDA intends to deliver end-to-end robotic systems and an expanded set of solutions, positioning the company to capture growth in U.S., Canadian and international global space exploration markets.

Heroux-Devtek announced it has been awarded a five-year contract from Lockheed Martin to manufacture landing gear for C-130J Super Hercules aircraft.

Under the agreement, Heroux-Devtek will manufacture and assemble landing gear for Lockheed Martin’s global production of C-130J aircraft and provide spare parts over a five-year period beginning in January 2020.

Boeing also selected Heroux-Devtek to manufacture main landing gear and side braces for F/A-18 Super Hornet and EA-18G Growler aircraft, with first deliveries in the third quarter of 2020.

SkyX, a drone manufacturer based in Markham, Ont., launched its latest product at Farnborough 2018: the SkyTwo unmanned aircraft system (UAS).

SkyTwo is an electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) drone that flies beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS), with a planned range of 170 kilometres on a single charge.

It would then recharge for about 2.5 hours on a remote xStation before continuing a mission.

SkyTwo is in the research and development phase, with test flights expected to begin in September. SkyX expects the product to be market-ready in 2019.

BRIGHT FUTURE

While Embraer made a bigger splash than Bombardier and the A220 family combined at Farnborough, all could benefit from a commercial airline market expected to swell in size over the next 20 years.

Embraer is projecting demand for 10,550 new aircraft with up to 150 seats worldwide over the next two decades, depending on the economic health of the airline industry.

If the forecast comes close to reality, the A220 family will likely battle head-to-head with Embraer’s E-Jets E2 family, with Boeing as a likely partner for the Brazilian OEM.

“This commitment confirms the important role the A220 aircraft now occupies in our Airbus single-aisle portfolio,” said Eric Schulz, chief operating officer for Airbus, as he announced the company’s 60-aircraft deal with the U.S. startup.

It was an understated way of saying this flashy, intentionally disruptive Canadian creation is now a relatively discreet member of the much larger Airbus family.

It seems to blend in as much as it stands out, but it shows no signs of fading away ."

Flight JD5759 was scheduled from Beijing International Airport to Macau but during the approach – the weather at Macau at the time of landing consisted of rain and wind with gusts up to 30 knots – the aircraft hit the runway very hard. One of the gears that got detached, hit the left hand engine. Due to the failure of the communication system and a lack of satellite phone, the aircraft was communicating with the ground using the ACARS onboard.

After declaring an emergency (Mayday), the pilots entered a holding pattern Northeast from the airport and then decided to divert to Shenzhen Airport. On approach the pilots first did a low pass over the field for a visual check on the landing gears.

Beijing Capital Airlines confirmed the accident, in total, there were 166 passengers and 9 crew members on board. After the landing at Shenzhen Airport an emergency evacuation was initiated, five of the passengers were slightly injured (most likely during the emergency evacuation).

On Sunday, another company Airbus A320 aircraft had a decompression, forcing the pilots to descend rapidly.

I recently flew Virgin Atlantic from London Heathrow to New York's JFK International Airport.

Virgin Atlantic's service, style, and entertainment options lived up to expectations, but its economy-seat comfort left much to be desired.

Virgin Atlantic Airways is a survivor. For most of its 34-year history, the plucky British airline has been taking the fight to larger and more established rivals.

Through it all, Virgin Atlantic has survived everything from the economic recession to an underhanded smear campaign by British Airways during the early 1990s.

Even though several airlines around the world have worn Virgin Group livery, including Virgin Australia and the soon-to-disappear Virgin America, Virgin Atlantic has always been Sir Richard Branson's baby. After all, the billionaire sold his once prized Virgin Records in 1992 to keep the airline afloat.

In late 2012, Willie Walsh, the CEO of British Airways' parent company, International Airlines Group, bet Branson, Virgin Group's founder, that his airline would be out of business within five years — loser gets kneed in the crotch.

Now, with Delta and Air France-KLM holding 80% of its shares, Virgin Atlantic is not only still flying, but in a stronger position as ever. And to my knowledge, Branson has yet to collect on the bet.

With roughly 45 planes in its fleet, Virgin Atlantic isn't a very big airline. British Airways, for example, has more than 270 planes, while a major US legacy carrier like Delta has nearly 900 mainline jets in its inventory.

However, the crown jewel of Branson's aviation portfolio is certainly influential. From its mood-light-drenched cabins to its stylish dressed staff, Virgin delivers service with a style and flair all its own.

On a recent business trip to the UK, I decided to fly Virgin Atlantic's bread-and-butter service between New York and London. It's arguably the most competitive route in a highly lucrative transatlantic-airline market. On the flight out from Newark Liberty International Airport, I took VS02, one of the airline's original flights dating back to its days as a one-plane operation.

Since it was an evening flight that took off at 10:30, I decided to document my afternoon flight back from London.

Here's a closer look at my most recent trip on Virgin Atlantic Airways."

The Irish budget airline’s investment has allowed Laudamotion to purchase an additional 9 Airbus A320 aircraft which will be delivered across Summer 2019.

The new aircraft will bring the fleet total to 18.

The airline has also unveiled a raft of increases to pilot pay which it says are among the highest in the industry including a guaranteed starting salary of €46,000p.a. for First Officers and €90,000p.a. for Captains. The move comes after Ryanair has been hit be a series of strikes by its pilots in Europe over pay and conditions.

Laudamotion’s CEO, Andreas Gruber, said: “Laudamotion now faces the future with great confidence, backed by the enormous financial strength of Ryanair, our new majority shareholder and Europe’s largest airline. Laudamotion has already achieved load factors over 90% in its first summer season, thanks to the efforts of over 500 Laudamotion colleagues. These 9 additional 2019 Airbus deliveries ensure that Laudamotion will grow again by at least 20% in 2019 to 5m guests p.a. We look forward to offering even more low fare choices to Austrian and German customers.”

Ryanair’s Chief Commercial Officer, David O’Brien, added: “Ryanair is pleased to complete the purchase of a 75% shareholding in Laudamotion GmbH from Niki Lauda and his team. We applaud the extraordinary work of Niki Lauda, Andreas Gruber and all the Laudamotion team in the face of very difficult market circumstances and unfair competitor activity to deliver this flying programme this summer, which has provided low fares for the first time ever on over 53 routes. We look forward to fulfilling Niki Lauda’s vision of Laudamotion as Austria’s No. 1 low fare airline and providing competition and choice to the high fare airlines which have for too long fleeced Austrian and German consumers/visitors. We also wish Niki a very speedy recovery and look forward to welcoming him back as soon as possible.”

Laudamotion operates from Vienna airport to destinations across Europe and flights can be purchased via Ryanair.com."

CORITY has been awarded the contract to provide integrated environmental, health, and safety platform to Airbus.

Airbus has recently introduced an innovative strategic project to harmonise EHS management by implementing a global digital platform, called FISH (Federated Information for Safety and Health). FISH will leverage Cority’s comprehensive solution across its 180 global locations – replacing existing point solutions. Spearheaded by Gregory Mould, Airbus Head of Health and Safety, this is a wide-reaching initiative to support all levels of the organization and prepare Airbus for the digital revolution in EHS risk management.

Airbus selected Cority to provide the FISH solution after an extensive evaluation of multiple EHS software vendors. The multi-function selection team were convinced by the robust data security, purpose-built workflows, and advanced reporting capabilities, as well as the passion, customer focus and tenacity of the Cority experts.

Cority now forms the foundation of the FISH platform and will enable an integrated approach to EHS management for Airbus, providing a holistic view of EHS performance across all departments, sites, and countries. As well as the EHS specialists, the company’s operational managers will use Cority, driving operational excellence and compliance by streamlining core processes to reduce risk to people, the environment, and the business.

“At Airbus, we are fully committed – from the Executives to the teams around the globe – to providing world-class occupational health and safety standards for those who make, maintain and operate our products,” said Gregory Mould. “This single solution will help us deliver accurate analysis, clear reporting, and proactive risk mitigation, to continuously improve worker health and environmental protection. We chose Cority because their solution fully integrates environment, health, and safety, has huge functionality and multilingual capability, and is backed up by their firm commitment to continue to evolve the technology with our EHS goals in mind.”

Cority senior director Mike Jackson added: “Airbus has demonstrated unwavering industry leadership in understanding how strong EHS performance translates into business success and we look forward to working closely with them on enabling their Federated Information for Safety and Health strategy.”
