Airbus and partners to establish aircraft lifecycle centre in China - Airbus,"Tue, 18 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMi0wMS1haXJidXMtYW5kLXBhcnRuZXJzLXRvLWVzdGFibGlzaC1haXJjcmFmdC1saWZlY3ljbGUtY2VudHJlLWluLWNoaW5h0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Chengdu, 18 January 2022 – Airbus has signed a Memorandum Of Understanding (MOU) with the city of Chengdu and Tarmac Aerosave for the development of the first sustainable aircraft “lifecycle” service centre in China. This agreement will cover a range of activities from aircraft parking and storage, to maintenance, upgrades, conversions, dismantling and recycling services for various aircraft types.

“This is another concrete contribution to the aviation industry's quest for sustainability, supporting the principle of a circular economy in line with Airbus’ purpose to pioneer sustainable aerospace. This unique centre will support the expansion of Airbus’ aviation services while enabling the implementation of China's “Green Industry” strategy”, said Klaus Roewe, SVP Airbus Customer Services. “Aircraft phase-out in China is forecast to grow exponentially over the next 20 years. Airbus is committed to investing in the region and this one-stop-shop - a first in China and outside of Europe - will see Airbus well positioned on the Chinese aircraft ‘second life’ services market.” he added.

A formal agreement to establish and frame this industrial cooperation is planned to be signed between the partners in mid-2022, with an entry into service of the new centre slated for the end of 2023, subject to relevant regulatory approvals.

Tarmac Aerosave will bring its 15 years of proven expertise in eco-efficient aircraft dismantling to the project. Located in the same centre, Airbus subsidiary Satair will acquire ageing aircraft, trade and distribute the resulting used parts to complete the full scope of lifecycle services. The facility will cover a surface area of 690,000 square metres and a storage capacity of 125 aircraft.

Airbus continues to deploy its sustainability roadmap for the aviation industry, enabling the increased re-use of aircraft and the recycling of materials and equipment.

Airbus and Boeing Report Q4 and Full-Year 2021 Commercial Aircraft Orders and Deliveries - Defense & Security Monitor,"Tue, 18 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL2RzbS5mb3JlY2FzdGludGVybmF0aW9uYWwuY29tLzIwMjIvMDEvMTgvYWlyYnVzLWFuZC1ib2VpbmctcmVwb3J0LXE0LWFuZC1mdWxsLXllYXItMjAyMS1jb21tZXJjaWFsLWFpcmNyYWZ0LW9yZGVycy1hbmQtZGVsaXZlcmllcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"by J. Kasper Oestergaard, European Correspondent, Forecast International.

Boeing and Airbus delivered 99 and 187 commercial jets in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared to 59 and 225 deliveries, respectively, in Q4 2020. Q4 marked another quarter of strong year-over-year growth for Boeing, whereas Airbus delivered fewer aircraft than in the fourth quarter of 2020 due to a dip in October shipments.

Following a more than challenging 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, 2021 was a year of recovery for the two largest commercial plane makers. However, Boeing and Airbus still have quite a way to go before deliveries are back to pre-pandemic levels. For the full year 2021, Boeing delivered 340 aircraft, compared to 157 and 380 in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Boeing’s last “normal” year was 2018 – before COVID and the 737 MAX grounding – when it delivered 806 jets, a level that will likely not be recaptured before 2024 or 2025. The past three years have been extremely challenging for Boeing but, despite ongoing Dreamliner issues, things are now looking brighter than at any time since the second 737 MAX crash occurred in March 2019. Orders are strong and deliveries have surged from the 2020 lows, with another sharp increase expected in 2022. In addition, the 737 MAX is poised to resume commercial flights in China any day now – well over a year after the FAA ungrounded the aircraft in November 2020.

In 2021, Airbus delivered 611 aircraft and won the deliveries crown for the third year in a row. Deliveries were up from 566 in 2020 but remain well below the company’s all-time record high of 863 shipments in 2019. Airbus is expected to retain the deliveries lead for the foreseeable future due to the company’s comfortable backlog lead over its American rival. Prior to 2019, Boeing had out-delivered Airbus every year since 2012.

As indicated above, in Q4 2021, Boeing delivered 99 jets – up from 85 in Q3 – including 84 737s (78 MAX / 6 NG), three 747-8s, eight 767s, and four 777s. Boeing expects to increase the 737 MAX production rate to 31 per month by early 2022, up from 19 by the end of October 2021. Further increases will follow as market demand allows. No 787s were delivered in the fourth quarter after Boeing halted deliveries in May 2021 for the second time in less than a year. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is reviewing Boeing’s method for inspecting and evaluating the aircraft to ensure it meets federal safety regulations. The FAA is also looking into whether modifications are needed on in-service 787s; however, the regulator has also made it clear that the issue poses no immediate threat to flight safety. Recently, new manufacturing defects were identified and the FAA has issued a number of memos and warnings. According to Boeing, the company is continuing to complete comprehensive inspections across the 787 production system and within the supply chain, while holding detailed, transparent discussions with the FAA, suppliers, and customers. In November, leaders of the U.S. House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee asked for a government review of the FAA’s oversight of the 787. The current 787 production rate is approximately two aircraft per month and Boeing expects to continue at this rate until deliveries resume and then return to five per month over time. It is currently unknown when deliveries will be allowed to continue. The 777 program will get a new addition in late 2023 with the first delivery of the 777X. Meanwhile, talks continue on a 777X freighter variant to replace the 777F.

In Q4 2021, Airbus delivered 187 jets – up from 127 in Q3 – including 16 A220s, 142 A320s (138 NEO / 4 CEO), seven A330s, 19 A350s, and three A380s. During 2021, Airbus steadily increased A320 production from 40 per month to 43 in Q3 2021 before finishing the year at a rate of 45. Production will be gradually increased until reaching a monthly rate of 65 by summer 2023. Airbus has also discussed a scenario with a rate of 70 by Q1 2024. Longer term, the company is investigating opportunities for rates as high as 75 by 2025. The A220, meanwhile, is being produced at a rate of five aircraft per month. The rate will be increased to six in early 2022 – with a monthly production rate of 14 envisioned by the middle of the decade. The A350 production rate currently averages five per month and will be increased to six by early 2023. Airbus is currently producing two A330s per month, a rate that will be increased to nearly three aircraft by the end of 2022. In 2021, Airbus launched the new A350 freighter, or A350F, which is a major and much-needed boost to the company’s competitiveness in the cargo segment. Boeing has long dominated the cargo space with its 737-800BCF, 767-300BCF, 767-300F, 777F and 747-8F offerings. Until now, Airbus has only offered the A330-200F, which has not performed well in competition against Boeing’s popular 767-300F. With the launch of the A350F, it appears Airbus is finally getting serious about capturing more of the cargo aircraft market. The A350F, which carries up to 120 tons (109 metric tons) of cargo, received its first order in November and will predominantly compete with the 777F. In comparison, the 777F has a cargo capacity of up to 112 tons (102 metric tons). On December 16, Airbus delivered the 251st and final A380 to Emirates. The A380 is an impressive feat of aeronautical engineering and will, despite its lack of financial success, be forever enshrined in the annals of aviation history. With 123 A380s purchased, Emirates took delivery of nearly half the A380 fleet and currently operates 121 of the superjumbos.

Turning to the Q4 2021 orders review, a number of major orders were announced at the 2021 Dubai Airshow in November, which ended with over 500 new aircraft sales – a clear signal that the commercial aviation sector is recovering from the pandemic. Boeing had a solid fourth quarter and booked nine orders for a total of 199 jets. However, the company also reported 22 cancellations, of which 20 were for the 737 MAX, resulting in 177 net new orders in total. The 199 gross orders included 174 737s (all MAX), 19 767s, and six 777s. The largest order was placed by Akasa Air, which ordered 72 737 MAX jets at the 2021 Dubai Airshow. The order was a mix of regular 737-8s and high-capacity 737-8-200s. Akasa Air is an upcoming Indian low-cost airline expected to commence operations in May 2022. Also in Q4, Allegiant Air ordered 50 737 MAXs (a mix of 737-7s and 737-8-200s), ahead of 777 Partners, which booked 30 737 MAX jets. Furthermore, UPS ordered 19 767-300Fs for delivery between 2023 and 2025. In 2021, Boeing booked an impressive 909 gross orders and received 430 cancellations, for a total of 479 net new orders (before ASC 606 changes). In 2020, Boeing accumulated a total of 184 gross orders and received 655 cancellations, for a total of -471 net new orders.

Airbus had a very strong fourth quarter in 2021 and was the clear winner at the Dubai Airshow. The company booked 18 orders during the quarter for a total of 501 jets. Airbus also reported 127 cancellations, resulting in 374 net new orders. The largest order was placed by Air Lease Corporation (ALC), a leading American aircraft leasing company based in Los Angeles. ALC’s order includes 79 A321neos (a mix of regular A321neos and A321XLRs), 25 A220-300s, five A330-900s, and seven A350 freighters, for a total of 116 aircraft. Also in Q4, Wizz Air, a Hungarian ultra-low-cost carrier, ordered 102 A321neos. The order comprises 75 regular A321neos and 27 A321XLRs, with the bulk to be delivered between 2025 and 2027. Furthermore, Frontier Airlines ordered 91 A321neos.

In 2021, Airbus booked a total of 771 gross orders and received 264 cancellations, for a total of 507 net new orders – enough to win the orders crown for the third year in a row. It should be noted, however, that if Boeing’s 2021 ASC 606 adjustments are included, Boeing comes out ahead with 535 net new orders. In 2020, Airbus accumulated 383 gross orders and received 115 cancellations, for a total of 268 net new orders.

At the end of December 2021, Airbus reported a backlog of 7,082 jets, of which 6,314, or 89 percent, were A220 and A320ceo/neo family narrowbodies. This is 643 aircraft below the company’s all-time backlog record of 7,725 aircraft set in January 2020. By the end of the year, Boeing’s backlog (total unfilled orders before ASC 606 adjustment) was 5,136 aircraft, of which 4,138, or 81 percent, were 737 NG/MAX narrowbody jets. Boeing’s all-time backlog high of 5,964 aircraft was set in August 2018. The number of Airbus aircraft to be built and delivered represents 8.2 years of shipments at the 2019 production level (the pre-pandemic level), or 11.6 years based on the 2021 total. In comparison, Boeing’s backlog would “only” last 6.4 years at the 2018 level (the most recent “normal” year for Boeing), or 15.1 years based on 2021 deliveries. In 2021, Boeing’s book-to-bill ratio, calculated as net new orders divided by deliveries, is 1.41, ahead of Airbus’ book-to-bill ratio of 0.83. In 2020, Boeing’s book-to-bill ratio was negative, while Airbus reported a book-to-bill of 0.47.

2022 Forecast

Forecast International’s Platinum Forecast System is a breakthrough in forecasting technology that provides 15-year production forecasts. The author has used the Platinum Forecast System to retrieve the latest delivery forecast data from the Civil Aircraft Forecast product. For2022, Forecast International’s analysts currently expect Boeing and Airbus to deliver 483 and 694 commercial jets, respectively. Compared to the 2021 level, this is a 42.1 percent increase for Boeing and a 22.6 percent increase for Airbus.

On January 26, Boeing will report Q4 and full-year 2021 earnings and operating results, followed by Airbus on February 17. As most of the uncertainty in the marketplace appears to be subsiding, both companies can be expected to provide some form of guidance on planned 2022 deliveries.

New competition for Airbus and Boeing - DW (English),"Mon, 17 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmR3LmNvbS9lbi9haXJidXMtYW5kLWJvZWluZy1mYWNlLW5ldy1jb21wZXRpdGlvbi1mcm9tLWNoaW5hLWFuZC1ydXNzaWEvYS02MDQwNjcyONIBXWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmR3LmNvbS9lbi9haXJidXMtYW5kLWJvZWluZy1mYWNlLW5ldy1jb21wZXRpdGlvbi1mcm9tLWNoaW5hLWFuZC1ydXNzaWEvYS02MDQwNjcyOA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The duopoly of Western aircraft manufacturers Airbus and Boeing is under pressure. Russia's MC-21 airliner is now certified to fly and China is pushing ahead with plans to enter the international market.

They may not sound spectacular, but MC-21 and C919 are out to challenge Airbus and Boeing and their decades-old bestselling aircraft. Both the MC-21 and C919 are twin-engine narrow-body planes.

The Irkut MC-21 is from Russia, while the Comac C919 is built in China. Both have endured years of delays in their development and so far have not caused too much concern for the top dogs in the West. That may be about to change.

After several hiccups, the MC-21 was finally certified for passenger service in December 2021 and is due to fly scheduled services in Russia later this year. The Chinese had planned to deliver their first C919 to an airline customer at the same time, but this has been delayed, partly because of a lockdown at the test location in Xi'an. Now it is uncertain if it can enter service sometime this year.

Still, one thing is clear. New aircraft are entering the highly lucrative main segment of the airliner market. And Airbus and Boeing need to take it seriously. The MC-21, in particular, could offer superior performance in some areas, compared to the common types of Airbus and Boeing now being sold. And it is no wonder as the giants from America and Europe have been resting on their laurels for many decades: The Boeing 737 traces its origins back to 1967, while the Airbus A320 premiered in 1987.

Russia is not new to the game

Russia has had a civil aviation industry for a long time, which, however, has been a shadow of its former glory during Soviet times ever since communism faded.

Although almost all aviation industry sites in the huge country still exist, just 14 Russian airliners were built in all of 2020 — an amount that Airbus assembles across its different factories in days when everything is up and running. Some traditional Russian design offices such as Tupolev and Ilyushin haven't come up with any new airliner designs for the past 30 years.

Not surprisingly, it was a long and thorny process until the type certificate from the Russian aviation authority vouching for airworthiness was granted for the base model MC-21-300 on December 28, 2021. The first flight had already taken place on May 28, 2017, followed by a test program with four prototypes.

The standard version of the MC-21, aimed at 163 passengers in two classes, should be up to par in range and capacity according to estimates by Western industry experts.

""On paper, the MC-21 would deliver a better flight performance than the newest Airbus A320neo,"" Nico Buchholz told DW. And he should know since he was responsible for fleet procurement at Lufthansa Group for many years and familiar with the new aircraft concepts.

Experts like him deem it very likely that the MC-21 is more economical than its Western competitors. If that is really true in terms of efficiency, reliability and performance have yet to be demonstrated by actual flight operations, which are due to start this summer with Aeroflot subsidiary Rossiya.

The plane is also expected to excel in passenger comfort, which was traditionally never one of the strengths of Soviet, or later Russian, aircraft. The cabin is quite spacious. Not for nothing is the MC-21 touted to be ""the widest narrow-body in the world."" Its cabin diameter is 11 centimeters (4.3 inches) wider than the A320 and even offers 27 centimeters more width than the Boeing 737. It is wider, but not wide enough for the airlines to squeeze in more than the usual six seats per row. This means passengers will get more elbow room and a wider aisle.

Manufacturers dependent on Western suppliers

Yet the times don't favor Russian airliners, as they currently cannot be built without multiple Western components, mostly in the form of engines and composite materials. A whopping 40% of the MC-21 consists of such composite materials, a record in this airliner category. So far, the composites come from American and Japanese suppliers. On top of that, the MC-21-300 variant now certified is powered by modern American Pratt & Whitney PW1400G-geared turbofans.

But in the current political climate, Russia can't be certain it can continue to rely on these Western suppliers. At the same time, Moscow sees important markets in countries like Iran, where it would be barred from delivering aircraft containing Western parts.

The aircraft presented in Dubai, called MC-21-310, is not yet certified, as it is powered by new Russian turbofan Aviadvigatel PD-14 engines. On December 25, 2021, another prototype of the MC-21-300 had its first flight, this time equipped with new composite wings made in Russia with a patented vacuum infusion technique.

According to the manufacturer, there are currently 175 firm orders for the MC-21 plus ""several hundreds of memorandums of understanding,"" signaling the intention to buy. The domestic Russian market is a significant one.

""According to the forecast, in the next 20 years, in Russia alone, more than 800 new airliners of this size will be required,"" according to Yury Slyusar, general director of United Aircraft Corporation, the parent company of aircraft manufacturer Irkut. ""Having proven the effectiveness of the aircraft in the domestic market, we will enter the international market,"" he announced.

Chinese manufacturers willing to branch out

In contrast to Russia, China has not been in the civil aviation industry for a long time. Nonetheless, it is in the aviation fast lane. And like in Russia, domestic needs are a major aspect in building the Comac C919 for 156 to 168 passengers.

""The Chinese airliner market alone has a volume enabling them to sell greater numbers, independently of the Airbus and Boeing jets flying in the country,"" said Buchholz.

There is another advantage China has over Russia that could be decisive in turning the C919 into a success. To crank up aircraft assembly and build hundreds or even thousands of new planes to high quality standards will be a big challenge, Buchholz said.

""As the Chinese have more experience in the industrial manufacturing of higher numbers of aircraft than the Russians, they are more likely to become competitors of Airbus and Boeing,"" explained Lufthansa's former aircraft buyer. ""And Western manufacturers contributed to that, as they, like Airbus, established their own final assembly lines in China. There the quality was at times better than that of Airbus jets manufactured in Hamburg.""

But currently the Chinese lag behind in getting their new jet in the air, despite their first successful test flight on May 5, 2017. No less than six test aircraft are ready to perform the flight program necessary for certification. Still, by the end of last December, only 34 out of the necessary 276 test flights had been carried out.

Airbus revokes Qatar Airways A321 jet order amid dispute - The Associated Press,"Fri, 21 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2J1c2luZXNzLWR1YmFpLXVuaXRlZC1hcmFiLWVtaXJhdGVzLW1pZGRsZS1lYXN0LXFhdGFyLTgzY2YxNjgwNmVkMzljYzhiNTA0MzhlM2YwYzE3ODI00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — European planemaker Airbus terminated a multibillion dollar order by Qatar Airways for 50 of its single-aisle in-demand A321neo jets.

The termination of the contract for the A321neo, confirmed by the planemaker to The Associated Press on Friday, comes as Airbus and one of its biggest customers, Qatar Airways, are embroiled in a legal dispute over the grounding of the larger twin-aisle A350 plane.

In December, Qatar’s national carrier announced it was suing Airbus in London over what it described as the “accelerated surface degradation” of the wide-body A350. Qatar Airways said it had no choice but to ground a number of the jets, with 21 now out of operation.

The termination of the Airbus contract for its 321neos follows on the heels of Qatar Airways refusing to take any more A350s until the problem is fixed.

The state-owned airline will be relying on the long-haul A350 for the increased inflow of passengers to Qatar for the month-long FIFA 2022 World Cup, which will be played in the Arab Gulf state starting Nov. 21.

Qatar Airways has a fleet of 53 Airbus A350s in both its 1000 and 900 series. The airline has more on order with the France-based airplane manufacturer, making its total order of 76 A350s the most of any airline worldwide.

In a brief comment to the AP, Airbus confirmed that it did terminate a contract for 50 A321s ordered by Qatar Airways. The airline did not provide further details.

Qatar Airways did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the A321neo contract.

The cancellation of the order was first reported by Bloomberg.

In a public statement last year, Qatar Airways said it was left with no alternative but to seek a resolution through the courts to ensure that Airbus undertakes a thorough investigation of the full root cause of the degradation beneath the paint on the fuselage of the aircraft. Qatar Airways says otherwise it is not possible to establish whether any proposed repair solution will rectify the underlying condition.

Airbus had said it intends to vigorously defend its position as no other airline flying the A350 has grounded the aircraft due to safety concerns."
"Lockheed, Airbus Say They Would Build New Air Force Tankers in Alabama, Georgia - Defense One","Mon, 31 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VvbmUuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMjIvMDEvbG9ja2hlZWQtYWlyYnVzLXNheS10aGV5LXdvdWxkLWJ1aWxkLW5ldy1haXItZm9yY2UtdGFua2Vycy1hbGFiYW1hLWdlb3JnaWEvMzYxMzY3L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Lockheed Martin and Airbus will build military tankers in Alabama and Georgia if the U.S. Air Force choses its aircraft over one proposed by rival Boeing, the companies announced Monday.

Executives and politicians are scheduled to announce the decision during ceremonies in Mobile, Alabama, where Airbus currently builds commercial jetliners, and Marietta, Georgia, later today.

The companies plan to assemble the aircraft in Mobile before flying it to a Lockheed factory in Marietta, Georgia, where workers would install special military refueling and electronic equipment.

The work would create a total of 1,300 jobs in Mobile and Marietta, Larry Gallogly, Lockheed’s project head, said during a virtual press conference this morning. Airbus would need to expand its factory in Mobile to accommodate widebody production, but Lockheed would use existing hangers previously used to work on the mammoth C-5 cargo plane.

Lockheed and Airbus have branded the new tanker as the LMXT. It would be a new version of Airbus’ Multi Role Tanker Transport, or MRTT, an A330-based tanker built in France and Spain and flown by 14 international militaries.

The new version being pitched to the Air Force will carry more fuel and have new special communications equipment, but will use the same boom and refueling system currently used certified for U.S. aircraft, Gallogly said.

“It's important to us that this be built in America by Americans for Americans. So we're trying to source as much of the supply chain in the United States as we possibly can, recognizing and respecting that there's a very successful existing supply chain that supports the MRTT right now,” Gallogly said.

The Air Force plans to buy up to 160 new tankers over the next decade, reigniting a longtime battle between commercial aircraft makers Airbus and Boeing. Boeing has an Air Force contract to build up to 179 KC-46 tankers, which are converted 767 airliners. But the company has struggled with design and quality-control setbacks, leading to delays and $5.4 billion in losses.

Lockheed is the latest large defense company to try to put U.S. branding on the Airbus A330. Northrop Grumman partnered with the European aerospace and defense behemoth during a competition in the mid-2000s. The Air Force selected its bid, but the decision was overturned by government auditors. Airbus bid on its own during a recompete, but the Air Force chose Boeing’s KC-46. Boeing has said it will enter a bid in the new competition, but has not said what aircraft it will pitch."
Airbus' deploys Beluga A300-600 ST fleet to serve industry's outsized cargo transportation needs - Airbus,"Tue, 25 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIyLTAxLWFpcmJ1cy1kZXBsb3lzLWJlbHVnYS1hMzAwLTYwMC1zdC1mbGVldC10by1zZXJ2ZS1pbmR1c3RyeXMtb3V0c2l6ZWQtY2FyZ2_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has launched a new service to offer outsized freight transportation for customers worldwide. Key to bringing this to reality is the unique capability of its BelugaST ‘Super-Transporter’ aircraft, based on the A300-600 design. Today the five-strong aircraft fleet, which has hitherto been the backbone of Airbus’ inter-site transportation of large aircraft sections, is moving on from ‘in-house’ duties.



In their place Airbus is introducing six new-generation BelugaXLs – based on the larger A330-200 platform – to support Airbus’ ramp-up of its airliner production. For the BelugaSTs, this means that a new stage in their operational life can now begin in earnest – especially as the airframes still have plenty of available flight-hours remaining before reaching their original design service limits.



First mission: transporting an Airbus helicopter to Japan

The launch of the service took place during the last week of December 2021, when Beluga “No. 3” delivered a brand new helicopter from Airbus Helicopters’ manufacturing site in Marignane, France, halfway across the world to Kobe in Japan. Along the way, the Beluga stopped to refuel at various transit points – including Warsaw (in Poland), Novosibirsk (in Russia) and Seoul (in Korea). Notably, the whole helicopter could be accommodated inside the Beluga without any prior disassembly -- only needing its long rotor blades to be folded back.

New service dedicated for “outsized freight” customers

Over the years the Beluga fleet has occasionally been called upon over the years to transport outsized cargo (such as industrial machinery, complete space satellites etc.) ie. unrelated to its normal day-to-day job of transporting Airbus aircraft sections. With the new service, these five Belugas will be dedicated solely to transporting such cargo for commercially contracted customers. Typical industry sectors which would be served include: engine manufacturers; space industries; helicopter manufacturers; oil & gas and energy providers; machinery manufacturers; land vehicles and other military equipment; humanitarian supply distributors etc., to name a few.

Largest cross-section to open new markets

The Beluga benefits all possible market applications, since it possesses the world's largest interior cross-section of any transport aircraft, accommodating outsized cargo of up to 7.1m in width by 6.7m in height.

Phillippe Sabo, Head of ATI Air Oversize Transport at Airbus, notes: “The Beluga’s wider cross section will open up new markets and new logistical possibilities – which would not be feasible with other current airborne transport means. For example, customers could consider in their future manufacturing process to make larger parts to be transported whole without prior disassembly.” He adds: In the case of transporting helicopters, not having to dismantle them first really is a plus.”

Clement Beaunis, Project Leader of Airbus Beluga Transport, says: “The large dimensions accommodated are also attractive for satellite manufacturers for example, as they would like to design bigger ones in the future. In contrast, today they are constrained in size by the available transport means. The Beluga will relieve that constraint.”

Another ‘use-case’ is if an airline is facing an AOG situation due to an on-wing engine issue. Sabo explains: “The Beluga can bring a full engine-change kit directly to the airport allowing the AOG team to change the engine in a few hours. This is possible because the Beluga can transport the engine and inlet in a fully dressed configuration. Whereas with other air transport means the engine would first need to be partially dismantled, and would subsequently need around two days to reassemble and re-test.”

Dedicated airline to be created for worldwide operations

For the initial Beluga missions -- such as this first one to Japan -- Airbus’ in-house ‘airline’ Air Transport International (ATI) is using its own aircrew. However, in the near future, once Airbus has commissioned all six new BelugaXLs, the fully released BelugaST fleet will be handed over to a newly created dedicated subsidiary airline with its own Air Operator Certificate (AOC) and staff.

Sabo points out: “Whereas the ATI structure is inherently focused around the European network of Airbus’ plants, the new airline which we will create will be flexible and agile to address the needs of external markets. Moreover, it will have a worldwide scope and we will be organised for that around the globe.”

In addition, to better meet the demands of a truly international operation, the Belugas will be upgraded with a new generation Flight Management System (FMS) with ADS-B for enhanced intercontinental navigational capabilities.



New loading innovations for quick reactivity and short turnaround

To maximise the BelugaST’s reactivity and short turnaround capability required by its targeted international customer base, new loading techniques and equipment are being developed for the operation. To this end, an automated on-board cargo loader (OBCL) will enable missions from/to airports which do not have available any suitable loading/unloading platform, and for payloads weighing up to 20t. This OBCL – available from 2022 – will be transportable inside the aircraft (stored in front of the internal payload hold area) and be able to load and unload the payload autonomously.

To complement the OBCL, and for the heaviest and longest cargo, a new redesigned transportable Outboard Platform (OP) is also under development. These OPs (at least six to start with) will be strategically pre-positioned at various airports around the world and be easily transportable prior to a mission at short notice.

The third loading innovation is the new Multi-Purpose-Pallet (MPP) recently developed and produced by Airbus at its sites in St Eloi and Nantes. Compatible with a range of payloads, the MPP, when it is already carrying the cargo, is raised by around five metres above the apron level and loaded through the Beluga’s nose opening using either the OBCL or OB described above. The MPP’s underside subsequently interfaces securely to the Beluga’s load-bearing floor attachment points. Notably, this inaugural mission to Kobe is another ‘first’ in that it marks the very first time that the MPP has been used for an operational mission -- following its recently-completed successful development-testing stage."

The Next Space era - Airbus,"Thu, 20 Jan 2022 13:43:33 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiI2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vTmV4dFNwYWNl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Space industry is changing. But that’s nothing new. Space has been pushing back the realms of the possible for decades and that’s what makes it so exciting.

The industry today takes many forms. Original pioneers who have innovation coursing through their veins. Newer players taking centre stage with impressive technology and far-flung ambitions. Start-ups developing niche technologies. A supply chain focused on components that cannot fail over years, if not decades, in orbit. All approach this in their own unique ways and all have something unique to offer.

Space Matters Airbus has always been at the forefront, a creator and a visionary, playing an essential role in the space adventure from the very beginning. This pioneering spirit remains at our heart today to ensure we continue to produce the very best services and technologies that connect, protect, inform, explore and direct down here on Earth. And increasingly, we do this together with valued partners.

01 / 05 arrow_back arrow_forward arrow_back 01 / 05 arrow_forward

In this together In days gone by, Space was reserved for a select few players and they achieved some amazing things, from landing on the Moon, Mars or even a comet flying at a mind boggling 37 kilometres per second to delivering the first views of Earth from space that we take for granted today. But as space is increasingly needed in our daily lives – from helping us find our way to meet friends, to checking the weather before a weekend away, more sustainable agriculture and, thankfully less often, to support in times of crisis – we need more companies able to bring the benefits of space down to Earth. This is why Airbus partners with hundreds of start-ups such as in our digital platforms where we make millions of images readily available so that collectively we can deliver insights from space. It’s also why we worked hard to revolutionise small satellite manufacturing enabling us to drastically reduce costs and work with new players like Loft Orbital whose ambition is to make our platform the “workhorse of their business model”. While in space exploration, we are sharing our knowledge of landing technologies with Astrobotic to provide the legs for their lunar lander. Airbus also believes in the value of co-creation which is why we play an active role in the ActInSpace hackathons. ActInSpace aims to develop innovations based on space technologies that serve life on Earth. It has already led to creation of over 35 companies around the world, with over 10,000 participants over four events. In the same spirit, we work closely with incubators and accelerators like SpaceFounders and the Starburst aerospace accelerator.

“Forget ‘New’ vs. ‘old’ space, Airbus is committed to doing the best space possible for the benefit of humanity and dares to be different when needed. That’s Next Space.”

Striving for sustainable space – together Importantly, we do all this with sustainability at the forefront. At Airbus we believe we need to learn from what humanity has done to the oceans, and not repeat this in space. There are currently around 5000 active satellites in orbit. This figure is set to increase exponentially. This is why we are working with players across the international community to push for responsible and sustainable use of space – as with aircraft, we need to manage space traffic, as well as the debris that’s in space. As a satellite operator we have significant processes and procedures to monitor and manage the immediate space around our satellites to avoid any other satellites or debris getting close. Our teams monitor this daily and take appropriate action as needed.

On a technical level, we have tested three technologies in orbit to clear out space junk and avoid spacecraft collisions. We also abide by space law and industry best practices with safe removal of spacecraft at the end of their operational life. Up in space, an example of this is the recent deorbiting of the MetOp A weather satellite - it had delivered vital data for over 15 years but weighing in at 4.1 tonnes it would have been a big mass of junk to leave in orbit and hence it was safely deorbited at the end of its life last year. There is still a huge amount of work to be done – and it’s a topic which must be tackled at an international scale – but if space becomes unusable, what next? We will all suffer. At Airbus it isn’t a space race, it’s a human race to advance the future of humanity. It’s about seeing how far we can all go, not just how far any one individual, organisation or even country can go.

Industry first: Loft Orbital signs agreement with Airbus to procure more than fifteen Arrow satellite platforms - Airbus,"Fri, 14 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMi0wMS1pbmR1c3RyeS1maXJzdC1sb2Z0LW9yYml0YWwtc2lnbnMtYWdyZWVtZW50LXdpdGgtYWlyYnVzLXRvLXByb2N1cmXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Toulouse, 14 January 2022 – Airbus has been contracted to supply space start-up Loft Orbital with more than fifteen satellite platforms derived from the Airbus Arrow platform. Arrow is the foundational satellite platform of the OneWeb constellation. There are 394 Airbus Arrow platforms in orbit for the OneWeb constellation and a further 254 are being produced to complete the 648 spacecraft required by OneWeb. With this acquisition, Loft Orbital confirms its intention to make the Airbus Arrow platform a true workhorse enabling its service business model.

Loft Orbital offers a true end-to-end service enabling customers to rapidly deploy and operate their payloads on reliable high-performance satellites at an unprecedented simplicity and affordability. Loft Orbital has also contracted Airbus to modify the Arrow platform to make it suitable for a wider range of longer lifetime missions and applications. Loft Orbital has offices both in the USA and France, being based in the heart of Silicon Valley in San Francisco, and in the European space capital Toulouse, and intends to continue rapidly growing its French presence following this contract relationship with Airbus.

Airbus previously benefitted from public support to develop the Arrow platform and OneWeb pilot line in Toulouse.

Bruno Le Maire, French minister for the Economy, Finances and the Recovery, said: “This groundbreaking contract between start up Loft Orbital and global space leader Airbus is a very good news. It demonstrates the uptake of New Space companies in France and the synergy across the space ecosystem for developing industry wide innovation. It also testifies the speed at which the French space ecosystem is growing, with start-ups, SMEs, and large groups working together to provide world-class solutions, and fully validates the ongoing government strategy and initiatives to develop a vibrant and growing next space innovation ecosystem. I am very pleased that the project presented by Loft with the support of Airbus relies on French suppliers, more than 60% of the value being created in France.”

Jean-Marc Nasr, Head of Airbus Space Systems said: “This sale of our small LEO platform Arrow to Loft Orbital is a ringing endorsement of our strategy to develop mass manufacturing for the next space era. Our reliable platform is already proving its worth in orbit for OneWeb who have more than 60% of their fleet in orbit. We look forward to working with Loft Orbital to provide them with the best space technology possible – combining industrially-proven know-how with disruptive innovations – to serve their customers.”

Pierre-Damien Vaujour, CEO of Loft Orbital said: “We are beyond excited about this procurement agreement with Airbus that is an industry first. Leveraging Airbus engineering experience and Airbus OneWeb Satellites production capabilities is enabling us to truly bring Loft's vision to life. While we are using this initial procurement to deliver to our customers who have ordered services based on a few tens of satellites, we see this as an opportunity to offer much larger constellation services to governments and companies worldwide. In addition, the level of support we have received in France, and the quality of the engineering talent, is simply unmatched and we are looking forward to growing the company here in Toulouse.”

The improvements to the Arrow platform, including all the engineering, qualification, test, and production of the first few spacecraft will be performed by Airbus in Toulouse. The production at scale of the remaining Arrow-derived platforms will be performed by Airbus OneWeb Satellites (AOS).

Airbus Space’s strategy of Next Space will seek further engagement with new players in the space ecosystem to ensure that sustainability and reliability in the LEO space environment is guaranteed for the future.

Airbus' iconic Beluga super transporters ready to serve global outsized-cargo demand - Airbus,"Tue, 25 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMi0wMS1haXJidXMtaWNvbmljLWJlbHVnYS1zdXBlci10cmFuc3BvcnRlcnMtcmVhZHktdG8tc2VydmUtZ2xvYmFs0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Toulouse, 25 January 2022 – Airbus has launched a new air-cargo service using its unique BelugaST fleet to offer freight companies and other potential customers a solution to their outsized freight transportation needs.

The new service - Airbus Beluga Transport - will provide commercially-contracted customers in a variety of sectors, including space, energy, military, aeronautic, maritime and humanitarian sectors, with a solution to their large cargo transport needs.

The first mission took place at the end of 2021 with a delivery from Airbus Helicopters’ manufacturing site in Marignane, France, to Kobe in Japan for an undisclosed customer. Beluga #3 stopped to refuel at Warsaw (Poland), Novosibirsk (Russia) and Seoul (Korea).

Phillippe Sabo, Head of ATI and Air Oversize Transport at Airbus, said: “The Beluga’s wider cross-section will open up new markets and new logistical possibilities for customers. In the case of loading helicopters - not having to dismantle them first - really is a plus. Similarly, the largest commercial aircraft engines can be accommodated in a fully-dressed configuration.”

Based on the A300-600 design, the five-strong BelugaST fleet, which has until now been the backbone of Airbus’ inter-site transportation of large aircraft sections, are being replaced by six new-generation BelugaXLs to support Airbus’ ramp-up of its airliner production.

The new Airbus Beluga Transport service can cater for a multitude of possible market applications since the planes possess the world's largest interior cross-section of any transport aircraft, accommodating outsized cargo of up to 7.1m in width and 6.7m in height.

In the near future, once Airbus has commissioned all six new BelugaXLs, the fully-released BelugaST fleet will be handed over to a newly-created, subsidiary airline with its own Air Operator Certificate (AOC) and staff. Philippe Sabo added: “The new airline will be flexible and agile to address the needs of external worldwide markets.”

To maximise the BelugaST’s turnaround capability for its targeted international customer base, new loading techniques and equipment are being developed for the operation. These solutions include an automated On-Board Cargo Loader (OBCL) for missions where a loading/unloading platform is not available at the origin or destination airport.

How Air Race E is inspiring technologies in electric aviation - Airbus,"Mon, 31 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDIyLTAxLWhvdy1haXItcmFjZS1lLWlzLWluc3BpcmluZy10ZWNobm9sb2dpZXMtaW4tZWxlY3RyaWMtYXZpYXRpb27SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"An Air Race E aircraft has carried out the first-ever flight by an all-electric race plane. As the competition’s founding partner, Airbus is playing an important role in developing a platform to create cleaner and more efficient electric air vehicles.

As Rein Inge Hoff eases back on the control stick, the modified Cassutt IIIM rises almost silently into the air above Tønsberg Airport in southern Norway. It’s a historic moment: Hoff is the first pilot to fly an all-electric race plane. For 15 minutes, he puts the Nordic Air Racing machine through its paces, reaching a full-power cruise of 180 knots (333 km/h), before landing safely.

It is also an important breakthrough for electric aviation. Eventually, the aircraft will hit speeds of more than 400 km/h just metres above the ground as the world’s top pilots take part in the Air Race E series, which starts in 2023.

The world’s first all-electric airplane competition, Air Race E is much more than just a thrilling spectacle, though. As an official founding partner, Airbus is providing the 17 teams with research data and industry expertise to help collectively drive the development of cleaner, faster and more technologically advanced electric engines. Some of the insights gained from the competition and more especially the lessons learned from making fly propulsive electrical systems will be key assets for Airbus solutions (from urban air mobility to, eventually, commercial aircraft).

“More than ever, when we look at the concept of sustainable mobility, the challenges push us to work differently, to be disruptive and to use the learnings and achievements from a mix of sectors. In this case, flying aircraft using tried and tested electric technologies from the automotive industry is proof of that and is an approach we fully support as part of our electrification journey.”

Karim Mokaddem, Airbus Electrification Fast Track Leader

Paving the way for electric innovation

As a global aerospace pioneer, Airbus is committed to developing, building and testing alternative-propulsion systems to reduce the CO2 emissions of aircraft, helicopters, satellites and future UAM vehicles.

Aerospace is not alone in this journey, of course: alternative propulsion is the main challenge for all transport sectors, and electric and hybrid-electric technologies are already revolutionising mobility on the ground. Aviation may face different challenges, but the industry can learn from the experiences of the automotive sector.

“More than ever, when we look at the concept of sustainable mobility, the challenges push us to work differently, to be disruptive and to use the learnings and achievements from a mix of sectors,” says Karim Mokaddem, Airbus Electrification Fast Track Leader. “In this case, flying aircraft using tried and tested electric technologies from the automotive industry is proof of that and is an approach we fully support as part of our electrification journey.”

Just as electric motorsport is pushing disruptive innovation in ground vehicles, Air Race E is expected to soon bring similar benefits to aviation.

There are many synergies between Air Race E flight testbeds and Airbus programmes like electric vertical take-off and landing vehicles (eVTOLs) and micro-hybridisation projects, which aim to power a growing number of on-board systems via batteries.

Mokaddem says some of the best practices from Air Race E aircraft, lessons learned from the competition challenges, such as battery integration, system engineering and techno-bricks performance and finally safety could serve Airbus solutions. They are also helping to pave the way on standards and regulations around key electrification technologies like embarked batteries. In addition, making fly technologies coming from the automotive market like motors, batteries, converters is an approach that we fully support to improve the way we could cross fertilize ideas, technologies, roadmaps from different markets and accelerate towards our ambition to pioneer the aerospace decarbonisation. Air Race E is for us the best flying testbed to reach this objective and assess the first potential.



Green light for sustainable aviation

While Nordic Air Racing may have claimed the honour of the first-ever electric race plane flight, all 17 teams will now spend the coming weeks and months rigorously testing their aircraft on the ground and in the air.

Air Race E’s first race is scheduled to take place in 2023. It will mark the official start of a mainstream platform that can accelerate innovation in electric propulsion.

As Air Race E CEO Jeff Zaltman says, “The world is depending on Airbus and partnerships like ours to guide the aerospace industry onto a sustainable path for generations to come.”"
Airbus Helicopters bounces back in 2021 - Airbus,"Wed, 26 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMi0wMS1haXJidXMtaGVsaWNvcHRlcnMtYm91bmNlcy1iYWNrLWluLTIwMjHSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Marignane, 26 January 2022 – In 2021, Airbus Helicopters logged 419 gross orders (net: 414) showing solid signs of recovery from the 2020 market situation which was heavily impacted by the economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. (2020 – 289 gross/ 268 net orders). The increase in orders for light helicopters, H125 and H130, reflects the recovery of the civil and parapublic market. The Company saw strong momentum from its home countries, with France ordering 40 H160s (civil and military versions), eight H225Ms, and two H145s, Spain ordering 36 H135s, and Germany procuring eight H145s for the Bavarian police force. Deliveries increased from 300 in 2020 to 338 in 2021, contributing to Airbus Helicopters’ preliminary 52 % share of the civil and parapublic market and confirming its position as market leader. In number of aircraft units, Airbus Helicopters recorded a net book to bill ratio above one.



“2021 was a year of major commitments for Airbus Helicopters. We committed to developing new products and services that fulfil our customers’ requirements such as launching the development of an innovative H160M for the French armed forces’ joint light helicopter programme and creating the new service package HCare Classics for customers that operate our legacy helicopters. We also delivered the first ever H160 to Japanese operator All Nippon Helicopter. It is our duty to innovate and to pioneer sustainable aerospace and to that end we have begun implementing the use of sustainable aviation fuel and pursued our urban air mobility journey with the unveiling of CityAirbus NextGen,” said Bruno Even, Airbus Helicopters CEO. “I’m proud of our teams that have worked hard to deliver all of these achievements. Their commitment to our Airbus values of teamwork, reliability, and integrity will enable us to continue working on securing the supply chain and to deliver on our continuous improvements to ease the operations of our customers. I especially value the trust that our customers place in our people, our products, and our services to help them perform their essential missions every day.”



The Company ramped up its five-bladed H145 deliveries in 2021 as well as delivered the first five-bladed H145 retrofit to DRF Luftrettung, a German helicopter emergency medical services operator, at the end of May. Other key deliveries the first H225M for Singapore in March as well as the first H225M in a naval combat configuration for Brazilian Navy, and the first NH90 TTH for Qatar which was delivered ahead of schedule. In North America, the US Army took delivery of the first UH-72B from the Airbus Helicopters factory in Columbus, Mississippi and the Lakota fleet reached the major milestone of one million flight hours.



Order highlights for 2021 consist of 93 H145s and 52 H160s including the first batch of H160Ms for the French armed forces as well as 10 H160s for the Gendarmerie Nationale – the first law enforcement customer for the model. Airbus Helicopters also expanded its partnership with The Helicopter Company in Saudi Arabia, which added 20 H145s and 6 ACH160s to their growing fleet of Airbus helicopters. The H225 saw 2021 kicking off to a good start with its long-standing customer, the Japan Coast Guard, ordering an additional two helicopters to its fleet in March.

Airbus Helicopters’ suite of HCare offerings continue to convince customers of their value add with new and returning customers such as Air Methods who signed an additional contract in February to cover 80 EC135s. The Company expanded its range in 2021 with HCare Classics, a custom-made set of services for its legacy fleet of approximately 2,000 in-service H120, Dauphin, Puma and Gazelle helicopters. HDataPower is an example of Airbus Helicopters’ ongoing commitment to digitalisation and harnessing the benefits (time savings, higher fleet availability, optimised costs) that it can proffer to customers with Helionix-equipped aircraft by leveraging data generated by helicopter systems.



2021 was an essential and exciting year for innovation and product improvement at Airbus Helicopters. The H125 performance increase received both its EASA and FAA certification enabling operators to take full advantage of the 10% power increase provided by the Arriel 2D engines. The Company also added the H175M to its military product portfolio. The VSR700, Airbus’ unmanned aerial system, began its flight envelope expansion ahead of sea trials later this year.



2021 was especially instrumental to the Company’s decarbonisation roadmap. The helicopter Flightlab started flight testing new technologies, including the engine back-up system which not only aims to deliver safety improvements but is also a fundamental first step on the road to hybridisation. Airbus Helicopters also launched a SAF User Group dedicated to the rotary- wing community in an effort to accelerate the deployment of biofuels, began using sustainable aviation fuel for its training and flight tests at it main sites in France and Germany, and ended the year by flying an H225 with one engine powered by 100% SAF.

Airbus to develop the Power Management and Distribution System for key Lunar Gateway module - Airbus,"Tue, 11 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMi0wMS1haXJidXMtdG8tZGV2ZWxvcC10aGUtcG93ZXItbWFuYWdlbWVudC1hbmQtZGlzdHJpYnV0aW9uLXN5c3RlbS1mb3LSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Madrid, 11 January 2022 - Airbus Crisa, an affiliate company of Airbus, has signed a contract for the development of the Power Management and Distribution (PMAD) system for the Habitation and Logistics Outpost (HALO) with Northrop Grumman.

Airbus Crisa is a Spanish company founded in 1985 to design and manufacture electronic equipment and software for space applications, and engineering projects for ground stations. It is fully integrated into Airbus Defence and Space.

The new Lunar Gateway station, scheduled for launch in 2024, will initially have two modules and will be expanded in successive years to five modules. The station is intended to serve as a space laboratory as well as an intermediate logistics post for future trips to the surface of the Moon and on to Mars. The two initial modules are known as PPE and HALO. PPE (Power and Propulsion Element) has solar arrays that power the station and thrusters that allow it to maintain a stable orbit around the Moon. HALO is the Habitation and Logistics Outpost module where the astronauts will live during the estimated 40 days of the first missions.

""This contract worth more than $50 million reflects our ability to deliver highly specialised space equipment to global manufacturers and is our first contribution to the Moon-orbiting Gateway, which is part of NASA’s Artemis programme to return to the Moon,"" said Fernando Gómez-Carpintero, CEO of Airbus Crisa. “This is an exciting step as Airbus Crisa is designing the PMAD to become the standard modular power management system for all future space stations and human vehicles. We have provided a disruptive solution, with an architectural concept never before seen in the sector. This lays the foundations for a new international standard, placing the company at the forefront of the sector.”

The PMAD has four power units and will manage the electricity from the solar panels of the Power and Propulsion Element (PPE). It will distribute the power to onboard equipment and the rest of the station as required, always ensuring the safety of the crew on board. The PMAD will power the life support system, the interior lighting, the communications systems and the scientific experiments. It will ensure that HALO's battery remains at optimal levels and is ready for use when the panels do not receive sufficient sunlight. PMAD must also provide power to visiting vehicles when they dock.

Airbus Crisa is a key international player in the fields of power conversion digital control and energy management and distribution for satellite and launcher applications thanks to the experience gained in the challenging ESA exploration missions. This contract demonstrates its great potential to provide reliable flight products to US manufacturers.

What’s behind legal dispute between Qatar Airways and Airbus? - Al Jazeera English,"Sun, 23 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIyLzEvMjMvd2hhdHMtYmVoaW5kLWxlZ2FsLWRpc3B1dGUtYmV0d2Vlbi1xYXRhci1haXJ3YXlzLWFuZC1haXJidXPSAWhodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbGphemVlcmEuY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzLzIwMjIvMS8yMy93aGF0cy1iZWhpbmQtbGVnYWwtZGlzcHV0ZS1iZXR3ZWVuLXFhdGFyLWFpcndheXMtYW5kLWFpcmJ1cw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Qatar Airways is seeking compensation of $618m plus $4m a day after grounding 21 A350s over safety concerns.

Qatar Airways has been locked for months in a legal dispute with Europe’s Airbus manufacturer over “serious and legitimate safety concerns” after a delivery of A350 jets.

Qatar’s state-owned airline is seeking compensation, saying the flawed planes forced it to ground 21 of its fleet of 53 Airbus A350s in both its 1000 and 900 series.

Here are some key facts:

How did the dispute begin?

Qatar’s national carrier raised concerns over the state of its A350s in November 2020 when an attempt to repaint a five-year-old jet in World Cup livery exposed about 980 defects.

According to a Reuters news agency investigation, at least five other airlines, including Finnair, Cathay Pacific, Etihad, Lufthansa and Air France, raised concerns in 2016 – well before Qatar Airways – but they did not ground their aircraft.

France-based Airbus acknowledged that the flaws needed attention while insisting they were cosmetic issues and did not put safety at risk.

Qatar Airways said Airbus failed to provide a full root-cause analysis needed to satisfy unresolved questions over the airworthiness of the affected jets, including the lightning protection system.

On December 20 last year, Qatar Airways sued Airbus in the UK. The case is due for a hearing in late April.

What are the issues?

The airline’s complaint says the paint on the recently delivered Airbus A350s was cracking and peeling, exposing copper meshing used to insulate the aircraft against lightning strikes.

It published a video on social media on Friday of the scarred exterior of grounded A350 jets.

The clip showed areas of peeling or missing paint, cracks and damage to anti-lightning protection, as well as what the airline described as patches of carbon fibre that were exposed to moisture and potentially damaging ultraviolet light.

The lightweight carbon-fibre jetliner relies on metallic foil embedded beneath the paint to help lightning wash safely over the fuselage, which is less conductive than earlier metal.

The video showed flakes of the copper-mesh anti-lightning system, which is supposed to be fixed to the plane with resin, coming loose when the paint was teased away by a gloved hand.

What is the airline demanding?

Qatar Airways is pressing for compensation of $618m plus $4m a day and has stopped the receipt of 23 more A350s.

Its legal case detailed how the Qatar Civil Aviation Authority (QCAA) had started withdrawing flying permits for individual A350 planes in a series of letters from June 2021.

It said the QCAA told Airbus the aeroplane’s deterioration was “disturbing, if not alarming”.

Airbus has said it will fight the claim, saying there is “no reasonable or rational basis” for the groundings, which have not happened elsewhere.

What is Airbus’s stance?

Airbus says that it is looking at changing the design of the anti-lightning mesh for future A350s, but insists there is adequate backup lightning protection. It says Qatar Airways is undermining global protocols by seeking leverage over safety.

Airbus says it has provided the relevant information and concluded there is no airworthiness risk, a view echoed by Europe’s air regulator.

On Friday, Airbus cancelled a $6bn contract with Qatar Airways for 50 of its new A321neo passenger jets, escalating the legal battle."

The Airbus C295 technology demonstrator of Clean Sky 2 makes its maiden flight - Airbus,"Wed, 26 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMi0wMS10aGUtYWlyYnVzLWMyOTUtdGVjaG5vbG9neS1kZW1vbnN0cmF0b3Itb2YtY2xlYW4tc2t5LTItbWFrZXMtaXRz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Seville, 26 January 2022 – The Airbus C295 Flight Test Bed 2 (FTB2) has successfully performed its maiden flight from the Final Assembly Line in Seville. The aircraft now starts a flight campaign with the aim of testing the new semi-morphing wing, the new affordable flight control system, as well as a SatCom antenna embedded within the aircraft’s fuselage.

“The first flight of the C295 FTB2 is a key milestone that represents an important step forward in the programme, following the successful integration of the new aero structures, power-on and ground tests. A few years ago this programme was just a dream of a more sustainable future for aviation. Today we are at the final stage and we finally made it fly” said Francisco Javier Sánchez Segura, Executive Vice President Engineering Airbus Defence and Space.

Based on the Airbus C295, the Flight Test Bed 2 is an in-flight demonstrator of the European Clean Sky 2 (CS2) and the EU Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme, where technologies related to CS2’s future regional multimission aircraft are tested.

The modifications include new materials and technologies designed to achieve noise, CO2 and NOx emissions reduction. With these technologies applied in a future regional multimission configuration, up to 43% CO2 and 70% NOx reductions can be achieved in a typical Search and Rescue mission of 400 nautical miles, as well as 45% less noise during take-off.

The main modifications in the aircraft are a new high-efficiency semi-morphing wing, new dynamic winglets and a flat panel SATCOM antenna integrated within the top of the fuselage. In addition, innovative flight controls for primary control surfaces, including ailerons, flaps and flap tabs with improved aerodynamics, are capable of adjusting in-flight and contribute to a more efficient high lift system.

The new flight control system leverages digital control systems to optimise the aerodynamic shape of the wing in flight, while a new multifunctional flap has been completely redesigned and includes flap tabs in the trailing edge controlled by electro-mechanical actuators.

But the advantages also extend into the manufacturing process, not least with the use of advanced materials and manufacturing ranging from the use of Scalmalloy and additive manufacturing, to a new assembly method for the aero structures of the wing. A one shot assembly approach has been used for the new composite winglet and winglet tab, moving from the conventional ribs approach to a multi-spar integrated torsion box. Finally, jig-less methods have been used for the assembly of flaps and ailerons.

As a result, the C295 FTB2 brings improvements not only to the purely operational aspects of the aircraft, but helps introduce new improvement to the design and manufacturing process.

Airbus Helicopters opens new MRO Logistics Centre in Paris - Airbus,"Tue, 25 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMi0wMS1haXJidXMtaGVsaWNvcHRlcnMtb3BlbnMtbmV3LW1yby1sb2dpc3RpY3MtY2VudHJlLWluLXBhcmlz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Tremblay-en-France, 25 January 2022 – The Airbus Helicopters MRO Logistics Centre has begun operations in the AeroliansParis business park in Tremblay-en-France near Roissy Charles de Gaulle airport. The 13,400 m2 building, developed by BARJANE, was conceived to house all logistics activities related to helicopter component repair, including the receipt, screening, control, storage and distribution of MRO parts, at one site close to Europe’s cargo hub in Paris.

The site’s proximity to Paris Charles de Gaulle airport and to the resources of aeronautical repair companies in the vicinity allows Airbus Helicopters and its logistics partner, Daher, to further improve services to the international customer base.

“The completion of this state-of-the-art MRO logistics facility supports our long-term ambition to put all our MRO logistics references under one roof, to optimise our flows, and to deliver a level of reactivity in line with customers’ expectations,” says Christoph Zammert, Executive Vice President of Customer Support & Service at Airbus Helicopters.

The Airbus Helicopters MRO Logistics Centre is poised to streamline service, ensuring the minimum aircraft downtime for customers and more time in the air performing their essential missions. The site consists of 12,400 m2 of logistics space and 1,000 m2 of office space, and can stock 30,000 units. It will be staffed by 200 employees from Airbus and Daher who will manage a volume of 200,000 incoming and outgoing flows annually.

The building was constructed in accordance with the BARJANE Green Building Charter, which aims to prevent pollution during the construction phase; more than 85% of the site's construction waste was recycled. In an effort to reduce water consumption, the site uses water-saving appliances and rainwater recovery tanks. Thanks to large window facades and the decompartmentalization of spaces with interior glass surfaces, the building maximizes natural light to create a comfortable working environment for employees.

The collaboration between Airbus Helicopters, BARJANE and Daher dates to 2011 with the building of a 46,500 m2 industrial logistics facility on the Technoparc des Florides site in southern France, which has since become a reference for support and services platforms. This new building is set to become a similar example of excellence in aeronautical logistics MRO support activities.

Airbus Factory in the South Paved the Way for Lockheed’s Tanker Proposal - Global Atlanta,"Mon, 31 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb2JhbGF0bGFudGEuY29tL2FpcmJ1cy1mYWN0b3J5LWluLXRoZS1zb3V0aC1wYXZlZC10aGUtd2F5LWZvci1sb2NraGVlZHMtdGFua2VyLXByb3Bvc2FsL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Lockheed Martin is pitching a partnership with a European company to make U.S. government’s next refueling tanker aircraft in the South, with the military outfitting potentially creating 1,000 jobs in Georgia.

While its LMXT proposal plays up its “American-made” bona fides, it’s hard to ignore that the defense contractor, which makes C-130s and F-35 wings at a massive Marietta plant, is teaming up with Airbus, a company that until last year found itself in the crosshairs of U.S. trade officials.

Based in France, with significant stakes owned by France, Germany and Spain, Airbus is the arch rival of U.S.-based Boeing, which beat out the company for a 179-plane tanker that Airbus initially won in 2008, before the contract was bid out again in part due to political pressure.

The current Lockheed proposal builds on Airbus’s efforts to assuage trade concerns by building a factory in Mobile, Ala., in 2015, illustrating that it doesn’t take an American company to produce American-made jets.

The $600 million Mobile plant, which now employs 1,000 people, makes the A320 and A220 single-aisle jets. (Atlanta’s own Delta Air Lines served as a launch customer for the U.S.-built A220s, introduced with 109 total seats in 2018.)

The Lockheed-Airbus proposal would see Airbus add a production line to make a commercial version of the wide-body A330 at the Mobile plant. It would then be flown to Lockheed-Martin’s sprawling Marietta campus for conversions enabling it to fuel smaller fighter, transport and maritime patrol planes mid-flight. (Lockheed says Airbus would continue to make the A330 commercial jets at its home base in France as well.)

The collaboration would leverage the existing Airbus A330 Multi Role Tanker Transport platform, a “combat-proven” design used by 14 nations that promises “established allied interoperability and [a] resilient global supply chain,” according to Lockheed Martin. As the main contractor for the Defense Department, Lockheed Martin would be in charge of outfitting the planes with the system and U.S. Air Force-only capabilities.

Lockheed played up its investment in both Georgia and Alabama, states with a proven track record of aerospace excellence. The company employs more than 2,600 people on rotorwing and hypersonic capabilities in northern Alabama, including a plant focused on the latter at Courtland, Ala., last October. More than 5,000 Georgians work for Lockheed Martin, including 4,500 focused on the Hercules C-130J transport planes and the F-35 Lighting II center wings at the Marietta plant. Total economic impact across the two states is $8.3 billion including payroll, taxes, supplier sales, donations and other downstream effects. For its part, Airbus has contributed a $1.2 billion in impact in Alabama since it opened in 2015, with responsibility for more than 15,000 jobs just considering construction and payroll, Lockheed said in a release.

“Establishing this production work in Alabama and Georgia confirms Lockheed Martin’s commitment that the LMXT will be built in America, by Americans, for Americans,” said Lockheed Martin Chairman, President and CEO James Taiclet. “The LMXT will strengthen global security by enabling our U.S. service members to carry out their most critical missions at extended ranges. At home, the LMXT will strengthen job growth and manufacturing by drawing on the experience and talents of a high-tech American workforce in two states that are proven leaders in aviation.”

Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp visited the Lockheed Martin factory again for the announcement Monday, less than six months after he used it as a backdrop to tout a tax incentive aimed at enabling “high-impact aerospace projects.”

Though the legislation doesn’t mention the company, it’s clearly tailor-made for the aerospace and defense giant. To qualify for a 6 percent state tax credit on top of Georgia’s existing jobs tax incentives, a project must commit $500 million in capital and commit to creating 1,800 jobs. It’s unclear if two separate projects in short succession would count. Lockheed is bidding on multiple defense projects, including some through its classified Skunk Works innovation center at the Marietta plant. During an event last August, Lockheed executives pointed to projects worth 3,000 jobs and $1.6 billion, if they were to win outstanding government contracts.

Lockheed’s partnership with Airbus, initiated via a 2018 memorandum of agreement to jointly develop tanker capabilities, is similarly up in the air, as it is contingent on an award by the U.S. Air Force that would likely see deliveries start in 2024-25.

Lockheed Martin and Airbus plan to compete for a new contract from the Air Force for aerial refueling tankers as part of a competition set to begin later this year.

If they win the Air Force KC-Y tanker competition, Mobile would see a third final assembly line for the A330, resulting in a $450 million investment and 400 direct jobs with an average salary of $60,000 per year, according to the Mobile Area Chamber of Commerce.

“Today’s announcement further cements Alabama’s reputation for excellence in the aerospace industry,” Governor Kay Ivey said. “We have a world-class workforce making Mobile a top city for manufacturing and innovation, and we are excited to welcome the Lockheed Martin LMXT to Brookley.

“This state-of-the-art aircraft is the right plane for the war fighter, and we’re thrilled to have it built in Alabama.”

Governor Ivey joined Airbus officials and local leaders at the announcement ceremony this morning at the Brookley facility. Lockheed Martin scheduled a formal announcement at its Georgia facility for this afternoon.

“This partnership between Lockheed Martin and Airbus brings together two titans in the aerospace/aviation sector,” said Greg Canfield, Secretary of the Alabama Department of Commerce. “It also heralds a new shared synergy in the military aviation space between the State of Alabama and the State of Georgia as Airbus will assemble the well-proven A330 jet aircraft in Mobile and Lockheed Martin will militarize the jet, transforming it into the LMXT.

“From the Alabama perspective, this signifies the potential of a significant expansion of Airbus’ activities in Mobile and could elevate Alabama’s critical role in our national defense,” Greg Secretary Canfield.

For France-based Airbus, today’s announcement represents its second attempt to provide the Air Force with an aerial refueling tanker, made in Mobile. In 2011, Airbus was part of a winning team for the first phase of the contract, but the decision was reversed and the contract awarded to Boeing.

Airbus later began producing passenger aircraft at the Brookley site. Its tanker aircraft, based on the A330-200, has been ordered by NATO, Australia, France, the United Kingdom, and several other nations.

“Over our 50-year history in the U.S., some of our proudest moments have come from supporting our American service members,” said C. Jeffrey Knittel, chairman and CEO of Airbus Americas. “Our U.S. workforce, which is more than 35% military veterans, is eager to see an Air Force tanker join the fleet of Airbus aircraft flying for the U.S. Army, National Guard, Navy and Coast Guard.”

Bethesda, Maryland-based Lockheed Martin’s presence in northern Alabama spans more than five decades, with a concentration in the rotorcraft and hypersonics sectors. More than 2,600 Lockheed Martin employees live and work in Alabama. In October 2021, Lockheed Martin opened an advanced production facility in Courtland focused on hypersonic strike production.

LOCAL IMPACT

Mobile officials applauded the plans to produce the tanker aircraft at the Brookley site.

“Today’s economic development announcement was special. Most Mobilians can recall the feeling in 2008 when our community lost the original tanker contract. Ultimately, Mobile turned that loss into two new final assembly lines that have created thousands of high-paying jobs,” said David Rodgers, vice president of economic development at the Mobile Area Chamber of Commerce. “Today, we show the world that we are ready for the next chapter. We show that our workforce is ready to step up to the next challenge and ready to build tankers.”

Mobile Mayor Sandy Stimpson said Mobile has proven it has a skilled workforce ready to build the world’s very best American-made airplanes.

“We are grateful for the continued investment in our community from Airbus and welcome Lockheed Martin to what we believe will be a very successful partnership,” Stimpson said. “Our commitment is to continue the investment in our infrastructure and workforce that’s needed to support the future of Airbus and Lockheed Martin. The best is yet to come.”

Alabama Power Mobile Division Vice President Patrick Murphy said over the last 10 years, Alabama Power has partnered with the Alabama Department of Commerce and Team Mobile to strategically support the growth of Airbus and its supplier base.

“Alabama Power’s Mobile Division and our corporate Economic Development group have worked steadily to lay the framework for Airbus and Lockheed Martin to be successful in this project, and we will continue to lend our support as the project evolves,” Murphy added."

Airbus Helicopters: Flying is Essential - Vertical Mag - Vertical Magazine,"Wed, 26 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL2FpcmJ1cy1oZWxpY29wdGVycy1mbHlpbmctaXMtZXNzZW50aWFsL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Towards cleaner air transportation

At Airbus, we are committed to reducing the environmental footprint of our helicopters to bring us closer to net-zero emissions. Helicopters account for less than one percent of the aviation industry’s CO2 emissions, but efforts are underway to continue to reduce this figure.

A major lever to achieve this goal in the short term is Sustainable Aviation Fuel, a drop-in fuel derived from waste material. Airbus Helicopters’ entire range is certified to fly with up to a 50 percent blend of SAF and kerosene, which would represent a 40 percent reduction of CO2 emissions. Airbus Helicopters has already begun using SAF when flight testing its aircraft at its main sites.

In the mid-term, Airbus is developing its recently revealed CityAirbus NextGen, an eVTOL solution for urban air mobility. The fully electric vehicle is equipped with fixed wings, a V-shaped tail, and eight electrically powered propellers as part of its uniquely designed distributed propulsion system. It is designed to carry up to four passengers in a zero emissions flight in multiple applications.

One of the key challenges to public acceptance of urban air mobility is sound level, an area where Airbus has been innovating for decades. The addition of sound-reducing techno-bricks such as blade design and the shrouded Fenestron has allowed us to optimize the sound performance of our aircraft, making many of them the quietest in their class. For instance, our H160 benefits from the innovatively-shaped Blue Edge blades that reduce perceived exterior sound levels by 50 percent, particularly during the approach, takeoff and landing phases, which are the most important for hospital neighborhoods.

The essential partner for life-saving medical missions

When it comes to saving lives, flying is essential. This is especially true for life-threatening medical emergencies, where the greatest chance of survival depends on help arriving within that first “golden hour.” The majority of Airbus helicopters can be configured to perform air medical missions, carrying both passengers and medical equipment when an emergency strikes.

Most recently, the EMS-market leading H135 recently received European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) certification for an alternate gross weight, which increased its take-off weight and useful load by 120 kilograms (265 pounds). This means additional patients, medical staff or equipment can be taken on board. The H135’s most recent EMS configuration also includes a dedicated HEMS floor that meets the highest standards in patient care.

Setting the benchmark for HEMS rotorcraft, the H145’s high-mounted tail boom and wide-opening clamshell doors facilitate access to the spacious cabin for medical interventions. On top, the new five-bladed H145 offers operators a further increased useful load of 150 kg (330 lb.), as well as improving the in-flight comfort of the crew and patient. Our next-generation multi-role medium twin helicopter, the H160, features the largest medical cabin as well as positionable stretcher capacity that makes it ideal for intensive care operations.

When the sky is the only way out

Rescue and disaster relief is another essential mission where sometimes the sky is the only way to reach those in need. Airbus Helicopters’ full range is equipped to respond at a moment’s notice to natural disasters such as hurricanes, forest fires and floods, as well as extricating the stranded.

Bringing significant added value for customers in the super medium category, the search-and-rescue (SAR) configuration of the H175 consists of a dedicated operator’s console, oversized windows, and a powerful search and weather radar. Where help is urgently needed to bring fires under control, the H215 and H225 are partners of choice, thanks to their extra-long range and high payload capacity that enable them to carry water tanks in areas with difficult access. Meanwhile, the H160 hosts a whole set of advantageous features for rescue operations, such as a hoist and a large cabin.

On the lighter end of the spectrum, our reliable workhorse, the H135, is a go-to choice for high-altitude mountain rescues thanks to its slope landing capabilities and hover performance. (The H135 celebrated its 25th anniversary in September 2021 and the accumulation of nearly six million flight hours.) Additional SAR mainstays are the H145, with its new five-bladed rotor, and the H125, with recent EASA and Transport Canada certification of a 10 percent power increase that makes full use of the available power in its Safran Arriel 2D engine.

Value-added support and services: our essential mission

Helping make all these essential missions possible is an efficient network of support and service experts for whom keeping customers flying is their essential mission. With decades of experience, this web of customer centers, service centers and independent distributors has honed how to anticipate operator needs and introduce new solutions that increase aircraft availability, enhance safety and improve the competitiveness of customer operations.

Among the newcomers is a new HCare offering aimed at strengthening support for the legacy range, including the H120, Dauphin, Gazelle and Puma. This customizable offer was conceived in response to customer feedback and encompasses needs like proactive obsolescence management, upgrades, spares, repair and overhaul, and technical support. Airbus has also formed a community that connects H120 and Dauphin operators with each other and the manufacturer, exchanging experience, ideas and solutions.

This year will also welcome new packages to help operators of Helionix-equipped helicopters go digital, equipping their aircraft and operations with the right hardware to make the most of their data. The focus will be on adding value to flight operations, airworthiness and engineering, or maintenance and logistics.

Finally, Airbus seeks to improve operational safety for all H125/H130 operators with the Crash Resistant Fuel System (CRFS). Now standard equipment on all new-built H125s/H130s, the CRFS is also available for retrofit on the H125/AS350 B3/B3e including cargo swing configuration and the EC130 B4. In order to encourage the implementation of this important safety enhancement for its customers, Airbus Helicopters has been offering its retrofit kit at a reduced price to customers since 2019 and has recently introduced new additional incentives to customers who choose to retrofit their fleets."
Airbus Is the Word’s Largest Jet Builder for the Third Year in a Row - Robb Report,"Tue, 11 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vcm9iYnJlcG9ydC5jb20vbW90b3JzL2F2aWF0aW9uL2FpcmJ1cy13b3JsZHMtbGFyZ2VzdC1qZXQtbWFrZXItMTIzNDY1NzY0NS_SAVZodHRwczovL3JvYmJyZXBvcnQuY29tL21vdG9ycy9hdmlhdGlvbi9haXJidXMtd29ybGRzLWxhcmdlc3QtamV0LW1ha2VyLTEyMzQ2NTc2NDUvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has been crowned the world’s largest jet maker, again.

The reigning King of the Skies, which now holds the title for three years running, delivered a total of 611 passenger jets to 88 customers in 2021, according to company data released Monday. That’s an increase of 8 percent compared to 2020, which saw 566 Airbus jets delivered to customers.

The aerospace giant appears to have comfortably eclipsed its main US rival Boeing in terms of revenue-generating deliveries, too. Boeing, which is scheduled to report 2021 deliveries and orders on Tuesday, handed over a comparatively modest 302 jets in the first 11 months of last year, according to Reuters.

Airbus, which is headquartered in the Netherlands, managed to double its order intake compared to 2020. It sold 771 airplanes last year for a net total of 507 after subtracting cancellations. The company also said it ended 2021 with a backlog of 7,082 aircraft on order.

More than three-quarters of last year’s deliveries were for planes in the Airbus A320 family, which are single-aisle aircraft predominately used for short- or medium-haul flights. The demand for bigger, wide-body planes, meanwhile, continued to lag due to a lack of international flights.

“Our commercial aircraft achievements in 2021 reflect the focus and resilience of our Airbus teams, customers, suppliers and stakeholders across the globe who pulled together to deliver remarkable results,” ​​Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury said in a statement. “The year saw significant orders from airlines worldwide, signaling confidence in the sustainable growth of air travel post-Covid.”

Although this is good news for Airbus, the numbers are still well below the pre-pandemic level. In 2019, Airbus delivered some 863 planes. Still, Faury expects Airbus to raise production rates through this year.

“While uncertainties remain, we are on track to lift production through 2022 to meet our customers’ requirements,” the CEO added. “At the same time, we are preparing the future of aviation, transforming our industrial capabilities and implementing the roadmap for decarbonization.”

Airbus will post its full 2021 financial results on February 17."

Release Date January 31, 2022 Once an afterthought, new Boeing & Airbus freighters get tailored in pandemic era Purchase a PDF of this article

Nearly six decades ago, hauling cargo was the inspiration for the iconic shape of the Boeing 747. Joe Sutter, the legendary engineer that led Boeing’s design team, remarked that the upper deck sat above the passenger cabin of the airplane because once the world was flying supersonic, his jumbo jet would live on as a freighter.

“It was this anticipated alternate use that made the 747 program economically viable from the company’s point of view,” the late Sutter wrote in his memoir. “The 747 had to be an excellent freighter, not just an excellent passenger plane.”

Boeing on Monday launched its first new airplane in a half decade, transforming its 777X flagship around a post-pandemic era shaped by freight and e-commerce. That followed Airbus’s own November launch of the A350 freighter, marking the shortest duration in which Boeing and Airbus have launched two new directly competing airplanes.

A confluence of forces brought the 777-8F into existence. First, the approaching conclusion of the 747-8F later in 2022, Airbus’s encroachment on Boeing’s freighter dominance with the A350, coming 2028 ICAO emission restrictions that will end production of today’s 767 and 777 freighters, and slack demand for large passenger planes amid a pandemic that has sent e-commerce booming.

Yet, embedded in the designs of both new super freighters is a reversal of sorts and illustrative of how much the pandemic has shifted the fortunes of twin-aisle passenger aircraft. It is a new willingness on the part of Boeing and Airbus to make significant changes to their passenger planes to create bespoke specifications for the world’s cargo haulers in a bid to reconstitute once-booming production lines."
Why have African airlines never flown the Airbus A380? - AeroTime,"Fri, 28 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm90aW1lLmFlcm8vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjk5OTgtd2h5LWFmcmljYW4tYWlybGluZXMtbmV2ZXItZmxldy1haXJidXMtYTM4MNIBWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm90aW1lLmFlcm8vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjk5OTgtd2h5LWFmcmljYW4tYWlybGluZXMtbmV2ZXItZmxldy1haXJidXMtYTM4MC9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus A380 aircraft can be seen flying over various African countries including South Africa, Egypt and Algeria. But not one of the plane’s carriers is, or has been, based or registered in Africa. AeroTime investigates why African airlines have never flown the giant of the skies.

It all depends on the infrastructure…

Most of Africa’s full-service carriers (FSC) have chosen to stick with smaller and more agile wide-body aircraft such as Boeing 787 Dreamliners, Boeing 777s or Airbus A350s. Why has the largest passenger jet, the Airbus A380, been left out?

The Airbus A380 was built to serve as a large capacity jet to transport passengers long distances from concentrated hubs. But it can only be used on select routes which have the necessary demand and can accommodate the aircraft.

According to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the Airbus A380 can operate scheduled flights in airports which have the Aerodrome Reference Code F. These airports have runways which allow for aircraft with massive wingspan and outer landing gear, usually the A380, Boeing 747-8 or Antonov An-225 Mriya.

The A380 aircraft is 80 meters wide and 73 meters long and is almost the length of a football field. Therefore, the sheer size of aircraft like the A380 require sophisticated airport infrastructure, including a wider and longer runway for take off and landing.

According to Airbus, the A380 is able to operate regular scheduled flights in 140 airports across the world. In addition, the manufacturer says that the carriers are capable of operating the A380 not only from Code F but also from Code E airports “with minimal changes to infrastructure and ground handling equipment”.

For instance, one of the most popular hubs for the A380, London Heathrow Airport (LHR), has invested £450 million ($611 million) to ensure it can handle the aircraft. Meanwhile, New York’s John F. Kennedy Airport (JFK) has invested more than $109 million in infrastructure for the A380, according to data presented in a report by Peter Forsyth, ‘Airport Infrastructure for the Airbus A380: Cost Recovery and Pricing’.

The well-known double-decker can accommodate more than 500 passengers in a typical three-class configuration. This requires more time for boarding, more ground handling equipment, and more staff to serve the aircraft. The airport also needs more gate space and dual passenger boarding bridges for the upper and lower decks of the A380.

Thus, many airports are not equipped to cope with such a large aircraft. Only a handful of Africa’s aviation hubs, namely in South Africa, Egypt or Mauritius, have such capabilities, meaning that only a few African FSCs can operate them from their respective hubs.

…and operational costs

Even before the end of production, the Airbus A380 was one of the most expensive jets ever built, valued at $445.6 million at a list price.

“The A380 is a high-risk plane to operate because of costs,” aviation analyst Desmond Latham tells AeroTime in an emailed statement.

Only 16 operators have operated the Airbus A380 aircraft, including carriers from Asia-Pacific, Europe, Australia, and the Middle East. However, none of the African, North and South American airlines ever flew the aircraft.

Latham says: “The volume of passengers in Africa was only really viable from South Africa and pre-2017/18 by SAA which is now a small airline that has been poorly managed by the state here in South Africa. No other African region including Ethiopia could support such a high-volume demand plane because of the high risk in dollar terms.”

Having the largest aircraft fleet in the continent, Ethiopian Airlines proved to be one of the most successful full-service carriers in Africa. But even for them, the A380 was not viable because it “operates Boeings mainly so it would entail retraining and an entire new ethos in terms of ownership and operations”, according to Latham.

“The A380 costs around $26,000 an hour to operate and its pax capacity is 500-525 pax. Only the big global players can afford that kind of money and volume of pax,” Latham explains. “The Boeing 737-800, the most popular plane in the world, costs $2,500 per hour and carries around 170 pax just to give you an idea about what we’re talking about here.”

Has the ship already sailed?

With A380 production already over, African airlines might be too late to join the game, even if they wanted to.

However, according to Latham, there might be a slim chance for African airlines to begin operating the super jumbos once their residual value is down. “But don’t hold your breath.”

He adds: “All airlines now are focusing on the single aisle aircraft, which is much more economical to operate, so there’s a belief that the A380 will be flown by BA [British Airways] and Emirates amongst others but unlikely by any African airline.”"
Airbus cancels Qatar's order for 50 A321neos | News | Flight Global - Flightglobal,"Thu, 20 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYWlyZnJhbWVycy9haXJidXMtY2FuY2Vscy1xYXRhcnMtb3JkZXItZm9yLTUwLWEzMjFuZW9zLzE0NzIwMC5hcnRpY2xl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus confirms it has terminated a contract to sell 50 A321neos to Qatar Airways, a move coming amid an ongoing dispute between the companies over alleged A350 quality issues.

Airbus does not specify why it took the step of cancelling the order, saying only that the move is “in accordance with our rights.”

Asked if the move relates to the A350 dispute, Airbus declines to comment.

Qatar in 2017 ordered 50 A321neos. Airbus was scheduled to deliver the jets between late 2022 and late 2027, according to Cirium fleets data.

Airbus and Qatar have been locked in an increasingly intense spat related to A350 paint quality.

News broke last year that Qatar grounded 13 of its A350s due to concern that surface paint was degrading faster than it should. Qatar said it took the step following “the explicit written instruction of its regulator”. The airline later said it increased to 21 the number of grounded A350s.

Airbus has said the claims about paint quality problems are inaccurate. It said Qatar continued to “misrepresent” the issue.

In December 2021, Qatar took legal action, filing proceedings against Airbus in London’s High Court."
Airbus to charter its popular Beluga XL ‘whale plane’ - CNN,"Wed, 26 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vdHJhdmVsL2FydGljbGUvYWlyYnVzLWJlbHVnYS13aGFsZS1wbGFuZS1jaGFydGVycy9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFJaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vdHJhdmVsL2FydGljbGUvYWlyYnVzLWJlbHVnYS13aGFsZS1wbGFuZS1jaGFydGVycw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus plans to charter out its whale-shaped Beluga transport planes – whose main job until now has been to ferry aircraft parts between its plants in Europe – to help other industries haul urgently-needed outsized machinery by air.

Airbus said the move to rent out spare capacity on its existing Beluga ST and new Beluga XL transporters would lead to the creation of a commercial-cargo airline subsidiary from 2023.

Weeks after ending output of the world’s largest passenger jet, the A380, Airbus is planning a new role for what could be the West’s largest commercial freighter by volume, the Beluga.

It is a rare example of aerospace “insourcing” tasks from other industries after years of farming out work externally, and if successful could pave the way for other services.

The 100% unit will work a commercial basis, Airbus said.

“It will get its revenues from its sales, and it will bear all its investments and operating costs,” a spokesman said.

Analysts say demand for outsized cargoes that can be transported without dismantling them has been rising, partly on the back of weakened supply chains. Logistics managers turn to oversized airplanes when there is no time to use sea lanes.

Until recently, Airbus had trouble meeting such demand because the aerospace industry was running at peak capacity.

But analysts say lower output of large passenger jets and an industry-wide slump during the pandemic have meant older Belugas have more time left on the clock than first expected.

“The Beluga ST are only at 50% of their life. They have been designed for 30,000 flight cycles and currently have an average of 15,000,” said Philippe Sabo, head of Airbus Transport International. A flight cycle is one take-off and landing.

Airbus cut average output by 40% when the pandemic hit and plans to restore and slightly increase output of singe-aisle jets by summer 2023. But wide-body output is expected to remain around half levels foreseen when Beluga XL was launched in 2014.

Airbus said there was no connection between the project to commercialize the Beluga fleet and planned production, however."
Why Airbus Qualified A New 3D Printing Material In 2021: Flame-Retardant PA - Aviation Week,"Tue, 11 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9tcm8vd2h5LWFpcmJ1cy1xdWFsaWZpZWQtbmV3LTNkLXByaW50aW5nLW1hdGVyaWFsLTIwMjEtZmxhbWUtcmV0YXJkYW50LXBh0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"As the aerospace industry's adoption of 3D printing has developed rapidly over the past decade, two major groups of applications are now starting to stand out. On one hand, the on-demand nature of 3D printing has been attracting increasing attention for its supply chain benefits, especially for aftermarket applications. By contrast, the other group of applications focuses on the ability of 3D printing to produce complex shapes and ultra-lightweight parts, with the ultimate goal of fuel savings.

While both schools of thought have produced success stories, the vast majority of 3D-printed flight-ready parts today fall into the first camp, motivated by supply chain drivers rather than design. This is largely because the benefits of lightweight design tend to be most apparent with metal parts, typically high-criticality applications where qualification is a significant hurdle.

In the meantime, low-criticality and non-critical applications—which have a lower qualification barrier—have been successfully and increasingly using 3D printing for its fast lead times and elimination of minimum order quantities. The applications are diverse, from arm rests to seat row indicators and ventilation system parts, and typically use polymers. Until recently, one polymer stood out in particular: Ultem 9085, 3D printed in the technology Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM). Then in May this year Airbus brought a second 3D printing technology on board, Selective Laser Sintering (SLS), by qualifying the material PA 2241 FR with Materialise as its first manufacturer.

What's new about flame-retardant polyamide?

Polyamide (PA) is the workhorse material of additive manufacturing, and the most-used polymer globally. Materialise estimates that the company prints over 700,000 parts annually using this material, amounting to 66% of their output, serving diverse industries from eyewear to medtech to machine manufacturing.

In aerospace too, PA has been in use for a while. Materialise has already had EN9100 and EASA 21.G production approval for the material PA 2241 FR—a flame-retardant polyamide—since 2015.

However, Airbus's qualification of SLS opens up the technology for use across their supply chain.

The opportunity, as detailed in this guide, is huge: SLS achieves a much lower cost per part and is suitable for a myriad of no/low-criticality plastic parts, such as interior cabin fittings.

Lower costs, higher design freedom

Producing parts in PA using SLS is around 50% cheaper than FDM with Ultem 9085.

This is partly down to the material itself being more cost-effective, but there are also key characteristics of the process that make it overall more economical. For example, with SLS, more parts can fit into the available build space as completely mixed runs. This ability to maximize the parts fitted into the cube enables highly efficient production.

The reduced requirement for post-processing is also an advantage. There are no supports to be removed with SLS, and the surface quality is smoother with less visible layers. This allows for PA-FR parts to be color-dyed, rather than requiring most cost—and labor-intensive processes such as painting.

Challenges of Selective Laser Sintering for aerospace and how to avoid them

In terms of applications, PA-FR is a versatile material with one key vulnerability against Ultem 9085: slower heat release. As a result, larger parts for commercial aircraft tend not to be suitable and are better off using Ultem.

Larger cabin parts with strict heat release requirements are ideally suited to Ultem 9085, such as this spacer panel by Airbus, pictured here in production at Materialise. © Materialise

On the production side, a major difference between the SLS and FDM processes is that SLS is influenced by many more parameters that need to be tightly controlled to achieve the desired level of process stability. FDM is a much simpler process, making it easier to control. This is important to understand when selecting a manufacturing supplier or partner for SLS.

Securing part acceptance requires rigorous control and insight over each process step, from design to production to post-processing. With a view to investing in this approach, Materialise has taken steps to developing standards in AM production data. The company recently opened up a dynamically updated Data Lake, an accessible resource designed to help DOAs make informed decisions on the performance of AM parts. In addition, Materialise also develops dedicated software solutions with capabilities in process control, production management, simulation and failure analysis.

For more information about the Data Lake and the relative strengths of SLS versus FDM for aerospace, Materialise has recently produced a free downloadable guide. Produced by the aerospace team at Materialise, the guide looks at the economics and applications of flame-retardant polyamide for aerospace additive manufacturing, how they compare to Ultem 9085, and key differences in qualification for the two materials."
Qatar Airways seeks more than $600m in Airbus A350 dispute - Al Jazeera English,"Thu, 06 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIyLzEvNi9xYXRhci1haXJ3YXlzLXNlZWtzLW1vcmUtdGhhbi02MDBtLWluLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzUwLWRpc3B1dGXSAWVodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbGphemVlcmEuY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzLzIwMjIvMS82L3FhdGFyLWFpcndheXMtc2Vla3MtbW9yZS10aGFuLTYwMG0taW4tYWlyYnVzLWEzNTAtZGlzcHV0ZQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The two companies have been locked in a row for months over damage including blistered paint, among other issues.

Qatar Airways is claiming more than $600m in compensation from planemaker Airbus for surface flaws on A350 jetliners, according to a court document shedding new light on a growing business feud worth $4m a day.

The Gulf carrier is also asking British judges to order France-based Airbus not to attempt to deliver any more of the jets until what it describes as a design defect has been fixed.

The two companies have been locked in a dispute for months about damage including blistered paint, cracked window frames or riveted areas and erosion of a layer of lightning protection.

Qatar Airways said its national regulator has ordered it to stop flying 21 out of its 53 A350 jets as the problems appeared, prompting a bitter dispute with Airbus which has said that, while it acknowledges technical problems, there is no safety issue.

Now, the financial and technical details associated with the rare legal spat have emerged in a court filing at a High Court division in London, where Qatar Airways sued Airbus in December.

The Gulf airline is calling for $618m in compensation from Airbus for the partial grounding, plus $4m for every day that the 21 jets remain out of service.

The claim includes $76m for one aircraft alone – a five-year-old A350 that was due to be re-painted in livery for the 2022 World Cup, which Qatar is hosting later this year.

That aircraft has been parked in France for a year, needing 980 repair patches after the aborted paint job exposed gaps in the lightning shield, industry sources said.

The largest customer for Europe’s premier long-haul jet claims Airbus failed to provide a full root-cause analysis needed to satisfy unresolved questions over the airworthiness of the affected jets including the lightning protection system.

The jets feature a layer of copper mesh under the paint to prevent lightning – which strikes planes on average once a year – damaging the carbon-composite fuselage, which is lighter but less conductive than traditional metal.

Breakdown of relations

Airbus said it understood the cause and would “deny in total” the airline’s complaint. It has accused the airline, once one of its most highly courted customers, of trying to mischaracterise the problems as a safety concern.

“Airbus restates there is no airworthiness issue,” a spokesperson said, adding this had been confirmed by European regulators.

Qatar Airways, which has ordered a total of 80 A350s, had no immediate comment.

The airline has long had a reputation as a demanding buyer, sporadically rejecting deliveries for quality reasons.

But the 30-page complaint detailed an unusual collapse of relations between two of aviation’s most powerful players.

The row widened in November when a Reuters investigation revealed at least five other airlines had discovered surface flaws, prompting Airbus to set up an internal task force and to explore a new anti-lightning design for future A350 planes.

Qatar is so far the only country to ground some of the jets.

Under aviation rules, the manufacturer’s primary regulator – in this case the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) – has responsibility for overseeing an aircraft’s design.

Regulators in each country when the plane is operated are responsible for each individual aircraft.

The complaint detailed how the Qatar Civil Aviation Authority (QCAA) had started withdrawing flying permits for individual A350 planes in a series of letters from June 2021.

It said the QCAA had told Airbus that the deterioration of aeroplanes was “disturbing, if not alarming”.

It is the first public evidence of the stance of Qatar’s regulator, which has not so far commented in public.

Airbus has appeared to question the QCAA’s independence from the state-owned airline, saying the decision to drag safety into a technical matter put at risk global safety protocols.

Qatar Airways Chief Executive Akbar Al Baker said in London in November that Qatar’s regulator was in charge of decisions and that the dispute had caused a “serious dent” in operations.

The airline has started bringing mothballed A380s out of retirement as it prepares to cope with the football World Cup."

As part of Airbus’ ongoing commitment to sustainability in aviation, all aircraft delivered from its U.S. manufacturing facility will be fueled with a SAF blend on the delivery flight.

As of this week, all aircraft delivered from the Airbus final assembly line in Mobile will be fueled with a U.S.-sourced sustainable fuel blend.

The move is part of Airbus’ initiative to develop a “zero carbon-producing commercial aircraft by 2035.”

“Delivering every one of our Mobile-produced aircraft with SAF is an important, iterative step toward solving the carbon challenge,” said C. Jeffrey Knittel, chairman and CEO of Airbus Americas Inc.

Airbus began delivering aircraft with an SAF blend in November and has gradually expanded the practice. “Henceforth, every aircraft delivered from the Airbus US manufacturing site will have SAF on board,” the company says.

“SAF is a positive contributor to enhanced sustainability in aviation since it enables up to an 80% reduction of CO2 across the fuel lifecycle,” Knittel said. “We are committed to making sustainable aviation fuels an everyday reality with use on an increasingly larger scale, and this announcement is further evidence of that.”

The International Space Station connected via the SpaceDataHighway - Airbus,"Mon, 17 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMi0wMS10aGUtaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC1zcGFjZS1zdGF0aW9uLWNvbm5lY3RlZC12aWEtdGhlLXNwYWNlZGF0YWhpZ2h3YXnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Munich, 17 January 2022 – The Airbus’ SpaceDataHighway – developed with the support of ESA – provides broadband connectivity services between the International Space Station (ISS) and the Earth. With the Columbus Ka-band (ColKa) terminal now installed and fully tested on-board the ISS, a SpaceDataHighway satellite will start to relay data via a bi-directional link in real time between the ISS Columbus Laboratory and the Columbus Control Centre located at the German Aerospace Center DLR near Munich as well as research centres across Europe.

Thanks to the SpaceDataHighway and the ColKa terminal, ESA will benefit from a direct and sovereign access to the ISS, thus increasing the operational flexibility allowing more astronauts, scientists and researchers to benefit from a direct link with Europe. This will also enable ESA to create slots for ad-hoc experiment access and interaction with European astronauts.

The ColKa data service provision has been contracted between ESA and Airbus. As part of this new SpaceDataHighway service, Airbus has adapted its Ka-band inter-satellite link to ensure data will be channelled via the ground station at Harwell Campus, UK.

Besides this Ka-band service, the SpaceDataHighway is the world’s first laser communication geostationary constellation. It represents a game changer in the speed of space communications, using cutting-edge laser technology to deliver secure data transfer services in near-real time. The system has achieved more than 50,000 successful laser connections within the first five years of routine operations.

Its satellites can connect to ISS as well as low-orbiting observation satellites at a distance of up to 45,000 km. From its position in geostationary orbit, the SpaceDataHighway system relays in near real-time to Earth the collected data, a process that would normally take several hours. It therefore enables the quantity of image and video data transmitted by observation satellites to be greatly increased and their mission plan can be re-programmed at any time and in just a few minutes.

With its SpaceDataHighway, Airbus is already serving four Copernicus Sentinel satellites on a daily basis and continues to expand its services to more customers. Pleiades Neo, Airbus’s most advanced optical Earth Observation constellation with four 30cm resolution satellites are the next satellites to benefit from SpaceDataHighway’s infrastructure and will further optimise mission reactivity providing near real time data delivery and reactive tasking capabilities.

France becomes first H160 law enforcement customer - Airbus,"Mon, 10 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMi0wMS1mcmFuY2UtYmVjb21lcy1maXJzdC1oMTYwLWxhdy1lbmZvcmNlbWVudC1jdXN0b21lctIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Marignane, 10 January 2021 – The French Armament General Directorate (DGA) has signed a contract, on behalf of the Ministry of Interior, for the procurement and maintenance of 10 H160s in a law enforcement configuration for the Gendarmerie Nationale. Linked to the contract for the procurement of 169 H160Ms for the French Ministry of Armed Forces, this order is part of the Stimulus plan to support the national aeronautical industry announced by the French government in 2020.

“The French Ministry of Interior contract is an important milestone for the H160. We now have customers for the offshore transportation, private and business aviation, search and rescue and law enforcement mission segments, showing that the H160 is a truly versatile aircraft,” said Bruno Even, CEO Airbus Helicopters. “Developing this new configuration for the H160 in cooperation with an experienced customer like the Gendarmerie Nationale is key to the success of the programme.”

France is the first country to order the H160 for law enforcement missions. The H160s for the Gendarmerie Nationale will be equipped with a Safran Euroflir 410 electro-optical system, winching, and fast roping capabilities. The air force command centre of the Gendarmerie Nationale and Airbus Helicopters are also working closely together to develop a tailored mission management system.

The French Gendarmerie Nationale already operates a wide fleet of Airbus helicopters from the H125, H135 and H145 families. On top of its improved performances and advanced mission systems, the H160 will bring a new troop transport capability for the French Ministry of Interior’s security forces, mainly tactical units, such as the Gendarmerie Nationale’s intervention group (GIGN). The first H160s will be delivered before the Olympic Games that will take place in Paris in 2024.

The first of a new generation of helicopter, the EASA-certified H160 benefits from a low cost of operations and optimized flight safety. With its light maintenance plan aligned between engine and aircraft, the H160 optimizes operating costs and offers a new standard in availability. The Gendarmerie’s H160s will benefit from a global support contract to be managed by Airbus Helicopters including technical support, spare parts stocks on four Gendarmerie bases, and connected services.

2021: another busy year for space - Airbus,"Wed, 05 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIyLTAxLTIwMjEtYW5vdGhlci1idXN5LXllYXItZm9yLXNwYWNl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"With space ever more embedded in our daily lives – each of us uses around 40 satellites per day – it is no surprise that we are seeing the space industry flourishing. Last year Airbus successfully launched 10 satellites and deployment of the OneWeb constellation reached 394 satellites, while new missions started with 12 more spacecraft in all domains: telecommunications, navigation, science and exploration.

Our satellites connect

From the four new telecoms satellites orbited last year to the new OneSat and Eurostar Neo contracts secured, there’s also no forgetting all that happens between contract signatures and launch, with key design milestones passed on our market leading OneSat, the first fully flexible, in-orbit reprogrammable satellite, and on the Skynet 6 and SpainSat military communications satellites for national customers in the UK and Spain.

Our satellites protect

Last year saw the launch of France’s three CERES reconnaissance satellites that are providing the nation with a signal intelligence capability rivalled by just a few in the world. Climate change was a topic high on all agendas with COP 26 in November and we continue to work on delivering space insights to help protect the planet with 20 of our satellites involved in climate change monitoring and 20 more in development.

Our satellites inform

We were very excited to orbit the first two Pléiades Neo satellites in Airbus’ very own 30cm resolution constellation bringing the world the most accurate images on the market – the remaining two satellites will join them in 2022.

Our satellites explore

In 2021, Airbus was honoured to form part of the international James Webb Telescope mission, providing one of the four instruments, NIRSpec, that will enable humanity to look back in time. It was launched on Ariane 5, built by Airbus’ Ariane Group subsidiary, with such accuracy that the telescope’s lifetime is now expected to be doubled.

The Artemis Moon-return missions remain a hot topic – with delivery of the second European Service Module (ESM) that will power the first crewed Orion spacecraft in 2023 and signature of a further three ESMs with our European Space Agency customer last year, as well as the very first uncrewed Artemis I launch to look forward to in the coming months.

Our satellites direct

Last year Airbus was awarded design and production of six Galileo 2nd Generation navigation satellites. Significantly different to the first generation, the new Airbus satellites will equip Galileo with the latest technologies in payload processing, beam forming networks, active antennas and electric propulsion on board a larger and a more capable platform – the Eurostar Neo, already developed for seven telecoms satellites as part of a fully digitalised production process.

Sustainable space

Last but not least, for our satellites to accomplish all this, they need to operate in a safe and debris-free environment. This is why Airbus is happy to be working together with its SSTL subsidiary on a new UK Space Agency study. Airbus firmly believes that the international community has to act fast to put in place regulations that draw on what we’ve learnt from the misuse of our oceans and keep space clean.

In 2022, Airbus looks forward to another exciting year, made possible thanks to the Airbus Defence and Space who will again deliver the best space possible while always striving for What’s Next in space.

Airbus Helicopters CEO: 2021 a 'turning point' for helicopter market - Vertical Magazine,"Wed, 26 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLWNlby0yMDIxLWEtdHVybmluZy1wb2ludC1mb3ItaGVsaWNvcHRlci1tYXJrZXQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters booked 419 gross orders in 2021, with CEO Bruno Even declaring the year a “turning point” after several years of continuous decrease in the helicopter market, following the oil-and-gas downturn and the Covid pandemic.

Airbus logged 52 orders for its H160 in 2021. Airbus Photo

The numbers represented close to 50 percent growth from the lows of 2020, when the company saw just 289 gross orders as the pandemic hit the globe. According to Airbus figures, the global helicopter market grew 40 percent last year, and while that 2020 figure did set a very low bar — 50 percent below 2019 — Even said the trend is clearly positive.

“I’m convinced that 2020 will represent a low point from which will recover progressively,” he told media during a call to announce the results. However, he cautioned it would still take two to three years before the manufacturer could expect to return to pre-Covid order levels.

“I think 2022 should confirm the positive trend, but still below the level we had before 2020.”

Even said Airbus’s increase in orders was driven in part by higher demand for its light helicopter line — the H125 (147 orders) and H130 (48 orders) combining for close to 200 bookings. This was powered by the North American market, through the emergency medical services (EMS), VIP, and utility sectors, he said.

“It’s a good recovery and we know based on our experience — we’ve seen this in the past — that the light helicopter [range] is always the range where we see the first signs of recovery,” said Even. “It’s positive not only for 2021, but for the years to come.”

For its light and medium twins, Airbus recorded 65 H135 orders, 93 bookings for the H145, and 52 for the H160. Of those 52 H160s, Even said 15 were civil orders, and the type was boosted by the French government ordering 40 aircraft over the year. The type’s military version, the H160M, has been chosen for the French Armed Forces’ Light Joint Helicopter program (HIL), with the French government signing a contract in December 2021 for the development of prototypes and a first batch of 30 aircraft.

At the heavier end of the manufacturer’s range, the super medium H175 received just four orders, and there were 10 bookings for the Super Puma family.

Even said this was clearly tied to the ongoing downturn in the offshore oil-and-gas market.

“The request for super medium and heavy helicopters is still low, starting with the oil-and-gas crisis,” he said. “Our analysis, in particular for the H175, [is that] the main challenge is more a market challenge than a competitiveness issue for this helicopter.”

When asked about any potential recovery in the offshore sector, Even admitted “it will take time,” and said a “change of habits” in the sector could impact the level of recovery.

That said, he still declared the sector “an area of growth,” with the main opportunities coming in fleet renewal.

“We’ve seen this in in the past with the phasing out of the S-76, which has created a strong demand for replacement,” he said. “I’m convinced that the question of the progressive phasing out of the S-92 will come when we see what a super medium helicopter like the H175 can provide in terms of range, capability, and transport of pax [passengers]. They can perform most of the mission of the S-92 at a much lower price.”

Even also raised the issue of an increased desire for sustainability from the end users — oil and gas producers.

“We see a clear trend on the market — it’s not specific to the helicopter market — but we see it on the helicopter market where more and more our customers … and end customers … have a key objective to reduce their co2 emission impact, and here a helicopter can directly contribute,” he said.

“When I compare the co2 emission of an H175 versus an S-92, there is a big improvement — there is a big gap.”

One potential source of H175 sales could be through a military version of the type. Airbus is pitching the H175M as a potential candidate for the U.K.’s emerging New Medium Helicopter (NHM) requirement, which aims to replace the Royal Air Force’s fleet of Airbus Puma HC2s by 2025.

“We are convinced that this is the best helicopter when it comes to the operational requirements, when it comes to the competitiveness and when it comes to the requirement to have some local content,” said Even. “We have been clear that we would base the production of this helicopter in the U.K.”

Small rise in deliveries

Deliveries for the year reached 338, rising from the 2020 figure of 300.

Delivery highlights for the manufacturer over the year included the first ever H160 to Japanese operator All Nippon Helicopter, the first five-bladed H145 retrofit to DRF Luftrettung, and the first UH-72B from the manufacturer’s facility in Columbus, Mississippi, to the U.S. Army.

The H160 has been certified by regulators in Europe and Japan, and Even said he expects the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration would follow suit “at the beginning of this year.”

As for the year ahead, Even said innovation would be the key focus for Airbus. Test flights are set to continue on the VSR700 unmanned aircraft, the Airbus RACER high-speed demonstrator will perform its first flight, and the company plans to perform a flight with a twin-engine aircraft fueled entirely with sustainable aviation fuel."

Airbus books Loft Orbital order for Florida satellite factory - SpaceNews,"Fri, 14 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9haXJidXMtYm9va3MtbG9mdC1vcmJpdGFsLW9yZGVyLWZvci1mbG9yaWRhLXNhdGVsbGl0ZS1mYWN0b3J5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"TAMPA, Fla. — Condosat operator Loft Orbital has ordered more than 15 satellite buses from Airbus in a deal announced Jan. 14 that calls for building the initial OneWeb-derived platforms in France before shifting serial production to Florida.

Loft Orbital expects to receive the buses in 2023, leveraging the automated production line that Airbus is using to build hundreds of satellites for OneWeb’s broadband megaconstellation under the Florida-based Airbus OneWeb Satellites joint venture.

Work to modify the Arrow satellite platform, including extending operational life and broadening the range of capabilities beyond broadband, will initially take place at Airbus facilities in Toulouse, France.

After building the first few in France, Airbus said the remaining Arrow-derived platforms would be made at scale by Airbus OneWeb Satellites (AOS). The joint venture’s automated production line in Merritt Island, Florida, was designed to produce up to two satellites per day.

Even with Airbus expected to fulfill most of Loft Orbital’s order out of the Florida factory, the contract is a solid win for France, according to a senior French government official quoted in the Airbus news release.

“I am very pleased that the project presented by Loft with the support of Airbus relies on French suppliers, more than 60% of the value being created in France,” Bruno Le Maire, French minister for the Economy, Finances and the Recovery, said in the news release.

San Francisco-based Loft Orbital buys satellite buses from multiple vendors and outfits them with payloads flown on behalf of customers looking to avoid the hassle and expense of owning satellites.

Loft Orbital co-founder and CEO Pierre-Damien Vaujour said that, while the company plans to use its initial Arrow procurement “to deliver to our customers who have ordered services based on a few tens of satellites, we see this as an opportunity to offer much larger constellation services to governments and companies worldwide.”

He told SpaceNews in an interview that the Arrow-derived bus will become its “workhorse satellite platform” as it leverages the AOS factory’s scalability and heritage.

Scaling up

The AOS announcement comes shortly after Loft Orbital said it had ordered additional buses from LeoStella, after securing undisclosed customers looking to fly payloads in 2023.

LeoStella was already under contract to build a bus for a satellite that Loft Orbital plans to deploy in the first half of this year. A separate Loft Orbital satellite slated to launch toward the end of 2022 will use a bus supplied by Blue Canyon Technologies.

Loft Orbital is currently flying two condosats with buses built by LeoStella and Blue Canyon.

According to Vaujour, Loft Orbital’s deal for Arrow marks the first time a mass-manufactured megaconstellation bus has been sold to a commercial third party for flying non-broadband payloads.

“It’s a completely different scale compared to everything we or the industry have done before,” he said.

Vaujour said Loft Orbital expects to take delivery of the Arrow-derived buses in 2023, using at least some of them for satellites slated to launch later that year on behalf of a backlog of customers.

“We’ve secured well in excess of $100 million of bookings,” Vaujour said, adding that Loft Orbital had been “turning down customers because we just don’t have enough bandwidth.”

He said the Arrow contract also has options “with set prices where we can just trigger a purchase order for any number of additional satellites.”

Plans to scale up Loft Orbital’s business with a rush of satellite bus orders come after the company secured $140 million in a funding round completed in October and led by investment giant BlackRock.

Florida factory future

Loft Orbital’s order provides some backlog for a Florida factory facing uncertainty after OneWeb executives made conflicting statements about where it intends to build its planned second generation of satellites. In early December, OneWeb’s head of government affairs said the company, which is partially owned by the British government, planned to open a U.K. factory to build the second-gen satellites. The following week, OneWeb’s chief technology officer said no decision had been made.

The first six of OneWeb’s first-generation satellites were built in Toulouse, before moving serial production to AOS in Florida. With 394 OneWeb satellites now in orbit, AOS is building 254 more to complete the 648-satellite constellation OneWeb expects to have in orbit before the end of the year.

An Airbus official in the U.S. told SpaceNews it has “no plans to close the Florida factory.” The $85 million facility, located near major NASA and U.S. Space Force launch facilities in Cape Canaveral, Florida, opened in 2019.

“We remain committed to supporting OneWeb’s future endeavors including Generation 2 satellites and those of our US Government and industry customers,” the Airbus U.S. official said via email. “Airbus will continue to use its manufacturing hubs in the US, France and the UK to be a leading provider of satellites and their payloads for the global market.”

The Airbus U.S. official said AOS is also “performing on other subcontracts to Airbus for our US government and industry customers.”

These include work on two satellite buses for the Blackjack LEO constellation, under a contract the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) awarded Canadian operator Telesat last year.

Sara Shell, public relations manager for Space Florida, the State of Florida’s aerospace economic development agency, said she could not go into details about the facility’s future because of non-disclosure agreements with both OneWeb and Airbus.

However, she said: “It is safe to say that Space Florida is confident the facility here at the Cape will continue to produce satellites for multiple customers for many decades into the future.”"

FAST Magazine: So, Sabine, you are now in charge of both engineering for Commercial Aircraft, and technology company-wide. This is a pretty wide scope. Why group these two activities?



Sabine Klauke: Yes, not only is the scope wide but it also makes sense! One of our top objectives is to prepare for sustainable aviation. To do this – especially in these crucial times– we need the highest efficiency between the two teams who are driving key technology evolutions across our current and future product portfolios.

As we speak, our engineers and technology experts are supporting customers, improving products and services, and resolving in-service issues. At the same time, these teams are also looking ahead: innovating to improve and empower our industry, and exploring breakthrough technologies and out-of-the-box concepts.

Right now, it’s all about working as one. Which is why our goal is to bring together a single, cohesive team and a tightly-focused vision to speed up research and development of major solutions for aviation. This cohesion also extends to our colleagues in the Defence and Space and Helicopters divisions, with whom we are already testing new energy, connectivity and digitalisation systems, for example.



The future is now



Are we talking about incremental development here or something bigger?

Actually, it goes far beyond incremental development. Today our industry and society at large is faced with massive and, at the same time, very exciting challenges. Decarbonisation, for example, is a massive leap towards revolutionising the industry and making it more sustainable.

What are these technologies which will impact the aviation of tomorrow?

In the short-medium term we are working on continuously improving our aircraft structures, circularity of our materials (reusing and recycling where possible), and the performance of aerodynamics and the propulsion system, just to name a few. In the longer term, we are defining completely new energy and propulsion concepts based on hydrogen and electrification and the surrounding systems.

Last but not least, we are studying more advanced connectivity and new sustainable materials for the cabin to enhance the flying experience for passengers and crew.

So you see, we are working on many different, but ultimately complementary fronts!



What are some of the more immediate solutions you are working on to decarbonise aviation?

In fact there are already existing solutions which are delivering results today. For one, replacing ageing aircraft fleets with latest-generation aircraft has the ability to reduce emissions by 20-30%.

Then, we have Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) which can be used by all current Airbus aircraft with a blend of up to 50%. Our aim is to enable 100% by 2030 and we have done test flights with 100% SAF on both the A350 and A319neo– proving that this goal is well within our reach! It is important to stimulate scaling up of SAF in order to bring the cost down and encourage change across the industry, which is why the CTOs of the industry have formed a united front to champion this effort.

We are also working with Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSP) authorities to optimise air traffic management and ground operations, and reduce inefficiencies in the air transport system such as aircraft waiting to land.



Looking further ahead, what technologies are you developing to become climate neutral by 2050?

Our ambitious objective is to be the first to introduce a zero-emission aircraft powered by liquid hydrogen by 2035. We are strong believers in the potential of hydrogen as a fuel of the future.

Other ideas we are looking at are extra-performing wings or totally new aircraft configurations like the “blended wing body” for a next generation, zero-emission aircraft. This new aircraft shape could bring fuel savings of up to 20% compared to current single-aisle models/configurations. Not only that, but the design could also open up new possibilities for different types of propulsion systems.







What needs to be done and who is involved?

Timing is of the essence– we need to understand and mature new technologies quickly to make them ‘industry ready’. To do this, we are counting on multi-functional teams who will tackle problems from different points of view and prototype solutions for quick results and decision-making.

This year, for example, we will have the first hydrogen system demonstrator running on the ground. Based on the outcomes, we will fly a first demonstrator aircraft by 2030. We will then also choose the right technologies for an aircraft configuration ready by 2035.

However, we certainly cannot do this on our own! We need the entire industrial chain to catalyze the step change. This involves airlines, of course, but also:

research institutes, suppliers, technology specialists for design and development,

airports and energy providers for the right infrastructure preparation,

regulators and policy makers to ensure certification and also the industrial market readiness.

Bringing experience from the field

How is the customer part of the equation when Airbus works on design and technology?

The customer is a very critical part of the equation, in fact. Over the years, I have seen the delicate balance required between design and technology on one hand, and customer wishes on the other. As Head of Programme in Customer Services I met with many customers and understood first-hand the impact of design and technology on their operations.

Having started my career as a manufacturing engineer and working on the A380 and A350 design and industrial phases, I became acutely aware of how important it is to offer a mature and reliable aircraft to customers.

We will always need passionate engineers and innovators (they are also part of the equation) but we must never lose track of the customer and what value our products and services should be bringing to them.



Are you optimistic about the future of aviation?

Yes, very much so! We are in the midst of really stimulating times for our industry. This being said, our first priority at Airbus is to move out of the crisis and help get customers back to service. Then, we have this tremendous step change to pioneer towards the future of aviation and sustainability. With so many projects making progress, there are many reasons to be confident that aviation will achieve net zero emissions by 2050 if we all work in unison. I am so proud and excited to have a role to play in this journey!

BEIJING -- Airbus sees the challenging pandemic period as the time ""for a new start"" in building a sustainable future together with China, a senior executive with Airbus China has told Xinhua in an exclusive interview.

""Airbus and China are adding a new dimension to the win-win future for both sides and a sustainable world by taking care of growth opportunities and opening doors for the next generation,"" said Michel Tran Van, chief operating officer of Airbus China.

In the interview, he outlined the company's vision for future of the aviation industry and deepened cooperation with China, focusing on innovation and environmental sustainability.

New Dimensions

""Airbus and China share the commitment to building a sustainable future. It will be a new dimension of win-win,"" said Tran Van.

The COO, who boasts a strong engineering background, drew a chart illustrating the multi-dimensional cooperation between Airbus and China, covering the full life-cycle of the aviation ecosystem.

The vertical ""products"" axis ranges from single-aisle to wide-body aircraft, representing Airbus' production facilities. The horizontal axis shows various areas of operation covering the whole life-cycle, such as research and design, innovation, engineering, delivery and supply.

It is in this range of operations that the environmental sustainability comes into play. Airbus and the Chinese partners are exploring ways to reduce their environmental footprints, cutting CO2 emissions, both from the aircraft themselves and the whole industrial set up.

Airbus and its Chinese partners are making efforts in fields such as reducing waste and water consumption in production, introducing green electricity and water recycling, and exploring innovative techniques.

Impressive momentum

""It was a challenging two years, but a very impressive and rewarding experience,"" said Tran Van with a smile, recalling that he took up the post in early 2020, around the time that COVID-19 hit the news.

Airbus China has experienced impressive momentum on several fronts over the past two years. ""We are all very proud of that. There has not been a single disruption of our supply chain in China. It's amazing!""

Almost all Airbus commercial aircraft are supported by aerospace parts made by more than 200 Chinese suppliers, covering their entire life-cycle.

In June, 2021, an Airbus A320 fuselage-equipping project was jointly launched by Airbus and the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) in Tianjin, marking another step forward for Airbus's localization and vertical integration in China.

Soon after, in July, a completion-and-delivery center for the Airbus flagship A350 aircraft was launched in Tianjin.

""China is our key market and the hub of our supply chain. It's also an integral part of the global aviation industrial ecosystem, a country with talented people, innovation vitality and good potentials,"" said Tran Van.

Securing the Future

Global aerospace giants are adapting to the changes brought about by the pandemic. According to Tran Van, Airbus is taking this challenging time as an opportunity for a more ambitious restart in cooperation with China.

""In the face of challenges and competition, we can't stand still. It's the right time to secure the future with innovation,"" he said.

In northeast China's Harbin, an innovative technique for detecting flaws in composite materials has been developed in a joint-venture.

The new technique is expected to enhance the quality and production efficiency of composite materials, which are key to the modern aerospace industry. It is a unique approach developed in China.

Airbus also cooperates with Chinese partners in fields such as smart manufacturing, data analysis in engineering and new aerospace materials.

""We aviation people have some fascinating responsibilities -- to leave the next generation the spirit of always being innovative and finding ways to keep people connected in a safer way."""
Airbus cancels $6bn contract with Qatar Airways after paint fight - Al Jazeera English,"Sat, 22 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIyLzEvMjIvYWlyYnVzLWNhbmNlbHMtNmJuLWNvbnRyYWN0LXdpdGgtcWF0YXItYWlyd2F5cy1hbWlkLWRpc3B1dGXSAWhodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbGphemVlcmEuY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzLzIwMjIvMS8yMi9haXJidXMtY2FuY2Vscy02Ym4tY29udHJhY3Qtd2l0aC1xYXRhci1haXJ3YXlzLWFtaWQtZGlzcHV0ZQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has cancelled a $6bn contract with Qatar Airways for 50 of its new A321neo passenger jets, escalating a legal battle between the two companies over paint on the recently delivered A350s.

Qatar Airways called Airbus’s decision announced on Friday “a matter of considerable regret and frustration”.

In December, Airbus was taken to court by Qatar Airways in London, following a series of alleged problems with the Airbus A350 aircraft.

The airline complained the paint on the recently delivered Airbus A350s was cracking and peeling, exposing copper meshing used to insulate the aircraft against lightning strike.

It is seeking more than $600m in compensation after grounding the affected aircraft – 21 of its 53 A350 jets – claiming the paint issue is a safety risk.

The deal was reportedly worth $6.35bn when it was finalised in December 2017.

Qatar Airways published a video on social media on Friday of the scarred exterior of grounded A350 jets that the airline said underscored “serious and legitimate safety concerns”.

The European Union Aviation Safety Agency independently assessed the issue and found no safety concerns.

“There is no reasonable or rational basis” for Qatari regulators to have grounded the A350s operated by Qatar Airways, Airbus said in documents prepared for a London court hearing on Thursday.

It accused Qatar Airways of instigating the grounding as it was in its own financial interest to keep the aircraft on the ground in light of the coronavirus pandemic collapse in demand for air travel.

Qatar Airways rejected the claims in a statement on Friday.

“These defects are not superficial and one of the defects causes the aircraft’s lightning protection system to be exposed and damaged,” it said. “We continue to urge Airbus to undertake a satisfactory root cause analysis into the cause of the defects.”

An investigation by Reuters news agency showed at least five other airlines reported A350 paint or skin flaws since 2016, well before Qatar raised concerns in November 2020 when an attempt to repaint a jet in World Cup livery exposed some 980 defects.

Airbus has said it is looking at changing the design of anti-lightning mesh for future A350s, but insisted there is adequate backup lightning protection. It says Qatar is undermining global protocols by seeking leverage over safety."

Paint issues on Airbus' A350 jets have raised concerns from airlines around the world, and Doha-based Qatar Airways is seeking over $600 million in damages from the manufacturer.

Qatar has grounded more than 20 Airbus A350 planes since August, citing airworthiness concerns about the surface paint the planemaker uses on the jet, according to Aviation International News. The airline said in a statement that it is following ""explicit written instructions"" from the Qatari aviation safety regulator.

After Airbus pushed back on Qatar's claims, the airline filed a lawsuit against the manufacturer in a London High Court in December. Now, court documents reveal the carrier wants $618 million in compensation from Airbus, Reuters reported on Thursday. The airline is also asking for an additional $4 million for every day the jet remains out of service.

Included in the court filing is $76 million for one of Qatar's A350s that was set to be re-painted in a special livery for the 2022 World Cup, which needs 980 repair patches, according to Reuters.

An Airbus spokesperson told Insider that it ""acknowledges the receipt"" of Qatar's claim, which they ""deny in total."" The company also said they have identified the root cause and ""provided necessary guidance to its customers and operators for continuous operations.""

Related stories

During the months-long dispute, the manufacturer has repeatedly said the paint flaws do not impact the airworthiness of the A350 and re-emphasized that point in a statement to Insider. The findings were also confirmed by the European Aviation Safety Agency, according to Airbus.

Photos obtained by Reuters show what appears to be paint peeling and cracking, and exposed copper mesh on the fuselage of Qatar's A350. According to Reuters, the mesh layer is placed under the paint to protect the plane's fuselage from lightning damage, which strikes planes once a year, on average.

While Airbus says the problem is simply ""cosmetic,"" Qatar CEO Akbar Al Baker says the paint flaw is a safety issue, claiming ""the fuselage surface below the paint is degrading at an accelerated rate,"" reported AIN.

At least six other carriers have also complained of paint damage on A350s, including Finnair, Cathay Pacific, Etihad, Lufthansa, Delta Air Lines, and Air France, reported Reuters. However, most of these airlines say the issue does not pose a safety threat, with Qatar being the only carrier to ground the jets.

In response to the multiple concerns over its A350s, Airbus said in a statement that ""it has become necessary for Airbus to seek an independent legal assessment as a way forward to resolve the dispute.""

However, the planemaker revealed its frustration over Qatar's claims in the same statement, saying ""the attempt by this customer to misrepresent this specific topic as an airworthiness issue represents a threat to the international protocols on safety matters.""

Qatar's complaints have put the airline and Airbus at a stalemate. In June, the carrier announced it would not be accepting any future deliveries of the A350 until Airbus conducts a full root-cause analysis, which Qatar claims the manufacturer has yet to do, according to Reuters.

Al Baker told the South China Morning Post in December that Airbus ""destroyed"" the business relationship with Qatar, which was the launch customer for the Airbus A350-1000. Because of the groundings, the airline temporarily reintroduced five A380 jets in November to cover capacity issues caused by the grounding of the A350, reported AIN."
First Class Experience: Onboard Delta's Airbus A220 - AeroXplorer,"Wed, 19 Jan 2022 09:58:33 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vYWVyb3hwbG9yZXIuY29tL2FydGljbGVzL2ZseWluZy10aGUtYmVzdC1haXJjcmFmdC1pbi10aGUtdXNhLWRlbHRhcy1hMjIwLnBocNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"DISCLAIMER: This article contains opinions that some may disagree with. Opinions expressed in this article are my own and do not reflect those of AeroXplorer.

The A220 is quite possibly the greatest regional/narrow-body aircraft out there, and thanks to both my love for Delta and geographical positioning, I have been able to fly the Delta A220 in both First Class and Economy Class.

I first flew the aircraft in August of 2019 when I needed to head to Seattle, so I will focus the first part of this article on that experience, which was in economy. I flew the A220 in economy again later in the year as a part of my annual winter trip to Utah where lots of my family lives. When I finally returned to Utah in 2021 after a year-long absence, I found myself on a Delta A220 again, this time in their first-class product for the first time. I will talk about both of the experiences in this article and hope to illustrate not only what makes the A220 a great aircraft, but also what makes Delta my favorite airline. I'll admit that on the latter I am biased having flown Delta to and from SLC many times as a kid, and I was engrossed in Jay Shabat and Seth Kaplan's book Glory Lost and Found, which I highly recommend you read! With that out of the way, here is the complete Delta A220 experience.

Delta A220(-100) Economy Class

Routes I've flown on: SFO - SEA, SFO - SLC, SLC - SFO



The Delta A220 economy experience is unparalleled among other economy offerings on other narrow-body planes. There are several areas in which the A220 stands out. First off, Delta's economy cabin on the A220 is arranged in a 2-3 configuration, meaning that if you sit on the left side of the plane, you don't have to climb over the middle seat if sitting by the window. The seat pitch and seat width are standard for any narrow-body plane, which is great for a plane intended at times to be a regional jet. That said, the plane as a whole has many upgrades over other narrow-body planes. The windows are massive and make the plane an AvGeek paradise. Even the lavatory in the back of the plane has a window, too! The overhead bins are also quite large, meaning that the plane can accommodate many checked bags. With those upgrades in mind, the economy experience is exceptional for short-haul routes, and when considering the aircraft being quieter and more environmentally friendly, there is quite simply no better plane for economy passengers.

Outside of the hard product, the soft product on Delta is the same as any economy flight -- Biscoff cookies are offered as are soft drinks. One thing I particularly appreciate about Delta is that they often give out the entire drink can versus just one small pour. It's the small things that count!



Delta A220(-100) First Class

Generally first class is quite similar across all narrow-body non-transcontinental Delta flights in the United States, and the first class on the A220 is pretty standard for Delta first class. I did notice that the first class seats on my flight home from Salt Lake City on a 737-800 were a bit different, but nominally the seats are basically the same.

Delta a220 First Class seats.

I found the service on both the outbound and return flights to be quite good. I was offered drink refills, given the choice of any snack I wanted, and they were generally quite friendly. I would have liked a full meal being the reviewer that I am, but alas the flight was not long enough to meet Delta's distance threshold for giving out meals in first class. Oh well.

The overall product was overall pretty good for first class. Given that it was such a short flight, I wouldn't recommend booking first class as it isn't really necessary. One thing to note is that domestic Delta first class doesn't give you access to the Delta Sky Clubs—unless you are flying first class on a transcontinental flight—which means that you have to resort to other means of getting in. As my parents hold the American Express Platinum Card, we were able to get in with the cardholder (my mom) getting in free and having to pay the guest fee of $39 per person. So in addition to not having lounge access, meals as I mentioned not offered on flights under 900 miles. That combination mixed with the short duration leads me to believe that on the A220 specifically, and any Delta plane for that matter, economy is just fine.

Delta a220 First Class Drinks and Snacks (They have more than just Biscoff and Goldfish).

That said, we paid with miles for this trip, and unfortunately, I don't remember the exact cost, but I believe it was in the ballpark of 60,000 miles roundtrip. One of the huge perks of Delta first class is two free checked bags per person and given we were on a ski trip, we took full advantage, checking six bags on our return flight! In the end, the perks you get as a first-class passenger on a short flight are almost never worth the cost, but the product itself is certainly nothing to complain about, and I highly recommend what Delta offers on their A220.

In Summary

No matter which class you sit on on the Delta A220, the experience is one of the most comfortable in the U.S. domestic short-haul market. The plane has unmatched space and comfort for narrow-body and regional aircraft, and with Delta continuing to expand its use and spread (the bulk are on flights to and from Seattle and Salt Lake City) around the country, I expect its popularity to only grow. As it does, I urge you all to consider booking economy unless you can get a great deal. Of course for longer flights first class is great, but the A220 isn't usually assigned to long flights."
Airbus Issues Alert To Pilots Of 5G Failure Modes. It's Terrifying. - Plane & Pilot,"Thu, 20 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBsYW5lYW5kcGlsb3RtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvdGhlLWxhdGVzdC9haXJidXMtaXNzdWVzLWFsZXJ0LXRvLXBpbG90cy1vZi01Zy1mYWlsdXJlLW1vZGVzLWl0cy10ZXJyaWZ5aW5nL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The rollout of 5G cellular phone service has started affecting operations around the country—a terrific story in The Air Current by Jon Ostrower detailed the confusion at Palm Beach International yesterday, writing, “The aircraft’s radar altitude abruptly ran down to zero, causing repeated loud aural warnings: PULL UP WHOOP WHOOP DON’T SINK TOO LOW GEAR. The flight landed without incident in good weather, but it wasn’t the first time. ’Exact same location multiple times the past two weeks,’ the pilot, who was on the flight deck for both anomalies, told The Air Current.”

And now Airbus has issued guidance to pilots that details the many things that could go wrong with their planes’ systems if the radar altimeter, built into a handful of systems, including Autoland and Ground Proximity Warning Systems, were to get erroneous readings.

To summarize the findings, the systems might give what Airbus calls “erroneous” readings and callouts, many of them during the most critical phases of flight, including several phases of flight on or close to the runway.

The following is guidance to Airbus pilots from the manufacturer. This is not for guidance, and we have printed it verbatim without correction:

Observed impact on A320Family/A330/A340 Systems with 5G Emissions Beyond RTCA Limits

RCA LIMITS

Flight Instruments (PFD, HUD, Callouts)

The A height indication on the PFDs and HUDs may be inconsistent alongside with untimely RA callouts (unusual or untimely sequence of RA audio messages and/or indications: e.g abrupt decrease in height or erratic sequence)

Untimely MINIMUM callout may occur (if RADIO Decision Height is selected in the FMS)

The AUTOLAND warning light may flash

The Ground Reference on the PFD altitude scale may be erroneous.

Auto Flight System (AFS)

For A320Family NEO, during TakeOff or Go-Around, the tail strike protection may br inoperative or operate prematurely. However the pilot retains full authority on the pitch control.

THS may freeze due to untimely activation of the Flare law: In the event of a Go-Around, the pilot may temporarily need additional sidestick input as the auto-trim function is inhibited by flare law mode

During autoland, very small pitch oscillations may be observed in FLARE mode.

Untimely RETARD callouts may occur

With AP engaged, LAND / FLARE / THR IDLE modes may untimely/early engage.

Note: As per Airbus design, when AP is OFF the pilot retains full authority on thrust reduction (automatic engagement of RETARD mode is inhibited)

Surveillance Systems

Untimely GPWS / TAWS alerts may occur

Windshear detection systems (predictive and reactive) may be inoperative

Aural TCAS alerts (“TRAFFIC” messages) may be inoperative.

Several readers have asked why aircraft in Europe, which rolled out 5G sometime ago, haven’t experienced such disruptions to safe operations, and the best explanation that we’ve seen is that the FCC gave permission to both Verizon and AT&T to use a slightly more expansive slice of the C Band that 5G employs than European cellular providers are granted.

Airbus Targets Chinese Demand For Storage And Recycling - Aviation Week,"Tue, 25 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9haXItdHJhbnNwb3J0L21haW50ZW5hbmNlLXRyYWluaW5nL2FpcmJ1cy10YXJnZXRzLWNoaW5lc2UtZGVtYW5kLXN0b3JhZ2UtcmVjeWNsaW5n0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"To capture the emerging demand for aircraft storage, transition and dismantling in China, Airbus is joining forces with specialist Tarmac Aerosave and the city of Chengdu.

Airbus is anticipating that the Chinese market will mature as Western markets did. In other words, fleet aging will create needs and accompanying business opportunities throughout an aircraft’s entire life cycle. Airbus wants to address these in the framework of China’s “Green Industry” strategy. The five-year plan, unveiled in December, notably aims at boosting the use of recycled material.

Airframer already sees unmet storage need

Recycling specialist Tarmac Aerosave seizes opportunity to expand

Airbus, Tarmac and the city of Chengdu emphasize that the project they are jointly developing supports the principle of a circular economy that addresses the whole life cycle.

The three partners are working out the details of creating a “sustainable aircraft life-cycle service center” that will feature a storage capacity of 125 aircraft on 80 hectares (200 acres) at Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport by 2023. The site is predicted to employ 300 people by 2030.

Between leasing contracts, a commercial aircraft may have to be stored. It may also have to undergo maintenance and upgrade work in that transition phase, such as receiving a new cabin layout and livery. “Chinese lessors store two-thirds of their aircraft outside the country, whereas they tell us they are looking for a solution in China,” says Wolfgang Kortas, head of Airbus’ life-cycle solutions development.

Future Chinese needs have also been identified in aircraft end-of-life services. Those include aircraft dismantling and used serviceable material (USM) distribution. A two-digit growth rate is expected over the next few years, Kortas says.

All those skills are the kind that Tarmac Aerosave—jointly owned by Airbus, Safran Aircraft Engines and Suez—has grown in France and Spain. Tarmac’s know-how includes aircraft storage, maintenance, transition and recycling. The company has focused on environmentally friendly processes, such as a giant chainsaw-like system that recovers all cooling water and dust when the airframe is cut apart.

Burgeoning demand in China and existing capabilities at Tarmac led Airbus to look for a way to establish a comprehensive facility. Chinese needs in recycling are not being met, Kortas says. “There is no such thing as the one-stop shop we will build,” he adds.

The project was launched three years ago. “We met players on the Chinese market such as carriers, lessors, [maintenance, repair and overhaul] service providers, appraisers and the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC),” he says. “We drew a picture of the market’s dynamics.”

Chengdu was chosen for its mature aerospace industry. “They are used to that sort of project,” Kortas says.

In Tarmac’s perspective, Airbus is bringing its strength in China to the partnership. “Airbus already has high visibility in China and a local market,” says Tarmac President and CEO Alexandre Brun. “Leaning on Airbus gives us more possibilities.” The airframer has 25 legal entities in the country, including joint ventures with Chinese partners.

A formal accord is expected to be signed in the middle of the year. It is planned to lead to a start of operations late in 2023, subject to regulatory approvals.

The form the Airbus-led cooperation effort will take has yet to be determined. “We are finalizing the details of our agreement,” Brun says. “The city of Chengdu will have a key role in infrastructure and local support.” Tarmac plans to hire local employees and train them, either in China or Europe.

Co-located with the future company, Airbus subsidiary Satair will take care of purchasing aging aircraft. A specialist in spare parts, the company will order aircraft dismantling services from the newly created organization. Satair will market used components, thus acting as a broker.

“In 2020, the CAAC issued a rule on reusing USM outside the fleet they come from,” Kortas says. “This gives us a solid regulatory basis to grow the USM market.”

Activity at Tarmac’s sites in Tarbes, France, Teruel, Spain, and at Toulouse-Francazal Airport, is still very much influenced by the COVID-19 crisis. At 180 in 2021, the number of aircraft coming in for maintenance declined after a strong 2020. “Our storage areas are full, and we had to turn down some requests for aircraft storage,” Brun says. “We have seen the number of parked aircraft grow by 56% in two years.”

In terms of aircraft returning to service, Tarmac saw a modest increase: up to 130, over the previous year’s 115. “In 2019, returns to service stood at 144, and we are still largely below that level,” Brun says.

In contrast to the healthy storage business, a drop in demand can be felt in aircraft recycling. “Owners lack visibility on used-parts demand,” Brun says. “They are waiting for a recovery to solidify, especially in widebodies. Therefore, they choose to wait and store an aircraft before embarking on a dismantling process.”"
Airbus Helicopters opens MRO Logistics Center in Paris - Vertical Magazine,"Tue, 25 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2FpcmJ1cy1oZWxpY29wdGVycy1vcGVucy1tcm8tbG9naXN0aWNzLWNlbnRlci1pbi1wYXJpcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Airbus Helicopters MRO Logistics Center has begun operations in the AeroliansParis business park in Tremblay-en-France near Roissy Charles de Gaulle airport. The 13,400 square-meter building, developed by Barjane, was conceived to house all logistics activities related to helicopter component repair, including the receipt, screening, control, storage and distribution of MRO parts, at one site close to Europe’s cargo hub in Paris.

The site’s proximity to Paris Charles de Gaulle airport and to the resources of aeronautical repair companies in the vicinity allows Airbus Helicopters and its logistics partner, Daher, to further improve services to the international customer base.

“The completion of this state-of-the-art MRO logistics facility supports our long-term ambition to put all our MRO logistics references under one roof, to optimize our flows, and to deliver a level of reactivity in line with customers’ expectations,” says Christoph Zammert, executive vice president of Customer Support and Service at Airbus Helicopters.

The Airbus Helicopters MRO Logistics Centre is poised to streamline service, ensuring the minimum aircraft downtime for customers and more time in the air performing their essential missions. The site consists of 12,400 square-meters of logistics space and 1,000 square-meters of office space and can stock 30,000 units. It will be staffed by 200 employees from Airbus and Daher who will manage a volume of 200,000 incoming and outgoing flows annually.

The building was constructed in accordance with the Barjane Green Building Charter, which aims to prevent pollution during the construction phase; more than 85 percent of the site’s construction waste was recycled. In an effort to reduce water consumption, the site uses water-saving appliances and rainwater recovery tanks. Thanks to large window facades and the decompartmentalization of spaces with interior glass surfaces, the building maximizes natural light to create a comfortable working environment for employees.

The collaboration between Airbus Helicopters, Barjane and Daher dates to 2011 with the building of a 46,500 square-meters industrial logistics facility on the Technoparc des Florides site in southern France, which has since become a reference for support and services platforms. This new building is set to become a similar example of excellence in aeronautical logistics MRO support activities.

CNN —

Size, energy efficiency, cargo and passenger load, comfort and cost. There are a lot of factors involved in making an airplane design appealing to airlines and, in turn, their customers.

But which are the best-selling civil airplanes of all time, and what made them stand out from the rest? Let’s take a look at the top eight, based on total deliveries as of December 31, 2021.

8. Airbus A330

In production: 1992 to present

Deliveries so far: 1,527

The wide-body A330 went into service 28 years ago this month, and was conceived by its European manufacturer Airbus as a successor to the A300 – the world’s first twin-engine wide-body plane.

The 63.66-meter long A330-300 was the first variant, with capacity for up to 440 passengers, and a versatility that meant it was suitable for both short-haul trips and long-range distances of up to 6,350 nautical miles.

It was followed by the smaller-scale A330-200, and then later the two “neo” craft, the A330-800 and A339-900, both with revolutionary curved wingtips.

7. Boeing 747

In production: 1968 to present

Deliveries so far: 1,527

Affectionately known as “Queen of the Skies,” the four-engine 747 was the first wide-body plane and the original “jumbo jet.”

It entered service in 1970 with legendary airline Pan Am and soon became synonymous with the glamorous age of international travel. Since 1990, it’s been the US presidential choice, with the Air Force One fleet comprising two customized 747-200Bs.

In recent years, many airlines have been replacing their passenger 747s with bigger, more efficient twin-engine planes.

Boeing expects to deliver the last ever jumbo – 747-8 Freighter – to customer Atlas Air later this year.

6. Boeing 777

In production: 1993 to present

Deliveries so far: 1,677

The twin-engined “Triple Seven” isn’t as humungous as the Queen of the Skies, but at nearly 64 meters in length the long-range wide-body is still longer than seven telephone poles laid end to end and can accommodate 440 passengers.

It was the first jetliner to be wholly designed by computer and the first Boeing aircraft to have weight-saving, computer-operated “fly-by-wire” controls.

It’s now a growing family of eight variants, with the extra-large 777X aircraft – the 777-8 and 777-9 – the newest additions. The much-delayed 777X-9 is projected to enter service in 2024 while production of the 777X-8 has yet to begin.

Boeing 777X-9: Making its debut flight, the world's longest and largest twin-engine airliner rocketed down runway 34Left at 9:08 a.m. local time at Paine Field, north of Seattle, to complete a successful test run on January 25, 2020. Brandon Farris Air power: The 777X-9 is equipped with the most powerful engines ever mounted on a commercial airliner: General Electric GE9X. These develop an incredible 105,000 pounds of thrust apiece. Chris Sloan Folding wings: Each wing on the 777X-9 is the largest single composite structure in the world.

So it can fit on the same gates, taxiways and runways as other airplanes, Boeing has designed distinctive 11-foot folding wingtips that deploy just before take-off and retract upon landing. Chris Sloan Greener flight: The 777X is claimed by Boeing to deliver a net efficiency gain of 13% on a cost per seat basis compared to the 365-seat 777-300ER with a 29% reduction in emissions. Boeing says its newest flagship is 22% more efficient than the world's largest airliner, the A380. Brandon Farris Smoother ride: A lower cabin altitude of 5,000 feet versus the typical airliner's 8,000 feet reduces the effects of fatigue and jet lag. The 777X also has higher levels of humidity to abate dehydration, cleaner air, less cabin noise, and smoother ride technology. Brandon Farris Coming soon: Boeing projects the 777X-9 will enter service in 2024. Brandon Farris Touchdown: The Boeing airplane landed safely after three hours and 51 minutes in the air. Chris Sloan Enthusiastic welcome: Despite more subdued celebations than is customary at such events, the airplane was given an enthusiastic reception by Boeing employees after it landed. Chris Sloan Aerial emotions: ""It was so much fun,"" said Chaney, the pilot-in-command and 777/777X chief test pilot. ""The moment we rotated and saw the chase plane go by, it was very emotional."" Chris Sloan Boeing's new 777X-9 takes to the skies for the first time Prev Next

5. Boeing 727

In production: 1962 to 1984

Deliveries: 1,832

This mid-sized plane, with a T-shaped tail and three rear-mounted engines, had range for transoceanic flights but was also versatile enough to land on short runways at smaller airports.

Boeing’s original plan was to build just 250 of the craft, but it would go on to be the first commercial airplane to reach the 1,000-sales milestone.

In one of aviation’s greatest unsolved mysteries, in 1971 a man known as D.B. Cooper hijacked a 727 in the northwest United States before parachuting to the ground with $200,000 of stolen cash strapped to his body.

The audacious escape was only possible because an early design quirk of the 727 meant that the rear door could be opened mid-flight.

4. Bombardier CRJ

In production: 1991 to 2020

Deliveries: 1,945

Regional jets are smaller planes, usually with fewer than 100 seats, that are designed for short-haul routes. The Bombardier Canadair Regional Jet family is the best-selling of its kind.

Canadian manufacturer Bombardier launched the program with the 50-seat CRJ, which was certified in 1992, before expanding with the 70-seat CRJ700 in 1997, the 86-seat CRJ900 in 2000 and the 100-seat CRJ1000 in 2007.

The last of the popular short-hop jets was delivered to Utah-based SkyWest Airlines in February 2021.

3. Airbus A320

In production: 1986 to present

Deliveries: 10,176

This is where the competition starts to get serious. Airbus delivered its 10,000th A320 last summer and, if we were basing this list on orders as well as deliveries, the A320 overtook the Boeing 737 as the 21st century’s most popular plane back in 2019.

The first A320 entered service in March 1988 and the twin-engine single-aisle craft has clocked up more than 280 million flight hours in the years since.

Variants include the A318, A319 and A321, while the A320neo family was introduced into service in 2016.

2. Boeing 737

In production: 1968 to present

Deliveries: 10,877

The Boeing 737 and the Airbus A320 are the aviation stalwarts that most of us will have flown in on many, many occasions.

The narrow-body classic has been traversing the skies for more than half a century, and the improved Next-Generation civilian version was produced from 1996 to 2019.

However, the much-publicized problems with the fourth-generation 737 MAX, which was involved in two fatal accidents in 2018 and 2019, have damaged Boeing’s reputation and profits.

1. Cessna 172

In production: 1968 to present

Deliveries: 45,000 and counting

While the 737 and A320 are the world’s top passenger jetliners, the plucky little four-seater Cessna 172 is the most successful civil aircraft in history, with more than 45,000 of them reported to have been built.

Its primary use is as a training plane, and generation after generation of pilots have cut their teeth in them. The high wings on this single-engine craft give pilots better visibility, making it easier to get their bearings on the world around them and also to land.

The large cabin doors make it simple for trainees and instructor to hop in and out, meaning that this is a popular design classic that’s endured."
Stelia seat brand remains within new Airbus Atlantic operation - - Runway Girl Network,"Wed, 12 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMjIvMDEvc3RlbGlhLXJlbWFpbnMtYWlyYnVzLWF0bGFudGljLW9wZXJhdGlvbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus is to retain the Stelia brand for its first and business class seats as it restructures some of its French and international subsidiaries into Airbus Atlantic.

The move is part of wide-ranging supply chain work that will combine pre-merger Airbus sites in and near Nantes in northwest France with other former Stelia Aerospace locations in France, Canada, Morocco, Tunisia and Portugal. It reverses the 2008–09 decision to hive off aerostructures work in particular, restructuring the former arms-length subsidiaries into a newer subsidiary that is closer to central Airbus within the wider Airbus Group.

Essentially, the aim is to change the relationship between the airframer and its subsidiary from one of a supplier-client relationship purchasing aerostructures, seats and so on to one that is more integrated within the Airbus operation. Stelia CEO Cédric Gautier continues as the head of Airbus Atlantic.

With Airbus chief executive officer Guillaume Faury characterising the supply chain as “fragmented” and “complex” last year, the overall impact is likely to be focussed internally rather than externally: more responsive changes within the erstwhile supply chain, as well as greater collaboration between Airbus core and Airbus Atlantic.

Indeed, the Stelia-branded business and first class seats are in many ways the most visible part of the business, with their luxurious and très très Made in France market positioning, particularly when it comes to the passenger experience.

Yet Airbus has not managed to capitalise on having what should have been essentially an in-house seatmaker when it comes to optimising the last few inches of the cabin: the interface between the seats and the sidewalls.

When it comes to seat comfort, particularly in the shoulder space and in the footwell sort of area, these last few inches can mean the difference between six-footer passengers being able to sleep comfortably, or broad-shouldered travellers finding a comfortable position to sit relaxed.

Airbus is not alone in missing this trick: Boeing and the former LIFT by EnCore, acquired by Adient Aerospace in 2018 (itself 49.99% Boeing-owned) produced an economy seat that was praiseworthily optimised for the 787 Dreamliner cabin, but seatmakers of all flavours and ownership structures have yet to surmount this last-few-inches problem.

It will be fascinating to see if the new ownership structure of the Airbus Atlantic-Stelia business will inspire a more joined-up, collaborative process here.

Airbus Atlantic will not include Premium Aerotec sites in Germany, where strikes have been held over the consolidation plans, and which is expected to form part of a core of operations in Germany — an “Airbus North Sea”, perhaps. Nor is there news on the Spanish operations near Cádiz in southwestern Spain, which might reasonably have been expected to be included under an “Atlantic” umbrella.

Airbus Atlantic’s sites are roughly half split between France and the other countries in number. In France, locations include Méaulte in the north, Montoir-de-Bretagne, Nantes and Saint-Nazaire in the northwest, Rochefort (the key Stelia seats site) and Salaunes in the west, and Mérignac near Bordeaux plus two Toulouse sites in the south west.

The “Atlantic” moniker may refer back to the Loire-Atlantique département (of which there are just over 100 in France, and which translate internationally as somewhere between a US state and county in function and identity), home to the Nantes, Saint-Nazaire and Montoir-de-Bretagne locations.

Canadian operations are centred in three locations: Montréal Mirabel and Saint-Laurent in Québec, and Lunenburg in Nova Scotia. In north Africa locations include two in Casablanca and one in Tunis, while in Portugal Airbus Atlantic will have an operation in Santo Tirso.

"HAPS Connectivity Services Under Study By Airbus, NTT, DOCOMO + Sky Perfect JSAT – SatNews - news.satnews.com","Tue, 18 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5zYXRuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDIyLzAxLzE4L2hhcHMtY29ubmVjdGl2aXR5LXNlcnZpY2VzLXVuZGVyLXN0dWR5LWJ5LWFpcmJ1cy1udHQtZG9jb21vLXNreS1wZXJmZWN0LWpzYXQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT), NTT DOCOMO, INC. (DOCOMO) and SKY Perfect JSAT Corporation (SKY Perfect JSAT) jointly announced that they have begun studying the feasibility of collaborating on future, high-altitude platform stations (HAPS)-based connectivity services as part of a future space-based wireless connectivity ecosystem.

Launched with a memorandum of understanding (MOU), the study aims to identify the early deployment requirements of a HAPS-based network. The collaboration will investigate the use of the Airbus Zephyr, the leading fixed wing, solar-powered, stratospheric unmanned aerial system (UAS), and the wireless communication networks of NTT, DOCOMO and SKY Perfect JSAT in order to test HAPS connectivity, identify practical applications, develop required technologies and ultimately launch space-based wireless broadband services.

In the global push to further advance 5G and eventually introduce 6G, initiatives are under way to expand coverage worldwide, including in the oceans and in the air, as well as remote and hard to reach areas. Such initiatives will include HAPS, which fly in the stratosphere about 20 km. above the Earth, and non-terrestrial network (NTN) technologies using GEO and LEO satellites.

HAPS networks are deemed to be a relatively easy solution for air and sea connectivity and an effective platform for deploying disaster countermeasures plus have many industrial applications. The provision of space-based radio access network services using NTN technologies, collectively called Space RAN (radio access network), is expected to support worldwide mobile communications with ultra-wide coverage and improved disaster resistance as well enhanced 5G and 6G. In addition, HAPS platforms can also interconnect to the nearest terrestrial network gateway and extend the reach of existing mobile services directly to end-user devices, providing service options including rural, emergency and maritime connectivity.

With the signing of the MOU, the four companies will discuss and identify possible future developments necessary to unlock future HAPS-based connectivity services, lobby for standardization and institutionalization of HAPS operations, and explore business models for commercializing HAPS services.

Specific themes will include the applicability of HAPS for mobile connectivity on the ground and base station backhaul,1 the performance of various frequency bands in HAPS systems, the technological considerations for linking HAPS with satellites and ground base stations, and the establishment of a cooperative system to test a network combining NTN technology, satellites and HAPS.

As separately announced on November 15, 2021, DOCOMO and Airbus successfully conducted a propagation test between the ground and a “Zephyr S” HAPS aircraft in the stratosphere, demonstrating the possibility of providing stable communication with such a configuration.

1 Base station backhaul refers to a fixed line that supports high-speed, high-capacity information transmission between a large number of wireless base stations in a mobile communications network and the core network."
Polishing my crystal ball: Airline traffic in 2050 - International Council on Clean Transportation,"Mon, 31 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaWNjdC5vcmcvZ2xvYmFsLWF2aWF0aW9uLWFpcmxpbmUtdHJhZmZpYy1qYW4yMi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The last few years have been tumultuous for the aviation world. Passenger traffic plummeted by two-thirds in 2020 compared to 2019, and recovery has been slower than the industry had hoped. In fact, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) forecasts that 2022 traffic will be just 60% of pre-pandemic levels.

Passenger traffic projections are an important variable in aviation decarbonization roadmaps, as passenger air transport typically accounts for approximately 80% of total commercial aviation carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions. Many groups have released predictions of growth in passenger airline traffic out to 2050. We will look at several of them here, and I’ll make some projections of my own.

Let’s start with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), which updated its long-term traffic forecast, considering the dampening of travel due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Per annum growth in the number of revenue passenger-kilometers (RPKs) flown is predicted to be 3.6% between 2018 and 2050, down from the 4.2% per year that was projected pre-pandemic. This represents a 4-year lag in travel growth. The 4.2% value now represents the high bound of their projection—a scenario in which economic activity improves faster than expected, and more people fly. If overall economic activity is lower than predicted, passenger traffic growth could be as low as 2.9% per year under the ICAO model.

Another intergovernmental organization, the International Energy Agency (IEA), has derived aviation traffic projections as part of their global average temperature alignment scenarios. Under their Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS), which aligns with a 1.8°C temperature change, global aviation activity grows by 2.9% per year between 2019 and 2050. For their net-zero emissions by 2050 (NZE) scenario, which aligns with a 1.5°C temperature change, traffic growth slows to 1.8% per annum over the same period.

The commercial aviation industry, through the Air Transport Action Group (ATAG), released its own long-term traffic forecasts in Waypoint 2050, which outlines possible decarbonization pathways. The range in their projections is smaller than ICAO’s, spanning 2.3% to 3.3% per annum between 2019 and 2050, with a central scenario at 3.1%. However, the first edition of Waypoint 2050, released in September 2020, had traffic growth scenarios between 2.7% and 3.5% per year, with the central scenario at 3.0%. Growth in the central scenario increased in the update, but values in the low and high scenarios were lowered.

The rosiest outlooks come from aircraft manufacturers, who have planes to sell and stockholders to impress. Airbus, with its Global Market Forecast (GMF), and Boeing, through its Commercial Market Outlook (CMO), produce traffic projections annually. Airbus’ most recent GMF covers the 2021-2040 period and reports that passenger traffic could return to 2019 levels between 2023 and 2025. Most importantly, GMF projects that global traffic will grow an average of 3.9% per year between 2019 and 2040. Boeing’s CMO offers a similar growth projection of 4.0% per annum over the same 22-year period.

Here’s my take. I use the Boeing CMO for my forecast but consult multiple editions to get historical traffic data for 1985-2019. I then fit second order polynomial trendlines for data starting in 1985 (the earliest data available from previous CMOs), but ending at three different years to obtain low, central, and high forecasts for 2019 through 2050, as shown in Figure 1.

Fitting the trendline on the data for the 1985-2019 period and forecast out to 2050, you get the purple dashed line—average annual traffic growth of 3.7% per annum between 2019 and 2050, if you assume that pre-COVID traffic growth resumes in 2025. COVID-19 has the potential of having a lasting impact on long-term traffic forecasts. The Airbus GMF reported that COVID has caused a 2-year lag in traffic growth, half the lag suggested by ICAO. In addition, there may be a future decrease in travel as people and firms wrestle with their own environmental footprints.

Combing through the data for subsets that might lower forecasted traffic growth, I found a distinct acceleration in traffic growth during the 2010-2019 period, compared to 1985-2010 as we came out of the Great Recession and started traveling again. Fitting trendlines on the traffic data for 1985-2010 and 1985-2014, and forecasting out to 2050 produces my Low and Central traffic forecasts (yellow and green in Figure 1, respectively). Under the Central scenario, global passenger traffic will grow an average of 3% per year between 2019 and 2050 (5 years of lost traffic due to COVID), with a lower 2.4% per year in the Low scenario (representing changes in travel due to climate concerns). My Central scenario is also similar to ATAG’s central forecast, while my High scenario is similar to ICAO’s mid-range forecast and my Low scenario is higher than IEA’s net-zero scenario.

Table 1 summarizes the six traffic projections discussed above. Given that the forecasts have differing end years, I estimated RPKs in 2040 based on per annum traffic growth rates. While some forecasts have similar growth percentages, 2040 estimates of passenger traffic can diverge due to differing baseline RPK estimates. Using my Central scenario of 3% per annum growth between 2019 and 2040, I estimate nearly 16 trillion RPKs by 2040, nearly 25% lower than Airbus and Boeing. Differing opinions on traffic growth will lead to vastly different estimates of CO 2 emissions by 2050.

Table 1. Summary of long-term passenger traffic forecasts

Organization Analysis period Passenger traffic growth (per annum) 2040 traffic (trillion RPKs) Airbus 2019-2040 3.9% 20.0 Boeing 2019-2040 4.0% 19.2 ATAG 2019-2050 Low: 2.3% Central: 3.1% High: 3.3% Central: 16.3 ICAO 2018-2050 Low: 2.9% Mid: 3.6% High: 4.2% Mid: 18.1 ICCT 2019-2050 Low: 2.4% Central: 3.0% High: 3.7% Central: 15.9 IEA 2019-2050 NZE: 1.8% SDS: 2.9% SDS: 16.2

Taking advantage of the trends in fuel efficiency improvements observed by my Global Aviation Carbon Assessment (GACA) between 2013 and 2019, I can quantify baseline 2050 CO 2 emission estimates. Assuming no drastic changes in aircraft design or fuel that would affect emission factors, the spread between my Low and High scenarios is more than 700 million metric tonnes (Mt). To place this number in context, global commercial aviation CO 2 emissions in 2019 were 915 Mt. The difference in 2050 emissions between the Central 3% per annum and High 3.7% per annum traffic forecasts is more than 400 Mt.

Passenger traffic forecasts are key inputs into any aviation decarbonization roadmap. The COVID-19 pandemic reminds us that no one can predict with certainty what the air travel industry will look like in 10, 20, or 30 years. Still, it is important to use sensible projections to analyze climate goals and the measures needed to support them. Estimate too high, and you may place unrealistic expectations on industry to develop advanced concept aircraft and sustainable aviation fuel that can bring the aviation industry to net-zero emissions. Too low, and decarbonization efforts will be feeble and fall short of the needed reductions. Long-term traffic forecasts will inevitably see revisions as time goes on, and decarbonization roadmaps will, too. We need to ensure that our emphasis is on the final decarbonization goal, with flexibility in the means of how we achieve it."
Breeze unveils first 17 Airbus A220 routes with new first-class product - The Points Guy,"Wed, 19 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9uZXdzL2JyZWV6ZS1haXJ3YXlzLWFpcmJ1cy1hMjIwLXJvdXRlcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Update (4/20/22): Breeze has delayed the Airbus A220 inaugural from May 4 to May 25, due to a longer-than-expected certification process. The inaugural is now set for May 25.

The next phase of growth for new airline startup Breeze Airways is about to take hold.

The carrier, which officially launched operations in May 2021, announced on Wednesday the details of its Airbus A220 rollout plan. As part of a booking window extension through Sept. 6, Breeze is assigning the first of its A220s to shorter-haul domestic routes beginning on May 4. That's subject to government approval, assuming that the airline receives permission from the FAA to add the A220 to its operating certificate.

If all goes as expected, Breeze will deploy the A220 on 17 existing routes this summer, with many more to come as the airline takes delivery of more jets. It'll have 15 A220-300s in its fleet by the end of 2022, with plans to add one new jet each month for the next six and a half years, bringing the total to 80 jets.

You'll find the full list of domestic routes getting the A220 at the bottom of this post, but for aviation enthusiasts looking to book the inaugural, it appears that it's currently scheduled for May 4 from Tampa (TPA) to Oklahoma City (OKC) on Flight Number 118, departing a 6:00 a.m. local time.

For now, Breeze is scheduling the Airbus A220 on short domestic hops, but the airline plans to quickly expand operations to longer-haul flights, including transcontinental routes. The airline promises to announce ""new, longer"" routes in the ""coming weeks,"" which jives with what founder and CEO David Neeleman told reporters at a dinner party late last year celebrating the unveiling of the carrier's A220.

Pressed for a more concrete example of an A220 route, Neeleman said that they'll be ""decidedly more long-haul."" He kept using the descriptors of ""long haul"" and ""transcontinental.""

Adding the A220 to the airline's all-Embraer fleet marks a major new chapter for the carrier — and for the onboard passenger experience. Breeze's A220s will be the first in its fleet to offer a first-class product, dubbed the ""Nicest"" product.

These recliners have 39 inches of pitch, 20.5 inches of width and a footrest for additional comfort. First-class seats also have in-seat power outlets, USB-A and USB-C ports and a water bottle storage compartment. The oversized tray table can easily fit a 15-inch laptop.

Breeze's first-class product is arranged in an industry-standard 2-2 configuration, but the number of first-class seats on each jet will vary, as Breeze is planning to adjust the proportion of ""Nicest"" seats on each jet based on demand trends.

The airline's first A220 has a whopping 36 first-class seats, but some will feature as few as 12.

While Breeze is debuting the new ""hard product"" in May, the airline isn't going to differentiate the onboard experience just yet. Fresh food items will be introduced later this year on longer routes, it says.

To snag a first-class seat, passengers will need to purchase a new, more expensive fare type, the ""Nicest"" fare, which includes additional perks like increased frequent flyer points earning, a carry-on bag, two free checked bags, a snack and drink and priority boarding.

Breeze says that it's introducing the cabin with a special $99 fare available for purchase on select flights through Jan. 25, 2022.

The A220 isn't just big news for first-class flyers. The aircraft is also outfitted with plenty of improvements for coach passengers as well. For one, it'll feature streaming entertainment and high-speed Wi-Fi internet access (for a ""nominal"" fee) later this year.

Additionally, all coach seats have a USB-A and USB-C port for charging mobile devices.

Just like the first-class cabin, Breeze is planning to dynamically adjust the number of extra-legroom ""Nicer"" seats based on demand trends and seasonality. Breeze's first A220 has 10 extra-legroom seats, but that number can jump up to 45 depending on the configuration. There will be 80 standard ""Nice"" coach seats on all A220s.

The extra-legroom and standard coach seats are arranged in a 2-3 configuration, meaning that there's just one middle seat per row. The A220 has some other flyer-friendly improvements, including large overhead bins with room for one rollaboard per passenger, oversized windows (measuring 11 inches wide by 16 inches tall), roughly 20-inch wide aisles and snazzy mood lighting.

For more details about the new jet, take a look at our detailed first look at Breeze's A220-300.

Breeze's A220 isn't just a step up for flyers. From the airline perspective, the A220 offers exceptional economics, with lower operating costs per seat compared to similar aircraft. The aircraft was purpose-built for the 100 to 150 seat market segment with nearly 1,100 nautical miles more range than other single-aisle jets.

Other savings include lower fuel burn, carbon emissions and a nearly 50% noise reduction compared to similar jets.

Breeze is one of America's newest startup airlines, founded by serial airline entrepreneur David Neeleman, who's perhaps most famous in the U.S. for launching JetBlue. Neeleman has also been involved in numerous other airlines worldwide, including Azul in Brazil and WestJet in Canada.

The airline launched in May 2021 with 39 routes between 16 midsized markets, focused on cities that Breeze calculated are too small for major carriers to serve beyond flights to their hubs. To date, the airline's fleet consists of a handful of used Embraer E190 and E195 jets — but that's about to change.

Airbus and Lockheed Martin announce partnership to build Air Force… - 1819 News,"Sun, 02 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vMTgxOW5ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvaXRlbS9haXJidXMtYW5kLWxvY2toZWVkLW1hcnRpbi1hbm5vdW5jZS1wYXJ0bmVyc2hpcC10by1idWlsZC1haXItZm9yY2UtdGFua2Vycy1pbi1tb2ItMDItMDEtMjAyMtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus and Lockheed Martin announced on Monday that they have formed a partnership to compete to produce tanker aircraft for the U.S. Air Force. Those tankers would be built at Airbus’s manufacturing plant in Mobile.

Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey (R) praised the decision on Twitter.

“Folks, the United States has always been able to count on Alabama when it comes to national defense. I’m proud to join @AirbusInTheUS & @LockheedMartin today to announce they’re partnering together to build the LMXT tanker in @City_of_Mobile.” Ivey.

“I applaud Airbus and Lockheed Martin for choosing Mobile to produce an aircraft that is already known to be a proven solution for the Air Force,” Carl said. “I’m proud my colleagues in the Alabama delegation and I were able to work together and get this project moving so Alabama can continue supporting the defense needs of the United States.”

U.S. Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Alabama) also praised the decision.

“I commend Airbus and Lockheed Martin for continuing to recognize Alabama’s commitment to excellence in manufacturing and engineering,” Shelby said. “Across the state, our workforce produces world-class products that serve to strengthen national security and maintain military readiness. The LMXT is yet another opportunity to demonstrate our staunch devotion to the warfighter. Alabama knows aerospace, and I trust Airbus and Lockheed to harness the talent Mobile has to offer to deliver the product our Air Force deserves.”

If the Airbus-Lockheed Martin LMXT aircraft is selected by the Air Force, Lockheed Martin will be the prime contractor and base its LMXT offering on the Airbus A330 Multi-Role Tanker Transport, which is currently in service with 13 U.S. allies around the world. The baseline Airbus A330 aircraft will be built in Mobile, Alabama, and converted to the LMXT military tanker in Marietta, Georgia. The A330ceo (current engine option) Final Assembly Line will involve the construction of a new $400 million facility located at the Mobile Aeroplex at Brookley with more than 300 direct employees. The Request for Proposal (RFP) for the competition is expected in 2023, with the projection that the Air Force will award the contract in 2024.

The LMXT is an Air Force-unique platform, building on the proven airframe of the Airbus A330 Multi Role Tanker Transport (MRTT) tanker that serves 13 nations today. The tanker aircraft is already proven and capable, as it has been refueling U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps aircraft in combat since 2015. Further, the LMXT has the greatest flight range, carries the most fuel of any tanker in the world, and completes automated aerial refuelings – giving the U.S. Air Force even more capability.

Airbus had previously sought the Air Force tanker contract during the Obama Administration for a tanker to be built in Mobile. Airbus won that competition; but Boeing used its considerable lobbying presence in Washington to have the results of that competition overturned. Boeing then was awarded the contract in a very controversial decision. Airbus then made the decision to build its first North American passenger jet manufacturing facility in Mobile at Mobile’s Brookley Aeroplex.

Airbus Launches Cargo Airline with Whale-Shaped Super Transporter - FLYING,"Tue, 25 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZseWluZ21hZy5jb20vYWlyYnVzLWxhdW5jaGVzLWNhcmdvLWFpcmxpbmUtd2l0aC13aGFsZS1zaGFwZWQtc3VwZXItdHJhbnNwb3J0ZXIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Editor’s Note: This article originally appeared on FreightWaves.com.

Airbus said Tuesday it is commercializing its in-house fleet of Beluga supersize jets used to transport large aircraft components between manufacturing sites to offer logistics companies and other organizations airlift for outsized shipments.

The iconic airplanes are designed in the image of the beluga whale, with its distinctive bulbous forehead.

The new service—Airbus Beluga Transport—will serve commercial customers with large cargo transport needs in a variety of sectors, including space, energy, military, aeronautic, maritime, and humanitarian aid. With the largest interior cross-section of any transport-category aircraft in the world—including the Antonov An-124—the Beluga is well-suited for heavy-lift applications. It can accommodate cargo with a width of 23.3 feet and height of nearly 22 feet.

Demand for large aircraft able to handle project cargoes—mining equipment, power generators, trucks, satellites, and cranes—has increased since COVID-19 because the extra-large freighters are being pressed into more frequent duty hauling general cargo. This is the result of the widespread grounding of passenger fleets, which eliminated a large amount of cargo capacity, industry executives say.

The aircraft manufacturer said it is replacing its five Beluga ST aircraft for internal moves with six new Beluga XLs to support ramped-up airliner production. As the unique jets—based on the A300-600 design—are phased out, they will be handed over to a newly created subsidiary airline with its own operating certificate and staff.

The first contract was executed at the end of 2021 with a delivery from Airbus Helicopters’ manufacturing site in Marignane, France, to Kobe, Japan, for an undisclosed customer. The Beluga super transport stopped to refuel in Warsaw, Poland; Novosibirsk, Russia; and Seoul, Korea.

“The Beluga’s wider cross-section will open up new markets and new logistical possibilities for customers. In the case of loading helicopters—not having to dismantle them first—really is a plus. Similarly, the largest commercial aircraft engines can be accommodated in a fully dressed configuration,” said Phillippe Sabo, the head of Air Oversize Transport in the announcement.

To maximize the BelugaST’s turnaround capability for its targeted international customer base, new loading techniques and equipment are being developed for the operation. The solutions include an automated on-board cargo loader for deliveries where a loading/unloading platform is not available at the origin or destination airport.

“The new airline will be flexible and agile to address the needs of external worldwide markets,” Sabo said.

Airbus has relied on the Beluga transport aircraft to carry fuselage sections, wings, and tails between manufacturing and assembly plants for its single-aisle A320 family, as well as the A330 and A350 widebody aircraft.

It previously offered ad hoc charters to third parties depending on availability, but Airbus Beluga Transport will now be a full-time contract carrier.

The An-124 is the closest commercial competitor to the Beluga. It was created to transport unique and oversized cargo for complicated logistics projects, with capacity for 120 to 150 tons. With an internal crane system and two cargo-loading entrances for out-of-gauge shipments, it is self-sufficient when it comes to on/offloading.

Ukraine-based Antonov Airlines operates seven Antonov An-124 freighters, plus one An-225—the largest cargo airplane in the world with a payload capacity of 225 tons. (The An-225 Mriya technically has the largest cross-section of any plane, but is only activated irregularly.) Volga Dnepr has a fleet of 12 An-124s. Maximus Cargo operates one An-124."
