Hawaiian buying Airbus A321neos for West Coast routes - USA TODAY,"Mon, 25 Mar 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS90b2RheWludGhlc2t5LzIwMTMvMDMvMjUvaGF3YWlpYW4tYnV5aW5nLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzIxbmVvcy1mb3Itd2VzdC1jb2FzdC1yb3V0ZXMvMjAxNzIwMy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Hawaiian buying Airbus A321neos for West Coast routes

Hawaiian Airlines says it has finalized an order with Airbus that will bring Airbus' new A321neo jets into its fleet.

The airline plans to take delivery of 16 A321neos between 2017 and 2020, with options for nine more. Hawaiian says it was able to finalize the order — it reached a tentative agreement with Airbus in January — after reaching ""labor agreements with its pilot and flight attendant unions on the introduction of new aircraft.""

Hawaiian describes the order as ""the latest step"" in the company's ""phased fleet plan designed to supplement its current wide-body fleet of 26 aircraft, expand its long-range fleet, and enable it to open new domestic and international nonstop services to Hawaii.""

Hawaiian says it will use its new ""long-range, single-aisle A321neos"" to complement its existing wide-body jets for service between Hawaii and the U.S. West Coast.

""Adding the superior comfort and operating efficiencies of the A321neo will secure Hawaiian's position as the Hawaii market leader in service quality, cost efficiency and choice of destinations from the U.S. West Coast throughout this decade and beyond,"" Mark Dunkerley, Hawaiian Airlines CEO, says in a release.

""The A321neo will be the most fuel-efficient aircraft of its type after its introduction in 2016,"" he adds. ""With its slightly smaller size, we'll be able to open new markets that are not viable for wide-body service, while also being able to augment service on existing routes to the West Coast of North America.""

The order has a combined list-price value of approximately $2.8 billion if all purchase rights are exercised, but it's typical for deals to be negotiated for substantially lower prices than the ""list"" price.

Hawaiian says its A321neo jets will seat approximately 190 passengers in a two-class configuration and will have an operating range of 3,650 nautical miles. Hawaiian adds that the A321s ""will offer the more comfortable seat widths found in its twin-aisle A330s.""

Hawaiian currently operates a fleet of 44 aircraft. It includes 26 wide-body, long-haul aircraft (294-seat Airbus A330-200 aircraft and 264-seat Boeing 767-300ER aircraft) and 18 narrow-body 123-seat Boeing 717-200 jets that Hawaiian uses for intra-Hawaii flights.

Hawaiian's existing aircraft orders include an additional 12 A330s between 2013 and 2015, and six next-generation, longer-range A350XWB-800 aircraft starting in 2017. The existing fleet of 16 Boeing 767s will phase out over the next 10 years.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9965478777885437}",neutral,0.9965478777885437,0
Airbus Sells 234 Planes to Lion Air in $24 Billion Deal - CNBC,"Mon, 18 Mar 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiIWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tL2lkLzEwMDU2MjM5OdIBJWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tL2FtcC9pZC8xMDA1NjIzOTk?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Lion Air Strikes Deal With Airbus 11:04 AM ET Mon, 18 March 2013

The landmark order includes 109 A320neo and 64 A321neo planes— with the neo designating the newest fuel-saving type of the narrow-body jets—as well as 60 A320 ""classic"" planes.

While below a recent peak, airplane demand remains robust as airlines and lessors modernize fleets in a bid to drive down fuel costs, while emerging markets continue to grow strongly.

The deal surpasses a record 201-plane order for equivalent Boeing aircraft from Lion Air signed in front of visiting President Barack Obama in late 2011, sparking European claims of U.S. political pressure gthat Washington and Boeing denied.



Southeast Asia has emerged as one of the most fertile markets for popular medium-haul jets built by Airbus and Boeing, as rising incomes and a growing middle class boost air traffic.



Indonesia's 17,000 islands and relatively robust economy, well insulated from Europe's financial crisis, have made the world's largest archipelago a magnet for aircraft sellers.

Its domestic aviation market is growing at 21 percent annually.

Reuters reported last week the two leading jetmakers were scrapping over a potentially rapid new order from Lion Air.

Rivalry



While below a recent peak, airplane demand remains robust as airlines and lessors modernize fleets to drive down fuel costs, while emerging market growth continues almost unchecked.

However, there have been suggestions growth is cooling, prompting some carriers to buy aircraft only to lease them out.

In deals totaling $35 billion, Germany's Lufthansa last week ordered 102 Airbus and Boeing jets, Turkish Airlines picked up 82 from Airbus and Ireland's Ryanair is expected to sign for 170 Boeings.

The values represent official prices but in practice, strategic airlines win significant discounts for big orders.

The Lion Air order marked at least the third attempt by Airbus to woo Lion Air, founded by travel entrepreneur Rusdi Kirana and long seen as a fortress for Boeing.

It is likely to throw the spotlight on an intense battle for market share between the largest planemakers.

It is also likely to add zest to a regional battle for supremacy between Lion Air and AirAsia, the low-cost carrier founded by Malaysian entrepreneur Tony Fernandes.

Lion Air is about to start up a domestic Malaysian rival to AirAsia, which has long been exclusively an Airbus operator. Some industry watchers have warned of a potential price war.

The airlines are respectively among the top buyers of Boeing and Airbus jets. Airlines rarely switch suppliers because of re-training costs and the burden of keeping extra spares, but the practice of ""flipping"" has grown as market share battles raged.

Boeing outsold Airbus in 2012 for the first time in six years and remains ahead this year, according to monthly data.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999983310699463}",positive,0.9999983310699463,1
Budget airlines lead shift from Boeing to Airbus: SpiceJet up next - Skift Travel News,"Mon, 18 Mar 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vc2tpZnQuY29tLzIwMTMvMDMvMTgvYnVkZ2V0LWFpcmxpbmVzLWxlYWQtc2hpZnQtZnJvbS1ib2VpbmctdG8tYWlyYnVzLXNwaWNlamV0LW5leHQtdG8tY29uc2lkZXItY2hhbmdlLXVwL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus is increasingly capturing market share in India among budget airlines; a trend which could be troubling to Boeing and its long-term growth.

SpiceJet Ltd., the Indian discount carrier operating an all-Boeing Co. fleet, said it may consider a full switch to Airbus SAS aircraft as it weighs options for a new generation of planes.

“As long as you can manage the implications and the risks that you’re taking and there’s enough money in it” the company would consider the switch, Chief Executive Officer Neil Mills said in an interview in Mumbai yesterday. The carrier currently has 37 Boeing 737 aircraft and plans to add seven more of the planes this year, he said.

A switch by SpiceJet would further tilt India’s budget airline fleet market share in favor of Airbus, whose planes are used by IndiGo, India’s biggest domestic carrier by market share, and Go Airlines (India) Ltd. Such a move could further hurt Boeing as it works to implement safety upgrades to its 787 Dreamliner to end a two-month grounding of the fleet after a smoking battery forced an emergency landing Jan. 16.

Mills was part of the EasyJet Plc team that in 2002 oversaw the start of a transition at the U.K. carrier from an all-Boeing fleet to Airbus aircraft. EasyJet had 75 aircraft when it started the transition toward an Airbus fleet, Mills said.

SpiceJet will consider Airbus A320neos to replace its Boeing fleet, he said. “It’s the new generation of aircraft that offers the next level of technology,” Mills said.

737 Max

Shares of the budget airline fell 1.2 percent to 33.5 rupees as of 11:10 a.m. in Mumbai. The stock has declined 24 percent this year.

Boeing, based in Chicago, didn’t offer an immediate response to an e-mail seeking comments.

The planemaker said last month it’s in talks with SpiceJet and Jet Airways (India) Ltd. to sell its 737 Max single-aisle aircraft as the plane maker forecast Indian carriers would need 1,450 new planes through 2031.

Boeing has 1,064 firm orders globally for the 737 Max single-aisle planes, Dinesh Keskar, senior vice-president for India and Asia Pacific sales, said last month. In comparison, Airbus had 1,734 firm orders for the A320neos as of Dec. 31.

In 2011, IndiGo firmed up an order for 150 A320neos and 30 of the existing version of the A320, while GoAir confirmed a deal for 72 A320neos.

SpiceJet’s Mills said the carrier will separately consider adding as many as five Bombardier Inc. Q400 turboprops to expand its regional flights.

Europe’s Airbus has landed a record order worth $18.4 billion at list prices from Indonesia’s Lion Air, the French presidency said on Monday, adding that the deal will create 5, 000 jobs in France over the next ten years.

In a sign of the rising importance of Asian budget carriers for high-tech manufacturing jobs, the deal was announced on Monday at a ceremony overseen by French President François Hollande.

The red-carpet event mirrors a record 201-plane order for equivalent Boeing aircraft from Lion Air signed in front of visiting U.S. President Barack Obama in late 2011, sparking European claims of U.S. political pressure which Washington and Boeing denied.

Lion Air founder Rusdi Kirana could not immediately be reached for comment.

Its domestic aviation market, serving the world’s fourth largest population, is growing at 21 percent annually.

Reuters reported last week the two leading jetmakers were scrapping over a potentially rapid new order from Lion Air.

French newspaper Les Echos reported in its early Monday edition that the order, for over 200 Airbus jets, would include many of the newest fuel-saving type of A320, worth $100 million each.

The new Trent engines were both received from UTC Aerospace Systems (formerly Goodrich) which had recently prepared the fully integrated powerplants prior to their installation on the aircraft’s pylons. Last month the Trent XWB received Engine Type Certification from the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), confirming that the engine had fulfilled EASA’s airworthiness requirements for flight. The Trent XWB has already powered a series of test flights on Airbus’ A380 Flying Test Bed (FTB) aircraft since February 2012, demonstrating a high level of maturity.

In parallel to the mounting of the two Trent XWB engines in Toulouse, the A350 XWB is also this week being fitted with its new specially developed APU – the Honeywell HGT1700, which has greater power density and higher efficiency than the previous generation APUs.

With the installation of its engines and also the APU, the A350 XWB MSN001 becomes essentially a completed aircraft. Following the ongoing ground tests, other preparations and also painting in the coming weeks, MSN001 will then be handed over to the Airbus Flight Test team to commence preparations for ground runs and maiden flight in the summer.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9989110231399536}",neutral,0.9989110231399536,0

High demand for A320

Lion Air is Indonesia's largest privately-run carrier and is a new client for Airbus as it has previously been equipped almost exclusively by US rival Boeing.

Indonesia is the world's fourth most populous nation and has more than 17,000 islands scattered across 33 provinces. Air travel in the region has grown sharply in recent years with the emergence of budget carriers such as Lion Air, but also because of rising incomes.

The news about the Airbus deal comes only days after Airbus received another important order from Turkish Airlines which also centered on the A320 family.

This achievement marks a critical step towards delivery of the first aircraft to the French Air Force. The award of the Type Certificate makes the A400M the world’s first large military transport to be designed and certified to civil standards from its inception. Military Initial Operating Clearance is ongoing, paving the way towards first delivery.

“Certifying the A400M to civil as well as military standards has been a huge challenge for us, our suppliers and EASA itself. But by providing a firm framework for certification from day one, to globally accepted standards, both we and the operators will see important benefits as the aircraft matures in service and new customers join the programme.” Cedric Gautier, Airbus Military Head of A400M programme said.

During the certification programme the A400M has undergone exhaustive testing of its handling qualities throughout the flight envelope in normal and failure conditions; demonstrated outstanding performance in the heat of the Gulf, cold of Sweden and Canada, and at the high altitude of La Paz, Bolivia; and satisfactorily completed more than 300 hours of function and reliability testing to demonstrate the robustness of its TP400 engines and systems.

Additionally it has begun tests of more advanced military functions such as air-to-air refuelling, air-dropping of supplies and paratroopers, and low-level flight – all with highly encouraging results. The five-strong fleet of “Grizzly” development aircraft has now completed some 4,800 hours in the air during more than 1,600 flights and will continue intensively to expand the A400M’s military capabilities.

Airbus designed the A400M airlifter to combine both tactical and strategic/logistic missions. With its cargo hold specifically designed to carry the outsize equipment needed today for both military and humanitarian disaster relief missions. According to Airbus, the multipurpose approach enables the A400M to deliver missions with smaller fleets and less operational investment.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.5241048336029053}",positive,0.5241048336029053,1

Air Pacific will soon rebrand itself as Fiji Airways, an effort that kicked into high gear today when the first Fiji Airways-branded flight touched down in Fiji after arriving from Airbus' factory in Toulouse, France, via Hong Kong.

The flight also marked another landmark for the Fiji's national carrier. The aircraft that arrived from Hong Kong is the company's first of its newly ordered Airbus A330 widebody jets. The aircraft won't begin flying paying passengers under the Fiji Airways' brand until this summer, but the arrival of the A330 marks the first step of Air Pacific's rebranding.

The company will continue to operate as Air Pacific until June, when Fiji Airways and its A330s will begin flying passengers under the new brand.

""The arrival of our first new Airbus A330 carrying the new 'Fiji Airways' brand … represents an exciting future that is rooted in our more than 60-year history and service to the people of Fiji as the nation's flying ambassador,"" said Dave Pflieger, Air Pacific CEO says in a statement.

The carrier has two more A330s on order, and eventually will use the jet to fly to its only U.S. mainland destination: Los Angeles. Air Pacific also flies to Honolulu

The airline's second and third A330s are scheduled to arrive in May and November. By the end of 2013, Air Pacific will have retired its existing fleet of Boeing 747s and will have repainted and upgraded all of its Boeing 737s.

Air Pacific says the addition of the A330s to its fleet — and its effort to rebrand itself as Fiji Airways ""underscores the success of the airline's turnaround plan, which started in 2010 and has culminated in reversing record losses and significantly growing passengers and revenue without increasing the size of the carrier's fleet.""

Crews are getting new uniforms and the company will roll out and customer service ""enhancements"" that it says will ""reflect and elevate the new brand of 'Fiji Airways.' ""

""The responsibilty that comes with being the nation's carrier is reflected by our commitment to bring greater economic benefit to Fijians by broadening tourism and trade opportunities,"" Pflieger adds in the statement. ""The new Airbus A330 is central to that commitment.""","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9984343647956848}",positive,0.9984343647956848,1

Canadian aircraft manufacturer Bombardier Aerospace, long known for producing smaller business jets, has revealed the passenger plane it believes will be it a serious competitor for industry giants Airbus and Boeing.

At Bombardier's factory in Mirabel, Quebec, executives revealed two important pieces of news: The new CSeries jet should be doing test flights by the end of June, and one model will be able to seat up to 160 passengers.

That size puts the CS300 in the range of the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737, which dominate domestic air routes. Most of the CSeries jets will made for the 100- to 149-seat market, which Bombardier says is growing.

Bombardier's move into the larger passenger jet market, combined with the growth of Brazil's Embraer, poses a threat to the dominance of Airbus and Boeing.

As our Airbus fleet expands, so does our destination network, said Mark Dunkerley, president and CEO of Hawaiian Airlines. Our fleet of A330s has prompted great response from our customers and employees alike. And the addition of the A321neo to our fleet is expected to generate around one thousand new jobs at our airline.

Airbus prides itself on being part of our customers’ growing successes, and this order is the perfect example of how the right plane at the right airline can alter not just a business culture, but a local community, said John Leahy, Airbus chief operating officer, Customers. The A320neo Family brings a further greening of our product line, and considering the environmental consciousness of the Hawaiian people, this aspect of the aircraft is another driver for eco-friendly, sustainable growth at the airline. It’s also the most comfortable single-aisle flying today.

Incorporating new engines and large Sharklet wing tip devices, the A320neo Family will deliver fuel savings of 15 percent. In addition, the A320neo Family will provide a double-digit reduction in NOx emissions and reduced engine noise. The A320neo will enter into service from late 2015, followed by the A319neo and A321neo in 2016.

More than 9,150 A320 Family aircraft have been ordered and more than 5,450 delivered to more than 385 customers and operators worldwide reaffirming its position as the world’s best-selling single-aisle aircraft Family. The A320neo has over 95 percent airframe commonality making it an easy fit into existing fleets while offering up to 500 nautical miles (950 kilometers) more range or two metric tons more payload at a given range.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9950475692749023}",positive,0.9950475692749023,1
Boeing and Ryanair in Deal for 175 New 737 Jets - The New York Times,"Tue, 19 Mar 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMTMvMDMvMjAvYnVzaW5lc3MvYm9laW5nLXNlY3VyZXMtMTUtNi1iaWxsaW9uLW9yZGVyLWZyb20tcnlhbmFpci5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Boeing said on Tuesday that it had signed an order for 175 single-aisle 737s, its biggest deal so far this year, from the European low-cost carrier Ryanair.

The agreement is valued at $15.6 billion at current list prices, although Ryanair, like most large customers, received a significant discount. The final sale price remained confidential, but analysts estimated that Ryanair probably paid around 50 percent of the $89.1 million listed price per jet.

The big order offers some better news for Boeing, which has been struggling with battery problems that have grounded its innovative 787 jets since mid-January. Boeing has been testing a new steel enclosure for the batteries and is planning a test flight this week to certify the system with federal authorities.

The deal with Ryanair provides Boeing with a smooth transition in the production and sale of its 737s before it builds a new version of its single-aisle plane with a more fuel-efficient engine. That plane, known as the 737 Max, is scheduled to come into service in 2017.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9990204572677612}",positive,0.9990204572677612,1

Airbus' A380 is the world's biggest commercial passenger jet, but – despite its size – the aircraft is flown on a handful of routes that may seem surprisingly short.

""Many airlines run the superjumbo on jaunts lasting just a few hours in order to rake in a little extra revenue from the twin-deck jetliner between its more conventional long-distance flights,"" writes Kinny Cheng of Australian Business Traveller.

In fact, the publication takes a look at some of the world's shortest A380 routes. Here are what Australian Business Traveller says are five of the shortest:

1. Guangzhou-Shanghai (2 hours, 20 minutes)

China Southern flies A380s (photos here) this domestic Chinese route.

2. Bangkok-Hong Kong (2 hours, 40 minutes)

Thai Airways and Emirates each fly A380s on this route within Southeast Asia.

2. Dubai-Jeddah (2 hours, 40 minutes)

Emirates flies A380s on this route between cities on the Arabian Peninsula.

4. Guangzhou-Beijing (3 hours 10 minutes)

Another domestic Chinese route that features China Southern's A380s.

5. Sydney-Auckland (3 hours 20 minutes)

Australian Business Traveller writes this Emirates route is ""cleverly designed to press the superjumbo into trans-Tasman service during the long layover between when it reaches Sydney on the overnight flight from Dubai"" and before the return flight.""","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999978542327881}",neutral,0.9999978542327881,0

American Airlines selects Airbus's cockpit technology for A320 jets - Aerospace Technology,"Wed, 20 Mar 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm9zcGFjZS10ZWNobm9sb2d5LmNvbS91bmNhdGVnb3Jpc2VkL25ld3NhbWVyaWNhbi1haXJsaW5lcy1zZWxlY3RzLWFpcmJ1cy1jb2NrcGl0LXRlY2hub2xvZ3ktYTMyMC1qZXRzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"American Airlines has selected Airbus’s Runway Overrun Prevention System (ROPS) technology for all of its A320 airliners.

The onboard cockpit technology increases pilots’ situational awareness during landing and reduces exposure to runway excursion risk.

The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) first approved the ROPS in October 2009 and the system is currently in-service on, or ordered for, around 70% of the A380 fleet.

ROPS is part of the basic configuration of A350 XWB jets and is also being used on other Airbus variants, starting with the A320, with a certification on this type expected later this year.

Airbus senior vice president and chief product safety officer Yannick Malinge said that the ROPS was the result of years of continuing research by Airbus.



""Its selection by American Airlines for its A320 family fleet underscores the value and significant contribution that ROPS brings to aviation safety,"" Malinge said.

American Airlines Flight vice president John Hale added: ""Our pilots appreciate the operational benefits that this industry-approved cockpit technology will bring to their daily work.""

ROPS analyses minimum realistic in-flight landing and on-ground stopping distances while comparing them with available real-time landing distances.

The analyses will consider factors such as runway topography and condition, aircraft weight and configuration, as well as wind and temperature.

""Our pilots appreciate the operational benefits that this industry-approved cockpit technology will bring to their daily work.""

The resulting outcome provides audio callouts and alerts for pilots, making ROPS an awareness tool to assess the crew in decision making processes.

In order to lower and eliminate the risk of runway excursions, various industrial members, including EASA, NTSB, Eurocontrol and FAA, are supporting the introduction of effective measures by commercial aviation stakeholders.

In line with this efforts, Airbus is making ROPS technology commercially available for aircraft from other manufacturers.

The system will be combined with the Terrain Avoidance Warning System, which is already fitted, and will use an enhanced version of its worldwide runway database.

American Airlines’ fleet of some 900 aeroplanes fly more than 3,500 daily flights worldwide from hubs in Chicago, Dallas/Fort Worth, Los Angeles, Miami and New York.

Turkish Airlines signs deal for 117 Airbus A320 aircraft - Aerospace Technology,"Mon, 18 Mar 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm9zcGFjZS10ZWNobm9sb2d5LmNvbS91bmNhdGVnb3Jpc2VkL25ld3N0dXJraXNoLWFpcmxpbmVzLXNpZ25zLWRlYWwtMTE3LWFpcmJ1cy1hMzIwLWFpcmNyYWZ0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Turkish Airlines (THY) has entered into an agreement with European aircraft manufacturer Airbus for the purchase of 25 A321ceo, four A320neo and 53 A321neo, with an option for 35 additional A321neo airliners.

The deal marks the largest order ever placed by a Turkish carrier.

Excluding the optional order, the order for 82 narrow-body A320 series aeroplanes is estimated to be valued at $9.3bn based on list prices, reports Bloomberg.

Turkish Airlines plans to choose the engine to power its A320neo jetliners at a later date.

Turkish Airlines chief marketing officer Faruk Cizmecioglu said: ""The A320 family, with its economic benefits combined with superior cabin comfort, will greatly contribute to meet our ambitious growth plans.""



Airbus COO customers John Leahy added: ""The 15% fuel saving and the widest cabin in its class give Turkish Airlines a big competitive advantage.

""We are delighted with this new order from Turkish Airlines, which takes us above 2,000 NEO orders in a little over two years after launch.""

Turkish Airlines, which is 49% state-owned, already operates 75 A320 jetliners.

""The 15% fuel saving and the widest cabin in its class give Turkish Airlines a big competitive advantage.""

The new A320s will allow Turkish Airlines to expand its short to medium-haul routes from its Istanbul hub, while the aeroplane’s commonality with its existing Airbus fleet will result in additional cost-savings.

Featuring large Sharklet wing-tip devices, the A320neo will provide a double-digit reduction in NOx emissions and reduce engine noise.

In addition, it has more than 95% airframe commonality making it an easy fit into existing fleets, while offering up to 500nm more range or two tonnes more payload at a given range.

The A320neo is scheduled to enter service from late 2015, followed by the A319neo and A321neo in 2016.

To date, Airbus has received more than 9,150 firm orders for its A320 line, with in excess of 5,450 having been delivered to more than 385 customers and operators worldwide.

Aircraft Accessibility: Is the Airbus 380 Disabled Friendly? - Reduced Mobility Rights,"Wed, 06 Mar 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlZHVjZWRtb2JpbGl0eS5ldS8yMDEzMDMwNjI5Mi9UaGUtTmV3cy9haXJjcmFmdC1hY2Nlc3NpYmlsaXR5LWlzLXRoZS1haXJidXMtMzgwLWRpc2FibGVkLWZyaWVuZGx5Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In a world where growing numbers of disabled businessmen take the skies, Reduced Mobility Rights has taken a closer look at the Airbus 380 accessibility.

Manufactured by Airbus, the 380 aircraft is the largest jetliner in service. The double decker airliner boasts 50% more floor space than its direct competitor, the Boeing 747 Jumbo jet.

In its all-economy configuration, the A380 can seat over 850 people. However, most Airbus 380 currently in use features 3 class configuration (First class, Business class, Economy). Qantas Airways and Air France operate a 4 class configuration, also featuring Premium Economy.

The aircraft was designed to improve passengers' in-flight experience. Featuring a 50% quieter cabin environment than its rival 747, the A380 has lower pressurization levels and relaxing cabin lights among its signature features.

In all its configurations in service, the Airbus 380 has business class on the upper deck, making cabin accessibility a critical issue for disabled businessmen planning to fly with the mighty aircraft. Reduced Mobility Rights contacted a number of airlines operating the A380 aircraft, asking which procedure or method is used to help a quadriplegic passenger (WCHC) make his way to and from the business class cabin on the upper deck.

""At all Paris Charles de Gaulle terminals handling the A380, the jetways are equipped with an elevator to help Passengers with Reduced Mobility (PRM) access the jetway to the upper deck,"" a spokesperson for Air France said. ""In the event of an elevator malfunction, jetway staff can use “SMax”, a motorized chair that can carry PRM up the 380’s internal stairs.""

The French flag carrier currently operates a fleet of 8 A380 in a four class configuration. Air France guarantees the aircraft accessibility at all times.

""Boarding for wheel chair passengers to a seat on the upper deck of the A380 parked at a gate position is done via jet bridges that directly connects to the upper deck,"" a spokesperson for Lufthansa told Reduced Mobility Rights. ""If necessary, the guest is then lifted into the seat

In the rare event that an A380 is parked at a tarmac position, we have a special high loader truck that is able to access the upper deck of the aircraft.""

The German flag carrier currently operates a fleet of 10 Airbus 380 aircraft in a 3 cabin configuration. Like rival Air France, Lufthansa guarantees accessibility at all times.

""Boarding the Korean Air A380 is made straight into both the lower and upper deck - a bridge connects directly into the upper deck,"" a spokesperson for Korean Air said ""This is an essential requirement for Korean Air's A380's at the airports it is used on - if the airport does not have a bridge that can connect into the upper deck the A380 cannot be used there.""

The South Korea flag carrier currently operates a fleet of 6 A380. It remains unclear if the airline can guarantee accessibility to the upper deck of the aircraft at all times as no emergency procedure was mentioned to help disabled passengers in case an upper air bridge becomes unavailable.

""Singapore Airlines A380 aircraft feature Business Class on the upper deck but due to the fact we offer direct upper deck access from the aerobridge, the boarding process is the same as for any other aircraft type (for both able bodied and disabled customers),"" a spokesperson for the Asian carrier told Reduced Mobility Rights.

Singapore Airlines operates a fleet of 19 A380 aircraft. Despite being the first ever operator of the superjumbo, the Asian carrier did not clarify if an emergency procedure is in place in case the upper air bridge becomes unavailable.

Emirates Airlines and Qantas were unavailable for comment. Airbus, the A380 manufacturer was also unavailable for comment.

Looking forward to A350 XWB's maiden flight - Innovation in Textiles,"Mon, 25 Mar 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmlubm92YXRpb25pbnRleHRpbGVzLmNvbS9sb29raW5nLWZvcndhcmQtdG8tYTM1MC14d2JzLW1haWRlbi1mbGlnaHQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"When the Airbus A350 XWB takes to the skies for the first time this summer it will be a momentous achievement for Airbus and one of the proudest moments in Hexcel’s 65 year history – especially as every A350 XWB that takes to the skies generates over $4 million in sales for the US composites manufacturer.

When the Airbus A350 XWB takes to the skies for the first time this summer it will be a momentous achievement for Airbus and one of the proudest moments in Hexcel’s 65 year history – especially as every A350 XWB that takes to the skies generates over $4 million in sales for the US composites manufacturer.

The A350 XWB is the first Airbus with a structure that is over 50% composites – 53% in fact, whereas composite materials constituted only 15% of the structure of the A340 and 23% of the A380. The A350 XWB lower wing covers are the largest single civil aviation parts made from carbon fibre, measuring 32 metres long and 6 metres wide.

When Hexcel was awarded the contract in 2008 to supply carbon fibre prepreg for all the A350 XWB composite primary structures, it was the largest contract in the company’s history, expected to generate revenues of $4-5 billion. By February this year Airbus had sold 617 A350 XWBs.

Hexcel secured the A350 XWB contract by developing a complete composite proposal including carbon fibre prepreg and associated products. The company’s experience in Intermediate Modulus carbon fibres was used to design HexTow IMA to Airbus requirements and HexPly M21E prepreg resin matrix was developed by Hexcel chemists to ensure that the very high performance properties in the fibre are fully optimized in the cured prepreg laminates.

The A350 XWB composite structures built by Airbus and the Tier 1 suppliers using HexPly M21E/IMA include entire fuselage panels, keel beam, the entire wing (covers, spars and centre wing-box) and empennage (tail assembly).

To meet the increasing demand for HexTow carbon fibre, new lines have been added at Hexcel’s PAN precursor facility in Decatur, AL; new carbon fibre lines have been commissioned in Salt Lake City, UT; and Hexcel has built its first European carbon fibre manufacturing plant in Illescas, Spain.

To produce the vast quantities of prepreg required for the A350 XWB Hexcel introduced a new model for the cost-effective large scale production of prepreg, producing resin film in a continuous process to very tight aerial weight tolerances in Duxford, UK, which it says has improved the quality, accuracy and consistency of the resin film. Hexcel is also expanding its prepreg matrix capacities at its Salt Lake City, Utah facility.

The resin film from the UK is converted into UD prepreg at Hexcel facilities in France, Spain, Germany and the USA from where it is supplied to nearby Airbus facilities and the Tier 1s throughout Europe and the USA.

This has resulted in a highly effective supply chain model for prepreg production, which benefits the customer and Hexcel, resulting in shorter lead times, greater responsiveness, reduced transportation of materials, point of use delivery, less packaging, reduced inventory and fewer requirements for cold storage space.

“We are very much looking forward to celebrating the A350 XWB first flight later this year” said Nick Stanage, Hexcel President and COO.

“Since we were awarded the contract by Airbus back in 2008 we have delivered on our commitments by investing in Hexcel’s global capacity as required for the A350 and other aircraft programs. Our expansion has been successful because of our close cooperation with Airbus and their global partners. The combination of advanced technology and operational excellence is the foundation for our business at Hexcel and I wish to thank our Hexcel team, suppliers and valued customers who are working on the A350 program for their dedication and commitment.”

The following videos give a really good insight into the processes used by Hexcel's customer Airbus in the manufacture of the A359 XWB:

Airbus A350 XWB in the making: Broughton.

In this video clip, team members at Airbus’ Broughton, UK site discuss the facility’s contribution to A350 XWB production – which focuses on wing deliverables.

Airbus A350 XWB in the making: Stade.

The contributions of Airbus’ Stade site to production of the next-generation A350 XWB jetliner are highlighted in this video clip, with comments from a number of Airbus team members.

Hexcel is a global leader in advanced composite materials for aerospace and wind energy markets, as well as some selected industrial applications. A technology trailblazer, Hexcel develops, manufactures and sells a very wide range of composite materials and processes for selected markets, from carbon fibre to reinforcements, adhesives, honeycomb, prepregs, engineered core and engineered products.

The company achieved $1.6 billion in sales in 2012 and forecast solid growth, based in particular on successes on new commercial aircraft programs such as the A350 XWB. Hexcel is predicting double digit growth over the next 5 years and anticipates achieving sales of around $2.5 billion by 2017.

With a workforce approaching 5000, Hexcel has 18 manufacturing sites, located throughout the USA, Europe and Asia.

Its hangar includes regional jets and propeller planes, as well as a range of executive aircraft. It formally unveiled its newest plane after a glitzy multimedia presentation at its Mirabel facility near Montreal, lifting a large screen to reveal one of the aircraft. Bathed in blue light, the white and olive-gray jet had a red-orange and white nose, its two Pratt & Whitney engines spinning gently. ""It's not a paper airplane, it's a real airplane,"" Arcamone said. ""It's not a re-engined aircraft we are putting into the market ... I can tell you we are a very serious contender."" The company said it was transitioning to flight testing ahead of a first flight scheduled by the end of June.

At list prices, the 110-seat CS100 costs $US62 million and the 130-seat CS300 costs $US71 million. In contrast, the Boeing 737 MAX costs $US82 million and Airbus' A319 NEO costs $US88.8 million. Latvia-based airBaltic is one of the first customers to purchase a higher-density 148-seat version of the plane, the company said. Bombardier said it would also offer a CS300 with an option for up to 160 seats, either as an initial order or as a retrofitted plane. LURING CUSTOMERS A big buyer is Germany's Deutsche Lufthansa, the first airline to put in a firm order. Lufthansa Executive Vice President Nico Buchholz was present at the event, along with executives from Swiss International Air Lines and Republic Airways.

Bombardier said executives from about 15 customers and potential customers attended the event, though most asked the planemaker to keep their anonymity. Its book currently stands at 148 firm orders, excluding a commitment for 32 CS300 jets by Russia's Ilyushin Finance Co. That order is awaiting shareholder approval, which is expected to go through sometime this month. That compares with 1064 orders for Boeing's competing 737 MAX and more than 1440 for Airbus' NEO family, although only a small fraction of those orders is for the smaller models that compete directly with the CSeries. Arcamone, noting it already has 14 customers, was adamant that Bombardier would meet its target of 300 firm orders and at least 20 customers by mid-2014, when the jet enters service. DISCOUNTING

Bombardier's slowly growing order book has raised concerns that the company does not have the appetite to lure customers with deep discounts, as Boeing and Airbus do, or provide financing offers and walk-away rights. ""We've had some customers that we did offer launch pricing as our competition's done, which is the industry norm. It makes economic sense,"" said Arcamone. The CSeries claims a 15 per cent cash operating cost advantage and 20 percent fuel burn advantage over the Boeing and Airbus models. Its airframe is lighter. The plane uses conventional batteries rather than the lithium ion batteries that have caused troubles for Boeing's Dreamliner plane. ""We are very glad about that decision,"" Arcamone said. Airbus and Boeing have moved to defend their strong market shares by adding fuel-saving engines similar to those on the CSeries to their own best-selling models.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999734163284302}",neutral,0.9999734163284302,0

Business is booming at: The European planemaker just closed a huge deal to sell $24 billion worth of A320 jets to Indonesia's Lion Air, and it's busy building the A350 XWB , the plane it created to compete with Boeing's 787 Dreamliner.

Airbus is based in Toulouse, France, but produces planes in the United Kingdom, Spain, Germany, and China.

To transport the wings and fuselages of half-built planes from one factory to another, it needed a plane bigger than any standard cargo jet.

So it built the Beluga.

Developed in the 1990s and based on the A300 (the wings, engines, landing gear, and lower portion of the fuselage are the same), the Beluga has one of the biggest cargo holds in the world.

It's the best way to get the body of a jumbo jet, a fleet of helicopters, or even a priceless painting across the planet.

It's also one of the strangest looking planes in the skies today.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9855286478996277}",positive,0.9855286478996277,1
Airbus wins record order from Indonesia's Lion Air - SKNVibes.com,"Sun, 17 Mar 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNrbnZpYmVzLmNvbS9uZXdzL25ld3NkZXRhaWxzLmNmbS83MTE5MtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"(Paris, FRA) - European aircraft maker Airbus on Monday announced a record order worth 18.4 billion euros ($23.8 billion) from the Indonesian company Lion Air for 234 medium-range A320 jets.

Lion Air, Indonesia's largest private carrier and one of the world's fastest growing airlines, is a new client for Airbus as it has previously been equipped almost exclusively by US rival Boeing.

French President Francois Hollande said a deal that he described as the biggest in the history of civil aviation would create 5,000 jobs in France over the next 10 years.

The agreement, hailed as ""historic"" by Hollande, was signed at the president's official residence, the Elysee Palace, by Airbus head Fabrice Bregier and his Lion Air counterpart Rusdi Kirana.

Lion Air is to buy 60 classic A320 planes. The rest of the contract involves the new, more fuel-efficient Neo version of the A320 series, which has a catalogue price tag of more than $100 million, though discounts are common for large orders.

According to the Elysee, the A320s currently under production will be delivered from next year while the Neos will be supplied from 2016.

""These are impressive figures which honour European industry and bear witness to the vitality of the Indonesian industry,"" Hollande said.

""Airbus is the pride of France and Europe. It is one of the pillars of our economy and directly employs 24,000 people,"" he said.

The news comes just days after Airbus unveiled an order potentially worth $15.5 billion from Turkish airlines for up to 117 planes. That order also centred on Airbus's best-selling, twin-engine A320 family.

Southeast Asia has emerged as one of the world's top market for medium haul planes as rising incomes and a burgeoning middle class have significantly boosted air travel.

Founded in 1999 by brothers Kusnan and Rusdi Kirana, who are ranked the 33rd richest Indonesians with collective wealth of $900 million, Lion Air is the country's first private airline.

Currently it operates a relatively modest 92 planes -- all Boeings except for one McDonnell Douglas -- which makes it number nine among regional carriers in terms of fleet size.

The company is however set to expand rapidly, having already ordered 230 Boeing 737s for $22.4 billion during US President Barack Obama's visit to Indonesia in 2011.

With some 240 million people, Indonesia is the world's fourth most populous nation and most far-flung archipelago with more than 17,000 islands scattered across 33 provinces. Air passenger numbers are currently growing at 20 percent per year.

Lion Air's 72 destinations are mostly in Indonesia, and the furthest it flies is to Saudi Arabia -- a route mostly packed with domestic workers and construction labourers. The company is banned from US and EU skies over safety fears.

In France, where economic stagnation has sent unemployment to record highs, Airbus is one of the few companies that continues to recruit in significant numbers.

In January, Bregier said the company would hire 3,000 people worldwide in 2013.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9704622626304626}",neutral,0.9704622626304626,0
SAA selects avionics supplier for new Airbus fleet - defenceWeb,"Thu, 28 Mar 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuY2V3ZWIuY28uemEvYWVyb3NwYWNlL2Flcm9zcGFjZS1hZXJvc3BhY2Uvc2FhLXNlbGVjdHMtYXZpb25pY3Mtc3VwcGxpZXItZm9yLW5ldy1haXJidXMtZmxlZXQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"South African Airways (SAA) has selected American avionic supplier Rockwell Collins to supply the full avionics suite and satellite communications equipment for its new Airbus A320 airliners which are due to be delivered later this year.

An order for 15 A320 passenger aircraft was placed by SAA with the European Airbus consortium in 2002, together with eleven of the smaller A319s and 15 of the larger A340 airliners. Deliveries were due to commence in 2010. While the latter two aircraft types have already been delivered, in 2004 SAA said it was cancelling the A320 part of the order, but Airbus never acknowledged the cancellation and continued to keep the order on its books.

In February this year it was reported that SAA had renegotiated its purchase agreement and that 20 new Airbus A320s would now be delivered. This will ensure that the 17 Boeing 737-800s operated by SAA and the four Boeing 737-800s operated by SAA low-cost subsidiary Mango will eventually be replaced by the A320s.

Rockwell Collins says the new aircraft will feature a full suite of Rockwell Collins’ communications, surveillance and navigation avionics. This includes the MultiScan Threat Detection System (a fully automatic airborne weather radar system), the GLU-925 Multi-Mode Receiver (a navigational system that incorporates signals from multiple types of navigational and landing systems into a single presentation) and the Iridium SATCOM satellite communications system.

Claude Alber, vice president and managing director, Europe, the Middle East and Africa for Rockwell Collins, says that “by selecting this package, South African Airways will benefit from our highly reliable, advanced avionics systems that enhance operations, and our world-class service and support.”

SAA also plans to retrofit the MultiScan weather radar to its current fleet of A319 aircraft.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9744218587875366}",neutral,0.9744218587875366,0

Air Pacific crew undergo Airbus training

More than 200 cabin crew of Air Pacific are getting up skilled to operate the new Airbus as final preparations are now being done before the arrival of the first A330 in two weeks.





According to Air Pacific the intensive training for 242 cabin crews will include both cabin safety for the new A330, and the refined service touches of the soon-to-be ‘Fiji Airways’ onboard experience.





More than 80 cabin crews have already attended the specialised A330 conversion training in Hong Kong at the Cathay Pacific Airways’ state-of-the-art training facility to ensure that crew are competent and confident in cabin safety and emergency procedures for the A330.





According to Air Pacific’s Cabin Crew Manager, Raelene Gibson safety is top priority and is the first step in the training program for their cabin crew who will operate the airline's incoming flagship aircraft.





The first A330 is expected to arrive in Nadi on March 19th following which all cabin crews will undergo a further one-day aircraft familiarisation programme to ensure they are fully conversant with its latest equipment and features.
