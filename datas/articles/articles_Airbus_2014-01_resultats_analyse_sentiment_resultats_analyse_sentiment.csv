A Hat Tip to SpaceX as Rebranded Airbus Defence and Space Takes Flight - SpaceNews,"Thu, 02 Jan 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS8zODg5MWEtaGF0LXRpcC10by1zcGFjZXgtYXMtcmVicmFuZGVkLWFpcmJ1cy1kZWZlbmNlLWFuZC1zcGFjZS10YWtlcy1mbGlnaHQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"MUNICH — Airbus Defence and Space, formerly named Astrium, rendered homage to its newest commercial launch competitor, Space Exploration Technologies Corp. (SpaceX), saying the Hawthorne, Calif., company has been able to retain a focus on cost efficiency without veering off into fascinating but unnecessary engineering challenges.

Company officials also described how it will use the reorganization inside the Airbus Group — the new name for the former EADS and Europe’s biggest aerospace company — to find synergies between the construction of Earth observation and telecommunications satellites, and between electronics components for military aircraft and for satellites, to improve profitability.

Airbus Defence and Space includes the former Astrium, Cassidian and Airbus Military divisions of Airbus Group.

In informal briefings here Dec. 18, conducted with the agreement that no company officials would be named, company managers discussed why they plan more workforce reductions and what they expect from their core European government customers.

One official said to expect Airbus Defence and Space to be much more aggressive on export markets despite the occasional disadvantage of working in euros as compared with U.S. dollars.

“We will not lose on price,” promised this official. “We’ll get our costs down to competitive levels and we will not lose on price. We’ll win on performance.”

How that promise will work into the company’s portfolio is unclear. The remarks came the same day the Brazilian government selected Sweden’s lower-cost Grippen fighter jet over Airbus’ Eurofighter.

Countering the negative effect of the euro, an official said, is the fact that some nations currently would prefer not to conduct defense and space business with U.S. contractors. “This can certainly play to our advantage in the current environment,” the official said.

The hat tip to SpaceX, which on Dec. 4 successfully launched its first mission for a large commercial satellite fleet operator, SES of Luxembourg, was perhaps the most surprising of the comments.

“They have been able to work on industrialization of the Falcon rocket without being waylaid by development issues,” said one Airbus official, whose company is prime contractor for Europe’s Ariane 5 rocket.

“They needed nine times the power of their Merlin 1D engine for their intended markets. In Europe we would have attacked the issue with a beautiful [research and development] program, costing hundreds of millions, to develop an engine with nine times the power. What did SpaceX do? They put nine Merlin engines on the Falcon 9 first stage. The result: Problem solved.”

An official said Airbus Defence and Space sent two of its best engineers to SpaceX sometime back to take a close look at the Hawthorne operation and to return with an assessment of whether the SpaceX way of business withstood harsh scrutiny.

“They came back and told us: ‘Yes, they’re going to do it,’” said one official. “When you consider who these guys were — one was our former chief technical officer, Robert Laine — we pretty much knew then what to expect.”

Airbus Defence and Space’s Space Systems division is under pressure to design a next-generation Ariane 6 rocket that can be manufactured and launched for 70 million euros ($96 million) while carrying a satellite weighing between 3,000 and around 6,500 kilograms.

The vehicle’s basic design will not be as difficult a challenge as reorganizing the current Ariane 5 industrial landscape, including dozens of companies in a dozen European nations, to meet the cost objective.

“It’s a difficult issue,” one Airbus official said. “We need to redesign the entire Ariane ecosystem of companies that build Ariane and reduce the number of companies that are involved. It’s the only way to reduce costs and fend off SpaceX and others.”

As a satellite and space-component manufacturer, Airbus Defence and Space currently has a 60 percent share of the business contracted by the 20-nation European Space Agency (ESA), company officials said.

Keeping that market share will not be easy given the heightened competition to come from space-budget stagnation in France and minimal growth in Germany, Europe’s two biggest space powers.

Airbus’ predominant share of the fast-growing British space market is coming under attack as competitors set up divisions in Britain to capture a share of the increased spending.

Airbus Defence and Space will also have to contend with the fact that the two most profitable divisions of the former Astrium — services and components — have been moved outside the Space Systems business.

Astrium Services is now inside Airbus Defence and Space’s Communications, Intelligence and Security division, managed by Evert Dudok, who was chief executive of Astrium Services.

The space components business is now housed in the Electronics division, headed by Thomas Mueller.

Francois Auque, previously chief executive of all Astrium businesses, is heading the Space Systems business, which builds satellites.

Airbus managers have said the reorganization will remove 2,470 posts from the former Astrium business by the end of 2016 in an attempt to the increase profitability of a business that is not growing. Even without the reorganization inside Airbus, Astrium would have been forced to reduced staff to remain competitive, they said.

“We don’t make a lot of money in satellites,” one official said. “Nobody else does either. Our competitors make a few points of EBIT [pretax profit], but they’re certainly not at 10 percent.” Combining certain now-separate processes for making rockets and satellites is one avenue to be pursued, as is a hunt for synergies between rocket and satellite construction.

The Electronics division is expected to cut costs as well.

“Sensor fusion is a big opportunity for us,” one official said of the Electronics division. “One example: transmit/receive modules for radar systems are very similar, depending on how far up the production line you go. You’ve got Eurofighter radars, radars we make for the U.S. Navy, and radars for our TerraSAR Earth observation satellite design. All have common elements.”

"Airbus sets new records in orders, deliveries and backlog - Airbus","Mon, 13 Jan 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxNC0wMS1haXJidXMtc2V0cy1uZXctcmVjb3Jkcy1pbi1vcmRlcnMtZGVsaXZlcmllcy1hbmQtYmFja2xvZ9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Market lead in widebody and single aisle aircraft

Airbus exceeded commercial targets in 2013, achieving a new record of 626 aircraft deliveries (493 A320 Family aircraft, 108 A330, 25 A380) to 93 customers (15 new) and a new industry record of 1619 gross orders (377 A320ceo, 876 A320neo, 77 A330, 239 A350 XWB, 50 A380) beating the previous record in 2011 by 11 aircraft.

The year was also Airbus’ most valuable gross order intake (List price US$ 240.5 billion). By year end, the backlog had climbed to an industry wide record of 5,559 aircraft, valued at US$ 809 billion at list prices, or eight years production.

Aircraft deliveries in 2013 were up for the 12th year in a row, beating the initial target and surpassing the previous record set in 2012 (588) by an additional 38 aircraft.

At 2013 year end, Airbus commanded 51 per cent gross market share (aircraft above 100 seats). Decisions by customers to move towards larger aircraft in all segments (A321, A330-300, A350-1000 and A380) is having a positive result on revenues, complementing Airbus’ lead in both single aisle and widebody aircraft markets.

During the year the A320neo surpassed 2,600 orders while strong sales of the A320ceo continued with more than 1,000 sold since the NEO was launched. The A350 XWB had significant commercial breakthroughs especially with a first order from Japan, and the A380 coninued to dominate the Very Large Aircraft market with 50 new orders.

Signalling Airbus’ successful transformation to a more agile company, 2013 was also notable for the A350 XWB first flight. Test flights are progressing well with two aircraft having accomplished over 800 flight hours. Certification is targeted for Q3 and Entry Into Service for Q4 2014. The A330 new longer range and regional variants were launched, A330 production reached a new record high of rate 10 per month and single aisle remained stable at rate 42.

In 2013, Airbus Military delivered 31 aircraft including seven A330 MRTT and two A400M for the French Air Force, confirming the programme is well back on track.

Airbus hired some 3,000 people in 2013.

“I thank the Airbus teams for these great achievements. The transformation of our company into a simpler, more agile and faster one is clearly taking shape. We are producing aircraft at all-time-highs and selling our market leading products at record levels,” said Fabrice Bregier, Airbus President and CEO. “These benchmark results are feeding nicely into our profitability targets, and I am proud to report that the trajectory is showing strongly upwards. To expand our leadership in single aisles and widebodies, 2014 will be significant with the first flight of the A320neo and the Entry Into Service of the A350 XWB.”","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 1.0}",positive,1.0,1
"Boeing, Airbus share honours in 2013 orders/deliveries race - but it's not about winners and losers | CAPA - CAPA - Centre for Aviation","Thu, 16 Jan 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFodHRwczovL2NlbnRyZWZvcmF2aWF0aW9uLmNvbS9hbmFseXNpcy9yZXBvcnRzL2JvZWluZy1haXJidXMtc2hhcmUtaG9ub3Vycy1pbi0yMDEzLW9yZGVyc2RlbGl2ZXJpZXMtcmFjZS0tLWJ1dC1pdHMtbm90LWFib3V0LXdpbm5lcnMtYW5kLWxvc2Vycy0xNDc5NDnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Both manufacturers had very strong finishes to the year. Airbus booked 211 firm orders in Dec-2013 alone. It announced orders for 100 A320s from an undisclosed customer and 20 from another undisclosed buyer, as well as 25 A330s from AirAsia X, 50 A380s from Emirates, six A350s from Air Caraibes and seven A320s from Turkish Airlines.

Airbus also cancelled five A380 orders and five A350 orders from the terminally ill Kingfisher Airlines, as well as 12 A320s from United Continental.

Boeing booked 319 orders in the same month. Like Airbus, it booked a considerable number of orders from undisclosed customers - in Boeing's case 174 aircraft, comprising 49 773 MAX aircraft from five buyers, 132 737NGs, also from five different buyers, two 747-8s from another buyer and a single 777-300ER from an unidentified customer.

Given the level of ordering and deliveries, the ""winners"" and ""losers"" storyline being played out in most of the major media outlets over the annual competition between the two manufacturers is beside the point.

The real point is that 2013 has been a staggeringly successful year for both companies and their sales teams.

Airbus and Boeing commercial aircraft deliveries: 2004 to 2013

Just five years ago, combined Airbus and Boeing deliveries were 979 aircraft. Ten years ago, combined annual deliveries were 605. So, in a matter of a decade, both manufacturers have more than doubled the amount of aircraft. This is, by any measure, a victory for both of them and their supply chains.

Market shares have settled at near-50:50

The difference between the two manufacturers in terms of raw numbers is a matter of a few percentage points, as it has been for most of the past decade. Last year Airbus and Boeing delivered almost 1,300 aircraft between them.

Airbus and Boeing net order share: 1995-2013

Narrowbodies - for expansion and replacement - are driving numbers

Output from the manufacturers is set to grow again in 2014, with Airbus and Boeing each planning to continue their incremental build-up in reaction to market demand.

The chief vehicles of the vastly increased delivery levels are the A320 and 737 narrowbody families. Both manufacturers are churning out their staple aircraft at a rate of around 40 aircraft per month - and further increases are looming.

In Oct-2013, Boeing announced that it would increase production on the 737 from 38 to 47 aircraft per month in 2017, the highest rate ever for the programme. Once implemented, the 737 programme will build more than 560 aircraft per year (nearly equivalent to total Boeing production of all aircraft in 2012), an increase in output of nearly 50% since 2010. Boeing plans for 737 production to hit 42 aircraft per month during 1H2014, matching output levels at Airbus.

Airbus' intention is to remain at this production level for 2014 and to transition from A320ceo (current engine option) to A320neo production at that rate. However, at the company's orders/deliveries announcement, Airbus executive vice president for programmes Tom Williams said A320 production could be raised to 44 or 46 aircraft per month, and output of the A320neo had the potential to go as high as 50 aircraft per month beyond 2018 or 2019. In 2012, Airbus stepped back from plans to raise A320 output to 44 per month.

Widebody aircraft production is also surging

The high value and high margin widebody aircraft are also seeing surging production. The A330 and 777 production lines are at record rates, of 10 and 8.3 aircraft per month, respectively. Boeing plans to raise 787 output to 10 aircraft by early 2014, almost doubling production over 2013, before raising output to 12 aircraft per month by 2016.

If all goes well for the A350, Airbus will begin delivering aircraft in 4Q2014 and plans to be producing 10 aircraft per month by 2018.

Airbus Production rate and development plans A320 42 per month, static for 2014 A330 10 per month, static for 2014 A350 Production underway, first delivery 4Q2014, output to reach 10 per month by 2018 A380 2 per month, increase in 2015 to around 2.5 per month Boeing Production rate and development plans 737NG 38 per month as of Oct-2013, increasing to 42 per month by 1H2014, 47 per month by 2017 767 2 per month, commercial backlog of 49, line to be supplanted by KC-46A military tanker aircraft at rate of up to 1.5 aircraft per month 777 8.3 per month, static for 2014 787 10 per month, increasing to 12 per month by 2016, 14 per month by 2020 747-8 1.5 per month through 2015

Aggregated, order backlogs are at record levels

After taking nearly 2,800 firm orders for the year between them, both Airbus and Boeing are also sporting record firm order backlogs. Airbus has orders for 5,559 aircraft, representing eight-plus years of sustained production. Boeing has 5,080 unfilled orders in its backlog.

Unsurprisingly, narrowbody aircraft dominate the order books, with combined orders for almost 8,000 aircraft between the two manufacturers, representing around 75% of all orders. New generation widebodies such as the 787 and the A350, account for 1,728 aircraft, around 16% of orders.

Not all aircraft types are finding favour with airline customers.

The market for the large four engine widebodies - the A380 and 747-8 - remains weak, despite some recent order successes. Boeing won 17 orders from five customers for the 747-8, although it lost five orders through cancellations for the year. Airbus won a firm order for 50 A380s from Emirates in Dec-2013, although it lost eight A380 orders in 2013, due to cancellations.

ATR, Bombardier, Embraer all had good years too

On top of the success at Airbus and Boeing, the western regional aircraft manufacturers - ATR, Bombardier and Embraer - continue to add their contributions to global airline fleets, albeit on a significantly smaller scale. Although ATR and Bombardier have yet to report their full-year tallies, the smaller manufacturers are projected to have delivered somewhere around 225 to 230 commercial airliners in 2013. The three of them have also recorded orders for better than 500 aircraft.

Embraer delivered 90 aircraft over 2013, after Embraer Commercial Aviation CEO Paulo Cesar de Souza e Silva set a target of 90 to 95 deliveries. The company had a particularly strong final quarter effort, delivering 32 commercial aircraft over the final three months of the year.

Embraer also enjoyed significant sales success in 2013, notably boosted by the launch of the second generation E-Jets aircraft programme (E-Jets E2), the first of which is slated to enter service in 2018. It logged 150 firm orders for the update to its E-Jets family, in addition to more than 180 orders for its current-generation E-Jets aircraft. There are another 215 E-Jets E2 commitments from six customers, mostly unidentified, waiting to be converted into firm orders. The company finished 2013 with a firm order backlog of 429 aircraft, almost five years of production at current rates.

Bombardier has reported 34 commercial aircraft deliveries (19 Q400 turboprops and 15 CRJ regional jets) for the nine months to the end of Sep-2013, matching its 2012 levels. As with Embraer, the final quarter of the year is traditionally a strong one for deliveries for Bombardier. Earlier in 2013, the Canadian manufacturer forecast commercial deliveries for the year of 55 aircraft, compared with the 50 aircraft delivered in 2012. Bombardier has recorded orders for more than 134 commercial aircraft this year, including 37 for its new CSeries aircraft.

Specialty turboprop manufacture ATR has forecast full-year deliveries of around 80 aircraft. This is a significant increase from the 64 delivered in 2012, already a record for the company. ATR has also experienced record ordering in 2013, noting the resurgence in demand for its aircraft due to fuel efficiency on certain missions. The company logged orders for 83 aircraft at the Jun-2013 Paris Air Show alone, securing its production slots until the end of 2016. It has already started 2014 in the same vein, logging an order for three ATR72-600s on 06-Jan-2014.

Fuel and growing travel create unprecedented demand and new strategies

Fuel prices have become an important driver of new aircraft demand. But unusually high traffic growth relative to GDP increases has also been a key ingredient.

Air travel demand has continued to grow, seemingly regardless of economic conditions and expectations of GDP/traffic growth correlations, with long-term projections of demand growing at better than 5% p/a. The past decade has witnessed the explosion of the Asia travel market, driven by China and the growth of low-cost airlines. Middle Eastern demand has taken off as well, while the North American and European markets have continued moderate growth, even in the face of economic uncertainly.

In addition to this, the new norm of high oil prices ensures demand for newer, more efficient aircraft. Prior to 2004, labour, not fuel costs, occupied the largest proportion of airline operating costs. Since then, the price of jet fuel has more than tripled and now accounts for almost a third of global airline costs.

In 2003, the average price airlines paid for fuel globally was USD28.80 per barrel. A decade later, it is USD124.60 per barrel. According to IATA, global airline fuel expenses have increased from USD44 billion in 2003 to USD210 billion in 2012. The rise in oil prices has fundamentally altered the economics of the airline industry.

Fuel as a percentage of global airline costs: 2003 to 2013

As a result, airlines are retiring older aircraft and seeking newer, more efficient replacements. Less efficient quad-jets, such as A340 and older 747s have seen their residual values plummet, with leasing companies like ILFC taking multi-billion dollar write downs on asset values in the last three years. Even newer aircraft, such as A320s, are seeing pressure on their lease rates and residual values, with more fuel efficient replacements set to enter the market over the next few years.

Manufacturers have taken advantage of the opportunity. Instead of betting their businesses on major new development programmes like the 787, A380 and A350, manufacturers are increasingly opting for a lower risk approach of re-developing existing airframes with new engines and other improvements. The strategy means manufacturers can deliver an enhanced product in a short time frame, while still offering double-digit enhancements to fuel burn and reductions in maintenance and operating costs that airlines seek to justify the purchase price.

The strategy has proven highly successful. The re-engined narrowbodies - the 737 MAX and A320neo - have won almost 4,400 orders between them. Boeing scored 259 orders for the 777X launched earlier this year. Even Embraer has seen the tactic pay off, with 150 firm orders and another 215 purchase commitments and options for their aircraft. Airbus has stated a re-engined A330 is an option, although not the only one for the family. Bombardier, bucking the trend with its all-new CSeries, has not yet seen similar success, with 182 firm orders for the aircraft in five years.

Neither Airbus nor Boeing expect a repeat of 2013 ordering levels in 2014. Both Airbus and Boeing sales teams are lamenting a lack of delivery slots, even as aircraft production is at a record pace. Most major carriers have weighed in with their orders and delivery slots for the most popular types are increasingly scarce.

More than 1,500 western-manufactured aircraft were delivered to commercial airlines in 2013, an unparalleled rate of expansion for global commercial airline fleets. If production rates at Airbus and Boeing rise as expected in 2014, global deliveries could top 1,600 for the year. Airbus intends to retake the number one delivery position from Boeing in four to five years time - giving Boeing a six to seven year stretch leading deliveries - by which time global aircraft deliveries could well be closing in on 2,000 aircraft per year.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9993999004364014}",positive,0.9993999004364014,1

Uniting all its activities under a single and strong brand, Airbus Group also renames two of its three Divisions. Going forward, the Group is home to:

Airbus, focusing on commercial aircraft activities;

Airbus Defence and Space, integrating the Group’s defence and space activities from Cassidian, Astrium, and Airbus Military;

Airbus Helicopters, comprising all commercial and military helicopter activities.

“For many years, Airbus has been a globally renowned synonym for technology breakthrough as well as aeronautic passion and pride,” said Airbus Group CEO Tom Enders. “Joining forces under the strong Airbus brand gives all our operations and employees the thrust and lift to capture global markets.”

Furthermore, the Group is launching procedures to change the legal form of its holding by 2015: Once renamed, Airbus Group N.V. shall turn into a European Company, Airbus Group SE (Societas Europaea) which will continue to be registered in the Netherlands.

“We are a pioneer for European industrial integration. It is a logical step and high time that our multinational culture is also mirrored in our legal structure,” said Enders. This legal conversion has no impact on the organization or operations of the Group.

Both the legal name change into Airbus Group N.V. and the conversion of the legal form into SE are subject to approval of the Annual General Meeting (AGM) of Shareholders: while adoption of the new name is expected at the AGM in May 2014, the legal conversion is targeted for approval in May 2015.

These steps complement the transformation process of the Group. In less than two years, the company has not only modernized its governance, broadened the shareholding structure, and united the Headquarters but also thoroughly overhauled its company strategy and launched the integration of the defence and space businesses.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9773297309875488}",neutral,0.9773297309875488,0

His successor will be Allan McArtor, currently chairman of Airbus Americas. In his new capacity, McArtor will be a member of the Airbus Group Executive Committee.

O’Keefe has elected to step down as chairman and CEO of Airbus Group, Inc in order to fully address ongoing medical issues due to injuries he sustained in a 2010 aircraft accident in Alaska. However, he will continue with the company on special assignment to oversee and facilitate the compliant transition of the company’s ongoing security agreement with the Department of Defense to the new U.S. Group structure.

“Sean has made significant contributions to the Airbus Group during his tenure as CEO of EADS North America, now Airbus Group, Inc. for which I am extremely grateful. These included leading the company during the tanker replacement competition, increasing our reputation with the U.S. Government and expanding our market presence in North America. I am pleased he stays with us for a while on special assignment and I wish him all the best for his medical recovery”, said Tom Enders, CEO of Airbus Group.

O’Keefe was appointed CEO of then EADS North America in November 2009. He assumed the additional responsibilities of chairman of the board in January, 2011.

At the same time, Enders welcomed Allan McArtor to his upcoming role as chairman and CEO of Airbus Group, Inc. “For nearly 13 years Allan has been a key member of the Airbus Americas senior leadership team and has served as its chairman during a period of significant growth and expansion.

Astronics To Acquire Test And Services Division From Airbus Group's U.S. Operations - Defense Daily Network,"Wed, 22 Jan 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZWZlbnNlZGFpbHkuY29tL2FzdHJvbmljcy10by1hY3F1aXJlLXRlc3QtYW5kLXNlcnZpY2VzLWRpdmlzaW9uLWZyb20tYWlyYnVzLWdyb3Vwcy11LXMtb3BlcmF0aW9ucy9idXNpbmVzcy1maW5hbmNpYWwv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Astronics [ATRO] on Tuesday said it has agreed to acquire the Test and Services (T&S) division of Airbus Group’s North America business for $53 million in cash, expanding its capabilities in the testing business and providing access to new markets.

The deal is expected to close in February and is subject to government approval.

The Airbus T&S business, which consists primarily of the acquisitions of Racal Instruments in 2004 and Talon Instruments in 2005, had sales of about $70 million in 2013 with expectations of about $100 million this year, Astronics said.

The T&S business of Airbus provides automatic test systems, subsystems and instruments for the semiconductor, consumer electronics, commercial aerospace and defense industries. More than half of the business was commercial in 2013 and that trend is expected to continue in 2015.

The T&S business has proven its ability to diversify into new markets, which is important given the lull in defense spending, Peter Gundermann, CEO of Astronics, said Tuesday on a conference call to discuss the pending acquisition. There is strong long-term potential in the test market despite recent difficulties, he said, adding that commercial aerospace represents just 10 to 15 percent of the business and is an area with strong growth potential.

Gundermann said that Astronics is good at the software side of the test business, the test program sets of automated tests, whereas the T&S business is stronger on the hardware side and automation side. Through the combination “we believe we can create a more formidable and a more capable competitor,” he said.

Astronics and T&S have already teamed to pursue business opportunities, Gundermann said.

Gundermann also said that the T&S business fits will with Astronics’ core capabilities in that it is technical and provides customized solutions for customers. Customers include large aerospace and defense companies like Boeing [BA], Britain’s BAE Systems, Lockheed Martin [LMT], Northrop Grumman [NOC], Rockwell Collins [COL], Honeywell [HON], France’s Thales, and United Technologies Corp. [UTX].

Astronics said the deal also includes a $10 million working capital adjustment. The California-based T&S business has 210 employees.

Airbus Group’s financial adviser on the deal was Houlihan Lokey.

Europe-based Airbus Group said that the sale of T&S is part of its effort to focus on its core businesses as it reorganizes. Airbus Group changed its name at the beginning of this year from the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Co.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9997463822364807}",positive,0.9997463822364807,1

By Alwyn Scott

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The head of Lufthansa said the German airline plans to begin flying Airbus(AIR.PA) A380 superjumbo jets on routes to India later this year.

On Monday, India lifted a ban on landing the aircraft in the country, enabling carriers such as Singapore Airlines, Lufthansa and Emirates airline to fly the jets into the world's second-most populous nation.

Lufthansa had earlier said it had no immediate plans to use the jet on those routes.

""We are interested to use the A380 also for the major Indian markets,"" Christoph Franz, CEO of Deutsche Lufthansa AG (GER:LHA.DE - News), said on Wednesday in an interview in the Reuters Global Markets Forum, an online community for financial professionals.

Franz said Lufthansa definitely planned to use the jet in India but noted the launch would be later in the year, since its fleet of 10 A380s is already committed by current schedules.

He said it was possible for the summer schedule, but added, ""We will likely make it for the winter flight schedule of 2014-2015"".

Under India's rules, A380s will be allowed to land at the country's four main airports - New Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore and Hyderabad - which are equipped to handle the planes.

India's decision was welcomed by foreign carriers aiming to tap India's fast-growing air travel sector.

The A380 can carry more than 800 passengers in a single-class configuration, and the government had banned their use because of concern that foreign airlines would dominate the market for international travel.

A pilot on the A320 Airbus reported the near miss to air traffic controllers, prompting an investigation. However, no one has been able to identify the object.

The aircraft was cruising at 34,000ft, around 20 miles west of Heathrow Airport, over the Berkshire countryside, when the captain spotted the object out of a left-hand side cockpit window.

It was said to be ""cigar/rugby ball like"" in shape, bright silver and ""metallic"" and travelling towards the jet. The pilot said he felt certain it was going to crash into his aircraft and ducked as it headed towards him, but it did not appear to make impact. He told investigators he believed the object passed ""within a few feet"" above the jet.

The sighting occurred in daylight, at around 6.35pm on 13 July last year"". It has only emerged now, following publication of the report, which concluded it was ""not possible to trace the object or determine the likely cause of the sighting"". The incident was investigated by the UK Airprox Board, which studies ""near misses"" involving aircraft in British airspace. It ruled out other aircraft, meteorological balloons, toy balloons and military objects.

The report does not name the airline or flight involved, but the Daily Telegraph says the aircraft was likely to have been travelling between a regional UK airport and another in Europe. The A320 Airbus typically carries around 150 passengers.

Aviation staff detect around one unexplained flying object every month, according to figures from the National Air Traffic Control Services in 2012. The Ministry of Defence closed its UFO desk in December 2009, after which the Civil Aviation Authority decided to look into such reports from aircrew and air traffic controllers.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999604225158691}",neutral,0.9999604225158691,0

The partnership started in 2010 with other partners, and primarily focuses on further increase of the proportion of thermoplastic composites in current aircraft.

The latest TAPAS 2 agreement will now run until the end of 2017 with a budget of €24.3m. The Netherlands Ministry of Economic Affairs is funding the ongoing partnership with a loan of €9.5m.

The agreement includes development of a trial tail section made entirely of thermoplastic composite material.

A thermoplastic fuselage panel was produced and presented as demonstrator under TAPAS 1 agreement.



Thermoplastic composites enable efficient processing in production, lower costs of structural components as well as a high-level of fire safety, while allowing for about 15% weight savings, compared to traditional aircraft materials.

""The agreement includes development of a trial tail section made entirely of thermoplastic composite material.""

In addition, the high-strength, lightweight composites lower fuel consumption, and increase the range and capacity of the aircraft.

TAPAS consortium includes companies and knowledge institutes in the Dutch aerospace industry that work together with Airbus on the development of thermoplastic composite applications in aircraft fuselages, wings and tail sections.

The TAPAS partners from Dutch SMEs include Airborne Composites, KVE, DTC, KE-works and CODET.

The Netherlands National Aerospace Laboratory (NLR), Delft University of Technology and the University of Twente are the Dutch knowledge partners in the programme.

The many ways to add more aircraft seats - Runway Girl Network,"Thu, 09 Jan 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTQvMDEvdGhlLW1hbnktd2F5cy10by1hZGQtbW9yZS1haXJjcmFmdC1zZWF0cy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Aircraft interiors experts have put on their thinking caps to consider more space saving initiatives now that Airbus intends to increase the maximum seat-count on its A320 to meet the seemingly insatiable desire of airlines for high-density seating.

Airbus chief executive Fabrice Bregier recently revealed that the airframer plans to ultimately raise seat-count from 180 to 189 seats, as originally reported by Flightglobal. The A320 is certified at 180 seats, but Bregier believes a 189-seater will prove particularly appealing to the low-cost sector. And aren’t nearly all airlines “low-cost” nowadays? Ahem.

Bombardier, of course, is in the same “frame” of mind, announcing last year that it will offer a 160-seat version of its CSeries CS300 by pitching slimline seats at 28 inches and adding a second pair of over-wing exit doors to clear certification hurdles. The Canadian airframer also recently announced it will launch an extra-capacity seating option for its Q400 turboprop “by converting the front right-hand side baggage door into an emergency exit door, eliminating the front baggage compartment and modifying the galley and wardrobe closet”, Aviation Week reported.

Certainly, Airbus could opt to take similar measures. Reducing galley space, and installing the new Airbus modular Smart-Lav could also make sense, particularly for customers like easyJet. But Airbus might be able to squeeze in an extra row if it pushes the bulkhead seats forward and installs airbags in the seat belts.

When conducting 16g testing of seats, a 5ft, 10in dummy is strapped into the seat, and “they arc the dummy and see where its head goes. If the head is within an inch of hitting the bulkhead it will pass, but an inch is the closest you can get. But now with airbags, you don’t arc at all, you stop. So that allows you to pitch the front row seats much closer to the bulkhead, and you could get an extra row of seats in the plane”, explains an interiors insider.

Delta Air Lines’ new Boeing 737-900ER aircraft, which feature B/E Aerospace’s new modular lavatory and Pinnacle economy-class seats, is understood to have been certified in this fashion. Delta yesterday announced it will retrofit 225 narrowbodies – its Boeing 757-200s, 737-800s, Airbus A319s and A320s – with a variety of new cabin features, including Pinnacle seats. At the same time, Delta is adding more rows of economy seats on more than 150 aircraft of these aircraft: three extra rows on the 757s and one extra on the Airbus. The carrier could not provide immediate comment on whether it is adding airbags at the bulkhead seats.

B/E Aerospace corporate VP strategy & marketing Paul-Ernest Cheron says, “As you know, we do not manufacture seat belts; this innovation has been brought to the market through business class and now expanded into the coach environment. And yet we do leverage [it] to expand the number of seats you can put in the restrained space you get in the environment.” He adds that airbags in seat belts simply let you “optimize the LOPAs [layout of passenger accommodations] in the coach environment”.

What about installing airbags on the actual bulkhead? Well, we know that Zodiac has designed an integrated airbag system installed directly into galleys – a first in aircraft galley history, according to the firm (see picture above).

Explaining the design, as part of its Crystal Cabin Award entry, Zodiac says, “The airbags act as an energy absorber for head impact for front row passengers. When airbags are installed in seat belts, certification must be completed every time seats are changed and airbags installed in seat belts are bulky and uncomfortable. When airbags are fully integrated into front row monuments (galleys), certification is only required one time.

“The airbag system can reduce the distance between the galley and front row seats by a minimum of four (4) inches. This space saving in combination with the other layout changes will allow additional pitch and potentially an additional seat row. Airlines are desirous of more space saving. Having a galley with integrated airbags allows the airlines to reach this ultimate goal of adding additional seats without compromising their passenger safety and comfort.”

Meanwhile, Airbus is also developing a new interior for the A320, complete with pivot overhead bin to accommodate more luggage. The design will starkly contrast to the A320’s current, dated interior, with its angular fixed overhead bins and segmented ceiling panels.

“The concept is brilliant. It’s the same as Zodiac’s ISIS, except the difference is ISIS is on prototype #20 versus Airbus’ prototype #1. Airbus will get there in time,” says a source with knowledge of the design.

Airbus declines to comment on where development now stands, with a spokesman saying, “Nothing has been launched and there is no timeline. I can only say what we’re doing or not doing.”

He adds, “Airbus is hard at work on lots and lots of things all the time but that is just part of business as usual. We’re always looking at things. We know what pivoting bins are. We have them on the A380 and have fixed bins on the A380, and one doesn’t replace the other; it depends on what the market needs and wants.”

A Zodiac executive could not be immediately reached for comment.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9548775553703308}",neutral,0.9548775553703308,0

Airbus cancels Kingfisher aircraft orders | Mint - Mint,"Tue, 14 Jan 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVtaW50LmNvbS9Db21wYW5pZXMvQkozTElWcWFDNENFSVhSUlFRWGpwTy9BaXJidXMtY2FuY2Vscy1LaW5nZmlzaGVyLWFpcmNyYWZ0LW9yZGVycy5odG1s0gFyaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubGl2ZW1pbnQuY29tL0NvbXBhbmllcy9CSjNMSVZxYUM0Q0VJWFJSUVFYanBPL0FpcmJ1cy1jYW5jZWxzLUtpbmdmaXNoZXItYWlyY3JhZnQtb3JkZXJzLmh0bWw_ZmFjZXQ9YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"New Delhi: Airbus , the commercial arm of aerospace firm Airbus Group NV , has withdrawn orders for 10 jumbo A380 and A350 planes by grounded Kingfisher Airlines Ltd , the company’s global sales chief said on Monday.

The move comes as further embarrassment to Kingfisher, which had with much fanfare in 2005 placed an order for five superjumbo A380 aircraft—with the option to buy five more—and an identical number of A350 jumbos.

It was not immediately clear what will happen to the pre-delivery payments, the 1-5% of aircraft costs usually paid by airlines at the time of booking a firm order.

Kingfisher, owned by brewer UB Group, shut operations amid mounting losses in October 2012 but has orders that were booked in the years before the shutdown.

On Monday, Airbus global sales chief John Leahy said Vijay Mallya was still “determined"" to sell the airline but that Airbus had concluded that some of Kingfisher’s aircraft orders could be cancelled.

“The Kingfisher order—not all of it was cancelled, there are still some single aisles. Speaking with Vijay Mallya, he is still determined to sell the airline; he has an operating certificate. But even if he does sell the airline, we took the decision internally here that he probably does not need the A380s just right now so we are taking them out of the order book along with the A350s,"" Leahy said at a press briefing in Toulouse, France, that was telecast live.

The A350s are intercontinental jets.

Airbus, produced by a European multinational consortium, shows 117 orders for Kingfisher and its low-fare airline Kingfisher Red (earlier called Air Deccan) in its order book online. Of these, 25 have been delivered, it says, although none are operational. Delivery dates for the remaining 92 aircraft are not known. After the Monday announcement, the order size may shrink to 82. Airbus did not specify any numbers immediately in an emailed reply.

The A380 superjumbo costs nearly $300 million at list prices.

Kingfisher has till the end of this year to restart operations, under regulatory rules. If it doesn’t, its flying licence will lapse and it will have to apply for the licence again.

But restarting operations will be difficult. The Mumbai-based airline had accumulated losses of 16,023.46 crore as on 31 March and its net worth is a negative 12,919.82 crore. It hasn’t paid salaries to its staff for more than a year.

This month, Kingfisher employees resumed their stir for payment of 17 months’ salaries, staging protest marches and hunger strikes. Kingfisher has appealed to them to call off the demonstrations.

Kingfisher, however, said it continues to work towards resuming operations.

“We continue our efforts to recapitalize and restart Kingfisher. However, there are no plans to fly long haul and, hence, the cancellation,"" a Kingfisher spokesman said.

Kingfisher was the only airline in India to order the A380 planes, which were put on demonstration flights as early as 2007.

Do you remember the first time you flew? John Roberts can certainly recall his first time onboard an aircraft. “It would have been in 1970 on a Dan-Air BAC 111 from Gatwick to Basle,” he says. “I thought it was just magic.”

Roberts, chief engineer on the A380 superjumbo programme at Airbus, has subsequently kept records of every flight he has taken. These have included some rather unusual journeys on aircraft that had yet to enter service.

For instance he flew on the “third or fourth” flight of a redesigned Airbus A330-200, with refashioned wings, strengthened landing gear, and new wing skins. “We were out over the Pyrenees and they were doing stall testing. It was fabulous,” he says. “It comes back to the fact that you’ve helped to design this thing, and it’s doing what it’s supposed to. You get a kick out of that – and it’s a feeling I get today with the A380.”

Roberts, now in his late 50s, grew up in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, and was educated in Cheltenham. His grandfather was an engineer and had a workshop in the garage. From an early age, Roberts was fascinated by technology. The space race and innovations in the aviation industry in the 1960s held a special appeal.

“With the space programme, every few weeks there was something going on,” he recalls. “There was Concorde. The 747 was being built. I don’t think people today get that same vision.”

Roberts studied engineering at Brunel University in London and gained his initial work experience at Cheltenham’s then biggest engineering firm, the Dowty Group. Over the four years of his degree, he spent six months of each year in industry. He says this gave him a solid grounding in the realities of manufacturing and that there is a danger in looking at engineering too abstractly. “You could see that even when people started to transition into doing a lot of work in CAD, some became more remote from what things are actually like.

“I’ve noticed in the past few years that that has improved. But there was a period when people were stepping away from engineering. If you are going to be designing products, you have to have a real feel for it.”

Before joining Airbus, Roberts worked full-time at Dowty, where projects included introducing digital technology to aeroengines. He also worked on a contract to develop control equipment for Trafalgar-class submarines.

“That was a difficult project,” he recalls. “Nobody in the business wanted to do it. What I enjoyed about it was getting involved with the customer and explaining what you were going to do to make the thing work. That is one of the things I have always enjoyed in a job.”

Today, he says, airlines will come to him still if there is a problem. “I’d always encourage people coming through the business to take any opportunity to talk to airlines. Part of the challenge is understanding the reality of dealing with this stuff. If you’re in the engineering design office, there’s a danger of being a long way from the person who’s trying to get this airplane away at quarter to midnight.”

During his time in the aerospace industry, he has seen it expand in a way that was inconceivable when he was a youngster. “Heathrow was then a small provincial airport in terms of the amount of traffic,” he says. “If you think about the heyday of British aviation, making VC10s, the total production run was 50 or 60 – which is about the same number of aircraft Airbus makes each month now.”

Although only a relatively small number of VC10s were built, they proved durable, serving BOAC and other airlines from the 1960s to 1981. They were also used as strategic airlifters by the RAF, and ex-passenger models and others were used as aerial refuelling aircraft. The remaining two VC10 tankers made their final flights only in September last year. And during the life of the VC10, the industry completely changed.

Roberts says: “People forget the incredible growth there has been over my lifetime in commercial aviation. The fact that now people can afford to fly to places, and the sheer ease with which they can do it. In those days, if someone was flying, it was a big deal.”

The A380 is a modern-day big deal. The twin-deck superjumbo had to be squeezed into an 80m by 80m envelope – the maximum size at which a plane can be parked at an airport. The aircraft has a wingspan of just over 79m and is the world’s largest passenger airliner, with 40% more floor space than Boeing’s 747-8. The A380 can seat more than 840 people in an economy-class configuration. It entered commercial service just over six years ago.

A behemoth it may be but the pressure was on to slim it down as much as possible. “From an engineering point of view, a lot of the pressures in aerospace are environmental,” says Roberts. “The airline industry has made a commitment to reduce carbon emissions. It’s a socially responsible thing. But fuel is a huge part of running costs, so it is commercially sensitive, too. It is a win-win for the airlines. In the old days the drivers were about performance: you had to make the thing go further, faster.”





John Roberts

Roberts’ engineering teams worked to drive “every possible gram” out of the A380, partly through the use of advanced aluminium and composites. “If there’s 500 people on board, an extra kilo on each of them is half a tonne of payload. The A380 is clearly multiples of that,” he says. “Cutting weight and getting the fuel burn down, and therefore the cost of operating it, was the main driver.

“Making sure we had the right technology to get the weight down was no small achievement.”

Another focus was making the A380 quieter, he says. “The aircraft had to beat tough targets on noise. Heathrow has one of the toughest requirements in terms of approach and departure noise. We had to make sure the A380 could operate out of places like that easily. We also needed to make sure it was quiet on the inside and therefore compatible with the rest of the family.”

The engineers were aware that they were working on a potentially iconic project, so reliability and customer appeal were even more important than usual, he says. “The marketing guys and customers will be asking for the impossible – and the engineers will be in a panic.”

He adds: “It’s not an aeroplane you can hide if something happens. If you ask the public, aircraft are relatively similar in appearance – but the A380 is one that everyone recognises. That adds more pressure in terms of getting it right. It is a different aeroplane.”

Not everything has gone right. In the most serious incident involving Airbus’s new jet, the first A380 to be delivered to Australian airline Qantas experienced failure of one of its Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines on a flight over Indonesia in 2010. Although catastrophe was averted, the accident led to a row between Rolls-Royce and the airline, the withdrawal from service of some of the fleet, and modification of some Trent 900 engines. Rolls-Royce ultimately paid Qantas more than £60 million in compensation.

Airbus also discovered problems with some of the brackets used on the A380’s wings, after cracking was found as a direct result of the Qantas engine failure investigation.

Roberts says the Qantas blowout was “fascinating from an airframe point of view, but a frightening event”. “Designing an aeroplane for that event, dealing with an uncontained engine failure, is a fundamental requirement. That defines how fuel tanks are separated, how you separate wiring harnesses, and so on, but you can’t test it,” he says.

“When it happened, we had to look at the wing and understand exactly what had occurred, because we wanted to ensure all our modelling was right. And it turned out to be. The other bit that occurred is that we found these cracks, which could not be explained by the event. My view is that demonstrates how robust our processes are.” In short, the engine failure incident led to the discovery of a problem that might otherwise have gone unnoticed, he says.





Orders record: Airbus has clinched deals to sustain more than eight years of production

Airbus is retrofitting older A380s with more robust aluminium brackets on some ribs, and has included the design on all aircraft built since the first quarter of last year. The move is adding 90kg of additional weight, according to some reports. “If you look at why aviation is safer than it’s ever been, it’s because it learns from experience,” says Roberts.

Airbus has received more than 250 orders for the A380 and delivered 119 planes, most of which have gone to the airline Emirates. Roberts says aeroplanes are starting to creep up in size. “The number of people wanting to fly around the world is going up. The only way to fulfil that is to move more people at one time. If you look at the Asian market, which is where a lot of these aircraft are going, the number of people who want to fly is going up so rapidly that you have to use the A380 to satisfy demand.”

Roberts is clear that it is engineering that has allowed Airbus to flourish over the decades. “That’s what fundamentally makes the difference.” He looks for certain qualities in aeronautical engineers. “They need to have a passion for the subject,” he says. “They also need to understand that we are a safety-driven industry.

“If things go wrong, people will get hurt, so you have to have engineers who understand the consequences of what they are doing. I’m not saying other industries don’t have similar constraints, but this is a flying machine and you need to understand it.”

Does he still get involved in engineering at a practical level? “I get involved on the technical side still. I occasionally do sums, usually to make sure that I agree when somebody has told me the answer is ‘X’. Computers are very good at coming up with long answers; sometimes you have to make sure the first number is right.”

But he says he is careful not to control his engineering teams too closely: “You have to give people the opportunity to do things themselves. If nobody’s going to make a decision without coming to me, things aren’t going to work.”

At Airbus, he enjoys the interaction between experienced engineers and their counterparts in their twenties or thirties. “You need younger people in your business – the people who are challenging established ways of doing things. On the other side, you need people with experience, people who have had their fingers burnt on previous programmes. It’s a marriage of the two, and doing it without either side becoming dominant is the key skill.

“People in their twenties and thirties need to feel they are pushing the system a little bit. It’s how to do that in a controlled way that is key.”

He knows that he will in all likelihood not work on a new commercial aircraft programme for Airbus. “I’m 58, so in my working career there will not be another A380. But there will be evolutions.” For example, the A380 had a slight increase in take-off weight approved last year, so it can carry more cargo. There has also been a small change to its wing twist to improve aerodynamics. Meanwhile the A330, which came into service in 1994, is on its fourth major revision, adds Roberts. “I still think I’ve got the best job in the factory,” he says. “When you don’t get a kick out of work, it’s time to stop.”

Flying has opened up from being the preserve of the elite to being available to many, he says. “It has changed the way in which the world thinks. The fact that people can easily go and see what people are like in other parts of the world is an incredible change. That’s what aviation has done, and I get a kick out of it – although the challenges are different from what they were.”

In terms of engineering at Airbus, he adds: “The longer anybody spends doing a particular thing, the less likely they are to challenge whether they are doing it right.

“But innovation comes from anybody. Innovation is almost like a natural phenomenon but organisations can stop it. From good engineers, it’s natural.”





Taking shape: Roberts and his engineering team worked hard to keep the A380’s weight down

Europe’s challenge to the US giants

The origins of Airbus can be traced back to 1967, when ministers from the UK, Germany and France agreed, “for the purpose of strengthening European co-operation in aviation technology and promoting economic and technological progress, to take appropriate measures for the development and production of an airbus”.

In 1969 French transport minister Jean Chamant and German economics minister Karl Schiller signed an agreement to launch the A300, the world’s first twin-engine widebody passenger jet. At the time it was thought that only three-engine aircraft could safely serve long-range routes.

The A300 was to be built by a French-German consortium which would also involve the British and the Dutch, and the decision to give the go-ahead for the aircraft was the formal starting point for the Airbus programme. The A300’s first flight took place in 1972.

Today, Airbus employs 63,000 people at 16 sites in France, Germany, the UK and Spain. Final assembly is based in Toulouse, France; Hamburg, Germany; Seville, Spain; and, since 2009, Tianjin, China. Airbus has subsidiaries in the US, Japan, China and India.

Airbus has about half the global commercial aircraft market. The company was set up to provide a European answer to US giants such as Boeing, McDonnell Douglas and Lockheed. Development of the A380, the world’s largest passenger airliner, began in secret in the late 1980s as a direct challenge to the dominance of Boeing’s 747 in the jumbo jet market.

Airbus’s A320 was notable for being the first civilian jet to use a fly-by-wire control system. The aircraft has been a great commercial success, and has shortened derivatives in the A318 and A319, with some of the latter under construction for the corporate business jet market. A stretched version is known as the A321. The A320 family’s primary competitor is the Boeing 737.

The longer-range widebody products, the twin-jet A330 and the four-engine A340, have efficient wings, enhanced by winglets. The Airbus A340-500 has an operating range of 16,700km, the second-longest of any commercial jet after the Boeing 777-200LR.

Airbus is studying a replacement for the A320 series, tentatively dubbed New Short-Range aircraft. Those studies indicate a maximum fuel efficiency gain of 9-10%. The company has also opted to enhance the existing A320 design using new winglets and aerodynamic improvements. This enhanced A320 should have a fuel-efficiency improvement of 4-5%, shifting the launch of a replacement for the aircraft to at least 2017.

Boosted by new business announced during the Dubai air show, Airbus registered orders for 108 commercial jets last November – bringing its overall backlog to what it claimed was an industry record of more than 5,400 aircraft, representing eight-plus years of sustained production. Fifty eight aircraft were delivered in November, taking total deliveries for the first 11 months of 2013 to 562, for 90 customers. This was a 9% increase on the same period in 2012, said Airbus.

The company’s global market forecast for 2013-32 anticipates that air traffic will grow at 4.7% annually, requiring more than 29,220 new passenger aircraft and freighters at a value of nearly $4.4 trillion.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9997298121452332}",neutral,0.9997298121452332,0
"Airbus unveils new 2014 list prices after setting sales, delivery records in 2013 - Creamer Media's Mining Weekly","Fri, 24 Jan 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5taW5pbmd3ZWVrbHkuY29tL3ByaW50LXZlcnNpb24vYWlyYnVzLXNldHMtbmV3LWRlbGl2ZXJ5LWFuZC1ncm9zcy1vcmRlci1yZWNvcmRzLWluLTIwMTMtbmV3LWxpc3QtcHJpY2VzLWZvci0yMDE0LTIwMTQtMDEtMjTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"European airliner manufacturer Airbus, part of the larger aerospace and defence company, Airbus Group (previously EADS), announced last week that it had exceeded its commercial targets for last year. The company set new records in aircraft deliveries – 626 – and gross order intake value ($240.5-billion, using list prices). It also set a new industry record for the gross number of aircraft ordered (1 619) and reached another industry record of a 5 559 aircraft production backlog, amounting to eight years’ production and worth (using list prices) $809-billion.

“I thank the Airbus teams for these great achievements,” said company president and CEO Fabrice Bregier. “The transformation of our company into a simpler, more agile and faster one is clearly taking shape. “We are producing aircraft at all-time highs and selling our market-leading products at record levels. These benchmark results are feeding nicely into our profitability targets, and I am proud to report that the trajectory is showing strongly upwards. “To expand our leadership in single aisles and wide bodies, 2014 will be significant with the first flight of the A320neo and the entry into service of the A350 XWB.”

Airbus also announced that it had raised its list prices for its airliners by an average of 2.6%, with effect from January 1. The increment was calculated by the planemaker using its standard escalation formula, over the period January 2013 to January 2014. The list price is not necessarily identical with the actual price paid by an airline, as the latter depends on the degree of customisation specified, the selection of engines and design weights.

“Our new 2014 pricing reaffirms the unbeatable value of Airbus’s modern, fuel- efficient aircraft family,” stated company chief operating officer: customers John Leahy. “We see continuing strong demand in all aircraft-size categories as our reliable, efficient product line enables customers to grow their businesses profitably [and] please passengers, who will always favour the most comfortable cabin.”

In terms of deliveries, in 2013, Airbus handed over to 93 customers 493 A320-family aircraft, 108 A330s and 25 A380s – 15 of those customers were new. This was the twelfth year in succession that saw an increase in deliveries by the company. It also beat the previous record delivery year (2012) by 38 aircraft and exceeded Airbus’s original target for 2013.

In terms of gross orders, these comprised 377 A320ceo and 876 A320neo aeroplanes, 77 A330s, 239 A350 XWBs, and 50 A380s. This is 11 aircraft more than ordered in Airbus’s previous record year, 2011.



Airbus list prices start at $71.9-million for the A318, which is the company’s smallest airliner, rising to $85.8-million for the A319, $93.9-million for the A320 and $110.1-million for the A321. These aircraft are all members of the A320 family. The new engine option (neo) versions of this family have higher list prices than their current engine option counterparts. So the A319neo is listed at $94.4-million, the A320neo at $102.8-million and the A321neo at $120.5-million.

Regarding wide-body aircraft, the A330200 comes in at $221.7-million, the A330-200 freighter at $224.8-million and the A330300 at $245.6-million. The new-generation A350800 has a list price of $260.9-million, the A350900 $295.2-million and the A3501000 $340.7- million. The list price of the A380 Superjumbo is $414.4-million.

By the end of last year, Airbus had obtained a 51% gross market share of aircraft with more than 100 seats. Since its creation, the company has sold almost 14 000 aircraft to more than 360 customers, of which more than 8 000 have been delivered. Also during 2013, Airbus Military delivered 31 aircraft, including the first two production A400M airlifters and seven A300 multirole tanker transports.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.999996542930603}",positive,0.999996542930603,1
China flies first Airbus A380 superjumbo - APAC Outlook Magazine,"Wed, 15 Jan 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFwYWNvdXRsb29rbWFnLmNvbS9pbmR1c3RyeS1pbnNpZ2h0cy9hcnRpY2xlLzIyNy1jaGluYS1mbGllcy1maXJzdC1haXJidXMtYTM4MC1zdXBlcmp1bWJv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"An Airbus A380 jet touched down at Guangzhou Baiyun Airport on Monday, marking the superjumbo jet’s first commercial flight in China.

Departing Beijing for the southern city of Guangzhou at 10:00 a.m., the fully-loaded flight landed around 1:00 p.m. with more than 500 passengers aboard, including Chinese basketball player Yao Ming and mayor of Guangzhou Wan Qingliang.

“Flying on board the first A380 in our country is really different. I felt exceptionally comfortable, while the space available on other jets is quite narrow for me,” said Yao who used to play with the U.S. Houston Rockets.

Many passengers snapped pictures of the plane, with some saying that they booked tickets well in advance because they were eager to fly on a new jet.

“I am so excited. My camera never left my hand,” said passenger Zhou Xiaofei.

“The performance of the A380 is extraordinary. I felt more comfortable when piloting the plane,” said Liu Xian, vice general manager with the China Southern Airlines, the operator of the superjumbo.

The A380 jumbo is scheduled to fly between Beijing and Guangzhou until Oct. 26 and then travel between Beijing and Shanghai from Oct. 27 to 29. And then it will be used on an international route afterwards.

China’s domestic air travel market is predicted to grow 13.9 percent annually by 2014 and transport 379 million domestic air travel passengers, which will make the country the world’s second-largest air travel market after the United States, according to a report released by the International Air Transport Association.

The purchase of an A380 jet is part of China’s efforts to accommodate surging air travel demands unleashed by the country’s economic boom.

Li Jiaxiang, chief of China’s civil aviation administration, estimated that over 1.5 trillion yuan (235 billion U.S. dollars) will be invested in the civil aviation industry by 2015, adding about 2,000 aircraft to the country’s fleet.

But industry insiders said China’s civil aviation needs to improve while expanding. Civilian flights have long been plagued by constant delays, which the administration attributed to crowded air space as well as poor coordination between airlines and airports.

Airport management may also curb the growth of civil aviation. China plans to build 45 new airports by 2015, although more than 75 percent of its current 175 airports suffered from deficits in 2010, according to the administration. – Xinhua

For years Iqaluit has marketed itself as a premier cold-weather testing ground for aerospace companies. Last June the City of Iqaluit sent a delegation to the Paris Air Show.

Eric Leuthold, owner of Frobisher Bay Touchdown Services, which offers logistic support to companies that test their aircraft in the capital, was part of the delegation.

""It's absolutely worth the money,"" said Leuthold of the trip. ""It is a big investment to go to a show like that but that's the only place where you will get everybody you'll need to talk to in one giant, giant location.""

Iqaluit's airport landing fees are minimal but the economic spin-offs in town are significant.

With a French crew of 48 aboard the jet, cold weather testing results in cold hard cash.

City councillor Mark Morrissey, who is also executive director of Nunavut Economic Developers' Association, also went to Paris.

""This is new money to the territory; this is not recycled government money,"" he said. ""This is new money being put into the community from outside the country so it's really good.""

Last year, Airbus brought the A350's engine to Iqaluit for cold weather testing. It also tested its A380 aircraft in Iqaluit in 2006.

Testing is expected to continue until mid-week.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999105930328369}",neutral,0.9999105930328369,0

The first flight took place at the Manching Military Air Systems Center, north of Munich, and involved Instrumented Production Aircraft 7 (IPA7), flown by Eurofighter Project Pilot Chris Worning.

Taurus KEPD 350 is a German/Swedish missile that is manufactured by Taurus Systems GmbH, a partnership between MBDA Germany and Saab Dynamics. The missile has a range of +500 kilometres (300 mi), a speed of Mach 0.8-0.9 and stealth features.

The first flight came after the successful ground tests and taxi tests; the flying activities, taking place within the Storm Shadow integration program, will focus on flutter tests, air data system large store interference assessment and aerodynamic data gathering.

According to Airbus Defense and Space (a newly formed division of Airbus Group combining the business activities of Cassidian, Astrium and Airbus Military) concurrent testing of the two similar missiles “optimises the Storm Shadow integration and facilitates the future airframe integration of Taurus.”

Airbus increased its catalogue prices for aircraft by 2.6 per cent as of January 1. Ramping up A320 Bregier said that the company was considering increasing production of its best-selling plane, the Airbus A320 which is popular with low-cost airlines, to satisfy global demand for medium-range aircraft. ""If the market remains positive, if the customer needs more aircraft, I think we would be silly not to ramp up again,"" he told journalists.

Airbus is producing 42 A320 aircraft per month and had previously said that it did not want to increase this rate of production until it had converted to producing the latest, more fuel-efficient version, the A320neo. The first A320neo is due to be delivered in 2015. With the passenger air traffic growing by five per cent per year and greater fuel economy promised by the A320neo and new versions of Boeing aircraft, there has been strong demand from airlines to update their fleets. ""We believe there is a potential to go higher than (the) rate 42. There is an upside and we are studying it. Some upside that we will confirm in the coming months,"" Bregier said. ""I would like to ramp up but be in a position to remain steady,"" he said. After 2018, ""when we have moved to the neo aircraft, we know that we will ramp up again, whatever we do now or not, we know that we will ramp up again.""

A source said that Airbus is looking at increasing output to 44 aircraft per month by the end of this year and to 46 by 2016. Airbus won orders for 377 A320 planes last year and has taken more than 1,000 orders since it announced at the end of 2010 the launch of the A320neo. Boeing plans to increase the rate of production of its 737, the competitor to the A320, from 42 per month currently to 47 in 2017, an unprecedented tempo. Airbus chief operating officer John Leahy said the company was also considering offering more fuel-efficient engines for its best-selling long-range aircraft, the A330, as a number of airlines including low-cost airline Air Asia has recently urged. Bregier said no new engines were currently being offered to clients, and even without them updates being made to the plane would keep it competitive.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9947019219398499}",positive,0.9947019219398499,1

""The A380 is the most fuel efficient aircraft with the lowest operating cost per seat,"" said Kiran Rao, executive vice-president, Airbus. Emirates said it ""looked forward to serving Indian travellers with our flagship aircraft in the near future.""

""Singapore Airlines will evaluate the commercial viability of this recent development,"" said its general manager (India), David Lau.

""The ban on A380s was imposed due to concerns that foreign airlines could grab a high share of international traffic, hurting Air India and Jet Airways. But Jet’s opposition came down after its deal with Etihad, which has a number of A380s on order,"" an official said.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9986697435379028}",neutral,0.9986697435379028,0

Airbus posts record orders - Times of Malta,"Mon, 13 Jan 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vdGltZXNvZm1hbHRhLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL0FpcmJ1cy1wb3N0cy1yZWNvcmQtb3JkZXJzLjUwMjU2N9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus posted an industry record of 1,619 new airplane orders in 2013, pushing its backlog to almost nine years of production, and said it was examining the potential for a two-stage increase in production of its most popular jets.

The European planemaker reclaimed top spot in commercial orders from Boeing after repeatedly revising up its targets last year, but lost the delivery contest to its rival despite an internal record of 626 deliveries.

While booking more jets than ever in a year dominated by the launch of two new Boeing aircraft, Airbus revoked orders for its A380 and A350 jets from India’s Kingfisher Airlines, which has not been flying since 2012 due to cash shortages.

After adjusting for cancellations, Airbus total net orders rose 80 per cent from the previous year to 1,503 aircraft.

Boeing closed the year with 1,531 gross orders, 1,355 net orders and a record total of 648 deliveries. It remained the world’s largest planemaker but lost the race for orders.

Airbus said it ended 2013 with an industry-wide record backlog of 5,559 aircraft worth $809 billion at list prices. Boeing’s backlog stood at 5,080 aircraft.

Buoyed by growth in emerging markets and the replacement of old fleets in the US, planemakers have been riding out the recession with ample orders, but are now shifting their attention towards producing the jets that they have sold.

Included in Airbus’s end-year figures was an order for 100 smaller jets from an unidentified customer. That mirrors a recent surge of anonymous orders at Boeing, which sources say reflects busy activity in China, despite its economic slowdown.

“We cannot continue at this level (of orders), but what we are doing is continuing to increase production,” said Airbus sales chief John Leahy.

Airbus produces 42 medium-haul A320 jets a month and Boeing recently announced plans to leapfrog its European rival by hiking Boeing 737 output from 38 a month to 47 by 2017. Both firms are upgrading these popular models to help save fuel. He did not say what production rate could be chosen or when it could be announced. Suppliers say they are being encouraged to think ahead to production rates as high as 52 per month.

Airbus has been hinting at possible production increases in recent months but Bregier’s comments give the strongest indication yet that it stands ready to fire up output of the A320, which is a key source of cash for other projects.

Leahy said the market could ultimately bear over 50 A320neo jets a month and as many as 14 A350 aircraft a month.

Airbus plans to produce 10 A350s a month by end-2018.

Airbus dropped its usual practice of predicting overall orders for the coming year, but Leahy said he expected they would at least keep pace with deliveries.

He did, however, commit to selling 30 A380s this year, after stagnant sales of the world’s largest passenger jet picked up in 2013 thanks to a surprise 50-plane order from biggest buyer Emirates. Net orders for the plane stood at 42.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9978973865509033}",positive,0.9978973865509033,1
Airbus crams Iqaluit cold-weather tests into one short weekend - Nunatsiaq News,"Mon, 27 Jan 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vbnVuYXRzaWFxLmNvbS9zdG9yaWVzL2FydGljbGUvNjU2NzRhaXJidXNfY3JhbXNfaXFhbHVpdF9jb2xkLXdlYXRoZXJfdGVzdHNfaW50b19zaG9ydF93ZWVrZW5kL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Test crew takes off after temperature rises, with blizzard not far behind

By PETER VARGA

Two full days of Arctic cold weather was all they needed, and that’s exactly what an Airbus test flight crew got in their short visit to Iqaluit, Jan. 24 to Jan. 26.

A crew from the France-based aircraft manufacturer cut short their intended five-day visit with their company’s newest passenger jetliner, the A350-900, on Jan. 26, when temperatures hit a balmy -18 C.

That was more than seven degrees too warm to continue any further, and the crew of 48 engineers, mechanics and test pilots had to pack up and return to base in Toulouse, France.

“If we stay one night we’re going to lose time,” flight operations manager Pedro Dias said at the start of an unseasonably mild Sunday afternoon.

“We have other flights to perform just after, so if we can save one day, it’s better to save it in Toulouse than in Iqaluit, because we’re not going to work.”

Warnings of an incoming blizzard, expected to hit Iqaluit in the next 12 hours, were not the deciding factor, Dias said.

Flight test engineers decided all mission objectives were covered by day three of the mission, after two full days of work at ideal temperatures measuring -25 and below.

“Things must have gone really well,” said Juan Solano of Honeywell, the principal project engineer for the plane’s air conditioning systems.

With that, the international crew gathered boxes and bag loads of equipment and personal effects at the airport’s forward base operation facility in the afternoon, and reloaded the plane for departure. And off they went, Europe-bound, at around 5:00 p.m.

The crew’s next round of tests, in about a week, takes them to Qatar for the opposite extreme: hot-weather testing.

The Iqaluit airport has hosted Airbus for aircraft cold-weather testing since the 1990s, when the city’s mayor John Graham served as airport manager.

“It’s routine. I have come to this place several times, and I like it,” said Dias. He recalled first meeting Graham 10 years earlier, on his first visit to Iqaluit.

“We’ve stayed in contact since then,” he said. As airport manager for more than 15 years, and as mayor last summer, Graham has worked to promote Iqaluit as the world’s “premier cold-weather test site.”

Iqaluit’s Arctic conditions are not the only reason Airbus comes to Nunavut’s capital for cold-weather testing.

The city happens to be under some of the world’s major flight tracks, including pathways from North America to Europe and the Northeast U.S. to Asia, which “can also reassure our customers,” Dias said.

“Because we’ve already come to this place to do our tests, they know in case of any problem they could have during a flight, they can land in Iqaluit, no problem.”

The airport’s 2.7-kilometre-long runway and the community’s hotels and regional hospital, with medevac services, make Iqaluit an ideal emergency stopping point, he said.

As in other test flights staged from Iqaluit, Airbus’s most recent one tested all the plane’s systems under extreme cold-weather conditions, on the ground and in the sky. The A350 pushes the boundaries on fuel efficiency with a light carbon-fibre body, greater aerodynamics and increased space for passengers, engineers said.

“The 350 is a next-generation” aircraft, said Solano.

“It’s the direct competitor of the Boeing 787,” Dias added, pointing to Airbus’s U.S.-based rival. In its finished form, the A350 will take on about 315 passengers for long-range travel between continents.

Seen from the outside, the plane on Iqaluit’s tarmac looked exactly like one passengers will ride in by the end of 2014, once all systems are fine-tuned, and orders from airlines start to fill up.

On the inside, though, the test model bristles with sensors, wiring and fuses that monitor everything from the engines and air conditioning, to electrical systems, hydraulics and doors. As test pilots run the plane on the ground and in the air, a group of nine crew members keep track of all systems in a “computer compartment” on board at any given time, with continuous support from a team of about 10 on the ground.

Engineers from suppliers of different systems — such as the plane’s Rolls Royce engines or Honeywell air conditioners — are part of the test team.

The plane must pass tests “in every extreme environmental condition around the world,” Dias said. Iqaluit’s cold-weather leg came two weeks after high-altitude tests in Bolivia.

“Coming to an extreme place means we can break anything,” Dias said. The crew carries complete spare parts with them for all systems, ready for replacement if anything breaks down. “We have no limitations, we just come and we see how the aircraft reacts.”

In fact, there are two limitations: tight timelines and sub-par weather conditions. Airbus’s three-day visit was the shortest one Dias has made to Iqaluit since his first, 10 years ago.

“Generally, we stay four or five days,” he said. Despite this, he was quick to add the mission was a success “for sure.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998863935470581}",neutral,0.9998863935470581,0

Mid-Canada Mod Center and Esterline CMC Electronics announce STC for upgraded FMS installations on Airbus A310 - Skies Magazine,"Wed, 15 Jan 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vc2tpZXNtYWcuY29tL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL21pZC1jYW5hZGEtbW9kLWNlbnRlci1hbmQtZXN0ZXJsaW5lLWNtYy1lbGVjdHJvbmljcy1hbm5vdW5jZS_SAWVodHRwczovL3NraWVzbWFnLmNvbS9wcmVzcy1yZWxlYXNlcy9taWQtY2FuYWRhLW1vZC1jZW50ZXItYW5kLWVzdGVybGluZS1jbWMtZWxlY3Ryb25pY3MtYW5ub3VuY2UvP2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Mid-Canada Mod Center (MC2), working in co-operation with Esterline CMC Electronics (CMC), are pleased to announce a new and significant FMS (Flight Management System) upgrade for the Airbus A310 aircraft fleet. The upgrade received a Supplemental Type Certificate (STC), from Transport Canada on Dec. 6, 2013. Joint development of this project has been several years in the making and has resulted in a STC modification that brings a much needed life extension to this “legacy” Airbus aircraft model.

The mod involves replacement of the dated, no longer supported avionics with an upgrade that is based around the Esterline CMC Electronics CMA-9000 FMS. This STC includes a suite of dual FMS and dual SBAS capable systems with GPS sensors. FMS components include two CMC CMA- 9000 FMS and two CMC CMA-5024 SBAS GPS Sensors with Antennas.

The CMA-9000 includes full-performance, coupled vertical navigation functionality, and the capability to fly all of the latest descents and approaches with significantly improved efficiency, control and annunciation. Its large, single navigation database allows global operations to significantly more destinations than the legacy FMS. Modern datalink capability is available as a service bulletin. CMC worked in cooperation with Mid-Canada Mod Center for the STC’d modification.

According to Jim Palmer, vice president, aviation products, Esterline CMC Electronics, “This FMS upgrade breathes new life into this legacy Airbus aircraft. The certification ushers in a new generation of airline FMS retrofits that bring operational efficiency and safety to aircraft, and many productive years of operation. It also marks the first time that an airline FMS was replaced with a more modern FMS, as an STC rather than an original equipment manufacturer program.”

Under the contract, Future Air Navigation (FANS-1) functionality will be added to the five aircraft. The FANS-1 functionality includes Airline Operational Communication (AOC) and Controller-Pilot Datalink Communications (CPDLC) functions via the CMA-9000 FMS in association with newly installed communication avionics.

The next phases of the program will include STCs for Polar Navigation capabilities and the installation of a FANS solution for the A310 fleet. These final two phases should be completed in 2014.

Polar Navigation will replace the existing dated and no longer supported Inertial Reference Sensors. The new generation units provide the aircraft with the capability to fly into areas of magnetic unreliability typically found north of latitudes 70N and south of 60S. Existing limitations related to autoland are also lifted with this solution.

The FANS portion of the project will equip the aircraft to fly FANS routes. This will be achieved by installing and certifying CPDLC (Controller Pilot Data Link Communications) equipment and interfacing the equipment to the newly installed FMS (Flight Management System).

The STC Approval for this project work was completed by Avionics Design Services of Midland Ontario.

In speaking about this mod, Bill Arsenault – VP of MC2 states, “We agreed with our client that this modification presented great value to the fleet of A310 aircraft as a whole and that working together, we could develop a solution. We are delighted to have achieved such a major milestone for them. Through a substantial team effort, using the dedicated resources and expertise of both CMC and MC2, we developed a mod that provides a great solution for the aging aircraft. Challenges such as this are a real opportunity to bring manufacturers and service/development specialists like us to collaborate and bring value to the aftermarket.”

This is the first certification of an upgraded flight management system on the Airbus A310-300 aircraft. The upgrade is being offered to other Airbus A310 and A300 aircraft flying globally. The DND FMS configuration shares a common core with the Esterline CMC Electronics’ FMS that has been certified for the Sukhoi SuperJet 100.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.986096203327179}",neutral,0.986096203327179,0

“Now, flights of A380 to India will be allowed to airports which are equipped to handle them,"" the aviation ministry said in a statement.

At present, only four Indian airports—Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad and Bangalore—have the infrastructure needed to handle A380 flights. The decision to lift the ban was taken after consulting with the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), the note said.

“The operation of A380s will help airports generate more revenue, give more comfortable and luxurious travel to passengers, liberalize the civil aviation milieu in India and boost the image of Indian civil aviation in the international market,"" the ministry said.

“As per available information, Singapore Airlines, Emirates and Lufthansa are interested in operating A380 aircraft in India on various international routes.""

The gigantic A380, which made its first flight in 2005 and entered commercial service two years later, can carry up to 850 passengers in an all-economy configuration, allowing airlines to transport more travellers without significantly adding flights.

There are 114 A380s serving various routes worldwide, with another 262 on firm order, according to Airbus SAS.

Nine of the 10 airlines that currently fly the A380 have scheduled flights into India.

Emirates and Singapore Airlines said they will review A380 plans for India now.

“We welcome the decision of the Indian aviation authorities to allow A380 operations. Any decision to deploy an A380 on our network is dependent on passenger demand on that particular route, as well as the ability of airports to handle the aircraft,"" said an Emirates spokesman.

“We will be reviewing our existing operations, and look forward to serving Indian travellers with our flagship aircraft in the near future.""

“The clearance to deploy A380s on Indian routes is favourable news to the Indian aviation industry. Singapore Airlines will evaluate the commercial viability of this recent development based on available traffic rights and resources,"" David Lau, general manager (India), Singapore Airlines, said.

Lufthansa said it already has the new Boeing 747-8 intercontinental jet, the next biggest plane, flying into India but did not rule out pressing A380s into service, too.

“Lufthansa welcomes the decision of the Indian government to approve A380 operations on direct services to and from India. Lufthansa will thoroughly examine the opportunities but currently has no concrete plans for immediate flight operations of this aircraft type to and from India. Lufthansa already operates its Boeing flagship, the new B747-8 with its new first, business and economy class cabins in India and can offer its Indian customers its top products,"" a Lufthansa spokesman said.

“Permitting the A380 points to a beginning of the dismantling of competitive and entry barriers. A great positive as it levels the playing field that was heavily stacked in favour of Etihad’s ‘change in gauge’ clause,"" said Shakti Lumba, formerly a senior executive with IndiGo and Air India.

He was referring to the advantage Jet Airways (India) Ltd would have in its alliance with Etihad.

Etihad was allowed a gauge change recently under bilateral talks between the UAE and India. A gauge change means, for instance, that Jet passengers can fly on a smaller Airbus A320 from Mumbai to Abu Dhabi and then take a bigger Airbus A380 from Abu Dhabi to London.

Ethiopian Airlines to order narrow-body aircraft - EthioSports,"Sun, 12 Jan 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV0aGlvc3BvcnRzLmNvbS8yMDE0LzAxLzEyL2V0aGlvcGlhbi1haXJsaW5lcy10by1vcmRlci1uYXJyb3ctYm9keS1haXJjcmFmdC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Addis Ababa, Ethiopia –Ã‚Â The fastest growing airline in Africa, Ethiopian Airlines, is planning to order single aisle (narrow-body aircraft) that it will deploy on regional routes.

Reliable sources told The Reporter that the management of Ethiopian is looking at Airbus A320 NEO and Boeing B737 MAX aircraft. The sources said the management of Ethiopian recently issued a request for the proposal. Both Airbus and Boeing have submitted their initial responses.

The arch rivals – Airbus and Boeing – are competing to sell their narrow- body aircraft to Ethiopian. The European consortium, Airbus, is proposing its A320 NEO narrow-body jetliner.

The Airbus A320 NEO family is a family of aircraft under development by Airbus replacing the predecessor A320 family. The letters Ã¢â‚¬Å“NEOÃ¢â‚¬Â stand for New Engine Option and are the last step of modernization program A320 Enhanced which was started in 2006. In addition to the NEO, the modernization program also included such improvements in aerodynamic refinements, large curved winglets (sharklets), weight savings, a new cabin with larger luggage spaces and an improved air purification system.

These improvements in combination are predicted to result in 15 percent less fuel consumption, 8 percent lower operating costs, less noise production, and a reduction of nitrogen oxide emissions. The price of A320 NEO is about 100 million dollars (74 million euros). The A320 NEO was launched in December 2010. Airbus has firm orders for the A320 NEO family totaling 2523 as of November 2013. The A320 NEO first flight is slated for 2014 autumn.

Boeing’s 737 MAX is a re-engined version of the narrow-body plane designed to take on Airbus’ A320 NEO.

The 737 MAX incorporates the best of future engine technologies for unprecedented levels of efficiency, reliability and passenger appeal.

MAX Efficiency includes 8 percent lower operating costs than its main competitors. Boeing claims that the new 737 MAX Advanced Technology winglet provides an increase in fuel efficiency of more than 1.5 percent.

Ã¢â‚¬Å“MAX Reliability means that, building on the 99.7 percent airline dispatch reliability of the Next-Generation 737, an airline with a fleet of 100 737 MAXs will avoid delaying over 65,000 passengers compared to using its competitor,Ã¢â‚¬Â Boeing stated in its official website.

According to Boeing, MAX Passenger Appeal is found in the new Boeing Sky Interior, which dramatically elevates the passenger experience, creating preference and loyalty.

For better environmental performance, the superior fuel efficiency of the 737 MAX reduces carbon emissions. Boeing says the noise footprint of the 737 MAX is improved for airlines and airport communities, at 40 percent smaller than today’s single-aisle airplanes.

The price of MAX ranges from 80 to 110 million dollars. Boeing received 1763 orders for MAX since its launch in 2011. Ã‚Â The first flight of B737 Max is scheduled for 2017.

Boeing has for decades dominated Ethiopian fleet especially on the long haul. Ethiopian operates B787, B777, B767, 757, 737, MD11 and Bombardier Q400 aircraft. Airbus, which has been trying to break BoeingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s monopoly on Ethiopian for years, succeeded in 2009 when Ethiopian ordered 12 Airbus A350 XWB jetliners. Back then, the management of Ethiopian decided to use a mixed fleet.

Again this year the management will make a decision on having a mixed fleet or keep on having only Boeing fleet. An aviation expert The Reporter talked to said that there are a number of issues an airline considers when it places new aircraft orders.

Ã¢â‚¬Å“The performance of the aircraft, the price of the aircraft, the cost that you will incur to introduce the new aircraft into the existing fleet are the most important issues that you consider when you place new aircraft orders. You base your decision on these issues,Ã¢â‚¬Â the expert said. Ã¢â‚¬Å“If they (Ethiopian officials) decide having a mixed fleet they will order the A320 NEO. If they decide having only Boeing fleet, they will order B737 MAX,Ã¢â‚¬Â he added.

Passengers arrive in Singapore after emergency landing scare - Yahoo Singapore News,"Tue, 07 Jan 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHA6Ly9zZy5uZXdzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9wYXNzZW5nZXJzLWFycml2ZS1zaW5nYXBvcmUtZW1lcmdlbmN5LWxhbmRpbmctc2NhcmUtMTMzODUzODc0Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Nearly 500 Singapore Airlines passengers arrived safely Tuesday after their Airbus A380 superjumbo was forced to make an emergency landing in Azerbaijan. ""It was quite frightening,"" Chris Milbourn, an 18-year-old student from Australia, told AFP after getting off a replacement A380 that ferried them from Azerbaijan's capital Baku to Singapore. ""I was calm... but there will be like moments here and there when you just think 'I am about to die',"" he said. The relief jet touched down at Changi Airport more than 34 hours after a loss of cabin pressure forced the original plane to land in Baku while en route from London's Heathrow Airport to Singapore. The original flight carrying 467 passengers and 27 crew had to make a steep descent to Baku's Heydar Aliyev International Airport late Monday night, but no one was injured. Oxygen masks were activated during the emergency procedure and passengers spoke of noise coming from one door as the aircraft manoeuvered to land, but said there was little panic inside the A380, the world's largest commercial plane. Jessica Copeland, 26, a waitress from Australia who was seated in the upper part of the double-decker plane, said seeing other passengers behaving calmly ""really helped me"". ""I thought we were going completely down,"" she said. Ashley Li, 28, a Singaporean returning from her European honeymoon, said she was ""a bit shocked"" when the oxygen masks dropped in the cabin but ""there was no turbulence"" as the plane descended towards Baku. Stephen Biss, a 47-year-old tennis coach from Britain, added that ""nobody was screaming or anything"". Indonesia-based independent aviation consultant Gerry Soejatman said the response by the pilot was ""typical of what you should do when there is cabin depressurisation"". ""Depending on the pressure in the cabin, the standard operating procedure is for the pilot to then decide how soon he should descend to 10,000 feet (3,048 metres), a level where human beings can breathe normally,"" he told AFP. ""In this case, the pilot decided to descend to buy some time. At least at 10,000 feet, you can breathe normally without a mask on and you can think and decide on the best course of action,"" he said by telephone from Jakarta. ""The plane landed only a few hours later, so they must have weighed their options and also because it was an A380, they also were looking for the best place to land because not all airports can take them."" Singapore Airlines has a fleet of 19 Airbus A380s with five others on order, according to its website. The planes are used for flights from Singapore to various destinations including Frankfurt, Hong Kong, London and Los Angeles. Airbus said in a statement Monday it was ""following up on this issue and providing technical assistance to the airline"". Singapore Airlines was forced to apologise to passengers for a lengthy wait at Baku airport before they were transferred to hotels. Many of the passengers took to social media to complain they were stranded at the airport with few amenities. Singapore Airlines said the stricken aircraft would return to Singapore after ""any necessary repairs"" are carried out.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9996939897537231}",neutral,0.9996939897537231,0

The four airports equipped to handle the A380s are in New Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore and Hyderabad. The ban on A380s was mainly due to concerns that foreign carriers may further hurt state-run Air India by grabbing a larger share of international traffic. The rule change will benefit carriers like Singapore Airlines, Emirates, Lufthansa and British Airways that operate the super-jumbo and fly to India, as well as A380 customers like Etihad and Qatar Airways who have yet to take delivery of the aircraft.



Civil Aviation Minister Ajit Singh had said earlier this month the government was considering removing the restrictions. ""Flights of A380's to India will now be allowed to airports which are equipped to handle them,"" the civil aviation ministry statement said, adding, ""The operations of A380 aircraft would be subject to overall traffic entitlements within the bilateral Air Service Agreements (ASAs) with different countries.""

On Monday, India lifted a ban on landing the aircraft in the country, enabling carriers such as Singapore Airlines Ltd, Deutsche Lufthansa AG and Emirates airline to fly the jets into the world’s second-most populous nation.

Lufthansa had earlier said it had no immediate plans to use the jet on those routes.

“We are interested to use the A380 also for the major Indian markets,"" Christoph Franz, CEO of Lufthansa, said on Wednesday in an interview in the Reuters Global Markets Forum, an online community for financial professionals.

Franz said Lufthansa definitely planned to use the jet in India but noted the launch would be later in the year, since its fleet of 10 A380s is already committed by current schedules.

He said it was possible for the summer schedule, but added, “We will likely make it for the winter flight schedule of 2014-2015"".

Under India’s rules, A380s will be allowed to land at the country’s four main airports—New Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore and Hyderabad—which are equipped to handle the planes.

India’s decision was welcomed by foreign carriers aiming to tap India’s fast-growing air travel sector.

The A380 can carry more than 800 passengers in a single-class configuration, and the government had banned their use because of concern that foreign airlines would dominate the market for international travel. Reuters

"Airbus's new A350 in Iqaluit, Nunavut for cold weather testing - Eye on the Arctic","Mon, 27 Jan 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJjaW5ldC5jYS9leWUtb24tdGhlLWFyY3RpYy8yMDE0LzAxLzI3L2FpcmJ1c3MtbmV3LWEzNTAtaW4taXFhbHVpdC1udW5hdnV0LWZvci1jb2xkLXdlYXRoZXItdGVzdGluZy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The new Airbus A350 XWB landed in Iqaluit, the capital city of Canada’s eastern Arctic territory of Nunavut, on Friday to begin cold weather testing.

For years Iqaluit has marketed itself as a premier cold-weather testing ground for aerospace companies. Last June the City of Iqaluit sent a delegation to the Paris Air Show.

Eric Leuthold, owner of Frobisher Bay Touchdown Services, which offers logistic support to companies that test their aircraft in the capital, was part of the delegation.

“It’s absolutely worth the money,” said Leuthold of the trip. “It is a big investment to go to a show like that but that’s the only place where you will get everybody you’ll need to talk to in one giant, giant location.”

Iqaluit’s airport landing fees are minimal but the economic spin-offs in town are significant.

With a French crew of 48 aboard the jet, cold weather testing results in cold hard cash.

City councillor Mark Morrissey, who is also executive director of Nunavut Economic Developers’ Association, also went to Paris.

“This is new money to the territory; this is not recycled government money,” he said. “This is new money being put into the community from outside the country so it’s really good.”

Last year, Airbus brought the A350’s engine to Iqaluit for cold weather testing. It also tested its A380 aircraft in Iqaluit in 2006.

Testing is expected to continue until mid-week.

"Airbus logs record 2013, but still behind Boeing - Malta Independent Online","Mon, 13 Jan 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGVwZW5kZW50LmNvbS5tdC9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDE0LTAxLTEzL2J1c2luZXNzLW5ld3MvQWlyYnVzLWxvZ3MtcmVjb3JkLTIwMTMsLWJ1dC1zdGlsbC1iZWhpbmQtQm9laW5nLTM2NzE3ODU0NzbSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Malta Independent

After tallying a record number of airplane orders and deliveries last year, Airbus is admittedly facing a high bar in 2014.

The European aerospace conglomerate said Monday it delivered 626 planes last year, a company record but still 22 fewer than U.S. rival Boeing Co.

The companies, which split the global market for commercial planes, enjoyed a banner year as airlines gobbled up their offerings to renew or build their fleets, cut fuel costs and plan for continued growth in travel.

Airbus' orders last year rose to 1,619, more than twice its expectations, leading some executives to caution against any precise predictions about how many they'll tally this year. The order backlog — jets it plans to deliver in coming years — sits at a record 5,559.

""The market was extremely bullish,"" said Airbus' top executive Fabrice Bregier, meeting with journalists along with commercial director John Leahy. ""More bullish than John or me would have thought, and probably Boeing.""

Some of the biggest demand came from once-struggling U.S. airlines as well as from emerging markets, particularly Asia.

""The real story for some of you is, where does it go from here?"" said Leahy. ""The fact is, we cannot as an industry continue at this level. But what we are doing is we're continuing to increase production.""

""The point is, we are in a growth industry,"" he added. Airbus will increase the average list prices of its aircraft by 2.6 percent this year.

Losing out to Boeing in the number of deliveries ""doesn't matter to us at all,"" Leahy said. ""I don't really care if they have two more airplanes or we have two more.""

Single-aisle aircraft, which are easier to contour to the demands of airline customers than are wide-body jets, make up the bulk of orders these days. The backlog for A320s — including the more fuel-efficient A320 neo in coming years — sits at nearly 4,300 planes.

But Airbus says its superjumbo, the A380, is also answering a key demand for air travelers: More space and wider seats for those long-haul flights where passenger comfort is more prized.

And tight seating could even partially explain the flared passenger tempers that have made headlines in recent months.

""You guys should start looking at some of the in-flight disturbances that are starting to happen in airplanes: fights that require people to call the police,"" Leahy said.

Squeezed seats might be tolerable for a two- or three-hour flight, but ""do it for 15 hours — then you do end up with black eyes,"" said Leahy, pulling in his elbows to mimic his own experience with economy-class travel.

Airbus is set this year to transfer its military aircraft business to another segment of the new Airbus Group — its parent, formerly known as aerospace and defense giant EADS.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9986451268196106}",positive,0.9986451268196106,1

France sells 1% stake in Airbus Group for 451 mln euros - SKNVibes.com,"Thu, 16 Jan 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vbS5za252aWJlcy5jb20vbmV3cy9uZXdzZGV0YWlscy5jZm0vODM5NjHSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"(Paris, FRA) - The French state has raised 451 million euros ($614 million) by selling a one percent stake in European aircaft and defence corporation Airbus Group, the economy minister said Thursday.

The divestment, of around 8 million shares to institutional buyers, brings France's stake in the publicly traded group to 11 percent -- the same as Airbus Group partner Germany.

Airbus Group -- the new name for what used to be known as EADS -- has seen its shares gain 74.63 percent over the past year, to 56.44 euros per share, in large part thanks to management reforms carried out in 2013.

French Economy Minister Pierre Moscovici late Wednesday announced the sale, saying it would lower the French government's stake to a level on par with that of Germany's, as per a bilateral pact. Germany recently raised its stake to the 11 percent level.

Spain's government holds a smaller stake of just over 4 percent in the European group.

Moscovici on Thursday revealed that 451 million euros had been raised from the stake sale.

France has been selling off some of its state holdings in companies in a bid to bring down its debt mountain, which is equivalent to 94 percent of GDP. Last year it raised 2.4 billion euros through divestments, nearly half of that through an earlier sell-off of Airbus Group shares.

Airbus Group is riding high after announcing this week its best commercial performance in its history, with notably 2013 being a record year for orders of Airbus aircraft, though deliveries still trailed those of US rival Boeing.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9955835938453674}",positive,0.9955835938453674,1

The Bids and Awards Committee junks the appeals of losing bidders, paving way for the post-qualification test of Spanish firm EADS Casa Airbus Military

MANILA, Philippines – The Philippines defense department vowed to look into the crash record of EADS Casa Airbus military, the only qualified bidder in the P5.3-billion aircraft acquisition project for 3 medium lift fixed wing of the Philippine Air Force (PAF).

The Spanish firm committed to supply the miltary 3 C295 planes for P5,288,609,983.99 or lower than the approved budget.

C295 is like a smaller version of the already familiar C130, which saw action in the Zamboanga City siege and government response to Typhoon Yolanda. It has an open ramp at the backside to allow troops an easy drop from above. It can carry up to 9 tons of payload or up to 71 personnel. C130s can carry up to 120 personnel.

EADS Casa’s C295 figured in at least one recent fatal crash and reports of defective aircraft. These incidents were reported in the media following the second bidding held last week. (READ: Only one bidder qualifies for military’s P5.3-B aircraft deal)

Defense Assistant Secretary Patrick Velez said fatal crash incidents involving Airbus Military’s C295 will be evaluated as the Spanish firm enters the post-qualification stage, a process where the Philippines determines its capability to supply the aircraft.

“This should not be part of the bidding process but we exercise our responsible authority to be able to determine the instances of fatal crashes which were reported in leading newspapers,” Velez said before fellow members of the Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) on Monday, January 20.

Velez presented the explanation of EADS Casa to the 2 incidents reported in the media. In 2008, at least 20 were killed when Casa’s C295 crashed in Poland. Investigation reports showed that it was caused by pilot error.

“In 2012, the Polish Air Force ordered an additonal batch of 5 of C295 showing their confidence with the safety and effectiveness of C295,” Velez said, reading EADS Casa’s letter.

In 2012, Casa’s C295 also figured in a different controversy when the Czech military returned the aircraft because of some defects. Its DAS anti-rocket systems and the plane’s navigation systems were found defective. When the aircraft couldn’t be repaired, EADS Casa was forced to replace them. EADS Casa submitted a company report that the Czech military accepted the replacement aircraft.

Investigation will continue, Velez said. “What would be important is the examination of the causes of the fatal accidents, whether these fatal accidents were caused by human error or by the failure of the equipment itself to perform in optimum condition under given environment,” Velez told the committee.

“At present, we cannot offer conclusion for the moment except that we will continue to verify accidents involving C295 during post-qualification,” he told the BAC members.

The BAC team that will conduct post-qualification stage is expected to fly to Spain on February 1 and aims to finish its probe by February 8. Without hitches, the project could be awarded to the Spanish firm by the end of February.

If all goes well, the first of the 3 C295 aircraft will arrive by August 2015 or earlier.

Denied: Losing bidder offers bonus aircraft

EADS Casa Airbus Military proceeds to the post-qualification stage as the BAC on Monday denied motions filed by 2 losing bidders for the committee to review its decisions.

Losing bidder PT Dirgantara Indonesia was disqualified because, among other reasons, the planes (CN235) it offered did not comply with the DND requirements. It is smaller than the C295.

In its appeal, the state-owned firm offered to supply 4 aircraft instead of the required 3 to compensate for the deficiencies of its planes.

But Velez dismissed it. “Specifications cannot be changed at the late phase of the project,” Velez said. “While the request was laudable, it was not feasible to say yes to compensation by limitation,” he added.

The BAC supported Velez’s arguments. The Indonesian firm’s motion for reconsideration was denied.

Velez also threatened PT Dirgantara Indonesia with possible “administrative sanction” or “blacklisting.” Knowing the technical requirements of the aircraft project, he said the Indonesian firm should not have submitted its bid knowing that its planes are not qualified.

Under bidding laws in the Philippines, a participating bidder that offers disqualified products at least 3 times could be blacklisted.

Another losing bidder, Italian firm Alenia Aermacchi, wrote the BAC letters to investigate possible collusion between the Spanish and the Indonesian firm. The two firms apparently have an earlier sub-contracting agreement involving the CN235 aircraft.

The BAC also dismissed the allegations as “insufficient to establish conflict of interest or establish collusion.”

It is normal for corporations to have a subcontracting agreement. Velez said similar situations were seen in previous bidding processes. The Spanish and Indonesian firms did not offer similar aircraft and have no similar controlling shareholders.

Alenia Aermacchi joined the first bidding, where there was no qualified bidder. It offered its ATR 42 aircraft. It also bought bid documents for the second bidding but it did not participate.

“I suspect what Alenia wants is for us to stop procurement. We cannot stop without acceptable justification,” said Velez. – Rappler.com","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9996548891067505}",neutral,0.9996548891067505,0

On landing, the Airbus A320 burst a tyre and suffered subsequent damage to a wing. The passengers fared even worse. The usual depression that hits when I leave my Imphal home after Christmas break lifted momentarily on Sunday at the airport. AI-890, the Air India flight to Delhi via Guwahati, was on time. Well, it was only 15 minutes late, and that's as good as it gets with Air India. In fact,I was even a little impressed as the Airbus A320 took off with about 170 people aboard - without fuss, fear or favour - at 4 pm on Sunday. Little did I know that I was flying to a brush with death, and that a full day after surviving it, I would be in a creaky bus jammed between endless lines of smoke-spewing trucks between Jaipur and Delhi.

Out of Imphal, the flight was smooth, but for a turbulence-related jerk now and then. Almost four hours and some circling around the Capital later, the pilot announced that Delhi was smothered in heavy fog and that we would be diverted to Allahabad or Jaipur. An hour later, we were told to prepare for landing at Jaipur. Bad luck turned into a nightmare the moment the plane touched down. There was a jaw-breaking jerk as it made contact with the runway. The speed seemed uncontrollably high and the plane swayed and listed violently. We were not slowing down at all, and the plane was shuddering like it would break into pieces any time.



This is not how I want to die, I remember thinking. An oxygen mask or two dropped behind me. Sparks flew from one of the wings. My seat, 11A, was right next to the emergency exit, and I tried to remember the cabin crew's instructions on how to open it. Finally, the plane came to a halt. Tears flowed as cellphones came alive through the plane. One man was saying: ""The wing caught fire. I didn't reach Delhi but thankfully I didn't go up either."" Mary, the lady sitting behind me-I later found out she is a Delhi University lecturer-said she had first thought that the ""Jaipur runway is not smoothly made"" before she realised the horror of her situation. The pilot's voice boomed over the PA system: ""Ladies and gentlemen, we have landed in Jaipur. We didn't have enough fuel to fly to Allahabad or Lucknow, so even though the visibility was zero in Jaipur, we were forced to make an emergency landing.""





Damaged tyre from the aircraft Damaged tyre from the aircraft

What he said next left me aghast: ""So, thank goodness we are all still alive."" I must say all 170 passengers are safe because of his skills, but his words made me feel worse. The passengers needed reassurance, not professional confirmation of a near-death experience. It kept getting worse. Passengers sat in the aircraft for an hour while the Jaipur ground crew tried to find their way to us through the fog.



When we finally disembarked, it was like a movie scene. I saw at least four fire engines, a few ambulances and some police vehicles, all with lights flashing. It was only later that we found out that a tyre had burst when we landed and the wing had been damaged. The airline gave us the option to take a bus to Delhi in an hour but I realised it would be foolish to be on the road in that fog. I opted to stay in Jaipur.

It took three hours for me to get to a hotel room. On Monday morning, we kept checking with the hotel if there was any word from Air India.



""There is no message yet, ma'am,"" the receptionist kept repeating. Finally, at 11 am, we were told the coach had arrived to take us to the airport where those who wanted to take a bus back to Delhi would be given that option. I planned to catch any available flight back if Air India could not arrange one. We got on the coach and, to my surprise, found out it was taking us straight to Delhi! There was no staff from Air India to inform us about the plans, no one we could address our grievances to. We were just put on three non-Volvo, non-luxury, creaky buses for Delhi.





One of the wings also broke as the plane came to a shuddering halt.

I hadn't wanted to worry my parents so I'd only told them that our flight had been diverted to Jaipur because of fog. But my phone rang when we'd travelled about three hours and my mom said, ""Why didn't you tell us what happened? It's all over the news. The tyre burst, the wing broke, the plane was nearly out of fuel. You nearly crash-landed."" Eight hours after speaking to my mother, I was still on the bus; the 250-km journey to Delhi airport took all of eleven hours. I was dead-tired, but alive, and that's what matters.

Two Airbus workers have been disciplined after posting photographs of a fatal plane crash online.

The images of the horror smash at Hawarden Airport , which claimed the lives of pilot, Gary Vickers, 58, and his girlfriend Kaye Clarke, 42, last November, were shared on social media.

Shortly afterwards, bosses at the Broughton site launched an investigation which concluded that strict regulations were breached.

Two members of staff have now been disciplined for the unauthorised use of cameras on company grounds.

An Airbus spokesman said: “Airbus can confirm that an investigation was launched after photographs were taken on the Broughton site following the tragic accident in November and shared on social media channels.

“In common with many manufacturing facilities, we do not allow photography on site except by authorised people and only under certain circumstances. As a result of this investigation, we can confirm that two people working on the Broughton site were found to be in breach of company procedures and were subject to the associated disciplinary action.

“For reasons of confidentiality we are not able to provide further details on the nature of this disciplinary action.”

Mr Vickers and Ms Clarke were on their way back from Paris when their twin-engine plane crashed as they attempted to land at Hawarden Airport.

Mr Vickers, who co-owned the Mill Hotel in Chester with his father Gordon, was killed instantly while Miss Clarke died later at the Countess of Chester Hospital.

A joint funeral was held for the couple at at Blacon Crematorium.

Pictures emerged of the light aircraft nose-diving on to the runway before smashing into pieces.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9906154870986938}",neutral,0.9906154870986938,0
Airbus Aircraft List Prices For 2014 - AvStop Aviation News,"Mon, 13 Jan 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHA6Ly9hdnN0b3AuY29tL2phbnVhcnlfMjAxNC9haXJidXNfYWlyY3JhZnRfbGlzdF9wcmljZXNfZm9yXzIwMTQuaHRt0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A321 - $110.1 - The Airbus A321 is a stretched first derivative of the standard A320. A321's major change is the stretched fuselage, which is lengthened by 22 ft 9 in the A321 is the largest of the A320 family.



A319neo - $94.4 - Airbus offers three advanced variants of the A320 family with the ""New Engine Option"" the A319, A320 and A321.



A320neo - $102.8 -The Airbus A320neo letters ""neo"" stand for ""New Engine Option"". Modernization program also included such improvements as: Aerodynamic refinements, large curved winglets (Sharklets), weight savings, a new cabin with larger luggage spaces, and an improved air purification system. These improvements in combination are predicted to result in 15% less fuel consumption, 8% lower operating costs, less noise production, and a reduction of nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions by at least 10% compared to the A320 series, as well as an increase in range of approximately 500 nautical miles.



A321neo - $120.5 - The A321neo can accommodate up to 236 seats. In conjunction with the additional over-wing exit door, a second new option is available whereby the forward exit is de-activated. This creates a seamless, undivided forward cabin allowing additional seats and even more flexibility in multi-class seat arrangements. This option will be of particular use in longer range markets where high comfort standards are needed in Premium class.



A330-200 - $221.7 - The Airbus A330 is a wide-body twin-engine jet airliner, the A330-300, the first variant. Responding to dwindling sales, Airbus followed up with the slightly shorter A330-200 variant which has proven more popular. Subsequently developed A330 variants include a dedicated freighter, the A330-200F, and a military tanker, the A330 MRTT.



330-200 Freighter - $224.8 - The A330-200F mid-sized freighter version is tailored for long-haul routes and regional operations to feed cargo into hub airports. The A330-200F’s large main-deck cargo door allows the aircraft to accept all commonly-used pallets and containers, enabling the transport of a full range of cargo – from high-value consumer goods to express packages and perishables.



A330-300 - $245.6 - The Airbus A330 is a wide-body twin-engine jet airliner. The A330-300, the first variant, the A330-300 is based on a stretched A300 fuselage 208 ft 11 in long but with new wings, stabilizers and fly-by-wire systems. The 300 carries 295 passengers in a three-class cabin layout, 335 in two-class, or up to 440 in an all-economy layout. It has a range of 5,700 nmi. It has a large cargo capacity, comparable to that of early Boeing 747s. It is powered by the choice of two General Electric CF6-80E, Pratt & Whitney PW4000, or Rolls-Royce Trent 700 engines, all of which are ETOPS-180 rated.



A350-800 - $260.9 - The A350-800 will seat 270 passengers in a 3-class with a 9-abreast layout. It will have a range of 8,300 nmi. It is designed to compete with the Boeing 787-9 and to directly replace the Airbus A330-200. A350-800 allows for a higher maximum takeoff weight. The -800's fuselage is 10 frames shorter (six forward and four aft) than the -900 aircraft. The baseline -800 will be offered with an MTOW of 248 t (550,000 lb), MLW of 190 t (420,000 lb), MZFW of 178 t (390,000 lb), and 330 kN (74,000 lbf) thrust engines. An optional 11-ton (24,000 lb) increase in MTOW, to 259 t (570,000 lb) with a corresponding increase of MZFW to 181 t (400,000 lb), MLW to 193 t (430,000 lb), and a higher thrust 370 kN (83,000 lbf) engine.



A350-900 - $295.2 - The A350-900 is the first A350 model and seats 314 passengers in a 3-class cabin 9-abreast layout. It has a standard design range target of 8,100 nmi. The -900 is designed to compete with the Boeing 777-200ER and replace the Airbus A340-300.
