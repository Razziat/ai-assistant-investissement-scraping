Airbus shows off Air New Zealand's A320 'sharklets' - USA TODAY,"Tue, 18 Jun 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS90b2RheWludGhlc2t5LzIwMTMvMDYvMTgvYWlyYnVzLXNob3dzLW9mZi1haXItbmV3LXplYWxhbmRzLWEzMjAtc2hhcmtsZXRzLzI0MzQ0Nzcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus shows off Air New Zealand's A320 'sharklets'

Le BOURGET, France — Air New Zealand's new livery was front and center at the Paris Air Show this week, but it was the jet's ""sharklets"" that were the center of attention.

The Airbus A320 was officially presented to Air New Zealand at a delivery ceremony here on Monday. The companies celebrated Air New Zealand's ""launch customer"" status as the carrier received its' first A320 with ""sharklets"" on its wing tips.

Malaysia's AirAsia technically was the first to fly an Airbus A320 with sharklets, though Air New Zealand earned the launch customer designation since it was the first to order one.

Airbus says the devices, which stand nearly 8 feet tall, will help improve fuel efficiency by up to 4% on the jets that have them. Sharklet-equipped A320s will be able to take advantage of a range gain of about 100 nautical miles or an increased payload capability of nearly 1,000 pounds, according to Airbus.

The sharklets are now an option for airlines buying newly built A320s.

Air New Zealand will take delivery of a total of 10 sharklet-equipped A320s.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.6283571124076843}",positive,0.6283571124076843,1
Airbus unveils RFID 'Bag2Go' that can be tracked from an iPhone app - Future Travel Experience,"Thu, 13 Jun 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ1dHVyZXRyYXZlbGV4cGVyaWVuY2UuY29tLzIwMTMvMDYvYWlyYnVzLXVudmVpbHMtcmZpZC1iYWcyZ28tdGhhdC1jYW4tYmUtdHJhY2tlZC1mcm9tLWFuLWlwaG9uZS1hcHAv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Share on LinkedIn LinkedIn Share on Twitter Twitter Share on Facebook Facebook Share on Reddit Reddit Share on Flipboard Flipboard Share on Tumblr Tumblr Share via Email Gmail Share on WhatsApp WhatsApp

[jwplayer mediaid=”10877″] Airbus’ Bag2Go prototype features RFID technology that can be recognised by automated airport and airline baggage processing facilities, and can also be traced using GPS, enabling passengers to track their luggage throughout its journey.

Airbus has revealed its vision of what it is calling “The reinvention of baggage”, a prototype ‘smart’ bag featuring an RFID chip that allows passengers to track their luggage during their journey, and could eliminate the risk of mishandled baggage for good.

RFID technology enables the ‘Bag2Go’ to be recognised by automated airport and airline baggage systems that connect the bag with a passenger’s specific flight itinerary, and in cooperation with mobile technology and other location-based technologies such as GPS, can track the luggage along its journey. The bag’s accompanying iPhone app’s ‘Find My Bag’ feature allows passengers to check whether their bag has made it onto their flight, and trace its location.

The Bag2Go concept, developed in partnership with German luggage maker Rimowa and mobile carrier T-Mobile, could revolutionise the end-to-end baggage process for the passenger. Yann Barbaux, Airbus’ Chief Innovation Officer predicted that an optional door-to-door courier service will collect the Bag2Go from a passenger’s home, before delivering it to and checking it in at the airport.

“You rent the bag, it comes to you, you pack it and then the bag goes to the airport,” Barbaux said.

“There are companies which already do this for maybe €25. We think with this system this could be done for €8 and it would still be profitable.”

Airbus, the developer of the A380 double-deck jet and the A350 jetliner, has explained that the Bag2Go is still in its development stages, but eventually could become available for just 20% more than its technology-less counterpart, and could also be rented from airlines and airports.

“The value for passengers is clear, but where is the added value for Airbus?” Barbaux asked. “That’s the point, we are really working on the business model today. We have the idea but need to find ways to get revenue back. The airlines would run the scheme, so it might be by licensing.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998704195022583}",neutral,0.9998704195022583,0
"Airbus comes up for air, responds to Boeing's Form 41 reliance - Leeham News and Analysis","Thu, 20 Jun 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxMy8wNi8yMC9haXJidXMtY29tZXMtdXAtZm9yLWFpci1yZXNwb25kcy10by1ib2VpbmdzLWZvcm0tNDEtcmVsaWFuY2Uv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus came up for air from the Paris Air Show and provided this response on the DOT Form 41 debate. Readers can now compare closely Boeing’s response to our queries with the Airbus response and draw their own conclusions. As with Boeing, we print their verbatim replies to our questions.

DOT form 41 Maintenance cost comparison

Boeing uses F41 data of the period 2004 to 2011 to demonstrate lower maintenance cost of the 737NG compared to the A320. Without debating about the relevancy of F41 data for aircraft maintenance performance and the “correctness” of the data, let’s have a look at the reported F41 data from the point in time when the A320 entered the US market (1991).

We see why Boeing is focusing on the 2004 to 2011 period, the reported data are at the first glance favourable for the 737NG.

However, the NG entered in the market in 1998, seven year later than the A320, hence at any point in time the graph compares aircraft with at least a seven year age difference. Is this a “like for like” comparison?

Let’s just shift the 737NG curve to the left, starting in the same year than the A320, in 1991:

The picture does now look quite different, but money over time does not have the same value and this is in the above graph penalising the NG.

To be fair the reported cost data need to be harmonised respecting the economic conditions. Let’s put all reported data in year 1991 economic condition:

At the time A320 entered the US market barely any MRO capacity was in place. This has changed over the years and from a certain point in time MROs started to make money with performing maintenance work on the A320. Competition started to take place between the MRO’s, which impacted the pricing of maintenance work in reducing the money spent for the operators. For the NG the maintenance market condition has not been the same. Due to the derivative nature of the NG to the 737 Classic a wide MRO base has been proposing maintenance work on the NG right form the entry into service in 1998.

The graph below illustrates this effect in showing the evolution of independent MROs in the US market.

Another fact leads to lower maintenance cost for the A320 compared to the NG. It is the solid structure, which has been fully fatigue tested during the certification of the aircraft. An advantage the NG does not have, because again due to the derivative nature of the NG compared to the Classic, no full fatigue test has been performed and certification of the airframe has been obtain by “grandfather rights”.

Some quotes from leading MRO’s illustrate the well maturing structure of the A320:

Conclusion:

· Instead of focusing on the “sweat spot” for the NG, data of the entire reporting period must be compared

· Comparing different fleet ages is not leading the sensible results

· Market forces e.g. competition have an impact on maintenance cost

The A320 airframe is better maturing than the NG and improvements on the A320 are showing tangible results.

Why Airbus will dominate Paris Airshow - CNN,"Mon, 17 Jun 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vdHJhdmVsL2FydGljbGUvYWlyYnVzLWFpci1zaG93L2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Story highlights Airbus and Boeing both expected to make large order announcements at Paris Airshow French government is known to pressure Airbus to make a good showing on home turf Boeing has two large aircraft programs in the works Embraer has been working diligently to line up solid orders to announce at the show

CNN —

At every international airshow, there’s a race to garner the most headlines, the most orders, the best visuals and the best sound bites.

Usually, however, Europe’s Airbus comes up the winner.

This is particularly true at the Paris Airshow (which starts Monday and runs till Friday), where Airbus always makes a special push to win the headlines war.

Airbus, of course, is headquartered in Toulouse, France, an hour’s flight south of Paris.

Government pressure

Aside from the aggressive competitiveness of Airbus Chief Operating Officer John Leahy, who can’t tolerate being second at any time and who rarely misses any opportunity to tweak Boeing, the French government is also known to pressure Airbus to make a great showing.

This 2013 Paris Airshow takes place this week. It's the aviation industry's most important event of the year. pierre verdy/afp/getty images file photo

Boeing conceded the point long ago.

“We know Airbus sees this as a competition on their home turf. In terms of orders, we see this as one week out of 52,” admits Boeing’s Vice President of Marketing Randy Tinseth, the company’s most visible communications counterpart to Leahy. (Leahy’s actual counterpart, Ray Conner, CEO of Boeing Commercial Aircraft, tends to keep a low profile.)

“Despite the wave of orders our competition rolls out at airshows, the market has still been roughly split down the middle over the past decade,” says Tinseth.

How do you pick up a ‘superjumbo’ A380?

High expectations

Leahy declined in a recent interview to predict how many orders he’ll have to announce at the airshow, but skipped the Airbus Innovation Days international media briefings on June 5 and 6 – an unusual absence – to go globe-trotting for orders in time for the show.

He’s expected to announce hundreds.

The A350 XWB – the new, composite rival to the Boeing 787 and aging 777 – is widely anticipated to make a flyover at this year’s event.

Some question the wisdom of even a flyby, as the A350 will have few test flights under its wing at that point.

Airbus sends first A350 XWB into the sky

But the French government wants to showcase the plane and so does Airbus.

Boeing strikes back

Boeing is expected to announce hundreds of orders. pierre verdy/afp/getty images file photo

Boeing won’t leave all its pizzazz at home.

The formal program launch of its 787-10 is expected (although Boeing won’t officially say so) and scores of orders are expected to accompany the announcement.

Singapore Airlines has already said it will take 30 of the airplanes.

British Airways is also presumed to be a launch customer.

Boeing is also expected to announce several customers who have signed up for “commitments” for the 777X, although the program launch is considered likely for the Dubai Airshow slated for November 17-21.

Emirates Airlines (headquartered in Dubai) is assumed to be a launch customer for as many as 100 of the new version of the venerable airplane.

Thus, with two new airplane programs and hundreds of orders and commitments anticipated, Boeing could conceivably “win” this year’s show.

But video footage and pictures of the flyby of the A350 will be hard for Boeing to beat with artist renderings and sound bites.

How will we travel 10 years from now?

Other competitors

Embraer, which makes the popular E-Jet in the 70-122 seat market, is expected to formally launch its re-engined design of the E-175/190/195. (The 170 appears on its way out.)

The upgraded E-Jet will feature new wings, new systems, geared turbo fan engines by Pratt & Whitney and room for an additional eight to 12 passengers.

Embraer has been working diligently to line up solid orders to announce at the show.

Bombardier, on the other hand, doesn’t traditionally do well at airshows.

Orders for its CSeries have been few and far between at these events, in part because Canadian securities laws require announcements within 24 hours of the signing of even letters of intent, making it virtually impossible for Bombardier to cluster announcements.

The first flight of the CSeries will almost certainly miss the airshow, but is expected the next week.

Bombardier will have to be content talking about tests leading up to the first flight, revealing an unidentified customer’s identify (possibly Odyssey Airlines, based on an executive’s slip of the tongue at an industry event) and perhaps some small order announcements.

So, with all this activity, maneuvering and posturing, who will “win” the Paris Airshow?

Airbus, of course.

Airbus v Boeing on wide bodies - Leeham News and Analysis,"Fri, 14 Jun 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxMy8wNi8xNC9haXJidXMtdi1ib2Vpbmctb24td2lkZS1ib2RpZXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus and Boeing don’t confine their comparisons to the A320 v 737. They are equally forthcoming in discussing the wide-body strategies.

The pre-Paris Air Show briefings included contrasts in how Airbus and Boeing see the wide-body strategies.

Airbus views the product line-up this way:



Boeing views the product line up this week. We added the seat gap counts and arrows, because Boeing appears to use a slightly higher seat gap count for the A380 than does Airbus vis-a-vis the A350. We added the seat gap count between the 777-9X and the 747-8I, based on Boeing’s publicly stated assumed seat counts.

.

In these examples, we favor the Boeing view (though with the Airbus A380 seat count) as to the market gaps. We do not see the A350-1000 competing with the 777-9X.

Airbus Fires Up the Engines on Its New Composite Airliner - WIRED,"Mon, 03 Jun 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS8yMDEzLzA2L2FpcmJ1cy1maXJzdC1lbmdpbmUtcnVuL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus is one step closer to the first flight of its newest airliner after firing up the engines of the A350-XWB over the weekend. The timing isn't entirely coincidental, with the Paris Air Show just two weeks away. However, the company said that a first flight of its new composite airliner will not be dictated by the air show, but many in the industry are expecting an aerial appearance in France.

Like Boeing's 787 Dreamliner, the A350-XWB is a mostly composite aircraft designed to provide significant fuel savings over similarly sized models. The prototype, known as MSN1, was turned over to Airbus' flight test team last month.

On Sunday the company fired up the Rolls Royce engines for the first time, renewing speculation about an imminent first flight. But at an industry conference in South Africa, Airbus' chief operating officer John Leahy again said the company will not rush the first flight.

""We'll do it when we're ready to do it,"" Leahy said in a story by Aviation Week. He managed to get a jab in at his main rival when explaining the reasoning for not selecting a predetermined date. ""We are not going to fall victim like Boeing did with the 787.""

Large twin-aisle, twin-engine airliners such as the A350, 777 and 787 are seen by many in the airline industry as the future for long-haul flights. Largely thanks to the efficient new engines used on the airplanes, airlines are ordering relatively large numbers of the new planes compared to past four-engine jets in an effort to reduce the fuel bill on the longer routes. Four-engine airplanes -- such as the 747 and A380 -- are not selling as well as airlines enable longer routes connecting two cities directly, rather than running flights through massive hub airports.

In addition to the new A350-XWB, Boeing announced last month that it will be updating the 777. The new airplane, simply called the 777X at this point, will have an all-new composite wing, as well as new engines and other updates in an effort to maintain its market dominance and stay competitive in the increasingly efficient big-jet market.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9993865489959717}",neutral,0.9993865489959717,0

Airbus hinted that its new A350 could help cap off the 2013 Paris Air Show with an overhead fly-by.

Airbus said via Twitter this morning (June 20) a fly-by of its A350 ""looks like a good possibility for tomorrow at the air show!""

The jet, of course, just made its maiden flight this past Thursday with a test flight over France. The jet has must undergo most test flying before it can win certification to begin commercial passenger flights.

Airbus projects delivering its first A350 to an airline customer in the second half of next year.

Still, the A350 has been a hot topic at this week's Paris Air Show, where the intensifying competition between Boeing and Airbus over the widebody aircraft market has been on full display.

Boeing officially confirmed the launch of its Boeing 787-10, a stretch version of its new-age Dreamliner that will be its biggest one yet. Boeing also landed new orders for its 777 model as well as announcing upgrades for that line of aircraft.

Airbus is offering its A350 as competition to both the Boeing Dreamliner and to the smaller versions of Boeing's 777s.

Airbus also has secured a number of new orders for its A350 at the 2013 Paris Air Show, including one on Thursday from United Airlines.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9933926463127136}",positive,0.9933926463127136,1

LE BOURGET, France (AP) - Airbus raked in orders Wednesday for its new A350, announcing 59 sales of the wide-body jet that flew for the first time last week.

Singapore Airlines ordered 30 A350-900s, with an option to buy another 20 of the 900s or the larger 1000 model. The airline had already ordered 20 of the A350.

Air France-KLM also put in an order for 25 A350 jets, saying the plane will be central to its plan to expand long-haul flights after years of struggling against discount carriers in Europe.

Airbus also announced that SriLankan Airlines, the country's national carrier, would buy four A350s and six slightly smaller A330 jets.

Wednesday's announcements at the Paris Air Show represent a vote of confidence in the A350, which Airbus is hoping will help it catch up to Boeing's popular 787 and 777 in the lucrative field of long-haul wide-body jets. The A350, which typically seats 314 passengers, has a list price of $287.7 million; the A330, which doesn't fly as far as the A350, has a list price of $239.4 million.

The A350 makes extensive use of lightweight carbon fiber, at a time when fuel costs are a major concern. Potential customers at the air show haven't been able to see the plane at Le Bourget - the plane is not yet cleared for flight there. First deliveries of the plane are expected in mid-2014.

The SriLankan Airlines' deal is worth around $2.8 billion at list prices, while Singapore Airline's firm order is worth $8.6 billion at list prices.

The Air France deal is worth around $7.2 billion at list prices but customers can negotiate steep discounts. It's a major investment for the airline, which has posted operating losses over the past couple of years.

The purchase fits in with Air France-KLMs hope to shift away from the cutthroat short-haul market. ""This year is a pivotal year for their recovery plan,"" said Robin Byde, an analyst with Cantor Fitzgerald Europe.

Discount carriers, who have successfully competed in both the United States and Europe against more established airlines, also made their mark at the air show.

Boeing on Wednesday finalized an order for 175 of its popular short-haul 737s with Irish low-cost airline Ryanair. The purchase would be valued at $15.6 billion at list prices, but Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary has said he's getting a steep discount - although less than the 53 percent markdown on a prior order.

Boeing also announced orders for a total of 33 of its new generation 737-MAX 8 jets, extending the popularity of the fuel-efficient aircraft. The 737-MAX 8 planes have a list price of $100.5 million.

Aircraft leasing company CIT Aerospace, which placed an order for 30 on Wednesday, is responsible for a fleet of 350 aircraft, including 128 Boeing jets, according to the company. Travel Service, an airline based in Eastern Europe, ordered three.

Smaller jet purchases have made up the bulk of the orders this year as airlines renew their fleets or expand into new markets, notably in Asia and Latin America.

The 737 carries between 150 and 200 passengers and is Boeing's most popular model. First deliveries of the MAX are expected in 2017.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999240636825562}",neutral,0.9999240636825562,0
Airbus A350 takes maiden flight | Arkansas Democrat Gazette - Arkansas Online,"Sat, 15 Jun 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFya2Fuc2Fzb25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMTMvanVuLzE1L2FpcmJ1cy1hMzUwLXRha2VzLW1haWRlbi1mbGlnaHQtMjAxMzA2MTUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS - The Airbus A350’s maiden flight ended with a safe landing Friday, setting the stage for intensifying competition with U.S. rival Boeing in the long-haul, wide-body aircraft market.

The 4-hour flight from Toulouse marks a key step on the path to full certification for the jet, which can carry between 250 and 400 passengers and is the European aircraft maker’s best hope for catching up in along-haul market dominated by Boeing’s 787 and 777. Toulouse airspace closed for both take-off and landing.

Airbus has 613 orders for the A350 and hopes Friday’s flight will bring it momentum heading into next week’s Paris Air Show, which is already shaping up as a battle of the wide-body planes.

“We want more than 50 percent of this market, and we will have more than 50 percent of this market,” Airbus Chief Executive Officer Fabrice Bregier said of the estimated 6,000 wide-body planes to be built during the next 20 years.

More than half of the twin engine jet consists of lightweight carbon-fiber designed to save on jet fuel, which makes up half the cost of long-haul flights. The plane cost about $14 billion to develop.

The A350, which was delayed for two years as Airbus hashed out the new design, is a direct competitor with the 787 Dreamliner - minus the lithium-ion batteries now under investigation for unexplained smoldering. Airbus abandoned its plans to use the lithium-ion batteries despite their advantages in weight, power and recharging speed.

“The A350 has the same innovations more or less as the Dreamliner, the 787,” said Gerard Feldzer, a French aviation expert and former airline pilot. “It is pretty much equivalent, the same amount or proportion of carbon for the lightness of the material, just as many electrical devices.”

Boeing’s list prices for its 787 line range from $206 million to $243 million. Airbus’ list prices range from $254 million to $332 million, and it had 613 orders as of May, compared with 890 orders for the 787. Steep discounts are common on large orders, although the details are rarely made public.

Airbus claims the A350 burns 25 percent less fuel than the Boeing because of its lighter weight, redesigned Rolls-Royce engines and new aerodynamics.

“The first flight is a very special moment in an aerospace company,” Tom Enders, CEO of Airbus parent company EADS, said late Thursday.

Friday’s flight handled as predicted, test pilot Peter Chandler said after a 4-hour-6-minute round trip.

“It felt more like an aircraft at the end of its flight test program than one on its first flight,” he said, although some glitches will need to be addressed.

Powered by Rolls-Royce Holdings engines, the A350 reached 25,000 feet and a speed of Mach 0.8 as Airbus used the flight to gather data needed to achieve certification within about 14 months, flight test engineer Patrick Du Che said. The flight-test campaign is expected to clock around 2,500 hours.

Airbus is trying to build up the A350 to take on Boeing’s 787 - Skift Travel News,"Thu, 06 Jun 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vc2tpZnQuY29tLzIwMTMvMDYvMDYvYWlyYnVzLWlzLXRyeWluZy10by1idWlsZC11cC10aGUtYTM1MC10by10YWtlLW9uLWJvZWluZ3MtNzg3L9IBXmh0dHBzOi8vc2tpZnQuY29tLzIwMTMvMDYvMDYvYWlyYnVzLWlzLXRyeWluZy10by1idWlsZC11cC10aGUtYTM1MC10by10YWtlLW9uLWJvZWluZ3MtNzg3L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"One would think that Airbus could have made much more traction on sales during Boeing's Dreamliner debacle, but its failure to totally dominate the wide-body field speaks to its own recent manufacturing challenges.

Airbus SAS is looking to build momentum for the new A350, with its sales chief criss-crossing the globe to chase orders while test pilots and engineers race toward first flight as the Paris Air Show approaches.

With 10 days left before the industry’s premiere expo, the wide-body plane made of composite plastic has started pre-flight taxiing tests and Airbus has picked the crew of the A350s maiden flight. John Leahy, head of sales, skipped a two-day media briefing at Airbus headquarters in Toulouse, France, to clinch orders he can add to the 35 for the model this year alone.

The European planemaker is marketing its A350 to challenge Boeing Co.’s 787 and best-selling 777-300ER. Underscoring the neck-and-neck race in the wide-body aircraft market, where margins are higher than for smaller planes, was a $17 billion purchase by Singapore Airlines Ltd. last week which the carrier split between the two manufacturers.

“We’re ready to go,” said Pascal Verneau, the 51-year-old flight engineer who’ll sit between the two test pilots in the cockpit of the first A350 set to leave the ground. “Personally, I hope we’ll fly before the air show.”

Airbus Chief Executive Officer Fabrice Bregier told journalists yesterday that the A350, which first emerged fully painted from its hangar last month, was in good shape and would likely meet a company forecast for first flight by midyear.

Encouraging tests

“I have pilots who tell me that from the results of the simulations the quality of the aircraft is better than on in- service aircraft for previous types of the fleet,” Bregier said. “This is encouraging.”

As aerospace companies converge on Paris for the industry’s largest trade event of the year, Airbus will face Boeing as it emerges from a three-month grounding of its marquee 787 Dreamliner following battery malfunctions. Boeing plans to showcase the Dreamliner in Paris, while Airbus hasn’t committed to the A350 making an appearance.

Airbus will need a good showing with the A350 as its U.S. rival seeks pledges for a 777 successor to help halt Airbus’s advance into the wide-body market, which Boeing still dominates. Both companies also compete in the market for the largest jumbos, though Airbus hasn’t secured a firm new order so far this year for its A380 and Boeing will cut output for its 747-8 amid slack demand.

Trial series

The maiden flight of the A350 will kick off a yearlong series of trials featuring five test planes. That’s more than used for the A380 program a decade ago so the planemaker can cram more work into fewer months, A350 program director Didier Evrard said. The full flight-test program will require 2,500 hours of flight spread over the five test planes.

Relatively little is left to do before the plane can fly. After applying power on June 2 to the Trent XWB engines made by Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc, the plane taxied for the first time at low speeds this week.

A glitch in the software that controls signaling is being worked through now, after which the plane will proceed to run taxi tests at increasingly higher speeds until the so-called rejected takeoff at high velocity, to check that brakes, spoilers and thrust reversers all work properly to bring the aircraft to a controlled standstill.

Verneau, the flight-test engineer and one of six people on the maiden voyage, said he’s been working flat out and through weekends, as the suspense of first flight builds. Already a flight engineer on the A380 and A340-600 test programs, Verneau said he doesn’t anticipate any vacation until Christmas.

“This is a baby,” he said, gesturing at the A350-900 painted in Airbus corporate livery as the 219-foot (67 meter) long plane sat gleaming in the sun of southwestern France. “It’s in my hands!”

At almost exactly 10:00am local time in Toulouse, France, the first Airbus A350 successfully took off with many on lookers locally and over 20,000 viewers on Airbus’ live feed. Six crew on board took the A350-900 XWB for a four hour test flight which will be the first of many to get to the 2,500 flight hours required for certification. The first aircraft, MS001, will be joined by four other test aircraft to get there.

’œI congratulate the whole A350 XWB development team for having completed the first flight preparation in a record time,” Airbus President and CEO Fabrice Bregier said. “I also wish to thank the first flight crew today for taking this aircraft where it wants to be ’“ in the sky. I would also like to extend my gratitude to all our teams in the design offices, at programme and manufacturing level, the ground crews as well as our colleagues in airlines and suppliers and many others who helped define this all-new aircraft. The A350 XWB which has flown today, integrating the latest available technologies, is now entering the final stage of its development. And it is ready. Ready to head towards certification and entry-into-service in the second half of next year.’

Airbus A350 XWB to make first flight Friday - CNET,"Wed, 12 Jun 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuZXQuY29tL3RlY2gvZ2FtaW5nL2FpcmJ1cy1hMzUwLXh3Yi10by1tYWtlLWZpcnN0LWZsaWdodC1mcmlkYXkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has confirmed that the A350 XWB will make its first flight Friday, a milestone that marks perhaps the last highly touted inaugural flight for years to come.

Over the last 10 years, aviation enthusiasts have been treated to a series of exciting first flights, from Airbus' A380 to Boeing's 787 Dreamliner and 747-8 Intercontinental. But with no other game-changing airplanes set to be launched in the next five years or more, the A350's first flight could be it for a while.

There has been significant speculation in recent weeks that the plane would take flight in time to make an appearance at the aviation industry's signature event, the Paris Air Show, which begins Monday. Airbus' announcement would seem to bolster such speculation.

The A350 XWB is Airbus' answer to three of arch-rival Boeing's planes, the troubled but popular 787 Dreamliner, and the 777 and 777-X. The new plane, which should take off from Airbus' headquarters in Blagnac, France, just outside the city of Toulouse, is said to be highly fuel-efficient, thanks in large part to its use of composite materials in 53 percent of the aircraft. It also utilizes titanium and advanced aluminum alloys, meaning that more than 70 percent of the entire airframe is constructed with what Airbus calls ""advanced materials.""

The A350 XWB's fuselage is built from carbon-fiber reinforced plastic composites, which should give the plane 25 percent better fuel efficiency, and be easier to maintain. Plus, it will better resist corrosion than traditional airplane bodies. Airbus boasts that its wings, at 105 feet long by 19.7 feet wide, are the largest-ever single aviation parts made from lightweight carbon composites.

Plus, in a bid to avoid the kind of battery issues that have plagued Boeing's Dreamliner, Airbus is using nickel-cadmium batteries rather than lithium-ion.

Three models

Airbus plans on building three versions of the A350 XWB. The first is the A350-900, which directly takes on Boeing's 777-200ER, and which replaces Airbus' own A330-300. The A350-900 will seat 314 passengers in a three-class layout and is powered by game-changing Trent XWB engines generating 84,000 pounds of thrust each. The plane has a range of 8,100 nautical miles.

Next up is the A350-800 XWB, which could be a direct competitor to Boeing's forthcoming 787-9 Dreamliner, the longer follow-up to its 787-8 Dreamliner. The A350-800 XWB will replace the A330-200. It has 270 seats in a three-class configuration, and flies with Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engines providing 74,000 pounds of thrust each. That plane has a range of 8,500 nautical miles.

Finally, Airbus will build the A350-1000 XWB, meant to take on the 777-300ER, and replace Airbus' own A340-600. That plane will seat 350 passengers in a three-class configuration, and uses the same engines as the A350-900. It can fly 8,400 nautical miles.

Friday's first A350 flight will be a big day for a program that was announced in 2006, and which began construction in 2009.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9817103743553162}",positive,0.9817103743553162,1

Scandinavian airline SAS announced Tuesday it plans to order 12 new Airbus aircraft. The deal would be worth $3.3 billion at list prices, though airlines typically negotiate significant discounts with big jetmakers Airbus and Boeing.

SAS signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) — short of a firm order — for eight A350-900 and four A330-300 planes as part of a renewal of its long-haul fleet.

The deal also includes upgrades of seven older A330 and A340 widebodies and an option to purchase another six A350 aircraft.

SAS said the A330s will be delivered in 2015 and the A350s in 2018.

Despite the MOU, as opposed to a firm order, SAS sent out an e-mail to its frequent-fliers touting the new jets.

""This will make our long-haul fleet top of class in the industry!"" SAS says in the e-mail, adding the new jets will offer ""completely horizontal flatbed seats in SAS Business, a new high-definition full video on demand entertainment system in the entire cabin (and) quieter planes.""

SAS also touts the order on its website, saying ""the Airbus A350-900 XWB has approximately 20% higher passenger capacity than the existing A340/A330 fleet. The A350 is a completely new aircraft type incorporating advanced aerodynamics and the latest materials and system technology available.""

CNN —

Airbus has confirmed that the first flight of its long-awaited A350 XWB is set for the morning of June 14, 2013, weather permitting.

According to the European aircraft maker, the “MSN1” flight-test aircraft will take off from Toulouse-Blagnac airport at around 10 a.m. local time (8 a.m. GMT).

Airbus has set up a website, www.a350xwbfirstflight.com, for those who want to watch the A350’s inaugural flight live online.

Today’s launch is in line with speculation among aviation professionals that Airbus is planning to show off its new plane at the upcoming Paris Air Show, a rumor the company has yet to confirm.

The A350 XWB is the first in a family of super-efficient passenger planes Airbus designed to go head-to-head with rival Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner and 777s.

“XWB” means “extra wide body.” There are three members in the A350 family: the A350-800, the A350-900 and the A350-1000, which seat 270, 314 and 350 passengers respectively, in three-class seating.

The plane was unveiled last month at Airbus HQ in Toulouse, France. Today’s flight is the latest milestone in what has been a turbulent production history for the A350 program, which was first announced in 2006.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998968839645386}",neutral,0.9998968839645386,0

First flight of Airbus A350 reopens wide-body race - ABC NEWS 4,"Fri, 14 Jun 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3czQuY29tL2FyY2hpdmUvZmlyc3QtZmxpZ2h0LW9mLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzUwLXJlb3BlbnMtd2lkZS1ib2R5LXJhY2XSAVNodHRwczovL2FiY25ld3M0LmNvbS9hbXAvYXJjaGl2ZS9maXJzdC1mbGlnaHQtb2YtYWlyYnVzLWEzNTAtcmVvcGVucy13aWRlLWJvZHktcmFjZQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS (AP) - Airbus sent a new wide-body plane into the skies Friday that sets the stage for intensifying competition with U.S. rival Boeing - with consequences for jobs, airlines' investments and the reputations of the powerful planemakers.

After years of delays and a revamp that cost billions, the A350 cruised for four hours in partly cloudy skies above Toulouse in southern France.

Most importantly, it then landed safely.

It met ear-to-ear smiles - and some sighs of relief - among the Airbus engineers and executives who helped the plane reach its maiden journey.

The flight marks a key step on the path to full certification for the jet, which can carry between 250 and 400 passengers and is the European aircraft-maker's best hope for catching up in a long-haul market dominated by Boeing's 777 and the 787, known as the Dreamliner.

""At the end of the day you need to make it real, and this is the time for making it real. So I am very proud already,"" Didier Evrard, head of the A350 program, said while watching the flight.

""But I will be still nervous until it comes back.""

Airspace over Toulouse, where Airbus has its headquarters, closed for both take-off and landing. With distinctive, upturned wing tips, the plane had a great big ""A350"" painted across its belly, heightening anticipation that it will fly at the Paris Air Show next week.

The plane's undercarriage remained down for the first part of the flight, so that they could run through a series of checks and ensure it was ready for the full flight.

Airbus has 613 orders for the A350, and hopes Friday's flight will bring it momentum heading into next week's Paris Air Show, which is already shaping up as a battle of the wide-body planes.

""There is a lot of money at stake, a lot of employment at stake. This is an extremely important political, social and economic issue,"" said Gerald Feldzer, a French aviation expert and former airline pilot.

Airbus' potential customers, the world's airlines, have all been squeezed by high aviation fuel costs and a fall in passengers because of the struggling world economy. Carriers are therefore looking for ways to run their fleets more cost-effectively.

More than half of the twin-engine A350 consists of lightweight carbon-fiber designed to save on jet fuel, which makes up half the cost of long-haul flights.

Airbus claims the A350 is 25 percent more fuel-efficient than comparable planes.

The A350, which was delayed for two years as Airbus hashed out a new design, is a competitor to the 787 - minus the lithium ion batteries now under investigation for unexplained smoldering. Airbus abandoned its plans to use the lithium ion batteries despite their advantages in weight, power and re-charging speed.

""The A350 has the same innovations more or less as the Dreamliner, the 787,"" said Feldzer. ""The same amount or proportion of carbon for the lightness of the material, just as many electrical devices.""

Boeing's list prices for its 787 line range from $206 million to $243 million. Airbus lists prices ranging from $254 million to $332 million, and had 613 orders as of May, compared with 890 orders for the 787. Steep discounts are common on large orders, although the details are rarely made public.

The initial A350 program was scrapped and redesigned after customers criticized it. Development of the plane was held up by management disputes and financial troubles at Airbus early on.

But Boeing faced its own delays and problems with the 787, and analysts say Airbus is now trying to position itself as the airplane manufacturer that can get the job done.

""Boeing has the broader product line but they are still struggling under the shadows of the 787 nightmare and they seem unenthusiastic about launching new products,"" said Richard Aboulafia, an analyst with the Teal Group. ""Airbus has its chance to show themselves as the opposite of that.""

It was nearly two years after Boeing's first flight of the 787 until the first passengers stepped onboard the jet. Aboulafia expects a similar timeframe for the A350.

However, he notes about Airbus: ""So far they have surprised, positively.""

Airbus hopes the timeframe is shorter. It's aiming to deliver the first A350 to Qatar Airways in the second half of next year.

The Toulouse-based company said the plane that flew on Friday will get a detailed inspection that will take two or three days before the plane flies for a second time. After that, it expects flight testing to take a little more than a year, Airbus President and CEO Fabrice Bregier said in a video released by the company. About 2,500 hours of flight testing are planned.

Eric Bernardini, a managing director at AlixPartners and aerospace analyst, said, Airbus designers ""have matured a lot in their development process,"" said Bernardini. The Airbus CEO ""was always insisting on simplicity and not overcomplicating the design and having a monster that is difficult to manufacture.""

The A350 will compete against larger versions of Boeing's new 787, but is also aimed at Boeing's 777-300ER, which has been a runaway hit with airlines. The original 777 design is aging - it first flew in 1994. Airbus said that eight out of 10 customers for the 777-300 ER have ordered A350s. U.S. customers for the A350 include United Continental Holdings Inc. and Hawaiian Airlines.

The biggest A350 will carry roughly 350 passengers, slightly fewer than a 777-300ER. Planes like that are generally used on long-haul international flights. Those planes have turned out to be popular with airlines who want large aircraft - but not superjumbos like the Airbus A380 or Boeing's new 747-8i. Sales of those two giants have been disappointing.

Boeing is considering whether to build a new version of its 777, now called the 777X, which would boost fuel efficiency with new carbon-fiber wings and new engines. Boeing is widely expected to announce a final decision about building the 777 at next week's Paris Air Show.

A year ago, at the Paris Air Show's sister event in Britain, Boeing beat Airbus for the number of orders announced. The two companies vie closely each year for the title of world's biggest plane maker, and the race is as tight as ever.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.5372428894042969}",positive,0.5372428894042969,1
Boeing goes head to head with Airbus after Dreamliner woes - The Guardian,"Sat, 22 Jun 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDEzL2p1bi8yMy9haXJidXMtYm9laW5nLWJhdHRsZS1tYXN0ZXJ5LXNraWVz0gFTaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMTMvanVuLzIzL2FpcmJ1cy1ib2VpbmctYmF0dGxlLW1hc3Rlcnktc2tpZXM?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"When British Airways takes delivery of its first 787 Dreamliner at Heathrow this week, it will mark another step in the rehabilitation of Boeing's reputation, and a minor victory in one of the world's great corporate battles.

For Boeing, this is a further opportunity to restore the reputation and fortunes of a carbon fibre miracle that briefly took on the air of an industrial disaster when burning batteries grounded the fleet in early 2013. Its gestation has been public and painful: after endless delays in production, the hype over its maiden voyages gave way to safety concerns that grew until aviation regulators took the fleet out of service.

The 787 did not return to the skies, with modified batteries, until late April. But airlines haven't lost their lust for a wide-bodied plane with the fuel efficiency and range of a much larger model – and one that also promises more peace for passengers and bystanders. As British airports push to expand, noise levels may prove particularly relevant and backers of Heathrow's expansion will welcome a quieter presence over west London.

Boeing's arch-rival, Airbus, has not revelled in its competitor's discomfort. Before the Dreamliner saga, the Franco-German business was in the headlines for persistent delays in producing its A380 superjumbo, which then endured high-profile mishaps once it entered service. The discovery of cracks in the wings of the A380 fleet – in the wake of an engine blowout on a passenger flight in 2010 – undermined the allure of a plane that represented the cutting edge of commercial aviation before the Dreamliner came along.

With perfect timing, Airbus has unveiled its response to the Dreamliner's return – the A350. The first of these slightly smaller jets took off from Toulouse on 14 June, in time for a swoop over the Paris Airshow last week. The Airbus plane is less revolutionary than the 787. It has similarly efficient engines and enough carbon-fibre to bring down the weight and the fuel bill, but not the battery-driven auxiliary systems that have plagued Boeing. For an airline industry wary of taking chances as profits tumble, it is a conservative compromise.

At Paris Airbus sold 69 more A350s, mainly to established customers such as Singapore Airlines, along with a good batch for Air France, naturellement. But Boeing secured ""commitments"" for 102 Dreamliners at Paris as it finally revealed plans for the 787-10 – a stretched model with around 330 seats that will match the capacity of the smaller A350s, entering service in 2018.

Randy Tinseth, Boeing's vice-president of marketing, says the battery problems had delayed the go-ahead despite interest from customers. But he adds: ""There is a little bit of magic in that aircraft because of the experience it gives passengers ... The more the airplane is out there in the air, the better it will do in the market because people just love it.""

The crucial people who ""love it"" are airlines who see a way into new long-haul markets on a lighter, fuel-efficient plane. Airports, meanwhile, think it can change the way planners view the economics of certain routes. In Britain this adds to the debate on whether, and where, to expand London's crowded airports. Gatwick trumpeted the merits of the ""hub-busting"" Dreamliner that Thomson Airways will operate from the airport, claiming its arrival meant that the decades ahead would shift airlines away from the ""hub and spokes"" model – where passengers fly in on short-haul planes then transfer to a long-haul flight. That is the business plan for the UK's biggest airport, Heathrow. But the Dreamliner gives the likes of Gatwick a chance to offer economically competitive long-haul services with just one runway.

For Heathrow, even more significant is the arrival of BA's first A380 on 4 July. A hole has already been carved in the entrance to the BA hangar, to allow the tailfin of the giant plane to squeeze through. This is the plane of Heathrow's future – doubly so if expansion plans are thwarted. With passengers connecting at the hub, it can load ever greater numbers on a single take-off. Where demand is high, such as on transatlantic routes, the numbers can make sense for airline and airport alike – and potentially for Londoners under the flight path, with the A380 promising to be far quieter than the Boeing 747.

With Boeing's own superjumbo heading for extinction because of the advent of the A380, it's perhaps unsurprising that Tinseth is sniffy about the A380 and its prospects for solving airport capacity issues. ""I could take every passenger on a wide-body today, put them on an A380, and that's not going to address the issue,"" he says. ""The way we see the market still headed is more fragmentation ... more flights to more places, rather than bigger and bigger airplanes. That really provides benefit to the passenger because it dramatically reduces their flight times.""

Airbus, and plenty of aviation analysts, remain confident about the future of the A380, but it is heavily reliant on one customer. Emirates has ordered 90 A380s and transformed its Dubai airport home to accommodate a plane whose economics match the strategy of the airline and its host hub airport. Only 20 A380s were sold at Paris, to a leasing company, Doric.

While the battle lines are being drawn, many airlines are happy to pitch their tents in the middle. BA and Singapore Airlines have announced carefully balanced orders from both manufacturers in recent months.

Douglas McNeill, investment director at stockbroker Charles Stanley, says that when planning future fleets, ""you're never quite sure what would suit you best"". The bottom line is the cost and revenue generated per seat per kilometre. ""Those might sound like quite simple questions but they're not: the number of people on the plane influences the weight, then the fuel ... Frequency and speed might mean you can raise fares. So airlines are reluctant to commit – they're hedging their bets. It also lets you drive a hard bargain.""

This negotiating tactic was claimed by easyJet to bring in its own Paris deal although low-cost carriers generally prefer to run as few aircraft types as possible to minimise crew training and maintenance costs. McNeill says that, to make the sums add up, Boeing would have had to go some distance to undercut Airbus, whose planes are the only ones easyJet now flies.

With such deals potentially valued at tens of billions of dollars, the finely balanced corporate battle has a wider impact: prime minister David Cameron was quick to tweet congratulations to Airbus for the A350 take-off ""securing 6,200 UK jobs"" – reflecting the fact that all Airbus wings are made in the UK.

Meanwhile, as befits two heavyweights, there was, before Paris, an edge detectable in Tinseth's voice as he talked of the ""strong rivalry"" and accused Airbus of holding back orders for the show. By the time of the show he had upped the rhetoric to claim that Boeing was outmanoeuvring Airbus: ""We've got them boxed and bracketed.""

John Leahy, chief operating officer for Airbus, retorted: ""Our A350 XWB has been outselling the 787 by better than two to one over the past five years. In addition our [short- haul] A320neo family retains a 60% market share lead. That's a corner I want to stay boxed into.""

And the final score in this Paris match? Airbus pipped Boeing with deals worth $68.7bn, for 466 passenger jets. Boeing notched $66.4bn for 442 planes. The running total for 2013, meanwhile, has Airbus ahead by 734 planes to 692. The battle continues.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9906787276268005}",negative,0.9906787276268005,-1

The A350, which has been in the making since 2004, is Airbus' first commercial jet to be made primarily from composite materials, offering better fuel efficiency and the latest in passenger comfort.

The plane will help it compete with Boeing's new 787 Dreamliner, also made largely from light-weight composite materials.

Airbus has proceeded cautiously after the Dreamliner, which was launched in September 2011, faced several battery malfunctions earlier this year. That led regulators to ground the plane for several months until Boeing could fix the problem.

Last week, Airbus' chief operating officer John Leahy told Aviation Week the plane-maker was not going to rush the first flight of the A350: ""We are not going to fall victim like Boeing did with the 787.""

The first half of 2013 and has certainly been a busy year in the annals of commercial aviation. In January the worldwide fleet of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner was grounded; not taking to the skies again until May. On Valentine’s Day, American Airlines and USAirways announced a blockbuster merger creating the world’s largest airline and effectively ending the legacy airlines consolidation game in the United States. In early March, Bombardier rolled-out the CSeries CS100, the first in a line of airliners that could not only be a game changing regional jet, but possibly challenge the Airbus A320 / Boeing 737 duopoly.

These headlines alone would make any year exceptional, but only midway through the year another major event loomed large. On June 14th Airbus embarked on flying for the first time what’s likely the last ’œtotally clean sheet’ large airliner for the rest of this decade ’“ the A350 XWB. Even with roughly 2 days notice, there was absolutely no way I was going to miss this historic event. I, along with many had suspected June 13th or 14th would be ’œD-Day’ for the A350 so I had my bags packed and reservations on hold just in case.

As we would learn later, Airbus had this week as a target for the last 9 months. Much has been already written about the A350 over the last 7 years and its maiden flight, I want this piece to take you with me on what it was like moment by moment to be there and witness aviation history. First, let’s go back to the future for a little A350 XWB refresher.

Airbus rival to Boeing's Dreamliner passes first test - The Guardian,"Fri, 14 Jun 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDEzL2p1bi8xNC9haXJidXMtcml2YWwtYm9laW5nLWRlYW1saW5lci10ZXN00gFTaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMTMvanVuLzE0L2FpcmJ1cy1yaXZhbC1ib2VpbmctZGVhbWxpbmVyLXRlc3Q?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Airbus A350's maiden flight ended with a safe landing on Friday, setting the stage for intensifying competition with US rival Boeing in the long-haul wide-body aircraft market.

The four-hour flight marks a key step on the path to full certification for the jet, which can carry between 250 and 400 passengers and is the European aircraft maker's best hope for catching up in a long-haul market dominated by Boeing's 787 and 777.

Airspace at the airport in the southern French city of Toulouse, where Airbus has its headquarters, closed for both take-off and landing.

Airbus has 613 orders for the A350, and hopes Friday's flight will bring it momentum heading into next week's Paris air show, which is already shaping up as a battle of the wide-body planes.

More than half of the twin-engine jet consists of lightweight carbon-fibre designed to save on fuel, which makes up half the cost of long-haul flights.

The A350, which was delayed for two years as Airbus hashed out the new design, is a direct competitor with the 787 Dreamliner – minus the lithium ion batteries now under investigation for unexplained smoldering. Airbus abandoned its plans to use the lithium ion batteries despite their advantages in weight, power and re-charging speed.

""The A350 has the same innovations more or less as the Dreamliner, the 787,"" said Gerard Feldzer, a French aviation expert and former airline pilot.

""It is pretty much equivalent, the same amount or proportion of carbon for the lightness of the material, just as many electrical devices.""

Boeing's list prices for its 787 line range from $206 million to $243 million. Airbus lists prices ranging from $254 million to $332m (£211m), and had 613 orders as of May, compared with 890 orders for the 787. Steep discounts are common on large orders, although the details are rarely made public.

Airbus claims the A350 burns 25% less fuel than the Boeing due to its lighter weight, redesigned Rolls Royce engines and new aerodynamics.

""The first flight is a very special moment in an aerospace company,"" Tom Enders, CEO of Airbus parent company EADS, said","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.8562220931053162}",neutral,0.8562220931053162,0
Honeywell and Safran demonstrate electric green taxiing system on Airbus A320 - Military & Aerospace Electronics,"Sun, 16 Jun 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5taWxpdGFyeWFlcm9zcGFjZS5jb20vY29tbWVyY2lhbC1hZXJvc3BhY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS8xNDIyNzA0MS9ob25leXdlbGwtYW5kLXNhZnJhbi1kZW1vbnN0cmF0ZS1lbGVjdHJpYy1ncmVlbi10YXhpaW5nLXN5c3RlbS1vbi1haXJidXMtYTMyMNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS, 17 June 2013. Honeywell (NYSE:HON) and Safran (NYSE Euronext Paris:SAF), having completed the first major phase of testing of their electric green taxiing system (EGTS), are publicly demonstrating the technology for the first time, installed on an Airbus A320 aircraft, at the 50th International Paris Air Show held at Le Bourget Airport.

Developed by EGTS International, a joint venture between Honeywell and Safran launched in 2011, the technology enables aircraft to taxi autonomously using its own electrical power, avoiding the use of the main engines during taxiing. EGTS is designed to improve airline operating efficiency during taxi operations and cut fuel consumption by up to four percent per flight cycle.

EGTS will also reduce noise and carbon and nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions during taxi operations, as well as reduce gate and tarmac congestion, improve on-time departure, and allow passengers to deplane faster as a result of smoother ground handling operations, says a representative. Officials anticipate introducing EGTS to the market in 2016.

EGTS enables aircraft to push back autonomously and taxi between gate and runway without engaging the main engines by using the auxiliary power unit (APU) generator to power electric motors in the main landing gear. Each of an EGTS-equipped aircraft's powered wheels is fitted with a control system, giving pilots total control of the aircraft's speed and direction during taxi operations. In addition to reduced fuel burn, the system will reduce engine and brake wear and minimize the risk of damage to engine turbines from foreign objects on the tarmac.

The component system and aircraft testing program has accumulated more than 3,000 hours of testing on seven bespoke testing benches and rigs, including on-ground maneuvers in Toulouse, France, on an A320 modified by the joint venture for the EGTS development program.

Since this aircraft's ""first move"" in April of this year, the EGTS fitted to it has logged close to 160 kilometers (100 miles) of rolling tests. These tests evaluate the system in various load configurations and runway conditions, through a series of complex maneuvers such as pushback, tight turns and U-turns, according to varying specifications of acceleration and speed. The next major milestone of the testing program following the Paris Air Show will be to conduct these same maneuvers at speeds up to 20 knots, at full performance and with the aircraft at maximum take-off weight (MTOW).

""EGTS is a revolutionary system that brings immediate benefits for a pilot operating in congested airports. In addition to faster push-back times, being fully autonomous with its reverse mode, the system is very smooth and so easy to operate, enabling the plane to accelerate without any delay, and move at a steady rate,” says Jens Berlinson, test pilot, Safran. “With EGTS we no longer need to use the brakes unlike with today's aircraft that have a tendency to accelerate naturally even when the engines are at idle. This is especially valuable in busy airports, where planes are often queuing up for an extended period of time before take-off.""","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.6192492246627808}",neutral,0.6192492246627808,0
Airbus and Boeing wide-body planes dominate Paris Air Show - RFI English,"Mon, 17 Jun 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJmaS5mci9lbi92aXNpdGluZy1mcmFuY2UvMjAxMzA2MTctYWlyYnVzLWFuZC1ib2Vpbmctd2lkZS1ib2R5LXBsYW5lcy1kb21pbmF0ZS1wYXJpcy1haXItc2hvd9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"France

The US aircraft-leasing group ILFC has ordered 50 more Airbus A320neo airliners, the two companies announced on the first day of the Paris Air Show on Monday.

The catalogue price for the sale is 3.7 billion euros. In 2011, ILFC had ordered 100 of the A320neo aircraft, which are more fuel-efficient than the A320 series, widely used by low-cost airlines and on short-haul routes.

The world's biggest air show took to the air on Monday at Le Bourget, just outside the French capital.

A battle between Boeing and Airbus for orders in the lucrative market for wide-body planes is set to dominate the event.

Airbus is pinning its hopes on the fuel-efficient A350 to compete in the long-haul sector after gradually winning more than half of the market for medium-haul, single-aisle planes that carry an average of 150 passengers.

The A350 is expected to conduct a fly-by of the air show towards the end of the week, hoping to woo potential customers.

Boeing is also entering the show in upbeat mood as it seeks to move on from its difficulties with the trouble-prone 787 Dreamliner.

Technical problems with overheating batteries forced the worldwide grounding of the Dreamliner fleet in a major setback for the Seattle-based manufacturer.

At Le Bourget, Boeing is expected to announce the launch of its 787-10X, a longer version of the original Dreamliner, which can accommodate up to 330 passengers.

The US firm is also set to announce in the coming months an up-to-date version of its existing 777, with wings made of fuel-saving composite material like the Dreamliner.

Boeing boss Ray Conner said it was going to be a ""great competition"" and said that airlines would ""benefit from the fact that both companies are going to have a good wide-body product line.""

Airbus has positioned the A350 for the market between the popular 777 and the 787, hoping to steal share away from both planes.

The European firm argues that its craft will consume six percent less fuel than the 787 and a quarter less than the 777.

Boeing's strategy, on the other hand, is to offer its clients a wider choice of long-haul airliners.

At last year's Farnborough show in Britain, which alternates with Le Bourget, Boeing came out on top, securing orders worth more than double the sum secured by Airbus.

However, while the big two still dominate the shows, other players are entering the market, with Canada's Bombardier hoping to win orders in the medium-haul segment with its CSeries, a plane with 110 to 130 seats.

""The duopoly is definitely over,"" acknowledged Randy Tinseth, marketing vice-president at Boeing.

But the Paris air show, in its 50th edition this year, is not just about commercial battles and the long-awaited A400M military transport plane will also probably prove a highlight as it takes to the skies.

The market in unmanned surveillance drones will also be in focus after three top European defence companies urged the creation of a European programme to manufacture the craft, currently available only from Israel or the United States.

The Paris Air Show runs from June 17 to 23. It is expected to welcome some 350,000 visitors through its cavernous show halls.

The event, which has become the global aviation industry's largest in terms of surface and number of exhibitors, will throw open its doors to the public on June 21 after first welcoming professionals.

The first flight, just days before the 50th Paris Air Show, is a huge milestone in the A350 program, which is the latest widebody aircraft in the Airbus family.

Much like the Boeing 787, the Airbus A350 has ditched traditional materials, and instead is produced with a combination of composite materials, with titanium and advanced aluminum alloys, as well as a carbon fibre reinforced plastic fuselage. Airbus is claiming a 25% boost in fuel efficiency compared to its competitors, thanks in part to its two new Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engines.

The A350 program has been relatively low key in the media. After the 787 battery malfunctions, Airbus decided to swap out the lithium ion batteries in the A350, instead option for traditional nickel cadmium batteries for entry into service. However, this does not rule out the possibility of switching to lithium ion in the future.

“This first flight marks the beginning of a test campaign totaling around 2,500 flight hours with a fleet of five development aircraft. The rigorous flight testing will lead to the certification of the A350-900 variant by the European EASA and US FAA airworthiness authorities, prior to entry into service in the second half of 2014 with first operator Qatar Airways,” said Airbus via press release.

There are currently 613 orders for the A350, though that number is likely to change during the Paris Air Show. In the United States, US Airways has 22 ordered (18 for the A350-800, and 4 for the larger A350-900), United has ordered 25 A350-900’s, and Hawaiian has ordered 6 of the 800 variant.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9994586110115051}",positive,0.9994586110115051,1

The aircraft uses the same Pratt & Whitney Canada PW127 turboprops engines which power all versions of the C295. The increased power is available from implementing new procedures recently certified by Canada and Spain, permitting operation in the climb and cruise phases at higher power settings at the discretion of the operator. When implemented at higher altitude and hot temperatures, these procedures improve operation over very high terrain such as the Andes or Himalaya mountains with only a minor influence on maintenance cost.

Europe’s newest passenger jet, the Airbus A350, successfully took its maiden flight on Friday.

Around 10,000 spectators, including many Airbus employees, watched as the jet took off from Airbus’s Toulouse plant under cloudy skies. The plane, with its curled wingtips, was carrying a crew of six people equipped with parachutes and orange jumpsuits, along with tonnes of test equipment.

The flight, led by two British and French former fighter pilots, was expected to last four hours and is the result of eight years of development that have cost more than 11 billion euros.

Airbus and Boeing – with its 787 Dreamliner – are engaged in a battle for supremacy in a new generation of lightweight carbon-composite jets designed to save fuel and open new long-distance routes.

A350 flyby expected at Le Bourget

Our Paris correspondent Giovanni Magi“We are confident that we can make the first flight of the A350 at the same time of Le Bourget air show in 2013.” That’s what Airbus’ top manager told me in May 2011, when I was filming a story for our aviation magazine “Fly” in Toulouse. And that confidence turned out to be well founded with the maiden flight performed Friday, June 14, not an easy task when it comes to launch an all-new airliner.

Now the general public expects to see up-close the newest member of the Airbus family. A flyby is scheduled in the skies over Le Bourget next Friday or Saturday, probably at a time when French President François Hollande visits the exhibition.

The A350 should make a low pass over Le Bourget’s runway, in a ‘missed approach’; she will not touch the ground before resuming her route to Toulouse. To make the fly-by possible, the prototype will need to have accumulated at least 10 flight hours in tests over the next few days.

The four-hour flight marks a key step on the path to full certification for the jet, which can carry between 250 and 400 passengers and is the European aircraft maker's best hope for catching up in a long-haul market dominated by Boeing's 787 and 777. Airspace at the airport in the southern French city of Toulouse, where Airbus has its headquarters, closed for both take-off and landing.

Airbus has 613 orders for the A350, and hopes Friday's flight will bring it momentum heading into next week's Paris Air Show, which is already shaping up as a battle of the wide-body planes.

More than half of the twin-engine jet consists of lightweight carbon-fiber designed to save on jet fuel, which makes up half the cost of long-haul flights.

The A350, which was delayed for two years as Airbus hashed out the new design, is a direct competitor with the 787 Dreamliner -- minus the lithium ion batteries now under investigation for unexplained smoldering. Airbus abandoned its plans to use the lithium ion batteries despite their advantages in weight, power and re-charging speed.

""The A350 has the same innovations more or less as the Dreamliner, the 787,"" said Gerard Feldzer, a French aviation expert and former airline pilot. ""It is pretty much equivalent, the same amount or proportion of carbon for the lightness of the material, just as many electrical devices.""

Airbus claims the A350 burns 25 percent less fuel than the Boeing due to its lighter weight, redesigned Rolls Royce engines and new aerodynamics.

Delivery of these aircraft is due to commence in 2018, with plans to operate the aircraft on United Airlines long haul network.

Singapore Airlines has increased its orders for Airbus A350, with commitments for an additional 30 A350-900’s and 20 options that can be taken as a -900 or a -1000 model, firming up an order it has after announcing a commitment to purchase earlier. This increases Singapore Airlines A350 orders to 70 firm and 20 options.

Hong Kong Aviation Capital has signed with Airbus for narrow body jets, with a Memorandum of Understanding for 40 Airbus A320neo and 20 Airbus A321neo (new engine option) aircraft.

Spirit Airlines have also been buying narrowbody Airbus aircraft, with a firm order of 20 Airbus A321’s – as well as converting 10 options it has into orders for another 10 A321’s (orignally A320’s) – a total of 30 aircraft. These will be A321ceo’s (current engine option) featuring Sharlets on as the wingtip devices.

Over at Boeing, a few extra orders to top off the order book.

Travel Service of the Czech Republic will be introducing the 737-MAX 8 into Central and Eastern Europe with the commitment to purchase 3 aircraft.

Oman Air has confirmed an order with Boeing for five Boeing 737-900ER aircraft to add to its existing fleet. This will mean Oman Air will be the first operator of the 737-900ER in the Middle East.

The long-awaited sortie is a milestone for Airbus as it battles against Boeing's 787 Dreamliner for sales of a new generation of lightweight jets made from carbon-plastic material designed to save fuel and open up new long-distance routes.

Boeing was quickest off the mark with the revolutionary carbon-composite technology and its Dreamliner has outsold the A350 with sales standing at 833 aircraft for 57 customers.

Airbus hopes to catch up and also mount a challenge to the U.S. manufacturer's larger, metallic 777 using a later version of the A350.

Airbus's ebullient New York-born sales chief, John Leahy, lost no time in talking up the plane's benefits moments after its Rolls-Royce engines opened up to full power.

Up and away: The new Airbus A350 aircraft takes off for its first test flight from Airbus's plant in Toulouse, France this morning

A large crowd gathered at the runway at the Airbus factory in Toulouse to see A350's first flight

The Airbus A350 will be a rival to Boeing's problematic Dreamliner jets which had to be grounded following battery failures

Airbus is finalising orders from Singapore Airlines , Kuwait Airways and Air France and may add a new customer at the June 17-23 show, analysts say.

Evrard said that Airbus would soon add a customer in the United States, where industry sources say that United Airlines is negotiating to upgrade and expand an existing order to 35 jets.

Airbus initially dismissed the threat posed by the new generation of mid-sized aircraft as it focused on building the world's largest airliner, the A380 superjumbo.

But faced with burgeoning Dreamliner sales, it changed tack and overhauled the design of the A350 by adopting similar composites technology in 2006.

Airbus plans to offer three variants of the A350 XWB, with the smallest, the A350 800, a rival to Boeing's Dreamliner 787-9 and 787-8 jets

The sleek jet with curled wingtips took off with a crew of six wearing parachutes and orange jumpsuits and with tonnes of test equipment on board

The high-tech jet, the company's first all-new plane in eight years, is built primarily from carbon composites and features fly-by-wire technology

To boost sales, Boeing is expected to confirm plans to build a larger version of its Dreamliner. It is also overhauling its 777 with new engines and wings.

The A350 is due to enter service in the second half of 2014 compared with an initial target of 2012 when it was launched as Europe's answer to the light-weight 787 Dreamliner.

Airbus plan to offer three variants of the A350.



The A350-800 is designed to compete with Boeing's 787-9 and 787-8 Dreamliners. It will have space for 270 passengers with a range of 8,500 nautical miles. The two aircraft are almost identical in terms of speed, capacity, range and cost.

AIRBUS A350 800 XWD

CRUISING SPEED: Mach 0.85

CAPACITY: 270 (3 class configuration)

The A350-900, a rival to Boeing's 777-200ER, is expected to seat 314 passengers in a three-class layout with a range of 8,100 nautical miles.

Finally the A350-1000, which is designed to take on the 777-300ER, will seat 350 passengers with a range of 8,400 nautical miles. Boeing, still recovering from problems with the lithium batteries on its 787 Dreamliner, currently dominates the long-haul market with the 787 and 777.



'The first flight is a very special moment in an aerospace company,' Tom Enders, CEO of Airbus's parent company EADS, said late Thursday.

Airbus made the decision to drop Lithium-Ion batteries and switch to traditional nickel-cadmium cells for the A350 in the wake of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner's 'exploding battery' mystery.

European airplane manufacturer Airbus' newest aircraft, the A350, successfully took off on its first test flight on Friday from France’s southwestern city of Toulouse.

With a total investment of $15 billion, the launch of the new aircraft was seen as a major effort by Airbus to challenge its US rival Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner in the long-distance market.

The A350 is Airbus' mid-size long-range airplane seating between 270 and 350 passengers. It is designed to be more fuel-efficient, using 25 percent less fuel compared with existing aircraft of same size and providing an equivalent of reduction in CO2 emissions, according to the company.

Each A350 aircraft costs around $250 to 330 million and consumes 6 percent less oil than Boeing's 787 Dreamliner, according to market analysts.

China also participated in about 5 percent of the design and manufacturing of the aircraft's body.

Friday's flight marked the beginning of a test campaign totaling around 2,500 flight hours with a fleet of five development aircraft.

The aircraft is expected to enter into service in the second half of 2014.

Analysts said the new A350 will gradually replace the older A330, a popular plane that is believed to have generated almost half of the company’s revenues in recent years, according to French media reports.

The company is bullish about future orders for the A350 and is hoping to win more at next week's international air show in Paris.

""I believe that the air show next week should be good for a few hundred orders for Airbus,"" Tom Enders, head of Airbus' parent company EADS, was quoted by Reuters as saying.

To date the A350 has already won 613 firm orders from 33 customers worldwide. China is expected to order 1,000 such aircraft in the next 20 years, according to the company.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9988166093826294}",neutral,0.9988166093826294,0

The bags include RFID chips for next-generation airline baggage handling and a barcode that syncs with an iPhone app that includes a 'Find My Bag' feature that hooks into airline databases to give you up-to-the-minute data on the bags location. They also have a digital scale built into the handle of the bag that talks to the iPhone's app.

Flyers simply lift up on the handle and the digital scale makes sure the bag is beneath an airline's weight limit. The airline believes the bags would cost some 20% more than comparable 'dumb' bags.

Christened 'Bag2Go', the concept has been developed in partnership with mobile carrier T-Mobile and German luggage maker Rimowa. An RFID chip inside the bag lets it work with the increasing number of automated airport and airline baggage-handling systems which can 'pair' smartchipped bagtags with your itinerary and frequent flyer number. A barcode on the bag’s trip-specific label syncs it against your iPhone and can be passed on to your airline booking.

Airbus says it would not sell the bags directly but could license the technology to partner airlines.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9997099041938782}",neutral,0.9997099041938782,0

To provide the air forces of Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Spain, Turkey and the UK - plus first export customer Malaysia - with a tactical airlifter capable of carrying a maximum payload of 37t, the A400M has been designed to occupy a niche between the USA's smaller Lockheed Martin C-130J and larger Boeing C-17.

Craig Hoyle/Flightglobal

Significant product development work is still being conducted on Airbus Military's C295 medium transport, which can carry a cargo of up to 9t. This includes a winglet-equipped production standard to be delivered to customers from 2014, plus a version on offer to several potential buyers with an airborne early warning and control system developed by Israel Aerospace Industries' Elta Systems subsidiary.

Speaking in Seville on 29 May, Ureña-Raso said the company's next development task could be to create an offering to fit below the size of the C-130 Hercules. Possible payload capacities for such a product could be in the 9t area already occupied by the current C295, or in the ""16-18t"" sector, he said. The latter would pit any such transport in the same broad category as Embraer's turbofan-powered KC-390 transport and tanker, which the Brazilian company says will be able to lift between 16 and 23t, depending on mission type. Embraer's developmental product should be ready for service introduction with the Brazilian air force during 2016.

Despite his hints at Airbus Military's possible future development strategy, Ureña-Raso notes that no such activity will be launched in the short-term, while final assembly of the A400M continues to ramp up and the company also pursues a ""second wave"" of orders for its Airbus A330-based multi-role tanker transport, and further orders for its C295 product line.

The event came only days before the Paris Air Show, with lucrative orders expected to come in.

Airbus's next-generation A350 plane landed safely in Toulouse following its first test flight Friday. After just over four hours in the air, the new plane touched down to cheers from Airbus employees and hundreds of aviation enthusiasts who had assembled on a nearby hill to watch the landmark flight.

The plane was manned by a British and a French test pilot plus a number of flight engineers at the back.

Tom Enders, the head of Airbus' parent company, EADS, described the test flight as ""a galvanizing moment"" for the entire group. ""It's a very special moment in the life of a company,"" he commented.

The maiden flight came ahead of Monday's opening of the Paris Air Show. ""I believe the show next week should be good for a few hundred orders for Airbus,"" Enders said.

More than half of the new A350 long-haul plane is made of light composite materials that reduce fuel costs dramatically. It will gradually replace the A330 which has generated almost half of the firm's revenues in recent years.

Eternal rivalry

Airbus hopes the A350 will be able to challenge Boeing's lead in the lucrative long-haul market, particularly after the US rival's problems with its 787 Dreamliner.

Following Friday's maiden flight, the jet is to enter a test-flying period that Airbus hopes will last less than 18 months, with the first delivery expected at the end of next year. Confirmed clients so far include Qatar Airways, British Airways and Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific.

Aviation analyst Nick Cunningham warned that the test-flying period might still reveal a number of problems engineers didn't have on their radar yet. ""They start building aircraft before they finish certifying and testing, so if you run into any issues, it gets very expensive as you have to fix the ones you already built,"" Cunningham explained.

"Airbus A350 Maiden Flight Complete, Looks To Take On Boeing 787 - SlashGear","Fri, 14 Jun 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNsYXNoZ2Vhci5jb20vYWlyYnVzLWEzNTAtbWFpZGVuLWZsaWdodC1jb21wbGV0ZS1sb29rcy10by10YWtlLW9uLWJvZWluZy03ODctMTQyODY0NDkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus A350 maiden flight complete, looks to take on Boeing 787

It may not be the biggest plane to ever fly the skies, but the Airbus A350 is the newest plane by the aircraft manufacturer and it comes touting some unique features. The A350 completed a four-hour flight earlier this morning, which marked the first time that the plane has taken to the skies. It will undergo 2,500 hours of testing before it goes into service starting late next year.

The plane took off and landed at Toulouse-Blagnac Airport in France in front of 12,000 or so onlookers wanting to get a glimpse of the first flight of the new plane. The A350 is a two-engine intercontinental plane, and it's the first new model from Airbus since the A380 jumbo jet that saw its debut in 2005.

The A350 aims to take on Boeing's 787 Dreamliner, and it's mostly built out of lightweight carbon-fiber composites, rather than traditional aluminum. The lighter weight will significantly cut down on fuel costs as well as maintenance costs, but the plane itself wasn't cheap to develop — around $14 billion.

During the flight, the on-board he crew explored the aircraft's flight envelope, and the plane was accompanied by a chase plane that observed and filmed the A350's various maneuvers for analysis later on. Flight experts on the ground were also monitoring the plane in real-time to track its health.

The plane will obviously go through a series of tests involving five A350 aircrafts before it can be certified to fly commercially, and that involves around 2,500 flight hours that need to be completed. However, Airbus is planning for an official launch of the new plane at some point during the second half of 2014 with Qatar Airways getting the first batch of A350s.

Airbus's maiden flight of the prototype A350-900 from Toulouse Blagnac is set to take around 4h and test the basic handling and control characteristics of the twinjet.

The aircraft will probably be flown initially under direct flight-control law, and switched into normal law, while the envelope will be gradually expanded - increasing the airspeed and altitude - if the behaviour corresponds to predictions.

If the flight progresses smoothly the pilots will explore changes in control surface configurations and retract the landing-gear. The jet could even be taken to its maximum operating height of 43,000ft.

A350 programme chief Didier Evrard says the aircraft will ""speak to us"" during the flight test.

But he says the airframer is confident about the development, saying the ""level of uncertainty is not high"".

Six crew members, including pilots Peter Chandler and Guy Magrin, have been selected to fly on board MSN1 which is powered by Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engines.

Its first flight will begin a year-long certification programme which will eventually include five flight-test airframes, two more of which are already undergoing final assembly.

Qatar Airways is to take delivery of the first A350-900 in the second half of 2014. Evrard says the cabin for the first customer is ""fully defined"".

""We have a good grip on the aircraft itself and its customisation,"" he says.

Airbus is marketing the A350-900 as a 315-seat aircraft and intends the twinjet to have a maximum take-off weight of 268t.

"May's top stories: UK unmanned aircraft in flight, Airbus $8.9bn China order - Aerospace Technology","Mon, 03 Jun 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm9zcGFjZS10ZWNobm9sb2d5LmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlcy9mZWF0dXJlbWF5LXN0b3JpZXMtdWstdW5tYW5uZWQtYWlyY3JhZnQtZmxpZ2h0LWFpcmJ1cy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In May, LaserMotive unveiled the world’s first tethered vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) unmanned aircraft system (UAS), which is powered by laser over optical fibre.

InvisiTower is capable of powering any multirotor helicopter using laser power sent through a fibre optic cable, allowing the helicopter to fly as long as power is available on the ground.

The system can be used to support a range of applications in the military and civilian markets, including ISR and situational awareness, communications relay, news and sports reporters, first responders and industrial facility security.

Researchers at German Aerospace Center, Deutsches Zentrum für Luft-und Raumfahrt (DLR), have developed a new receiver and antenna to track aircraft from satellites.

Developed in partnership with the DLR Institute of Flight Guidance in Braunschweig, the new technology will locate the ADS-B (automatic dependent surveillance – broadcast) signals that flights broadcast using a special antenna.



The receiver will be carried onboard the European Proba-V satellite, which is set to liftoff on a Vega launcher, with the primary mission of observing vegetation from space.

Scientists at DLR intend to test during the next two years whether continuous monitoring of aviation routes is possible.

Doha-based carrier Qatar Airways is in talks with European aircraft manufacturer Airbus to purchase up to 15 twin-engine A330 passenger airliners in a deal estimated to be worth approximately $3.6bn.

The airline is considering Airbus aircraft following production delays of 787s and the grounding of its five 787 Dreamliners in January due to battery problems.

The deal is expected to be finalised in June this year during the Paris Airshow.

Qatar Airways is also considering options for the purchase of more four-engine A380 superjumbo airliners.

Also this month, an unmanned BAE Systems Jetstream aircraft known as ‘The Flying Test Bed’ successfully completed its maiden flight, marking the world’s first unmanned flight across the UK-shared airspace.

The aircraft, specially adapted to fly in unmanned mode, took off from Warton in Lancashire and landed in Inverness, Scotland.

BAE Systems noted that this development marked another step forward in the evolution of flight and proves that future technology of this kind could be safe.

The twin-turboprop airliner carried two onboard pilots as a precaution. However, it was under the control of a pilot on the ground at Warton and National Air Traffic Services (NATS) controllers.

Meanwhile in Germany, Eurocopter has officially opened its new Systemhaus helicopter development centre at its Donauwörth site.

The 30,000m² centre provides workspace for approximately 900 employees and offers complete system capability for Eurocopter’s production activity.

The Systemhaus building features testing and research facilities, which include simulators, avionics trainers, laboratories, test centres and a prototype shop.

It is also home to the system support centre (SUZ) for the German armed forces (Bundeswehr) helicopter fleet, including the NH90 and CH-53 transport helicopters, and the Tiger attack helicopter.

Airbus has logged an $8.9bn firm order for 100 single aisle A320 airliners from two Chinese carriers, Air China and its subsidiary, Shenzhen Airlines.

Air China has entered into a purchase agreement to acquire 60 A320 series jets for $5.37bn, based on list prices, and delivery of the aircraft is expected in stages between 2014 and 2020.

Shenzhen Airlines will purchase 40 A320 series aircraft for $3.4bn, with the delivery of airliners expected in stages between 2016 and 2020.

Both airlines will acquire 40 current engine versions of the A320, as well as 60 more fuel-efficient versions with the A320neo.

Helicopter and fixed-wing simulators manufacturer Frasca International has delivered three new flight training devices (FTDs) – two Cessna 172R FTDs and a CRJ-200 Level 5 FTD – to Southern Illinois University (SIU) Carbondale.

SIU has also upgraded its existing Frasca 172R FTD to have the same features as the two new 172R devices, including G1000, a three-channel projected cylindrical visual display and low-profile instructor cab.

The CRJ-200 Level 5 FTD features a three channel 220°x58° spherical visual display system.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999920129776001}",neutral,0.9999920129776001,0

The deal would include orders for about 100 A320neo aircraft with an option for an additional 120 airliners, which will mark the carrier’s first largest order in more than a decade, according to the sources familiar with the matter.

Featuring large Sharklet wing-tip devices, the A320neo will provide a double-digit reduction in NO x emissions and reduce engine noise, according to Airbus.

In addition, it will have more than 95% airframe commonality, making it easily integrated with existing fleets, while offering a further 500nm in range or two tonnes extra payload.

The A320neo is scheduled to enter service from late-2015.



easyJet recently completed the technical evaluation of tenders from Airbus and Boeing, over its decision on the re-engined Airbus A320neo and Boeing 737 MAX, and then moved to a commercial evaluation stage, which is still ongoing.

The airline is expected to make an announcement on the order as early as this week to coincide with the Paris Air Show at Le Bourget, the sources said.

""The airline is expected to make an announcement on the order as early as this week to coincide with the Paris Air Show at Le Bourget.""

The deal would require approval from easyJet shareholders.

Stelios Haji-Ioannou, who established easyJet in 1995 and remains its largest shareholder with a 37% stake, said that the purchase of new aeroplanes would hit shareholder value, and instead the money could be spent on improving returns to investors through dividends or share buybacks.

Mr Haji-Ioannou is seeking to replace easyJet’s ageing fleet of A319s, which constitute about three quarters of the carrier’s fleet, with cost-effective and fuel-efficient 180-seat jetliners.

easyJet started operations in 1995 with Boeing aircraft; however, the airline shifted to Airbus airliners in 2002 when it placed an order for 120 A319s with options for a further 120 jets.

TOULOUSE, France--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- A comprehensive package of Rockwell Collins' information management, communication, navigation, electromechanical and avionics data network systems played a key role in the successful first flight of the Airbus A350 XWB. The flight occurred today in Toulouse, France.

""Watching the first flight of the A350 XWB is a gratifying and monumental occasion for our teams in the U.S. and Europe,"" said Kent Statler, executive vice president and chief operating officer, Commercial Systems for Rockwell Collins. ""This platform is especially important to our company since we've been given the opportunity to lead integration activities that introduce a new level of trust between Rockwell Collins and Airbus.""





Rockwell Collins provides the following systems as standard fit for the A350 XWB:

Information Management On-board

This solution is a new airborne hosting platform for flight operations, aircraft maintenance and airline applications. Monitoring all the systems of the aircraft, it assists maintenance crews by providing secure, detailed information and trends on the health of each component. In addition, it hosts data to the electronic flight bag, helping pilots get easy and instant access to flight plans, aircraft manuals and maps.

Communication System

This system ensures the management of voice and data communications of the aircraft, between pilots, flight crew, controllers and the airline company. It represents the consolidation of five separate packages into one, and encompasses full system integration responsibilities. The package includes next-generation capabilities with improved size, weight and power.

Landing and Navigation Systems

Airbus selected the Rockwell Collins Multi-Mode Receiver and Digital Low Range Altimeter, confirming Rockwell Collins' leadership in flight landing avionics. The Multi-Mode Receiver provides Instrument Landing System and GPS Landing System capabilities and Space Based Augmentation System, as well as the aircraft's position, velocity and time reference. It implements the latest satellite navigation features and is prepared for future airspace requirements such as Galileo.

Story continues

The Digital Radio Altimeter provides precise height measurements above terrain during aircraft approach, landing and climb-out phases of flight. This information is provided to the automatic flight control system, instrument system and terrain awareness and warning system. The Rockwell Collins Digital Low Range Altimeter is the first digital radio altimeter for commercial aircraft.

Rockwell Collins is also providing navigation system components consisting of the ADF-900 Automatic Direction Finder, DME-2100 Distance Measuring Equipment and the VOR-900 VHF Omnidirectional Radio receiver.

Trimmable Horizontal Stabilizer Actuator (THSA)

Rockwell Collins brings decades of experience designing, certifying and manufacturing its market-leading THSA to the A350 XWB. The flight-critical control system is built to withstand no-command-motion and load-path failures, and utilizes multiple electric drive motors for redundancy and maximum availability.

Rudder/Brake Pedal Assembly

As a longer term improvement of the A350 XWB aircraft, Airbus selected Rockwell Collins for the rudder/brake pedal assembly, which is part of the pilot control system. This unit leverages industry-leading applications and multiple generations of design experience in fly-by-wire pilot control systems. The rudder/brake pedal unit converts pilot inputs into an electrical signal that commands rudder movement, and it also controls the A350 XWB's main wheel braking system.

Avionics Data Network

This secure AFDX network represents the backbone of flight avionics data communications. It connects all the aircraft systems and applications. Rockwell Collins is the exclusive supplier of this critical data network on the Airbus A350 XWB, A380 and A400M. Rockwell Collins is also providing navigation system components including the Automatic Direction Finder (ADF-900), Distance Measuring Equipment (DME-2100) and the VHF Omnidirectional Radio receiver (VOR-900).

The A350 XWB (Xtra Wide-Body) is an all-new mid-size long range product line seating between 270 and 350 passengers in typical three-class layouts.

"Incoming Mobile Airport Authority chief Roger Wehner talks Airbus, 'getting things done' - AL.com","Tue, 04 Jun 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsLmNvbS9saXZlLzIwMTMvMDYvaW5jb21pbmdfbW9iaWxlX2FpcnBvcnRfYXV0aG9yLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"MOBILE, Alabama – When Roger Wehner assumes the helm of the Mobile Airport Authority later this month, it will be a homecoming of sorts for the veteran economic developer.

Wehner, who currently serves as president of Birmingham-based Global Resource Group LLC, actually spent a significant chunk of his tenure with Alabama Power Co. on executive loan to the authority while Airbus parent EADS and then-partner Northrop-Grumman Corp. built their business case to lure a lucrative refueling tanker project for the U.S. Air Force to Mobile's Brookley Aeroplex.

The authority oversees both Brookley and Mobile Regional Airport

Specifically, Wehner – whose background incorporates substantial international trade and business development expertise – was charged with first examining and absorbing the intricacies associated with recruiting the supply chain necessary to support a southwest Alabama aerospace cluster and then maintaining those relationships even after EADS archrival Boeing Co. ultimately won the $42 billion contract in February 2011.

“Then, as now with Airbus, the vast majority, of the proposal comes through the airport authority,” Wehner told the Press-Register Tuesday by phone from Orlando.

“That experience, working so closely on the supply chain side – spending so much energy and leveraging resources recruiting that supply chain and growing those relationships to keep Alabama in play even without a project, that was probably the most enjoyable part of my entire career,” he said. ""My forte is just getting things done.""

Consultative, holistic approach

Although born and raised in St. Cloud, Fla., Wehner said he’s been “knocking around” Alabama since the late-1980s and considers it home.

After serving with Special Forces in the U.S. Army, where he specialized in signal intelligence, Wehner parlayed his training into private enterprise, founding Global Resource Group and offering “competitive intelligence” for companies.

“We spent a lot of time doing research and really trying to understand the inner workings of industries we were serving, but mainly we focused on how companies compete against each other,” he said, noting competitive intelligence ranges from helping customers understand competitive pricing strategies to determining market share in certain countries when comparing Brand X and Brand Y.

“And then Uncle Sam gave me an opportunity to go to Afghanistan,” Wehner said. “You close up all relationships the best you can, try to make your clients as happy as possible and you walk away.”

When he returned from the one-year deployment, Wehner said Alabama Power contacted him about a position that melds his strong suits of international marketing and business development.

""They wanted a consultative approach to economic development, and that was the beginning of eight amazing years with Alabama Power, but then along came the opportunity with Safran I just couldn't pass up,"" he said.

‘Airbus’ commitment to Mobile never really wavered’

Safran USA, where he served as vice president for business development, afforded him the opportunity to take seven years of Airbus and EADS supply chain research and really put it to work.

“At heart, I’m a business development guy with a penchant for project management, but my time

at Safran really gave me a deeper understanding of the industry – from inside a Top 10 global aerospace company – as it relates to workforce and supply chain,” he said of the first Airbus-related supplier to establish a physical footprint in Mobile

“They’re a very broad organization with a strong parental structure, and sometimes that presents challenges, but I’m one of those the-harder-the-better kind of guys,” Wehner said. “Working for Safran gave me a real opportunity to take my background to the next level, helping them find synergies in the United States.”

At the same time, Wehner said there are just certain projects – those into which you really poured your heart and soul – that tug at you from time to time, and Mobile's relationship with Airbus always fell into that category for him.

""Airbus' commitment to Mobile has never really wavered. They just went on trying to build the best possible business case to make something happen, and now here we sit with an aircraft assembly plant under construction at Brookley nobody could have even imagined back then."" he said.

Taking the reins

Although final details are still being ironed out, Wehner said he expects to make the trip with the Mobile delegation to the June 17-23 Paris Air Show as executive director of the Mobile Airport Authority, but he plans to be “way on down the road” with plans for Brookley and Airbus before his nameplate hits his new desk when he returns.

Projects of Airbus’ magnitude, he said, funnel through several different phases, including the approach, the recruitment, the landing and then the actual delivery.

“Like I said before, so much of this runs through the Mobile Airport Authority, and that excitement just vanishes if we don’t do our part delivering,” Wehner said.

At the same time, however, the Airbus project itself is only one piece of the puzzle for Brookley and the authority, he said, and it becomes his job as executive director to bring together all of the invested parties to take plans from the drawing board to the assembly line and beyond.

“This really is the exciting part for the authority. This is the bright horizon, and that brings challenges, but I know having done what I’ve done in my past and with my penchant for project management and detailed execution, this is a good marriage,” Wehner said.

Of course, the real “opportunity” phase begins when the first planes start rolling off the assembly line in 2016, extending about 10 years while the cluster stakes its claim and matures.

“That’s where the real work begins, when we start asking ourselves how do we maximize these opportunities. And you have to keep in mind that Airbus is great, but we have other great companies as well, and this is an opportunity to work in concert with all of our partners to build something special along these clusters, and that doesn't come without planning that really needs to start now,” Wehner said.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999849796295166}",neutral,0.9999849796295166,0
Flying on a Special Fiji Airways A330 Media Flight - Airline Reporter,"Thu, 06 Jun 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAxMy8wNi9mbHlpbmctb24tYS1zcGVjaWFsLWZpamktYWlyd2F5cy1hMzMwLW1lZGlhLWZsaWdodC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A media flight is always a special event, but there are a few things that can make it even more special. So how special is a media flight that also happens to be a delivery flight flown by two Airbus “expert pilots” who preformed a 2 hour low altitude fly by with the airline CEO on board as well as the artist responsible for the airlines brand new image? Yea, that is special. What else could Air Pacific, soon to be Fiji Airways, possibly have added to this flight to make it more special? I can’t think of anything. This is the story of a small airline that made a big impression.

Air Pacific is re-branding in a big way, which I detailed in a review of their new Airbus A330. To help promote these big changes, Fiji Airways in cooperation with Tourism Fiji invited a small handful of travel bloggers and journalists, as well as one #AvGeek (me), to fly out to Fiji and witness the delivery ceremonies of their second new Airbus A330.

The night before the flight, Fiji Airways took a large group of travel industry professionals from the Los Angeles area to tour the new aircraft, as they are the people responsible for filling it up with passengers. Fiji Airways is run by smart people and they know that the best way for travel agents to communicate to potential passengers about the nice new aircraft is simply to invite them on board.

The media group was given the first tour, lead by Fiji Airways acting CEO Aubrey Swift, who knew the airplane inside and out. Sadly, we had to leave the aircraft for the night, but we were able to return the next morning for our flight to Fiji.

Bright and early at the Tom Bradley International Terminal at LAX, all of about 30 passengers checked in for the media flight and we took the long walk down to the remote bus gate. I had never boarded like this at LAX before and I’m not sure many people do. We ended up at some concrete ramp of a gate once off the bus, where Namuka-I-Lau, our A330, was waiting for us to board.

The boarding process and subsequent procedures were very standard, which was not what I was expecting for a media flight. We had to push back on time, and after a quick safety briefing, that is exactly what we did. So long, LAX. Hello, 14 hour journey.

Soon after take off, we were served a delicious (but special media flight) breakfast, it was time to explore the aircraft a bit. I had just recently been on a delivery flight a few weeks before, but that flight was packed compared to this one. With only about 35 passengers on board, it was exciting to see so many empty seats, as it meant I could explore the aircraft without bothering anyone else.

The flight was long, and most people on board decided to sleep for a few hours. I, however, had other plans. There was a good amount of light bleeding through the front galley curtains, and I needed to know why. Passing through the curtains, I discovered that the door to the flight deck was open and I quickly asked if I could have a look inside.

Not only did I have a look, but I sat on the jump seat for a solid hour, talking with Fiji Airways Chief Pilot, as well as the two Airbus pilots. Captain Yann Lardet, who holds the official title of “Flight Operations Expert Pilot,” showed me many details of the A330 flight deck, which I never would have known about otherwise.

Watching as Captain Lardet requested an increase in cruising altitude by means of digital communications only was quite interesting. No audible communication was necessary to request the change in altitude.

During my time spent in the flight deck, I inquired about a map that was on the center console and I received the best answer ever. The long, winding, amazing flight plan I spotted turned out to be the plan for our 2 hour, low altitude fly over of the Fiji islands.

When I asked more about the fly over, the pilots were concerned about the weather in Fiji, and that if visibility was too low, it would have to be scrapped. Thankfully, the weather cleared, and our epic two hour tour of Fiji began.

As the fly over began, the travel writers asked me if I had ever been on a fly over like this before, to which I responded with a grin, and a comment along the lines of “hahaha….no.” We dipped down to altitudes as low as 900 feet, banking and turning over the mountainous outer islands of Fiji. The Pacific Ocean zipped by below, as did entire towns and groups of trees.

We would bank heavily to the left, only for moments before the engines roared and we banked hard to the right, creating stunning views out the windows. Our “expert pilots” put the A330 to the test, and it was one hell of a ride…something I am not likely to ever be a part of again. There are no words that can properly describe how awesome this was.

Although this was the airline’s second of three new Airbus A330s, it was every bit as important as the first to the airline and people of Fiji. As a part of Fiji tradition, the pilots quickly made their way down the air stairs, where they were mobbed by a group of women and cloaked in robes. That’s one hell of a welcome!

This media flight was one that I will never forget,as I was able to cross a lot of “firsts” off my list. My first true delivery flight, my first low-altitude fly over, my first time spending a significant amount of time in a flight deck while in-flight. Every minute of this flight was simply amazing, one to remember forever.

Soon I will be sharing my experiences on the ground in Fiji.

'Least safe' aircraft models revealed - Telegraph - The Telegraph,"Wed, 19 Jun 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlbGVncmFwaC5jby51ay90cmF2ZWwvbmV3cy9MZWFzdC1zYWZlLWFpcmNyYWZ0LW1vZGVscy1yZXZlYWxlZC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The website AirlineRatings.com urged travellers to steer clear of four models in particular - the LET410, the Antonov AN-12, the Ilyushin Il-76, and the CASA C-212.

The LET410, for example, has been involved in at least 20 fatal crashes since 2003, according to its research, while the Ilyushin Il-76 and the Antonov AN-12 have each been involved in 17.

The LET410 – introduced in 1970 – is still used by around a dozen airlines, including four in Brazil, three in Honduras, two in the Philippines, two in Russia, and two in Hungary. Citywing, based in the Isle of Man, also uses four LET410s, leased from the Czech carrier Van Air Europe.

The Antonov AN-12 is currently used by Egyptair, Iraqi Airways, and Russia's Aeroflot, among others.

A handful of airlines count the CASA C-212 among their fleet, including Bering Air and Bighorn Airways in the US, while the Ilyushin Il-76 is now largely used for transporting cargo.

Of the 55 models analysed by AirlineRatings.com, the safest were deemed to be Boeing’s 777, 717, 787 and 767/757, the Airbus A380 and A340, the Embraer 135/145, and CRJ 700/1000 – none of which have ever been involved in a fatal accident.

“The crash records of aircraft that dominated the 1970s and 1980s but are no longer in passenger service are irrelevant today,” said Geoffrey Thomas, editor of Airline-Rating.com. “We only looked at aircraft that are carrying passengers in 2013.""

He added: “We have used the Boeing database which is an industry standard and supplemented that with our own records and those of Aviation-Safety.net and Ascend. The survey also ignores piston-powered planes and those smaller aircraft used mainly for charter work.”

Last week the website ranked 425 different airlines in terms of overall safety using a star system. One-star airlines, it claimed, were the least reliable.

A total of 137 airlines have been given seven stars, the top mark, including British Airways, Flybe, Virgin Atlantic, Lufthansa and Aer Lingus. Ryanair, easyJet, Monarch and Jet2.com were each given five stars.

More than 40 airlines were given three stars or fewer, including Lion Air based in Indonesia, Yeti Airlines in Nepal, and Solomon Airlines.

"Airbus Bag2Go smart luggage packs mobile radio, GPS and RFID - TechSpot","Fri, 07 Jun 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hzcG90LmNvbS9uZXdzLzUyODM0LWFpcmJ1cy1iYWcyZ28tc21hcnQtbHVnZ2FnZS1wYWNrcy1tb2JpbGUtcmFkaW8tZ3BzLWFuZC1yZmlkLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Lost luggage could soon be a thing of the past. Well, let me take that back - finding your luggage that the airline lost could soon become much easier if a prototype smart luggage reaches production status. Airbus' Bag2Go luggage is equipped with numerous sensors that can be used to track your luggage as you travel.

Specifically, the luggage contains a GPS tracking device, a 2G mobile chip and an RFID chip. These connectivity elements could be used in conjunction with an iPhone app (we assume Android would be supported as well) and handling systems in an airport to keep track of your checked baggage at all times.

The case is able to alert the owner when it has been opened, either by TSA security workers or perhaps the prying eyes of someone else. The luggage even comes with a scale built into the handle to allow users to weigh it before getting to the airport.

Airbus reportedly worked with German luggage maker Rimowa and T-Mobile to create the prototype. The difference between Airbus' implementation and other luggage tracking accessories is that tracking hardware for the Airbus luggage is built right into the case.

Unfortunately Airbus doesn't have any plans to sell the luggage directly. Instead, they may license the technology to airlines which could then rent the suitcases out to passengers when they travel. Another option would see Airbus use the technology as part of a door-to-door service. Under this idea, the company would pick up the luggage from a traveler's home, take it to the airport and see that it arrives at their destination.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999741315841675}",neutral,0.9999741315841675,0
Video: Composite-Rich Airbus 350 Makes First Flight - Design News,"Fri, 21 Jun 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlc2lnbm5ld3MuY29tL2Fzc2VtYmx5L3ZpZGVvLWNvbXBvc2l0ZS1yaWNoLWFpcmJ1cy0zNTAtbWFrZXMtZmlyc3QtZmxpZ2h00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Airbus A350 XWB, composed of more than 50 percent carbon composites, took off on its successful maiden flight last week. A precise and smooth takeoff and landing over Paris's Toulouse-Blaganc airport bookended the flight, which lasted about four hours.

A lot of ground testing went into the preparation for this event, since Airbus had previously said it expected first flight tests to occur toward the end of summer. This ground testing included powering up the MSN001 flight test version's two Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engines on June 2, which had been installed in the aircraft in March. Before that powerup, Airbus conducted final outdoor ground tests, and other tests such as flight-test-instrumentation verification. In December 2012, the aircraft maker completed indoor ground tests, including stability tests on movable elements such as ailerons, wing spoilers, elevators, and rudder, and tests to ensure extraction and retraction of landing gears.

The MSN001 is the first structurally complete A350 XWB. The plane incorporates more than 53 percent carbon-fiber-reinforced composites by weight, the largest proportion of any commercial jet so far. As we've previously reported, carbon fiber composites are used in the fuselage panels and barrel, the vertical and horizontal tail plane, the wings' upper and lower covers, the wing spars and center wing box, the plane's keel beam, and the main landing gear door and bay.

Both the structural design and aerodynamics of the A350 XWB's wings are expected to contribute considerably to the plane's targeted reduction of 25 percent in fuel consumption. At 32 meters x 6 meters each, they are the biggest civil aircraft components to date to be made from carbon-fiber-reinforced composite. Composite leader Hexcel is supplying most of the plane's carbon fiber composites, both prepreg and fibers, used in its primary structures.

A key issue for planes made with substantial amounts of carbon-fiber-reinforced composites is the danger of lightning strikes. To avoid this, Airbus embedded metallic foils into the aircraft's carbon composite panels, which increases the electrical conductivity of the plane's structures and protects its harnesses with metallic conduits. This design ensures adequate protection for both systems and equipment. Airbus successfully completed electromagnetic hazard testing in April on a second flight test aircraft, the A350 XWB MSN3.

Airbus's A350 XWB is designed to combine widebody passenger comfort with twin engines, instead of the three or four engines required on other widebody jet designs. It will be made in three versions that seat between 270 and 350 passengers each. The plane is scheduled to enter service in the second half of 2014 after flight testing is completed, which will comprise about 2,500 flight hours by five A350 aircraft.

Watch a video of the first flight below. Airbus has also set up a separate website focused on the first flight event, which has more videos, a photo gallery, 360-degree cockpit views, news, and technical specifications.
