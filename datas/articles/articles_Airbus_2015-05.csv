Airbus ships first major aircraft components to Alabama factory | Made in Alabama - Made In Alabama,"Fri, 22 May 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hZGVpbmFsYWJhbWEuY29tLzIwMTUvMDUvYWlyYnVzLXNoaXBzLWZpcnN0LW1ham9yLWNvbXBvbmVudHMtdG8tYWxhYmFtYS1mYWN0b3J5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus established the manufacturing facility in Mobile to assemble and deliver A319, A320 and A321 aircraft to meet the growing needs of its customers in the United States and elsewhere. It is the company’s first U.S.-based production facility, and the fourth in the network which includes Hamburg; Toulouse, France; and Tianjin, China.

Construction began on the $600 million assembly line at Mobile Aeroplex in April 2013. The facility will employ 1,000 people at full production. In June 2014, AIDT, a division of the Alabama Department of Commerce that acts as the state job-training agency, opened a training center at the Aeroplex to help Airbus assemble its workforce.

“This is a day of celebration as we reach another important milestone in aircraft production in the U.S.,” said Airbus President and CEO Fabrice Brégier. “North America is one of the largest single-aisle aircraft markets in the world. This manufacturing facility brings us closer to our customers, and strengthens the aerospace industry in the U.S., Europe and around the world. Production will begin in just a few weeks, with first delivery scheduled for 2016.”

With Airbus launching production of A320 Family passenger jets in Mobile this summer, the capabilities of Alabama’s aviation and aircraft sector now span almost the entire industry spectrum, from research and development to final aircraft assembly, said Greg Canfield, secretary of the Alabama Department of Commerce. In the past three years, Alabama has attracted nearly $900 million in new aerospace capital investment as companies such as Boeing and Lockheed Martin expand in the state.

“Alabama has a long history in aerospace and aviation, but the future looks even brighter because of major developments like the Airbus production launch,” Canfield added. “Our aerospace and aviation sector is poised to reach new altitudes in coming years as major industry players expand their Alabama operations.”

Approximately 200 employees, including some from Mobile who are training in Hamburg, celebrated the first shipment in a ceremony held today to launch the cargo ship. The U.S. Consul General in Hamburg, Nancy Corbett, was on hand for the event. Traditional songs from all four European Airbus nations and the U.S. were played as the ship — bearing German and U.S. flags, as well as the flags of the city state of Hamburg and the state of Alabama — sailed off.

The sea voyage will take approximately 20 days, and can be tracked on Airbus in the U.S. Facebook and Twitter pages, or on www.vesselfinder.com (ship name BBC Fuji)."

"New Airbus A350 XWB Aircraft Contains Over 1,000 3D Printed Parts - 3DPrint.com","Wed, 06 May 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vM2RwcmludC5jb20vNjMxNjkvYWlyYnVzLWEzNTAteHdiLTNkLXByaW50L9IBN2h0dHBzOi8vM2RwcmludC5jb20vNjMxNjkvYWlyYnVzLWEzNTAteHdiLTNkLXByaW50L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"When it comes to manufacturing components within the aerospace industry, 3D printing is gradually inching its way into the process. We have seen numerous applications for end-use 3D printed parts by space agencies such as NASA as well as aircraft manufacturers such as Boeing and Airbus.

The aircraft manufacturing sector will continue to benefit from these technologies as lighter weight, more streamlined aircraft begin rolling off of the production lines. This is certainly true for Blagnac, France-based manufacturer Airbus, who has very recently introduced their Airbus A350 XWB aircraft to market.

The A350 XWB utilizes state-of-the-art manufacturing techniques to reduce the overall weight and increase aerodynamics, ensuring safer, more fuel efficient travel. Available in three different sizes, the 800, 900 and 1,000 models, the A350 is the first Airbus manufactured aircraft with a fuselage and wingspan which are manufactured out of a light-weight carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer. Officially launching in December with the first plane being delivered to Qatar Airways, it was revealed this week that the company has also relied heavily on 3D printing for its production.

Back in March, Airbus had announced that they would be using 3D printing within the new A350 XWB aircraft, however the scale of such use was not divulged. Today Stratasys has announced that over 1,000 parts within the aircraft are 3D printed, replacing out traditionally manufactured parts.

“We are delighted that Stratasys additive manufacturing solutions are being adopted by Airbus for its flagship A350 XWB aircraft. Both companies share a vision of applying innovative technologies to design and manufacturing to create game-changing benefits,” said Dan Yalon, Executive Vice President, Business Development, Marketing & Vertical Solutions for Stratasys. “Our additive manufacturing solutions can produce complex parts on-demand, ensuring on time delivery while streamlining supply chains. Additive manufacturing also greatly improves the buy-to-fly ratio as significantly less material is wasted than with conventional manufacturing methods. Stratasys is looking forward to bringing these and other advantages to its collaboration with Airbus and to being part of Airbus’ Factory of the Future initiative.”

Stratasys used an ULTEM 9085 resin, which is certified to an Airbus material specification, to fabricate each part on an FDM 3D printer, melting the resin and extruding it layer by layer until entire parts are fabricated. This production method not only produces parts which are lighter in weight and incredibly strong, but they also are FST (flame, smoke, and toxicity) compliant. Working alongside Stratasys since 2013, Airbus has managed to save money and reduce manufacturing time to meet their required deadlines.

“We are on the cusp of a step-change in weight reduction and efficiency – producing aircraft parts which weight 30 to 55 percent less, while reducing raw material used by 90 percent,” Peter Sander, head of emerging technologies and concepts at Airbus, said back in March. “This game-changing technology also decreases total energy used in production by up to 90 percent compared to traditional methods.”

As these technologies continues to make tremendous strides, and companies like Airbus continue to look towards such technologies in the production of their aircraft, there is little doubt that the future of manufacturing will see 3D printing playing an ever expanding role. Let’s hear your thoughts on these revelations. Discuss in the Airbus A350 forum thread on 3DPB.com.

Airbus issues software bug alert after fatal plane crash - The Guardian,"Wed, 20 May 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS90ZWNobm9sb2d5LzIwMTUvbWF5LzIwL2FpcmJ1cy1pc3N1ZXMtYWxlcnQtc29mdHdhcmUtYnVnLWZhdGFsLXBsYW5lLWNyYXNo0gFlaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvMjAxNS9tYXkvMjAvYWlyYnVzLWlzc3Vlcy1hbGVydC1zb2Z0d2FyZS1idWctZmF0YWwtcGxhbmUtY3Jhc2g?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has issued a critical alert calling for immediate checks on all its A400M aircraft after a report identified a software bug as having caused a fatal crash in Spain earlier this month.

The aircraft manufacturer’s alert follows the crash of the new A400M military transport plane during a test flight in Seville, in which four Spanish air force crew members died and two were injured.

The aircraft was due to be delivered to Turkey, but the fleet was grounded by the UK, Germany and Turkey following the crash. France, which also has A400M aircraft, did not ground its planes.

According to a report by Der Spiegel, the software problem caused a fault in the control units of three of the aircraft’s four engines causing them power-off shortly after takeoff.

The Spanish defence ministry is currently investigating the crash, but has not released any findings and is keeping data from the plane’s black box private.

After an internal investigation into the plane’s safety, Airbus said on Tuesday: “The Alert Operator Transmission requires operators to perform one-time specific checks of the Electronic Control Units (ECU) on each of the aircraft’s engines before next flight and introduces additional detailed checks to be carried out in the event of any subsequent engine or ECU replacement.

“It is a precautionary measure which is part of our continued airworthiness activities.”

The Airbus A400M is Europe’s largest defence project, costing €20bn (£14.3bn) and developed by European Nato governments seeking to replace ageing military transporters. It has been plagued with problems around the complex software needed to run its four engines – a collaborative effort between Rolls-Royce, Safran and MTU Aero Engines.

Technical issues with refuelling, cargo loading and other operations have caused delays delivering the aircraft, of which Airbus has sold 174 but only has 12 in service. It was expecting to deliver a further 12 this year.

Airbus’s head of its military division Fernando Alonso boarded the aircraft’s last test flight to try and assuage fears over safety, as the company forges ahead with further testing.

The plane manufacturer has previously praised 3D printing as an alternative way to produce lighter parts, with shorter lead times and using fewer materials, making it better for the environment.

Parts such as brackets or panels can be ""grown"" in a printer, which uses computer-aided design information to add layer upon layer of materials such as aluminium, titanium, stainless steel and plastics.

James Woodcock, an expert on 3D printing with Rapid News, told the BBC that the Airbus A350 XWB was using the technology on an ""unprecedented"" scale. ""Historically, the use of 3D printed parts have been in military aircraft rather than commercial passenger jets,"" he said.

Positioned to compete with Boeing's 787 and 777, the first Airbus A350 XWB was delivered to Qatar Airways in December. The airline describes it as a ""next-generation aircraft"" featuring state-of-the-art technology and an extra-wide body. The plane – which is said to be more efficient because of its tapered wing – is currently being used to fly passengers between Doha in Qatar and Frankfurt in Germany, as well as Doha and Singapore.

Stratasys, which manufactures 3D printing equipment, said its technology had enabled Airbus to manufacture ""strong, lighter weight parts while substantially reducing production time and manufacturing costs"".

Aircraft manufacturers, such as Airbus and Boeing, are also developing ""spare parts solutions"" so airlines can print replacement parts as and when they need them. This would reduce the need for large storage areas to keep spare parts, as well as reducing waiting times for parts from manufacturers.

Boeing recently filed a patent application for manufacturing aircraft parts with a 3D printer.

A spokesperson told GeekWire that Boeing had been using 3D printing since 1997 and currently prints around 300 non-metallic parts across ten different aircraft platforms."

3 SHARES

Posted: 27 May 2015 | Jeffrey K.A. Brown, Houston Airport System

With the arrival of the first two Airbus A380 arriving at Houston’s George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH), Chief Development Officer Jeffrey K.A. Brown explains the airports approach to accommodating the aircraft through infrastructure and ground handling operations.

Chances are you’ve heard the phrase “everything’s bigger in Texas.” That simple and direct expression happens to be a tremendous source of pride for Texans, as it encapsulates a very distinct spirit that permeates throughout the Lone Star State and encourages its residents to “think and dream big”. It also happens to be an accurate description of the aviation trend currently unfolding at George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH) in Houston, Texas. With 41 million passengers passing through its gates on an annual basis, IAH is already a major player on the global aviation route map but within the past few years, its presence within the industry has literally been growing, with the arrival of two Airbus A380 aircraft.

The excitement began in August 2012, when Lufthansa Airlines made Houston the first city in Texas to host regular scheduled air service featuring the A380 aircraft, upgauging its nonstop flight to Frankfurt, Germany. Hundreds of Houstonians came out to an airport viewing party, simply hoping to catch a glimpse of the aircraft as it touched down on the IAH runway. Two years later and Emirates made a similar splash on the Houston aviation scene, utilizing the A380 aircraft for its route to Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates.

The arrival of these aircraft is a testament to the strength of Houston’s economy and the diversity of its population. The nation’s fourth-largest city stands as an undisputed leader in the area of job creation, with well-established success in key business sectors such as energy, manufacturing and various medical-related fields. In large part because of this economic success, Houston has also consistently stood as a national leader in the area of population growth, projected by the United States Census Bureau to lead America in this category through the year 2040. One of the most exciting results of this unprecedented growth trend is the fact that Houston now ranks as the most diverse population of any major city found anywhere in the United States. This influx of international flavor has led to two exciting developments, a unique and dynamic cultural experience and a flood of new international air carriers establishing flight operations at George Bush Intercontinental Airport. In fact, between April 2013 and April 2015, 11 international airlines either launched or announced new operations in Houston, Texas.

In many respects, the Airbus A380 aircraft is the perfect personification of this oversized success. Currently the world’s largest commercial aircraft, the A380 has a seat capacity of 544 passengers in a comfortable four-class configuration. But like economic success and population growth, the A380 aircraft also brings with it the need for planning and coordination. Team members with the Houston Airport System (HAS) now have a full appreciation for this fact, having gone through the accommodation process on two separate occasions.

It’s a process that begins with the melding of imagination and models, spending countless hours considering and contemplating various arrangements of various aircraft at IAH. Different gate configurations were evaluated using a host of aircraft, such as the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, Boeing 777 and Boeing 747. The evaluation process quickly led us to several significant hurdles. First, because the aircraft would be parked so close to the international terminal building, there was a tremendous amount of difficulty in finding ample space for the various ground support equipment necessary for the operation of such an aircraft. The second challenge involved the fact that the A380 aircraft requires fueling from both sides and prior to our modifications, the fuel pits at IAH were not found in the required location. And finally, the existing ground power units (GPUs) and pre-conditioned air units (PCA) were not capable of handling the demands of an A380 aircraft.

Upper level boarding had to be provided to load and unload the A380 in a timely manner and to provide an adequate level of service to premium passengers. The terminal building had to be structurally modified, as elevated exterior walkways up to 200’ in length had to be constructed to connect to the new loading bridges. The building electrical system also had to be upgraded to accommodate the increased power demands of the A380 and the PCA units were converted from glycol to electric. Additionally, parking the A380 required taking adjacent gates out of service. To accommodate the dislocated aircraft, other narrowbody gates had to be upgraded for widebody operations.

The matter of time and pending deadlines was also a constant cause for concern during the preparation phase for both Lufthansa Airlines as well as Emirates. Both airlines were understandably anxious to launch the A380 aircraft at IAH and both required a firm deadline as to when the required work would be completed and the inaugural flight could take place. Once again, communication and coordination were absolutely essential in making sure that the most efficient work schedule was followed. HAS team members began an early dialogue with representatives from Allied Fuel in order to make absolutely sure that the new fuel pits were set to be located in the correct location. Similar conversations were initiated with the manufacturer of the necessary loading bridges. Since the Infrastructure staff at George Bush Intercontinental Airport had never installed a dual jet bridge at IAH before, the entire process was new to those involved and the HAS team relied heavily on the expertise offered from those providing the materials. This allowed the work to be completed in an efficient amount of time. In both instances (the Lufthansa Airlines launch and the Emirates launch), the Houston Airport System was facing a deadline that granted them only a few months in which to complete the required tasks. In both instances, the work was completed within the necessary timeframe and the inaugural flights went off without any significant difficulty.

The mission of the Houston Airport System is to “connect the people, businesses, cultures and economies of the world to Houston.” This is a challenge that’s taken very seriously within the ranks of the HAS team and I am proud to say, it’s a challenge that’s been met with unprecedented success in recent years. George Bush Intercontinental Airport is currently enjoying record-breaking numbers in the area of international travel and William P. Hobby Airport (HOU) has set all-time records for passenger traffic in each of the last four years. Houston’s global route map offers nonstop air service to almost 200 different destinations found in the U.S. and around the world, and this historic growth is being accommodated through major construction projects that are either already underway or deep within the planning phase. And the emergence of the A380 aircraft is definitely part of the conversation when HAS leaders discuss future growth plans. The airport system is currently moving forward with the construction of a new international terminal building at IAH, a facility that will feature 15 widebody-capable gates. Four of those gates will be specifically designed to accommodate the Airbus A380 aircraft.

The world may be getting smaller but everything is still bigger in Texas. And within the Houston Airport System team, there is a belief that those two realities can coexist in perfect harmony, provided the necessary coordination and planning is allowed to take flight."
Airbus Innovation days: A350-1000 getting real - Leeham News and Analysis,"Thu, 28 May 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNS8wNS8yOC9haXJidXMtaW5ub3ZhdGlvbi1kYXlzLWEzNTAtMTAwMC1nZXR0aW5nLXJlYWwv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Bjorn Fehrm

Introduction

May 28, 2015, c. Leeham Co. We are visiting the Airbus Innovation days where we have been given an update all Airbus civil aircraft programs. The perhaps most interesting update is the progress of the A350-1000 as its forerunner, A350-900, is ramping its production to 15 aircraft during 2015.

The A350-1000 is next in turn; it will be flying next summer and will enter service with first customer Qatar Airways summer of 2017. The A350-1000 is getting more real and Airbus gave a good insight to the aircraft’s readiness for prime time during the sessions of today.

The changes to A350-1000 compared to A350-900 is described in Figure 1.

Design improvements

The A350-1000 is building on all the knowledge and data that Airbus has gathered on the A350-900. With this experience and knowledge, Airbus has taken the chance to go one step further in a number of areas to gain further weight and reliability advantages for A350-1000, Figure 2.

Primary areas of improvements are:

Airbus is increasing the Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastic, CFRP, content of the aircraft. Fuselage door surrounds and a portion of the fuselage frames were made with Titanium and Aluminium on A350-900. This will now be changed to CFRP, gaining both weight and cost advantages by means of reduced structural maintenance requirements (CFRP is almost immune to fatigue and requires less inspections).

Airbus has also done some other improvements. The bilge area below the cargo floor has got a new frame support structure and the aircraft’s nose landing gear doors are now electrically instead hydraulically actuated, simplifying door installation and maintenance.

Finally their are a number of clean ups on the electrical side. A CFRP aircraft means electrical routing is increased as the fuselage structure no longer offers electrical conductivity. The electrical network on A350-900 is rather elaborate as result. The designers have found simpler solutions for the -1000, requiring fewer connections, something that saves both weight and sources of future trouble as connectors are prone to bad contact when getting old.

Airbus has also worked on increasing A350-1000 competitiveness versus Boeing’s 777 by increasing the cabins passenger carrying capability. We have presented the changes in our article A350-1000 gets upgrade to 387 seats. These changes will be vital in the competition with Boeing’s 777X, which will come in to the marketplace in 2019-2020.

Program readiness

The A350-1000 is swiftly moving through Airbus program management gates with final design freeze late last year and sub component production having started immediately thereafter, Figure 3.

This meant that material, like forgings, could be cut to their final dimensions (having been cast earlier and machined down to rough dimensions) and fuselage and wing skins in CFRP could be taped out in Spain, Germany and US.

Subsystems that had to be changed from A350-900, like the air conditioning system (to cater for 369 passengers instead of 315 for the -900 version), had their final interface specifications frozen and could now be finally configured.

First versions of all these parts could now be produced and be delivered during the spring and summer to three Pre-Final Assembly Line sites:

St Nazaire in France for the Nose and middle section of the fuselage.

Hamburg Germany for the rear section of the fuselage.

Bremen Germany for the aircraft’s wings, there being built up to full wings based on wing boxes produced at Broughton, UK.

The actual Pre-FAL assembly with integration of all parts and installation of system starts in August. It will take these sites until January-February 2016 to complete their sections and to deliver them to the A350 FAL in Toulouse.

In addition to these parts from the Pre-FAL sites, empennage parts get built in Spain for the horizontal stabilizer and tail cone with Hamburg doing the vertical stabilizer. Engines are delivered from Rolls-Royce Derby and landing gear from United Technologies’ Goodrich division.

The fuselage sections gets delivered to Station 59 of the FAL to get large test equipment and monuments installed. Then the sections will be joined in Station 50, which has been expanded to three parallel stations to cater for A350-1000 production. The next production stop, Station 40, has also been expand, this time to four in parallel to have A350-1000 test aircraft production and subsequent production ramp to not affect the ramp up of the A350-900. The next step also has been expanded, system integration and test in Station 30, to four sites in parallel.

Airbus COO Tom Williams commented that the reduction of A330 production to six per month for next year is not all bad for Airbus. The reduction in A330 activity is happening as A350-900 and -1000 are ramping up. The A330 and A350 share the outstations to test fuel and pressure systems (Station 18) and the hangars to fit interiors and engines (C63 etc). Facilities and people from A330 FAL can therefore help the A350 program through their challenging period of -900 ramp and start of -1000 production next year.

Flight test

The flight test for A350-1000 will start this year as the 97k lb -1000 engine will be flight tested on Airbus A380 like it was done for the -900 engine. Testing will contain approximately 120h flight hours where also certain engine certification test will be completed. This contributed to risk reduction and a smooth flight test on the A350-900 and will therefore be repeated for the -1000.

Flight testing of the first complete A350-1000 will start next summer and span a nine month test program with three test aircraft flying a total of 1500 hours. Certification is foreseen for Q2 2017 followed by first customer delivery.

Summary

The first A350-1000 will be delivered to Qatar Airways in summer of 2017. It will be a significant event as this is the head on competitor to Boeing’s successful 777-300ER. The Entry into service of A350-1000 will thereby mark a new chapter in the widebody competition between Airbus and Boeing.

Airbus Warns of Possible A400M Engine Glitch - Defense News,"Tue, 19 May 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS90cmFpbmluZy1zaW0vMjAxNS8wNS8xOS9haXJidXMtd2FybnMtb2YtcG9zc2libGUtYTQwMG0tZW5naW5lLWdsaXRjaC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Airbus on Tuesday warned of a technical bug potentially affecting the engines of its A400M that was discovered during an internal test after one of the military planes crashed in Spain, according to Agence France-Presse.

The company said in a statement it had sent out an alert to its clients urging them to carry out ""specific checks of the Electronic Control Units (ECU) on each of the aircraft's engines.""

The ECU controls how the aircraft's engine operates.

The potential flaw was uncovered during internal checks separate from an official investigation into the crash of an A400M cargo plane near Seville in which four people were killed 10 days ago.

""To avoid potential risks in any future flights, Airbus Defence and Space has informed the operators about necessary actions to take,"" the company said in a statement.

The crash of the A400M a few minutes into a test flight just north of Seville's airport prompted Spain, Britain, Germany, Turkey and Malaysia to ground their planes.

France, which has six of the A400M planes in active operation, said it would only carry out the most pressing flights until more details emerge on why the military aircraft went down.

Two of the six people on board the plane, a mechanic and an engineer, survived the crash and were sent to a hospital in a critical condition.

The A400M, a large, propeller-driven transport aircraft, was launched in 2003 to respond to the needs of seven NATO members – Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Spain and Turkey – with Malaysia joining in 2005.

A total of 174 A400M planes have since been ordered by the eight nations, which are seeking to replace their aging Hercules fleets.

The plane's 12-wheel landing gear allows it to land on soft and rough airstrips as short as 750 meters, making it ideal for military and humanitarian missions."
Airbus Safran's Ariane 6 Bid is In; CNES Buyout Unresolved - SpaceNews,"Fri, 15 May 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9haXJidXMtc2FmcmFucy1hcmlhbmUtNi1iaWQtaXMtaW4tYnV0LWNuZXMtYnV5b3V0LWlzLXVucmVzb2x2ZWQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Airbus Safran Launchers has submitted its formal bid to design and build Europe’s next-generation rocket, a contract to be valued at around 3.2 billion euros ($3.6 billion) that the European Space Agency hopes to sign by the end of June.

The contract does not include a new Ariane 6 launch pad, a contract with an estimated value of about 600 million euros that is under the responsibility of the French space agency, CNES, not the industry team.

Airbus Safran’s bid, submitted May 7, will be put on a fast-track evaluation at ESA, which with Airbus Safran Launchers has already determined most of the details. The goal is to develop the vehicle in time for an inaugural launch in 2020.

What remains unclear is how large a portion of the 3.2-billion-euro total development cost will be shouldered by industry. Both Airbus Safran Launchers and its principal subcontractors. ESA and Airbus had, in effect, agreed to disagree in mid-March about an ESA-requested industrial contribution of up to 400 million euros.

Airbus Strategy Diretor Marwan Lahoud said May 6 that industry remained willing to pay a share of the development charges as part of an overall rebalancing of responsibility between Ariane manufacturers and European governments.

One sticking point has been whether the contract’s final signature would be slowed by ongoing negotiations over the cost to Airbus Safran Launchers of the approximately 34 percent stake in the Arianespace launch consortium now owned by the French government -— mainly through CNES.

Airbus had said it wanted to conclude a purchase of CNES’s Arianespace shares in advance of a contract, or at least at around the same time. CNES officials have declined to set a deadline.

“You can’t take on responsibility without financing a portion” of the development charges, Lahoud said of the Ariane 6 financing scheme in testimony to the French National Assembly, or parliament. “Industry will pay a portion, and when I say industry I mean mainly Airbus and Safran, which are the two gorillas in the space launch business.”

The fate of Evry, France-based Arianespace following a purchase of the CNES shares — which would give Airbus Safran Launchers a 74-percent stake in the launch services company — is unknown.

The German and Italian Arianespace shareholders have expressed reservations about having an Airbus takeover. Some government officials have added that either CNES or ESA should maintain some ill-defined presence in the company as well.

In his testimony, Lahoud sought to reassure satellite builders, including Thales Alenia Space of France and Italy, that an Airbus-controlled Ariane 6 would not lead to commercial or design biases in launcher sales.

He said just as missile-maker MBDA works just as hard to sell to both Europe’s Eurofighter and the competing Rafale jet fighters despite MBDA’s being owned by Eurofighter shareholders, Airbus Safran Launchers will ensure strict neutrality with respect to all satellite builders.

While the development of Ariane 6 and the effort of Arianespace and Airbus Safran Launchers to adapt the current Ariane 5 to the commercial market have received most of the publicity in recent months, Lahoud said a similar revolution was occurring in the satellite business.

He said Airbus Chief Executive Tom Enders had asked Airbus’ management team to join him on a tour of California’s Silicon Valley to take the measure of the new business practices that were born there and are now spreading to the space industry.

The key to the revolution, he said, is that satellites will now be built so that they can be delivered by the tens every month for tens of thousands of euros, rather than custom-made spacecraft that takes two years to build and costs tens of millions of euros.

Airbus Defence and Space is one of several companies bidding on the OneWeb global Internet-delivery constellation managed by OneWeb LLC of Britain’s Channel Islands.

Lahoud said Airbus, whose missile, helicopter and aircraft divisions already deliver at this rate, is well-placed to use intra-company synergies to adapt to the new satellite market.

“Building satellites in this way forces you to think in new ways about space applications,” he said. “[O]ur visit to Silicon Valley took me back to my youth as an engineer. We need to question anew the way we are doing things.”"

""Airbus is devastated to confirm that of a total crew of six on board we have lost four of our crew members in the accident,"" the company said. ""Two other crew members are currently in hospital in a serious condition"".

All the crew members are Airbus employees and are Spanish, the company said.

""We express our deepest sympathy. They were fellow countrymen,"" said Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, Reuters reported.

The A400M aircraft crashed around 1 p.m. local time after taking off from Seville airport at 12: 45 p.m. for a first production flight, the company said. Airbus had planned to deliver the MSN023 in June as the third A400M for Turkey.

Television channel Telecinco carried footage of dense black smoke rising from the crash as filmed by a passing car, and there was video showing fire engines and other emergency vehicles at the wreckage.

Airbus is sending a ""go-team"" of company experts to the scene and is cooperating with the authorities, the company said.

Turkey signed in 2003 an order for 10 A400Ms, with the last of the units due to be delivered in 2018. Turkey has previously complained about a late delivery of the Airbus aircraft and expected to claim penalties.

Airbus handed over the first two aircraft for Turkey last year and a further two were due this year.

Airbus Military has an assembly and test site for transport aircraft here.

Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Spain and Britain have also ordered the A400M. The orders total 174 of the units and 12 delivered and operating, said the Airbus website. The company has dubbed the plane the Grizzly."
"Pontifications: the A380, Airbus and Boeing - Leeham News and Analysis","Mon, 04 May 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNS8wNS8wNC9wb250aWZpY2F0aW9ucy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"May 4, 2015, c. Leeham Co. Of all the things we write about, nothing stirs responses and readership than news–of any kind–about the Airbus A380.

Last week I wrote about Malaysia Airlines putting a large number of its Airbus and Boeing wide-bodies for sale or lease. MASCargo’s entire fleet of Boeing 747-400s and Airbus A330Fs is on the chopping block. Some Boeing 777-200ERs are, too. The six A380s (all of those in the MAS fleet) are also being offered for sale or lease.

Holy crap. This news headlined not only international press but sent the social media into a frenzy. Within 12 hours it had become our second most read story of 2015. In less than 36 hours, it became our top story of the year so far.

I also wrote last week about the 10 year anniversary of the A380. It was a mixed review: the plane is a technological success, if by now a bit dated, but sales continue to be poor. I talked about the prospect of an A380neo and how Boeing is rooting for Airbus to proceed, sucking up money and resources in the process. I wrote about the urban legend that Boeing tricked Airbus into launching the A380 program as a way to divert money and resources.

And then I suggested that Boeing’s own failed strategy, ineptitude and arrogance prevented the company from taking advantage of Airbus’ focus on the A380.

You’d have thunk I dropped a skunk at a lawn party.

One reader suggested I was part of the Airbus PR department or Airbus’ John Leahy ghosted the article. Never mind that the day before I wrote a strong defense of the Boeing 787 and suggestions that “everyone” was deferring the 787; and gave an equally strong defense of the 787 in TheStreet.com. Perhaps Boeing’s Randy Tinseth ghosted my article and impersonated me to The Street.

I didn’t go into detail in my article about Boeing’s “failed strategy, ineptitude and arrogance” because I thought after all these years, these were pretty obvious. Apparently not. So I’ll hit some highlights.

Failed strategy

Go all the way back to the merger between Boeing and McDonnell Douglas. The financially-driven McDonnell family and MDC CEO Harry Stonecipher pushed onto Boeing the (failed) MDC strategy of developing more derivatives instead of developing new airplanes. The 757-300 and 767-400 were sales duds. Research and development was starved for money. Proposals for the 747-500/600/X went nowhere.

When it came time to fish or cut bait on whether to launch the 7E7 (later named the 787), debate in the board room centered around developing this airplane for much less money than it cost to develop the 777. Lynn Lunsford, then the aerospace writer for The Wall Street Journal, wrote on April 21, 2003, a detailed insider’s look at board considerations. This cost-cutting approach led to the failed industrial partnership that later so bedeviled the 787 program. Irony of irony, one board member who cautioned against overly focusing on costs was–Jim McNerney, who warned doing so could allow Airbus to overtake Boeing. His warning, it turned out, was spot on.

From this core failed strategy of international industrialization, the insidious knock-on effects have set Boeing back for decades in its competition with Airbus. If the 787 had entered service in May 2008 as planned, then Boeing was going to develop a clean-sheet replacement for the 737, followed by a clean-sheet replacement for the 777. We all know what’s happened since: Airbus maneuvered Boeing into doing the 737 MAX and, with no stomach for the risk associated with a new design, Boeing settled for an extreme makeover of the 777 in the form of the 777X in response to the A350-900/1000. The MAX 7 is the new 737-600 and the MAX 9 can’t hold its own with the A321neo.

If Airbus spent too much time, effort, money and resources on the A380, what does this say about the 747-8, especially the 747-8I?

Ineptitude

This is inside baseball stuff, but Boeing’s sales process is cumbersome to the point of absurdity, complain Boeing insiders. There is a committee process that takes a long, long time to go through. At Airbus, when necessary, Group CEO Tom Enders, Airbus Commercial CEO Fabrice Bregier and super-salesman Leahy can make a decision in an hour, according to customers. Boeing has lost deals due to its process, Boeing insiders tell me. None of this is new; The Wall Street Journal wrote about process years ago. It just hasn’t changed.

Furthermore, while Airbus coordinates efforts between sales and support services, the Boeing insiders complain sales and its support group (Commercial Aviation Services, or CAS)–because over the high emphasis on each being its own profit center–make it difficult to offer competitive packages to match or beat Airbus.

Arrogance

Boeing’s arrogance is well known and decades ingrained. Wags even say the stock symbol is “BA” for a reason. Sales campaigns have been lost because Boeing refused to believe customers were seriously considering the A320 (think legacy United Airlines and Frontier Airlines, campaigns that date to the 1990s and 2000s; and jetBlue, also to the 1990s). None of this is new. The Wall Street Journal wrote about this, too.Things haven’t changed, either. Boeing sales was said to be gobsmacked when Delta Air Lines ordered the A321ceo instead of adding to its existing order for the 737-900ER.

Or that the A320neo was an inferior plane to the 737NG and would never be launched. Not only was the A320neo launched, it became the fastest selling airliner in history and Airbus flipped several 737 operators.

Think Boeing’s insistence that the 737-900ER and the MAX 9 are better than the A321ceo/neo; the market thinks otherwise, and the A321 comfortably outsells the 737 counterparts.

Think Boeing’s insistence the 747-8I is better than the A380. The A380 has around 90% of the VLAP sector. The market has spoken again.

Do I suggest that Airbus has bettered Boeing on strategy and arrogance? In some cases yes, in some cases no. Generally speaking, Boeing’s wide-body strategy has been better than Airbus. One need look no further than the A340 to look at a failed strategy, and the A300s were inferior to the Boeing 767. Airbus had to try four or five times to get to the A350 XWB and the -800 was a dud and the -1000 has challenges. But Airbus has reached sales parity in recent years in the wide-body sector while surpassing Boeing in single-aisle market share.

Airbus is not without its own arrogance, either. But Boeing has this down to a science, with decades more experience.

Separately…

Boeing CEO Jim McNerney is threatening jobs (again) if he doesn’t get his way (again). McNerney is right on the larger picture–renewal of the ExIm Bank–but his threats are not only tiresome but in this case a bit suspect. McNerney’s desire to emasculate the SPEEA engineering union is well known. One can’t help but wonder if McNerney might be taking advantage of the situation to continue snipping away.

Boeing is asking Oklahoma for $6m in incentives to move jobs from Washington to OK, according to a Washington State legislator. While other states tie jobs-to-incentives, our buffoon government in Washington lets Boeing take our tax breaks and moves jobs to other states for more tax breaks.

Frank Shrontz, a former CEO of Boeing, has interesting thoughts about today’s Boeing vs his Boeing in this Puget Sound Business Journal article.

Spanish Air Force Takes Over Airbus A400M Crash Probe - Defense News,"Thu, 14 May 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS9ob21lLzIwMTUvMDUvMTQvc3BhbmlzaC1haXItZm9yY2UtdGFrZXMtb3Zlci1haXJidXMtYTQwMG0tY3Jhc2gtcHJvYmUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"MADRID — Spain's air force has taken over the investigation of the crash of an Airbus A400M military cargo plane near Seville which killed four men, a defense ministry spokesman said Thursday.

The Spanish government intially charged a civilian team made up of experts from the transport and defense ministries to probe the crash, the first of an A400M airlifter.

The civilian team ""took the decision to withdraw because they understood that the plane has specific characteristics due to its military configuration which they were unfamiliar with,"" he said.

Spain's military air crash investigation agency, CITAAM, took charge of the investigation at the beginning of the week, he added.

The A400M plane that crashed in a field and burst into flames just north of Seville's airport on Saturday was several minutes into a test flight before it was due to be delivered to Turkey in July.

Two of the six people on board the plane, a mechanic and an engineer, survived the crash and are in hospital in serious condition.

A funeral mass was held at Seville's cathedral on Tuesday for the four men who died in the crash.

Spain on Tuesday became the fifth country to ground its A400Ms pending the outcome of the crash investigation, following similar decisions by Britain, Germany, Turkey and Malaysia.

France, which has six of the planes in active operation, said it would only carry out the most pressing flights until more details emerge on why the plane went down.

German newsweekly Der Spiegel reported that the plane experienced multiple engine failure, citing comments by one of the crash survivors."

In a sign of the company's confidence in the plane, the boss of Airbus Military Fernando Alonso was onboard the test flight, which took off from the company's Toulouse, France headquarters bound for Seville, site of Saturday's crash.

""The A400M behaved normally, all scheduled tests were carried out. This is our tribute (to the victims),"" Alonso wrote on his Twitter account.

Onlookers and journalists applauded as the huge transport plane landed at Seville airport at 4:35 p.m (1435 GMT) after doing a loop above the runway.

Passengers on the A400M were met at the airport by Airbus staff before heading to Seville's cathedral for a memorial mass for the victims of the crash, the first of an A400M military airlifter.

The A400M that crashed in a field and burst into flames just north of Seville's airport was several minutes into a test flight, and due to be delivered to Turkey in July.

Two of the six people on board the plane, a mechanic and an engineer, survived the crash. They are in hospital in serious condition.

Earlier Tuesday, Spain became the fifth country to ground its A400Ms awaiting for the causes of the accident to become clearer, following similar decisions by Britain, Germany, Turkey and Malaysia.

France, which has six of the planes in active operation, said it would only carry out the most pressing flights until more facts emerge on why the plane went down.

""Obviously, as a precaution, while waiting for the results of the investigation, it is better if the planes in production and which are about to be tested do not fly without knowing what actually happened,"" Spanish Defence Minister Pedro Morenes said on radio station Onda Cero.

'Fully confident in plane'

Spanish authorities on Sunday located the two cockpit recorders and handed them over to the judge investigating the cause of the accident.

The plane experienced multiple engine failure, according to a report in German newsweekly Der Spiegel, which cited comments from one of the crash survivors.

The A400M is a large, propeller-driven transport plane that is being assembled in Seville.

The plane's 12-wheel landing gear allows it to land on soft and rough airstrips as short as 750 meters (2,500 feet), making it ideal for military and humanitarian missions.

It was launched in 2003 to respond to the needs of seven NATO members — Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Spain and Turkey — with Malaysia joining in 2005.

A total of 174 A400M planes have been ordered by the eight nations, which are seeking to replace their ageing Hercules fleets.

About 20 of the planes are currently on the assembly line in different stages of production, Airbus said, and all must undergo testing before they can be delivered to clients.

Airbus said it is ""too early to know what impact (Spain's) decision will have on the supply chain.""

""We are working closely with military authorities and with our clients to deal with this situation,"" a company spokeswoman said.

""We want to show our clients, air forces, that we are fully confident in this excellent transport plane,"" Airbus chairman Tom Enders said in a letter to employees on Monday, in which he said test flights would continue as planned.

There are a total of 12 A400M planes currently in service — in addition to the six operated by France, Britain and Turkey have two each and Malaysia and Germany both have one."
Delta gets first '242-ton' variant of the Airbus A330 - USA TODAY,"Thu, 28 May 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS90b2RheWludGhlc2t5LzIwMTUvMDUvMjgvZGVsdGEtZ2V0cy1maXJzdC1tYXhpbXVtLXRha2VvZmYtd2VpZ2h0LWFpcmJ1cy1hMzMwLzI4MDczMTUxL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Delta gets first '242-ton' variant of the Airbus A330

BLAGNAC, France -- Airbus delivered its first 242-ton variant of the A330-300 to Delta Air Lines Thursday evening at the jetmaker's headquarters in southern France.

The plane is Airbus' latest version of its A330 long-haul widebody jet, capable of flying farther and taking off with more weight than prior versions of the jet. Delta is the launch customer.

""We are very pleased to be taking delivery of the A330 242T"", President Ed Bastian said during brief remarks at a press conference.

Delta says it will use the jet on both trans-Atlantic and trans-Pacific routes, taking advantage of the 242T's expanded cargo-capacity and range.

Part of an order announced by the airline in September, 2013, nine more of the new-variant A330s will come to Delta during the next two years. The aircraft will be used in part to replace the carrier's aging Boeing 747 fleet.

They'll join the Delta's existing fleet of 32 A330 -200s and A330-300s, acquired in 2009 when it merged with Northwest Airlines.

Delta also has 25 next generation A330neo aircraft on order, with the first expected to deliver in 2019.

So far, Airbus says 11 airlines have ordered the 242T.

The airplane will expand the aircraft's range by up to 500 nautical miles, enabling flights up to 15 hours. Airbus says the modifications will result in up to 1% fuel burn savings over current models. And Delta adds that it expects its new A330-300s to be 15%-25% more fuel efficient per seat than the Boeing 767-300s and 747-400s they will replace.

As for the 242T variant of the A330, the incremental variant will likely be the last to be introduced on the A330, which debuted in 1994. The current generation of A330 will be replaced in late 2017 by a next-generation version of the plane, dubbed the ""A330neo.""

Until the introduction of the neo, however, Airbus faces a worrisome production gap for its A330 assembly line. Already, Airbus has lowered production rates for its ""A330 classic"" models several times -- most recently to six per month from nine. That comes as the jetmaker tries to prevent a potential stoppage in the line by delivering all of the ""class A330s"" that have been ordered before the ""neos"" come online.

Incremental improvement packages, such as the 242T, have been aimed at extending airlines' interest in the classic A330s while Airbus readies for A330neo production. So far, results to date have been mixed.

The company has also launched an A330 ""regional"" in 2013. That A330 variant is aimed at the rapidly ballooning Chinese domestic market, though the airplane has not yet won Airbus any orders. Executives initially said it expected as many as 200 orders, though CEO Fabrice Bregier said on Thursday that he remains confident the market will develop.

Airbus executives suggested that several A330 classic orders could be on the horizon for the upcoming Paris Air Show, set for mid-June.

Airbus Helicopters demonstrates low-noise IFR operations at airport with commercial traffic - Vertical Magazine,"Tue, 12 May 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2FpcmJ1c2hlbGljb3B0ZXJzZGVtb25zdHJhdGVzbG93bm9pc2VpZnJvcGVyYXRpb25zYXRhaXJwb3J0dy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A discussion between a flight test pilot and engineers before the H175’s flight. Airbus Helicopters Photo

Airbus Helicopters has achieved another key milestone in more eco-friendly rotorcraft operations by successfully demonstrating low-noise helicopter instrument (IFR) approaches at an airport with commercial airline traffic.

As the final outcome of a seven-year project devoted to environment-friendly helicopter approach procedures, Airbus Helicopters used an H175 helicopter to fly low-noise IFR approaches to the heliport of Toulouse-Blagnac airport in south-western France.

The approach procedures were flown using accurate lateral and vertical guidance provided by EGNOS (European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service), the European Satellite-Based Augmentation System (SBAS), and in the presence of airplane traffic simultaneously approaching and departing to/from airport runways, which proved the suitability of these helicopter-specific procedures to achieve Simultaneous Non Interfering (SNI) aircraft and rotorcraft IFR operations at a medium-size commercial airport.

“Airbus Helicopters is the world’s first helicopter manufacturer to demonstrate such helicopter- specific IFR procedures at a heliport located at an airport with commercial airline traffic,” said Tomasz Krysinski, the Head of Innovation and Research at Airbus Helicopters. “We are confident these environment-friendly IFR procedures will contribute to easing helicopter access at airports and remote sites in noise-sensitive areas, thus paving the way for the development of passenger transport with high-speed helicopters.”

The low-noise helicopter-specific IFR approach procedures are based on the noise optimized flight paths successfully validated in 2013 by Airbus Helicopters with an H155 and having demonstrated noise footprint reductions of up to 50 per cent, which is one of the Clean Sky initiative’s high-level goals.

Detailed design and integration of the procedures in Toulouse airspace was achieved by GARDEN, a partner project with expertise in Air Traffic Management (ATM) that supports Airbus Helicopters in Clean Sky.

Airbus Helicopters performed this demonstration as part of Clean Sky’s Green Rotorcraft Integrated Technology Demonstrator program. Clean Sky is Europe’s most ambitious aeronautical research program, with the goal of developing breakthrough technologies that significantly increase the air transport sector’s environmental performance – resulting in quieter, more fuel efficient aircraft and rotorcraft."

Flying the Airbus A350 - Leeham News and Analysis,"Mon, 25 May 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNS8wNS8yNi9mbHlpbmctdGhlLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzUwL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Bjorn Fehrm

Introduction

May 25, 2015, c. Leeham Co. Friday we showed our little video from our test flight of Airbus A350 at end of April. Now it is time to describe the impressions during the flight more in detail. Different from the excellent reports of other magazines that were present, we will look deeper into flying an aircraft with Fly By Wire in contrast to a conventionally controlled aircraft and less in trying to compare the A350 with other airliners, as we don’t have this experience.

Our lack of experience in flying airliners has an advantage when it comes to first impression of how it is to fly the much-discussed Airbus Fly By Wire (FBW) concept. My experience so far has all been non-FBW aircraft, from very small and slow (Tiger Moth) to the fast and a bit larger (Mach 1.7 SAAB Draken). In all, I’ve flown 14 different types. To that, one can add having flown the Embraer KC-390 simulator last October. Some of the aircraft have had no servos. Others had 100% servos with artificial feel through springs working on the stick. Autopilots have differed widely from wings leveler to flight director aircraft with coupled ILS approaches. None has had auto-thrust to date except for the KC-390.

Discussion

My primary interest with flying an aircraft like the A350 is to get a feel for how natural such an aircraft is to fly for someone coming from conventional aircraft. The Airbus is controlled in a way which is easiest described as being in constant autopilot attitude hold mode. When no input is given on the stick, the aircraft keeps its attitude. This is also true when the speed varies. A conventional aircraft would lower the nose when speed decays and start the slow rollercoaster called phugoid oscillation. Not so the Airbus. It stays put until one commands otherwise.

Coming totally green to this environment gives one a possibility to see how easy it is to adapt to such an aircraft when having basic flying skills and having learned the aircraft’s automation systems using a desktop simulator based on the first FBW aircraft that Airbus made, the A320. The ease of adaptation from having trained on an A320 also tests Airbus claim of commonality between types.

Fly by Wire

Fly by Wire (FBW) can mean just that: the aircraft rudders (we will use the word rudders in a general sense to characterize all the aircraft’s movable control surfaces) are controlled via electrical signaling instead of via steal wires or aluminum push-rods. This is called open loop FBW and an example is Embraer E-Jet in its first generation. In such aircraft, the commands from the flying controls are transferred to the rudders via electrical signals and there might be computers that modify the signal dependent on, for instance, the speed of the aircraft (control gain adaptation), but there is no comparison of the given command and the aircraft’s response by the computers. This is for the pilot to do.

The Airbus FBW is of the more advanced type, meaning the pilot gives a command, the FBW computers interpret what the pilot wants to have done and then executes one or several commands to different rudders to get the job done. The latter system has several advantages; it leaves the field free for the flight law designers to use several rudders to achieve a desired effect, like having an aerodynamically different aircraft like the A350 fly like an A330 from a pilot’s point of view.

We were delayed in the simulator before our afternoon A350 flight and as a result I went to the flight test center with Airbus Cheif test pilot Peter Chandler in his car, instead of the bus which was chartered for the media teams. We spoke in quite some detail about the flight testing of the A350, something that I had followed very carefully over the years from the sidelines. Contrary to other Airbus aircraft programs, there were virtually no problems to fix in the A350 flight test. I have verified this from several sources, including several A350 test pilots at different occasions, so this was not Chandler giving a party-line pitch. Instead, the test flights, on top of flying for certification credits and verifying flight performance, were used to fine tune the flight laws of the aircraft.

Target was to make the A350 feel like an A330 but to achieve an even more refined aircraft. Chandler described that this could require many flights and much discussion with flight control people to achieve a rather straight-forward function like putting the nose wheel down after landing. This shall be done in a positive yet smooth way. Different test pilots have different styles in doing this. Some gently lower the nose, others let it fall and then give a last moment pitch up to hinder it from slamming down onto the runaway. The fine-tuning was aimed at allowing the different pilot styles all achieving a smooth nose wheel put down.

Another area that took a lot of testing was the fine-tuning of the droopable spoilers so that they generated an aerodynamically correct slat to the A350 drop hinge flaps, yet did not produce a strong whining sound. An adjustment of a fraction of a degree of the spoiler gap could do the trick and it took many tests before the different teams (areo, flight laws, test pilots, flight test engineers) were satisfied.

We also discussed what control law adjustments had been made during development. I have a special interest for aircraft stability and control and have taken special courses in the discipline, among others at Cranfield College’s aeronautical university, including flying in their specially equipped Jetstream 31 test aircraft. With this aircraft, all the different modes of aircraft oscillations could be studied, fun rides with puke bags handy for those in the rear test stations when testing dutch roll for long.

Dutch Roll: Comes from the Dutch ice skaters skating their canals in the winter in their typical hands-on-the-back style, ducking and diving the fore-body to the left and right in a rhythmic fashion to keep balance. An aircraft which has strong roll resistance (strong dihedral) and is weaker in yaw can go into the same ducking and diving mode to the dis-pleasure of its passengers. Aircraft designers fit yaw dampers to stop dutch roll tendencies.

Traditionally, aircraft designers have worked on the flight laws in a rather straight-forward way. This means: to improve pitch handling when, e.g., the aircraft aerodynamics change so that the aircraft goes nose heavy when, e.g., flaps are extend. This has been compensated with autotrim during flap travel so that the pilot does not have to do the trim change.

With FBW and especially with the powerful A350 FBW, the flight control people have used more features of the flight control system than just trim to achieve an experience of no trim change but also no real flight feeling change. This can involve setting autotrim, changing pitch gain, adjusting flap and slat deployment speeds and values dynamically, changing damping values in pitch, roll or yaw axis, all to leave the pilot with a desired experience, making his flying more instinctive and easier.

Chandler answered several of my questions with, “they adjusted a lot of things, not just one parameter, can’t tell you all they adjusted” to get the desired characteristic for, for instance, landing flare. This shows just the amount of detail work that went into the flying experience of the A350 and also to the A350 cockpit in general. So how does it all work then?

Flying the A350

Having read a lot of on-line discussions around the “computer game style flying of Airbus FBW aircraft,” I was quite excited to be given a chance to test this it myself and see if this was the case. The discussion comes from the fact that the Airbus cockpit uses a side-placed spring loaded joystick as control stick together with throttles which are not of the back-driven type, Figure 1.

This means they are used to tell the engine control computers, the FADEC, what job one want to have done (e.g., give me climb thrust) rather than controlling it oneself, Figure 2.

When the FADEC then changes the thrust to comply with different changing conditions the throttles don’t move in unison, they stay in their detent. In flying jargon, this is called that the throttles are not back-driven. In other words, when Autothrust reduces engine rpm to lower thrust, the throttles does not move to reflect the fact that the engines have less demand for power generation placed on them. It means that one always looks at the engine display to understand how much thrust the engines generate and that one sometimes needs to collect the power level green line with the lever position bug before disengaging Autothrust to avoid sudden thrust swings. In normal operation this is no problem, when stressed this can be a bit harder.

Before we get to deep into the throttles, let’s start with the control of the aircraft. I am a typical right hand stick and left hand throttle guy from my fighter days. Classical Civil aircraft including airliners are flown either like that from the First Officers seat (FO) or left hand yoke and right hand throttle if in the Captains seat (CO). I deliberately choose the FO side in the simulator to keep this as I am used to, but in the aircraft, all media pilots wanted the Captain’s position so I flew there as well. It meant I flew the aircraft with my left hand, which I seldom have used for this and was controlling throttles and thrust reverse with the right hand.

Despite this I sensed nothing of the rumored artificial feel when flying the aircraft through the joystick. The response of the aircraft was immediate and solid. Gradually I stopped moving the joystick for small adjustments. I just gave it a bit of pressure and the aircraft followed. It was a nice feel and it gave me confidence in the aircraft. This did not change with the different flight modes and protections we tried. Whether it was high speed gradual pitch-up to stop a rather brutal attack on the high speed limit, Vmo, or low speed protection preventing me from stalling the aircraft, it was always smooth and natural in its operation, Figure 3.

With normal mode FBW, turning is done in a normal way until 33° bank. You put the aircraft in the roll attitude and then the FBW keeps it there, including keeping altitude. To roll over 33° requires constant stick pressure and one cannot bank more than 67°. For a fighter pilot this sounds weird (you seldom bank less than 60° in a fighter except for ATC procedure flying; it just makes your turn radius too large at M 0.9), but it feels quite OK flying the A350. This is a passenger aircraft and you would not bank over 30° for anything else than an abnormal situation and then keeping the stick pressure on is OK. Like fighters, there is no kicking rudder when turning. What little aileron adverse yaw there is, the FBW takes care of. It also applies pitch to keep the altitude in the normal turn.

During the low speed handling, I could experience a simulated engine out direct after rotation. We slowed to a speed close to V2 and Chandler pulled one engine to idle and told me to not compensate in any way. There was a little yaw and a slight roll because of the yaw but it was nothing compared to the twins I trained on in previous flying. Miss the rudder and leaning into the going engine, and you are in serious trouble for many of these aircraft. Here an engine out after take-off is almost a non-event in comparison.

After high speed and low speed handling and checks, Chandler switched the FBW to direct law. Now the aircraft is flown with no protections and no FBW compensations. I sampled direct law in low speed mode, around 180 kts. I was surprised by how little different the feel was. Yes, you had to kick rudder in the turns and apply pitch as for a conventional aircraft, but the responsive feel was still there. We changed thrust and there was some pitch change and asymmetric thrust called for rudder input, but it was still a nice and well behaved aircraft.

When people discuss that Airbus pilots were reverted to alternate, or even worse, to direct law it is like things are starting to go pear shaped. Not at all. You are now with an aircraft that flies like every other aircraft on the planet and they don’t fall out of the sky. The FBW allows Airbus to tune the feel of their aircraft families to enable common type ratings. This eases pilot training and deployment for the airlines. The Airbus FBW also has very sensible protections, both for high and low speeds. When things don’t work as normal one is down to a classical aircraft in functionality, should not be to dramatic should it?

Throttles

The stick control was a positive surprise. The throttles takes some getting used to. They are in a way two personalities in one. Move the throttles in a normal way and the engines follows in a nice way from Idle to full thrust which is called TO/GA (Take Off / Go Around thrust), Figure 4.

When you go for a normal take-off you typically work in Autothrust mode and move them first to FLX/MCT (Flexible take-off thrust with different forms of engine derate to save engine maintenance or when in the air Maxium Continous when you fly on one engine), then after you are established on your climb-out to the Climb detent. Once you have handed over the engines to the automation the levers don’t move any more, you can only see the present thrust level on the engine display. If your flight follows your flight plan that you have programmed in the Flight Management System, FMS, your throttles stays in CL detent until you flare for landing given you do an autopilot/autothrust controlled approach and landing.

This is perfectly OK and natural for normal flying but was really awkward on Airbus aircraft up to A350 when some protections changed the thrust drastically from e.g. manual 65% to automatic and full throttle, i.e 100%. Before you could get the thrust back to your control when out of the protection you had to sync the throttles with actual thrust, here how it worked.

In previous Airbus FBW aircraft, including the simulators I trained on (A320, 330), a triggered protection meant the engines went to full power (TO/GA) and stayed there until a mentaly stressed pilot (he shouldn’t fly into a protection otherwise) realized he had to sync the thrust levers and its blue bug with the thrust level green line before being able to cancel Autothrust (with the red “Instinctive” Autothrust disconnect button on the throttle handles side) and get thrust functionality back to normal. If his happens in, e.g., full landing config (which is the most probable situation), one easily goes from an under speed situation to a flap and gear over-speed, simply because one can’t perform the catching of the thrust green line with the throttle levers blue bug fast enough. Airbus has recognized this and changed it for A350, Full thrust is applied to get out of the low speed situation but then the throttles return to normal state when the protection deactivates. This felt good and is a clear improvement, with this the major Airbus throttle grievance disappeared for me.

Another area which has been improved is how thrust reverse is controlled, it is now with levers on the front of the throttles like most other aircraft instead of moving the throttles behind the idle detent. Worked flawless in my life’s first thrust reverse after landing the A350.

In the next article about Flying the Airbus A350 we will look at some of the new system concepts that was introduced on A350 and how they differ from previous generations.

Summary

Aircraft, like cars, leave a feel imprint in one’s mind after flying/driving them. I flew business aircraft after my Air Force time but stopped after a while as it was no fun. It left no lasting desire to fly, having done the real thing with the fighters. The A350 rekindled my joy of flying. The feeling of the aircraft was such that it was fun to fly. That feeling stayed for several days after the test flight.

A very nice feeling and I am working on flying more of this breed of aircraft. Flying this class of aircraft is fun, especially when they are so well put together and tuned as the A350.

Airbus military plane faces more trouble after Spain crash - Chattanooga Times Free Press,"Mon, 11 May 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpbWVzZnJlZXByZXNzLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMTUvbWF5LzExL2FpcmJ1cy1taWxpdGFyeS1wbGFuZS1mYWNlcy1tb3JlLXRyb3VibGUtYWZ0ZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS (AP) - Airbus' troubled A400M military plane has hit turbulence once again.

The cargo plane whose rollout went billions over budget and years over deadline is being grounded by numerous governments after a crash in Spain this weekend killed two pilots and two flight test engineers.

Though the crash is still unexplained, many of the governments who first ordered the A400M are keeping them in the hangars out of precaution, with leading buyer Germany openly criticizing its design. Shares in Airbus Group fell on the prospect of more trouble with the model.

Here's a look at the case and the plane's history of problems.

SPAIN CRASH

Airbus and government officials haven't publicly announced the cause of the weekend's crash near Seville, but the voice and flight data black boxes have been recovered and delivered to a Spanish judge investigating the case.

In trading on Monday, shares in Airbus fell 4.23 percent, underperforming the wider European market which was down less than one percent.

The sell-off in Europe's biggest aerospace company came after an A400M military plane crashed outside Seville, Spain, on Saturday, killing four crew and prompting Germany, Britain Turkey and Malaysia to ground their fleets of the new troop and cargo carrier.

On Monday, Airbus Group Chief Executive Tom Enders asked the company's 137,000 employees to observe a minute's silence at midday for the two pilots and two test engineers who lost their lives. Two others remain in hospital.

""The men who lost their lives in Seville were great professionals; they knew about the risks of their job and they would not want us to stop flying,"" he said in a statement.

Testing continues

Enders also said that Airbus would resume testing as planned on Tuesday to demonstrate to customers that the company continues to ""fully trust this great transport plane.""

""We are committed to the program and the further ramp-up of deliveries and capabilities as ever,"" he added.

Spanish authorities said Sunday they had found the plane's two black box flight recorders and had handed them over to investigators. The Spanish government has also sent a team to look into the cause of the accident.

Hapless project

The A400M was developed for Spain and six other European NATO members - Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, Luxembourg and Turkey - at a cost of 20 billion euros ($22.33 billion).

After more than three years of delays and billions of euros of cost overruns, European governments injected more money into the project in 2010. But delays and technical problems resurfaced last year, leading to a management shake-up.

In February, Airbus took 551 million euros in charges for the new A400M delays, bringing the total written off over the lifetime of the project to more than 4.75 billion euros.

""Airbus can ill afford more delays,"" Hamburg-based Berenberg Bank said in a note after the crash, adding: ""Longer-term, this latest development will almost certainly hamper the ability to sell A400M in the export markets, the only way this program will ever make any money.""

The crashed aircraft was due to be delivered to Turkey and was on its maiden test flight.

A next-generation A320neo Airbus passenger jet, powered by twin LEAP jet engines with Additive Manufactured parts, is reported to have completed its maiden flight on May 19, 2015, in Toulouse, France.



The LEAP is the first engine equipped with 19 3D-printed fuel nozzles, as well as parts made from high performance ceramics that make it 15% more fuel efficient than comparable engines built by CFM International, the 50/50 joint-venture between GE Aviation and France’s Safran (Snecma) that designed the engine.

“Today, we are celebrating the next step in our very successful journey with Airbus, a journey that goes back nearly 35 years to the very launch of the A320 program,” stated Jean-Paul Ebanga, President and CEO of CFM.



The two engines used for the four and a half hour flight were the LEAP-1A, developed specifically for the Airbus jet. Airbus picked the LEAP for the A320neo in 2010. Since then, CFM has received more than 2,500 orders and commitments for the LEAP-1A engine, representing 55% of A320neo orders to date.



There are 19 of these AM fuel nozzles in



each of GE’s new LEAP passenger jet



engines



CFM International also designed the LEAP-1B for Boeing’s 737 MAX aircraft, and LEAP-1C for Comac’s C919 planes. With a running tally of 8,900 orders valued around $115 billion (US list price), the LEAP is the bestselling engine in GE Aviation’s history.



CFM has said it was “on track” to receive joint US Federal Aviation Administration and European Aviation Safety Agency certification. The first LEAP is scheduled to enter service in 2016.



There are currently more than 30 LEAP engines (all three models) in final assembly or going through tests at GE and Snecma testing facilities in Peebles, Ohio, Victorville, Cal., and elsewhere in Europe and around the world. The testing program has logged a total of more than 3,660 certification test hours and 5,460 test cycles.



The FAA recently certified the first 3D-printed part for a GE jet engine – a casing that houses the compressor inlet temperature sensor inside the GE90 jet engine.

He says he will make the trip to demonstrate the company’s confidence in the plane.

The A400M turboprop, which was due to be delivered to Turkey next month, crashed near the assembly plant at Seville , killing the two test pilots and two of the four flight test engineers aboard. The air forces of four countries, including Britain, have grounded their A400Ms while the incident is investigated.

Airbus shares recovered throughout Monday after a sharp fall saw more than €1bn (£710m) wiped off the company’s valuation in early trading.

The aerospace firm held a minute’s silence for the victims on Monday.

It said flight testing would continue according to schedule, with Fernando Alonso, the executive vice-president of military aircraft at Airbus Defence and Space, due to be aboard an A400M that will fly from Toulouse to Seville on Tuesday.



In a letter to staff, Airbus’s chief executive, Tom Enders, said it would “demonstrate to our customers, the air forces, that we fully trust this great transport plane and are as committed to the programme and the further ramp up of deliveries and capabilities as ever”.

Investigators in Spain have recovered the black boxes but there is so far no information as to the cause of the crash. Airbus did not comment on an unconfirmed report in the German press that the plane’s engines failed.

Officials in Germany, which was an early customer alongside Britain, France, Turkey and Malaysia, complained of “shortcomings” in the A400M in their testing over the past six months. Germany has 53 of the planes on order, out of a total of 174.

The A400M was developed at a cost of €20bn at the behest of European Nato governments seeking to replace ageing military transporters. The plane’s genesis has been marked by escalating costs and delays. Its turboprop engines are supplied in part by Rolls-Royce."

Two people reportedly survived the crash, while several others remain unaccounted for.

A government official said Saturday that four people on board the A400M Airbus which crashed on Saturday near Seville had died.



Andalusia's regional prefect Antonio Sanz, who heads the local administration, told reporters a burnt body had been located amongst the wreckage, bringing the death toll to four.



It remains unclear how many people were aboard the aircraft when it came down, with numbers ranging from six to 10.

The two injured crew members were transferred to a nearby hospital with serious injuries, and a further two remain unaccounted for, the unnamed spokesman added.

The Airbus A400M reportedly crashed shortly after takeoff from an airport in Seville Saturday afternoon, local time.



The El Mundo newspaper reported, citing a witness, that the plane crashed into an power line as the pilot attempted an emergency landing which then caused a power outage in a nearby suburb.



AENA, Spain's airport authority, confirmed the crash had caused a power outage at an industrial estate in the suburb of Carmona, but did not comment on reports the aircraft had hit an electricity pole.

Airbus, makers of the A400M and a government spokesperson declined to comment on the cause of the crash.

AENA confirmed the airport's closure, saying fire crews had attended a plane crash outside its perimeter fence. The airport was closed for just over 1.5 hours as crews attended the scene.

""The plane that crashed a mile (1.6 kilometers) north of Seville airport in an nonresidential area was not a commercial craft,"" a regional emergency services spokesman told AFP.



The Airbus A400M is assembled in Seville and had been undergoing flight trials at the time of the crash, the company said. The same type of aircraft had been delivered to the German military in December.

Airbus Defence and Space, the Airbus division responsible for military aircraft, said the crashed plane was destined for Turkey.

The company has sent a group of experts to the crash site to investigate.

If Saturday's crash is deemed an accident, it would be the aircraft's first since going into service in 2013.

Germany, UK ground A400M aircraft

In light of Saturday's crash, the German defence ministry announced it had grounded its Airbus A400M military transporter aircraft.



The decision echoes the announcement by Britain’s Air Force earlier on Saturday to ground its fleet of A400M aircraft carriers.

“The (Air Force) chief of staff has suspended operations until further notice,” a German defence spokesperson said.

France, Malaysia and Turkey, each of which also operate the aircraft, have not made public plans to ground their fleets.

Germany currently owns one A400M which it took delivery of in 2014 after a delay of four years.



Berlin has placed an order for 53 Airbus A400M aircraft in total, but has plans to sell 13 to other countries.

Andalusia's regional prefect Antonio Sanz, who heads the local administration, said a burnt body had been found in the wreckage, raising the death toll to four. A spokeswoman for the emergency services had earlier said there were at least three dead and two seriously injured.

She said the authorities were still trying to establish how many people were on the plane when it went down in a non-residential area around a mile from the airport.

The airport was closed to traffic for about an hour after the crash. A thick plume of black smoke was seen billowing from the vicinity of the airport.

Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, who received the news on a campaign visit to Tenerife, one of the Canary Islands, spoke of ""eight to 10 people on board.""

The prime minister, who was due to visit the crash scene later Saturday, sent his condolences to the victims, Spanish news agencies reported.

Aviation sources confirmed the plane was one of the new A400M troop and vehicle transporters from European aerospace group Airbus.

Airbus Defence and Space, the Airbus division responsible for military aircraft, said the plane was destined for Turkey, but did not immediately say how many people were aboard.

The group sent a team of experts to the crash scene.

If confirmed as an accident, it would be the first since the plane, which is assembled at a factory in Seville, went into service.

The first A400M was delivered to France in 2013, with subsequent planes having also been handed over to Turkey, Britain, Germany and Malaysia -- the first non-European buyer.

Beset by problems

The A400M programme has been beset by problems since it was launched in 2003 at the request of European armies.

In addition to production and delivery delays, the programme ran 30 percent -- or 6.2 billion euros ($7 billion) -- over budget, sparking criticism from clients that at one point led Airbus to threaten to scrap the project.

When Germany took delivery of its first A400M last December -- four years behind schedule -- it complained of construction flaws.

Powered by four turbo-prop engines, the A400M is designed to transport troops and material, including armoured vehicles and helicopters, over great distances at high speeds.

Capable of transporting up to 37 tons over 3,300 kilometres, the A400M is still nimble enough to land on irregular terrain.

Airbus has high hopes for the aircraft, which is reaching the market just as its main US rivals are nearing the end of their life cycles -- notably the C-130, which was designed 50 years ago.

A total of 174 A400M planes have been ordered, including 50 by France, 53 by Germany, 27 by Spain and 22 by Britain.

Though Saturday's crash was the first involving the aircraft, it is the second deadly accident involving military planes in Spain this year.

During NATO exercises on January 26, a Greek fighter jet experienced a technical failure during take-off and crashed into pilots and mechanics on the ground, killing 11 people and injuring 21.

Following Saturday's crash, Spanish political parties announced suspension of their campaigning for May 24 regional elections out of respect for the victims.

Airbus Admits 'Assembly Quality Problem' after A400M Crash - IndustryWeek,"Fri, 29 May 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZHVzdHJ5d2Vlay5jb20vb3BlcmF0aW9ucy9zYWZldHkvYXJ0aWNsZS8yMTk2NTI1MC9haXJidXMtYWRtaXRzLWFzc2VtYmx5LXF1YWxpdHktcHJvYmxlbS1hZnRlci1hNDAwbS1jcmFzaNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"BERLIN — Analysis of the flight recorders of the A400M that crashed in Spain on May 9, killing four, indicated there were no structural faults but assembly quality problems, a senior Airbus executive said in a newspaper interview to appear on Friday.

""The black boxes confirm it. There was no structural fault, but we have a serious final assembly quality problem,"" Airbus group's chief of strategy Marwan Lahoud told the German daily Handelsblatt after receiving the first results of the analysis of the flight recorders.

In a statement released ahead of publication, Handelsblatt wrote that the units that control the engines of the turboprop A400M military cargo and troop transport were poorly installed during final assembly, which could have led to the engines malfunctioning and the plane crashing.

But Airbus's defense and space division said it was too early to draw any conclusions.

""We will need the full results of the investigation in order to have the full picture, so as long as there is no further communications from (investigating authority) CITAAM, it is too early to draw any conclusions from the accident,"" it said in a statement.

The division added that ""like all accidents, it will certainly be a combination of issues and not one single cause"".

It also said other A400M aircraft in service have already been subject to checks and are ""100% protected from this failure"".

On May 19, Airbus warned of a technical bug in the Electronic Control Units (ECU) that controls how the aircraft's engine operates, which it discovered during an internal test it conducted independently of the investigation into the crash.

An expert in the sector speaking then on condition of anonymity said that a software bug could lead to a loss of control of engine power.

Airbus recommended inspections and possibly exchanging the motors or ECUs, but did not draw a direct link between this problem and the Seville crash.

The crash of the turboprop A400M military cargo and troop transport plane a few minutes into a test flight just north of Seville's airport prompted five countries — Spain, Britain, Germany, Turkey and Malaysia — to ground their planes pending the outcome of the probe, which is being led by Spanish investigators.

Two of the six people on board the plane, a mechanic and an engineer, survived the crash and were sent to the hospital in critical condition.

The development of the massive transport plane has been plagued by setbacks that led to years of delays and costly overruns.

The first aircraft was delivered in 2013, and a total of 174 have been ordered.

Shortly after Germany took delivery of its first A400M last January — four years late — Der Spiegel magazine published a list of 875 construction errors or malfunctions detected in the plane.

Flight test: Airbus keeps family faithful with A350 - Flightglobal,"Fri, 22 May 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vZmxpZ2h0LXRlc3QtYWlyYnVzLWtlZXBzLWZhbWlseS1mYWl0aGZ1bC13aXRoLWEzNTAvMTE2ODg5LmFydGljbGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"When Airbus conceived the all-new A350 XWB almost a decade ago, it did so after first attempting to create a challenger to the Boeing 787 based on its existing “big-twin”, the A330. As that aircraft’s conception saw it evolving away significantly from the type upon which it was based, and still not satisfying the needs of many customers, Airbus took the brave decision to abandon the original plan and adopt an all-new approach with A350 XWB, powered by advanced generation Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engines.

The challenge facing Airbus as it made its back-to-basics rethink was to create all-new airliner offering technology to match or better the all-new Dreamliner but retaining significant flightcrew commonality with the aircraft it was expected to replace – the A330. And while at first glance the two cockpits appear a world apart, the fundamental Airbus philosophy is unchanged and Airbus reports that A330 crews quickly feel fully at home in their new surroundings.

The all-new A350’s “Xtra Wide Body” moniker points to its hoped-for marketing advantage, a wider fuselage than the 787 (which itself had greater girth than the A330, whose cross-section was directly derived from the original Airbus, the A300B). According to Airbus, the XWB’s passenger cabin is 12.7cm (5in) wider than the Dreamliner’s, allowing nine-abreast economy layouts with seats, Airbus is proud to point out, that are 45.7cm wide at the armrests – 1.3cm more than 787.

Some 15 months after its first flight on 14 June 2013, the baseline A350-900 received EASA certification on 30 September 2014, with US Federal Aviation Administration approval following on 12 November.

Launch customer Qatar Airways put the new big twin into revenue service on 15 January 2015, between Doha and Frankfurt. The Qatari carrier is due to debut the A350-900’s big brother, the -1000 stretch in mid-2017. However a third A350 derivative, the A350-800 “shrink”, is in limbo, having effectively been replaced in the Airbus line-up by the re-engined A330neo.

Familiar feelings

Not long after the A350’s service debut, Flightglobal was invited to Toulouse to sample firsthand how Airbus’s biggest twin would fly.

Throughout my civil aviation career I have primarily flown Boeing products; ranging from the 737 to the 747 Classic. The newest Seattle product I was qualified to command was Boeing’s big twin, the 777. As a reporter for Flightglobal I was able to “fly” a 787-8 simulator prior to its delivery to Continental Airlines (now United Airlines), in 2010. While sidelined with an injury in 2012, I rode with Paul Smith during his evaluation flight of the 787 for Flightglobal.

Boeing had sought and obtained a common type rating for the 777 and 787, and in both the 787 simulator cab and cockpit I felt completely at home. Smith, who flies the 757/767 for a US freight carrier, remarked how the flows and overall feel of the 787 reminded him of his regular Boeing ride.

From a training and qualification standpoint, Boeing was leading the industry when it earned a common type rating for the 757 and 767. Having qualified on both the 757/767 and 777, I can attest that while they have different underlying architectures, they are remarkably similar from the pilot’s perspective. I think one can comfortably say that a pilot qualified in the 757/767 or 777/787 series would experience little challenge in transitioning to the other.

Boeing’s efforts at fashioning a common cockpit environment are notable, but they are well eclipsed by Airbus’s efforts. While I have never been qualified to command an Airbus, as a reporter for Flightglobal I have been fortunate to have flown the A318, A340-600, A380 and several A330 simulators. With the A320, Airbus laid the foundation for a common flightdeck and flight control philosophy for its fly-by-wire (FBW) aircraft. Over the years I have observed and appreciated the commonality inherent in Airbus designs.

The most notable enhancement I had observed was when I flew the A380. While the A340-600 (and A330) has six square displays and virtually identical to the A320 family cockpit, Airbus took the opportunity with the A380 to refresh the arrangement. It has a total of eight much larger and rectangular (upright) displays. Additionally, the A380 cockpit incorporates an integrated electronic flight bag as part of the onboard information system (OIS) which is displayed on screens mounted on the left and right sidewall.

To interface with the A380’s OIS, full-size QWERTY keyboards are incorporated into each pilot’s fold-out table. Finally, two pedestal mounted keyboard and cursor control units (KCCUs) were installed. Each KCCU features a QWERTY keyboard as well as a track ball and scroll wheel. My view of the A380’s cockpit was that while I appreciated the large amount of real estate available to display information, in retrospect it lacked a clean, cohesive feel.

Flightdeck familiarisation

With Airbus chief test pilot Peter Chandler, I was able to re-acquaint myself with an Airbus flightdeck as we went over the highlights of the A350-900 in a full-motion simulator. Later that day Chandler hosted me and several other journalists on our preview flight onboard the real aircraft.

Like other Airbus flightdecks, the A350 employs a dark-cockpit philosophy. For the A350, Airbus took the A380 as a baseline and improved upon it. Six large 39cm-wide displays replace the A380’s eight smaller (15cm x 20cm) displays. Five displays are placed side by side from side wall to side wall on the forward instrument panel, the sixth below the middle display above the centre pedestal. Each display can be divided in half, yielding two 15cm x 20cm windows. Overall the instrument panel presented a clean appearance.

The simulator had optional Thales head-up displays installed. In addition to helping the pilots keep their eyes out of the cockpit, the HUD may be used in the future for Enhanced Vision System (EVS), Surface Guidance System (SGS) and Synthetic Vision System (SVS) displays. Like the A380, the A350 has tray table-mounted keyboards as well as two pedestal-mounted KCCUs. Unlike the A380, the A350’s KCCUs can interface with the OIS.

Chandler guided me through the flight management system initialisation procedures, which were easy to accomplish as the FMS automatically sequenced to the appropriate page. Like the A380, the A350 has a smart electronic checklist, one that will automatically “tick” accomplished items. In the event of an electronic centralised aircraft monitor (ECAM) announced abnormal/emergency procedure, the appropriate checklist and relevant system display are automatically presented. If a “non-sensed” abnormal/emergency condition is encountered, the appropriate checklist and system display can be selected from a menu presented when the ECAM control panel’s “ABN” button is pressed.

During our simulator brief, Chandler also highlighted several other features on the A350 that differed from the A330. One is the surveillance (SURV) system, which debuted on the A380 and integrates weather radar, traffic collision avoidance system (TCAS), terrain awareness warning system (TAWS) and air traffic control (ATC) mode S transponder components. These subsystems are controlled by a single pedestal-mounted panel.

The nose is the most visually striking feature of the A350

Another is the “Brake” panel above the landing-gear lever, which has a single push button for the arming of three automatic braking modes, and a rotary switch to select runway condition. The first is auto-brake which, based on system logic, applies braking for a rejected take-off event or normal landing roll-out. The second, Brake to Vacate (BTV), was discussed in detail by Chandler while in the simulator.

BTV automatically brakes the aircraft for runway turn off at a pilot selected exit point. Airbus feels that BTV is a major evolution in braking control as it can optimise brake application and reduce runway occupancy time, all while enhancing passenger comfort.

Airbus originally developed BTV for the A380 and believes it is a major evolution in braking control as it optimises brake application and reduces runway occupancy time, all while enhancing passenger comfort.

The third is the Runway Overrun Protection (ROP) mode. With runway excursions on landing an ever-present threat, in the A350 Airbus has incorporated two features to reduce their likelihood. The Runway Overrun Warning (ROW) system is active at 500ft above ground level on approach, and computes real time stopping distance required. Should it determine there is insufficient runway available it triggers a visual and aural alert, designed to encourage the pilots to either go-around or correct approach parameters. The other is ROP which activates when the autobrake is active on roll-out. If an overrun is sensed, it commands maximum braking and issues visual and aural alerts for the pilots to use maximum reverse thrust.

Simulated circuit

Since the actual flight in the A350-900 was to be shared with several journalist pilots, I was determined to glean as much as I could from my time in the simulator. For the simulator exercise I occupied the left seat and fellow journalist pilot Greg Cellier in the right seat. Cellier was current and qualified on the A320 as a first officer for a European airline.

With familiarisation complete, Chandler guided us through the engine start process. Once both Trent XWB engines were stabilised at idle, post start flows were completed and set flaps 2. I released the parking brake and taxiied towards runway 14R at Airbus’s home port of Toulouse Blagnac.

Our simulator had the optional external and taxi aid camera system (ETACS) installed. Two cameras provide views from just behind the nose wheel and from the top of the vertical tail. I found the video feeds aided my taxiing on centerlines during my navigation around the digital rendition of Blagnac airport. During the taxi I was also able to see the A350’s airport navigation function operate. With navigation display (ND) ranges of 5nm (9.3km) and below, an airport diagram is presented.

Our own aircraft’s position was shown in magenta on the moving map. Runway intrusions are a constant threat, and Airbus has equipped the A350 with a runway proximity advisory (RPA) feature. Approaching a runway, the runway’s name and runway depiction itself will flash in yellow on the ND. An RPA message is also presented on the primary flight display and ETACS display. As I have noted on numerous other preview flights, having one’s position depicted on an airfield diagram greatly enhances situational awareness.

Once aligned on 14R, I advanced the thrust levers to the FLX/MCT (flexible/maximum continuous thrust) detent. The autothrust set a “FLX TO” take-off thrust setting. Power is displayed on the engine display in percentage, as determined by the Airbus Cockpit Universal Thrust Emulator (ACUTE).

ACUTE takes the engine control parameter and converts it into a common thrust parameter. This set-up is particularly useful for aircraft with several engine types as percentage thrust replaces the underlying controlling N1 fan speed or engine pressure ratio setting. Currently the Trent XWB is the only engine planned to be offered on the A350 series; but should a second engine type be certificated, the ACUTE system will minimise any required differences training.

When Cellier called “Rotate”, I pulled aft on the sidestick and followed the Flight Director’s guidance. Once airborne, gear and flap retraction caused no pitch changes as we accelerated and climbed to pattern altitude. I used the HUD to hand fly the aircraft around the visual circuit, its symbology reflective of that displayed on the PFD.

After Cellier installed and activated the 14R ILS approach in the FMS, I used the Flight Director cues in the HUD to hand fly the approach. I left the autothrust engaged, its accurate tracking of speeds on the approach simplifying my task loading while handling this big twin. At about 40ft radio altitude (RA) I began the round-out for the flare manoeuvre.

When “Retard” was annunciated at 20ft RA, I retarded the levers to idle. Nearing the idle stop, I clicked off the autothrust for the full-stop landing and manually braked to a halt.

Organic shape

Prior to our sortie, Airbus flight test engineer Bruno Bigand led us on a pre-flight inspection of our A350-900 preview aircraft, MSN002 (F-WWCF). This is the second A350-900 built but the third to fly as it was the first test aircraft to be completed with a furnished cabin. This aircraft, which was used primarily in the flight-test campaign for development and certification of the passenger cabin, is painted in a white and carbonfibre-look colour scheme to emphasise the advanced materials used in the A350’s construction. Composites alone make up 53% of the structure.

Visually I found the most striking feature of the A350 was its nose section. To my mind, the noses of large commercial aircraft have never been particularly appealing or sleek – apart from the Concorde. Airbus and Boeing with its 787 have gone to great lengths to reduce drag wherever they can. These new designs have an almost constant rake from the tip of the radome to the top of the fuselage, giving a look that is somewhat evocative of a Parrot’s beak.

In a nod to drag reduction, and perhaps simplicity, the A350 is the first Airbus to incorporate fixed cockpit windows. This change saves weight and complexity and allows a more aerodynamic glazing, and necessitated an overhead escape hatch for cockpit crew which is located above and behind the first officer’s seat (the 787 is similar in this respect). Long ropes are supplied for the up to 7.6m (25ft) drop to the ground.

The A350’s all-new wing spans 64.75m, including its signature 2.4m high winglet, and is primarily constructed of carbon composite materials. As with the A380, Airbus made extensive use of computational fluid dynamics and windtunnel testing to deliver an efficient wing optimized for a Mach 0.85 cruise speed. While not evident during the walk-around, the A350’s flight computers tweak the position (+/-4º) of the inboard and outboard flaps during the cruise. This capability gives the A350 a variable camber wing that can be optimised for real time flight conditions.

ND and PFD are integrated into a single screen

The A350 only has two 345bar (5,000lb/in2) hydraulic circuits, just like the A380. To gain the required level of flight control redundancy, Airbus uses three types of control actuators: conventional, electro-hydrostatic actuator (EHA), and electrical back-up hydraulic actuator (EBHA). Conventional actuators use the ship’s green or yellow hydraulic systems, while EHAs have a self contained electro-hydraulic generation system. The EBHAs operate as conventional actuators until there is loss of hydraulic power, when they operate as EHAs. As we inspected the outboard trailing edge section of the wing, Bigand pointed out the vents for the aileron’s EHA and EBHA. Approaching the wing/body join, Bigand pointed out a unique feature of the A350’s main landing gear, which differs from previous Airbus designs. Each main strut is supported by two drag links, a more intricate configuration than usual designed to reduce loading on the wing.

After completing the walk around inspection we boarded the A350-900 and I went aft through the cabin. MSN002’s cabin is configured with a 252-seat layout comprising 42 business-class and 210 economy-class seats. As I walked aft I noted that the A350’s cabin was noticeably more open and airy than that of the A340-600 that I had ridden over to Europe on from San Francisco. I took a seat at the flight-test station installed half way down the cabin. The station had several monitors that allowed me to view flightdeck activities through several cameras, as well as repeat actual flightdeck displays. While designed for the flight test effort, the station allowed me to closely watch the cockpit and gain a better understanding of the A350 and its systems.

Envelope protections

From the flight test station I observed the normal start, taxi and take-off performed by another journalist pilot. An autopilot climb was established as we flew to the working area approximately 120km west of Toulouse.

With Direct Law engaged, Gerzanics slows to 180kt to fly a series of 30' turns

Max Kingsley-Jones

At FL220 with the autopilot still engaged, the pilot disengaged the autothrust and advanced the thrust levers to the “CLB” detent. At 340kt (630km/h; all speed values are indicated air speed (IAS)) the PFD’s airspeed tape was red, indicating an overspeed. At 343kt the autothrust woke up and retarded the thrust level to slow the aircraft below VMO (maximum operating speed). Slowing through 340kt the autothrust disengaged itself, returning thrust control to the pilot.

Throughout this exercise, the autopilot stayed engaged. This overspeed protection feature is in addition to the flight control laws’ high speed protection scheme. That scheme limits the effect of pilot forward stick input, stabilising the aircraft at VMO+25kt/MMO (maximum operating Mach +0.06M).

Next the pilot explored the protections resident in the roll axis of the flight control laws. As with other Airbus civil fly-by-wire aircraft, up to 33º angle of bank can held with neutral lateral stick. Additionally, automatic pitch trim relieves the need for aft stick pressure to maintain level flight. Angles of bank up to 67º (clean configuration) can be obtained if a lateral stick input is held. Automatic pitch trim, however, is disabled and aft stick pressure is needed to maintain level flight.

In addition to its three full air data reference systems, the A350, as would be expected, has a third standby pitot static system. Even this level of redundancy however, has been known to fail. While there is no doubt a quick reaction handbook procedure to deal with this rare occurrence, Airbus has developed a backup system to further enhance safety. At high and medium altitudes, the A350’s backup air data system uses information from the engines nacelle mounted air data probes to compute aircraft speed and altitude.

At FL220 and about 250kt, Chandler switched the PFD’s air data to the tertiary backup source. Dashed lines were drawn through the PFD’s airspeed and altitude tapes to indicate degraded accuracy, but when it all settled out, indicated altitude and airspeed were within 20ft and 2kts of the primary system’s. While not demonstrated on our preview flight, Chandler said that at low altitudes the system uses inertial inputs to determine airspeed and global positioning system data to determine altitude.

Chandler next directed a descent to an altitude block of FL100 to FL150. Once established in the block, he switched the flight control system Alternate Law. The left seat pilot manoeuvered the A350 fairly aggressively within the normal flight envelope. He commented that it seemed no different than Normal Law. His assessment was accurate as the Alternate Law schemes are similar to Normal Law schemes.

The biggest difference, not noticeable in the heart of the flight envelope, was the loss of envelope protections. Now back in Normal Law, the last flight control law feature I observed from the flight test station was its angle-of-attack protection scheme. At slow speeds it operated like prior Airbus fly-by-wire aircraft with one exception. Autothrust still advances the thrust to take-off/go-around (TOGA) at Alpha Floor, but unlike prior schemes which kept TOGA thrust until the pilot intervened, in the A350 once a safe airspeed is attained, thrust is reduced and autothrust is deactivated. This refinement to the protection scheme maintains an equivalent level of safety while making its operation a little less aggressive.

Direct law

We were still in the FL100-to-FL150 altitude block when it was my turn in the left seat. Once seated, I adjusted the arm rest and rudder pedals to the settings I had written down from my simulator session. One thing missing from the preview aircraft was the HUD I had used extensively in the simulator.

A350 main instrument panel (Click here to enlarge)

I did a few turns and minor altitude changes to acquaint myself with how the A350 felt in Normal Law. Having done digital flight control development in the F-16, I am intimately familiar with sidestick aircraft. The tactile experience of controlling the large FBW A350 with the low force displacement sidestick however, could not have been any more different than the control manipulations needed to fly a 737NG, my regular ride. Chandler then engaged Direct Law. I slowed the A350 to 180kt where I did a series of 30º turns. The aircraft felt quite responsive, but the lack of a turn coordinator necessitated the use of rudder to counteract adverse yaw. With manual thrust selected, I advanced the thrust levers. The increased thrust from the underslung engines pitched the nose of the aircraft up. Reducing power caused it to drop. Asymmetric power application caused a yawing motion. All these characteristics are masked/compensated for in Normal and Alternate Law.

As of late both Airbus and Boeing have stressed the need for pilots to get back to the basics of aviation. My short exposure to the A350’s handling qualities in Direct Law reinforced what I knew, but perhaps didn’t fully appreciate. Underneath all its automation the A350 was still an aircraft, an aircraft that adhered to the same laws of aerodynamics as the Cessna 150 I flew solo 40 years ago.

Landing roll-out with full flap and ground spoilers deployed

V2 cut

Each pilot was given the opportunity to fly one approach and landing when we returned to Toulouse. Again seated at the flight-test station in the passenger cabin, I monitored several full stop landings to runway 14L, followed by taxi back for take-offs. One interesting approach was the VOR 14L flown using the FMS Landing System (FLS). The FLS computes a final approach path, called the FLS beam. Pseudo-localiser and pseudo-glideslope information is presented in an instrument landing systems (ILS) like format making the approach easy to fly.

When it was my turn, I cycled into the left seat while on downwind in the radar pattern. Conditions were clear skies with good visibility so I elected to do a hand flown visual approach, with the ILS as a backup. With full flaps (the fourth setting), the target airspeed was 139kt for the 189t widebody (the zero fuel weight was 161.2t and fuel 27.6t). As in the simulator, I commenced the flare manoeuvre passing through 20ft RA, retarding the thrust levers to idle at the “Retard” call.

The touchdown was smooth, no doubt cushioned by the large wing-in-ground effect. The ground spoilers automatically extended on touchdown and I lowered the nose wheel to the runway. In order to save time, Chandler had suggested we do a touch-and-go, so he then retracted the spoilers, reset the trim and set flaps 2. I advanced the levers to the TOGA detent. Chandler called “Rotate” as we accelerated through 139kt, our prior target airspeed. Once airborne with the gear retracted, Chandler rapidly retarded the right thrust lever to idle to simulate an engine failure. Initially I maintained neutral control inputs to see how the aircraft would respond to the simulated engine loss. At 180kt the right wing dropped about 4º and a slow yawing motion to the right ensued. These motions provided tactile cues that alerted me to the thrust loss.

Satisfied with the A350’s docile initial response, I leveled the wings with a small lateral stick input while putting in about 6º of left rudder to center the beta target symbol on the PFD. While not quite as elegant as the thrust asymmetry compensation systems that equipped the 777 and 787, I found the handling qualities inherent in the A350’s flight control laws made an engine failure a non-event.

Autoland and BTV

Established on downwind, prior to the full-stop landing and taxi back to the Airbus ramp, I moved to the third occupant seat, located aft of the pedestal. Our final landing was used to demonstrate the A350’s autoland and BTV systems. With both autopilots and autothrust engaged, the A350 captured and tracked the Localiser course.

At one dot below the glideslope, the flaps were extended to 2. The gear was extended at glideslope intercept, with full flap set prior to 1,000ft above ground level. I watched as the vertical and lateral flight mode annunciators on the PFD changed from G/S and LOC to a single LAND indication. The autothrust flight mode annunciator indicated SPEED in green with BTV in blue below it, indicating the system was armed. The LAND flight mode annunciator cycled from FLARE then to ROLLOUT, as the automated system executed a flawless touchdown and tracked centerline on roll-out.

Shortly after touchdown, the BTV system activated, as indicated by the aircraft slowing and its flight mode annunciator changing to green. The BTV system is designed to slow the aircraft to a speed of 10kts, 50m prior to the selected exit point. Reaching these conditions, the BTV function automatically disconnected.

During the taxi back to the Airbus ramp, I noted that the left seat pilot found the ETACS useful in keeping the large aircraft’s gear centered on the sometimes narrow taxiways. Once parked, Chandler shut down both the Trent XWB engines and expeditiously accomplished the shutdown flows.

Extra-wonderful Airbus

During my flight in the A350-900 and companion simulator experience, I found it to be the most refined Airbus I have experienced. With its six large display screens, the flightdeck is Airbus’s cleanest to date. Any Airbus pilot would feel right at home in it, especially those flying the A330 with which it shares a common type rating.

In the air I appreciated the A350’s smooth and predictable handling qualities, finding it felt more responsive than the larger A380. Demonstrations of flight envelope protection schemes and its docile response to a simulated engine failure showed me that the A350 could be manoeuvered with confidence to its extremes. From both a pilot’s and passenger’s perspective, it seems Airbus has added yet another winner to its stable of aircraft. Some 780 orders for both A350 models confirm that Airbus’s biggest twin will be a commercial success.

Jason-CS/Sentinel-6 is a mission to carry out high-precision measurements of ocean surface topography. The contract is worth 177 million euros. The implementation of the second satellite will follow the approval of the programme by the Council of EUMETSAT, the European meteorological organisation, in June 2015 and it is co-funded by EUMETSAT and by the European Union via the Copernicus programme.

The satellites will measure their distance to the oceans’ surfaces with an accuracy of a few centimetres and use this data to map it globally, repeating the cycle every 10 days. Observing changes in sea-surface height using such a high level of precision provides insights into global sea levels, the speed and direction of ocean currents, and ocean heat storage. The measurements made are vital for modelling the oceans and predicting rises in sea levels. This data will also be used increasingly for weather forecasts and storm surge warnings.

The Sentinel-6 mission is part of Copernicus, the European Earth observation programme, and is a continuation of the programme started in 1992 to collect satellite-based measurements of the oceans’ surfaces. Weighing around 1.3 tonnes, the Jason-CS/Sentinel-6 satellites will ensure that measurements are carried out on a continuous basis from the years 2020 and 2026 respectively, at an altitude of around 1,350 kilometres. Operations for the missions, each running for five and a half years, will be overseen and managed by EUMETSAT in Darmstadt, Germany. Development of the satellites will be based on the highly successful CryoSat programme.

“The Jason-CS/Sentinel-6 programme underscores Airbus Defence and Space’s outstanding expertise in the field of Earth observation satellites,” said Dr. Michael Menking, Head of Earth Observation, Navigation and Science at Space Systems, after the signature of the contract. “Reliable, high-performance satellites gather data about our ecosystem in a precise and sustainable way, providing politicians, scientists and other users with an important diagnostic and decision-making tool.

“As the leader of five of the seven Copernicus missions, Airbus Defence and Space is the key industrial partner par excellence for satellite-based monitoring of the environment,” he said.

As with CryoSat, Airbus Defence and Space in Friedrichshafen will be the prime contractor for the space segment and lead the industry consortium on behalf of ESA. Thales Alenia Space France will construct the main instrument, a radar altimeter, whose predecessor is already being used on CryoSat-2, Jason-3 and Sentinel-3. Further instruments are being developed by NASA/JPL in the USA. The American National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is also a partner of Sentinel-6/Jason-CS.

While GE continues to work towards metal printed parts into aircraft, Stratasys is hard at work on the plastics side. Today, the company announced that aerospace giant Airbus has 3D printed over 1,000 parts for the passenger A350 XWB aircraft, completed and delivered to Qatar Airways in December of last year.

In a press release, Stratasys stated that the aircraft manufacturer relied on 3D printing for its flexibility, so that it could meet its scheduled delivery. The 1,000 parts were printed from Stratasys’ ULTEMTM 9085 material, which has met the aerospace requirements set by Airbus. At the same time that the components were strong and lightweight, due to the FDM technology used to print them, they were also flame, smoke, and toxicity (FST) for use inside of the aircraft. Though the parts weren’t specified, it’s likely that some of them were coverings for electrical components. The Airbus video below provides more insight into the company’s 3D printing facilities and how they apply specifically to the recently produced aircraft:

Executive Vice President of Business Development, Marketing & Vertical Solutions for Stratasys, Dan Yalon, said of the project, “We are delighted that Stratasys additive manufacturing solutions are being adopted by Airbus for its flagship A350 XWB aircraft. Both companies share a vision of applying innovative technologies to design and manufacturing to create game-changing benefits.” He continued, “Our additive manufacturing solutions can produce complex parts on-demand, ensuring on time delivery while streamlining supply chains. Additive manufacturing also greatly improves the buy-to-fly ratio as significantly less material is wasted than with conventional manufacturing methods. Stratasys is looking forward to bringing these and other advantages to its collaboration with Airbus and to being part of Airbus’ Factory of the Future initiative.”

3D printing aerospace components is neither new for Stratasys or Airbus. Including its work with Airbus, Stratasys has a history of 3D printing prototypes, jigs and fixtures, and even end parts for the aerospace industry. Airbus, which will also see the use of GE’s 3D printed metal components, will be 3D printing satellite parts for the UK Space Agency and Innovate UK’s National Space Technology Programme. Ultimately, the company even envisions 3D printing entire aircraft, though that is still a long ways off. Perfecting 3D printing to ensure that it can be used for more critical end components in aerospace is still a little ways off, as well."
Five countries using A400M aircraft suspend flights after Seville crash - EL PAÍS USA,"Mon, 11 May 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vZW5nbGlzaC5lbHBhaXMuY29tL2VscGFpcy8yMDE1LzA1LzExL2luZW5nbGlzaC8xNDMxMzMxMzQxXzA0MjAyOC5odG1s0gFcaHR0cHM6Ly9lbmdsaXNoLmVscGFpcy5jb20vZWxwYWlzLzIwMTUvMDUvMTEvaW5lbmdsaXNoLzE0MzEzMzEzNDFfMDQyMDI4Lmh0bWw_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"An A400M at a Berlin air show in June 2010. JOHANNES EISELE (AFP)

The United Kingdom, Turkey, France, Germany and Malaysia have all decided to suspend the use of the Airbus A400M after an accident involving the plane in Seville at the weekend, which saw four people killed. These five countries – the only ones apart from Spain who currently operate the A400M – have 12 units between them.

France, however, will still use the aircraft in certain situations.

“Our A400M are in operation and will only be used in extremely high priority cases,” announced French Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian on Sunday.

The Spanish Public Works Ministry revealed on Saturday that the black box flight recorders from the plane had already been found, but that they had suffered “significant damage caused by the heavy impact and subsequent fire.” They have been passed onto the investigating judge who will be in charge of determining the causes of the accident.

The ministry also announced that Public Works Minister Ana Pastor headed up a coordination meeting on Sunday regarding the crash at the Seville airport. Attendees included the secretary of defense, Pedro Argüelles, members of the Military Air Accident Commission and technicians from the Civil Aviation Accident Investigation Commission.

Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, meanwhile, is being kept informed of the progress of the two survivors of the accident and the progress of the investigation into the crash. Spain’s defense minister, Pedro Morenés, has called for a complete investigation of the crash, and requested that the incident was not used to doubt “the credibility of Airbus.”

In March 2012, Spain’s former king Juan Carlos I flew in an A400M.

The British Air Force currently has two A400M military transport planes, and has a total of 22 on order, which are due to be delivered over the next few years. “Operations of British A400M planes have been interrupted while the investigation into the accident in Seville is carried out,” a Defense Ministry spokesperson said at the weekend. “Our thoughts are with the family and friends of those who were involved in the accident.”

This has been a terrible blow for the company, and now the most important thing is to be with the victims and their families” Airbus spokesperson

In Spain, the investigation will be carried out under the auspices of the Defense and Public Works ministries. There is, however, a legal loophole given that the latter is in charge of civil aviation investigations, while a military commission called CITAAM is charged with incidents involving aircraft from the armed forces. The plane that crashed on Saturday in Seville is a military aircraft, but did not belong to the armed forces, rather the manufacturer, Airbus.

The company has already sent a team of technicians to the crash site to begin investigations. “This has been a terrible blow for the company, and now the most important thing is to be with the victims and their families,” said a company spokesperson.

Four employees from Airbus were killed on Saturday in the crash and another two suffered serious injuries when the plane, which was being tested ahead of its delivery to Turkey, crashed near the airport of the Andalusian capital. The crew was made up of a pilot, copilot, mechanic and three engineers. The identities of the victims have not yet been released.

The two survivors of the accident are being treated in Seville hospitals, and are in a “stable but serious condition,” according to medical sources who spoke to news agency Europa Press."

In the United States, Simplot will monitor fields distributed over several states during the growing season. This imagery will be acquired at key crop growth stages, and will be assessed for in-season adjustments.

Satellite imagery provided during the growing season will allow Simplot to collect reliable data on crop conditions, and pinpoint variations that could be related to specific pest, nutrition or water issues. Thanks to Pléiades acquisition capacity, Simplot will be able to cover its entire geographic footprint to create a precise and detailed database. This advanced mapping will enable Simplot to provide growers with crop change detection analysis, and estimate the possible impacts this may have on yield.

As a result, it will be possible for Simplot to diagnose crop issues, through field comparisons, allowing Simplot to guide crop production management and optimization decisions in real time. Factors such as seed density, fertilizer, water and other inputs will be adjusted on a sub-field level with pinpoint accuracy. “The Pléiades images collected at key crop stages will fully support more sustainable farming practices while saving time and cutting costs,” stated Allan Fetters, Director of Technology for Simplot Grower Solutions.

Airbus Defense and Space relies upon twin satellites, Pléiades 1A and 1B, that operate as a constellation in the same orbit, phased 180 degrees apart and deliver very high-resolution optical data products in record time, offering a daily revisit capability to any point on the globe.

Spain halts Airbus A400M test flights pending crash cause - Washington Times,"Tue, 12 May 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b250aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDE1L21heS8xMi9zcGFpbi13aXRoZHJhd3MtcGVybWl0LWZvci1haXJidXMtYTQwMG0tdGVzdC1mbGlnaC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"MADRID (AP) - Spain on Tuesday withdrew permission for test flights of Airbus A400M military transport planes that are still in production until an investigation determines the cause of a deadly weekend crash, officials said.

The move, announced by Defense Minister Pedro Morenes, sparked new uncertainty about planned deliveries of the cargo plane to national militaries that have ordered it by the dozens.

In a statement, Airbus said it was too early to say how Spain’s decision would affect the delivery schedule for the planes, and it was working with military authorities and customers “to manage the situation.”

Two pilots and two flight test engineers died in Saturday’s crash in the southern city of Seville, where A400Ms are being assembled.

“It’s not a good idea for those planes in the production phase and about to do tests to fly without knowing what really happened with the (crashed) plane,” Morenes said in an interview with Onda Cero radio.

Spain’s air traffic controllers said on Twitter that the pilots had communicated just before the crash that an unspecified problem was affecting the flight.

Some media outlets also quoted Airbus Seville labor union representative Francisco Figueroa as saying the pilot evaded a much worse disaster by landing the plane in a field, avoiding a possible crash into a nearby shopping mall or factories.

“It appears that the pilot made a maneuver to try to avoid worse things happening in the accident,” Morenes said. The four who died were honored at a funeral mass at Seville’s cathedral on Tuesday.

Morenes said the permits were being temporarily rescinded by Spain’s National Institute for Aerospace Technique, which means that A400Ms in final stages of assembly cannot go on test flights.

Morenes declined to provide initial findings of the crash investigation, stressing that the probe will be complicated. Also, a judge in Seville in charge of the crash probe ordered that it must be conducted in secret.

Possible human and technological crash factors will be investigated, Morenes said, adding the possibility that the pilot’s maneuvering of the plane in its final moments in the air might provide clues.

Separately Tuesday, Airbus sought to promote the plane’s safety by conducting a test flight of another A400M. The plane flew safely from Toulouse, France, to Seville.

That flight was not affected by Spain’s halt on test flights because the plane owned by Airbus is a test plane not scheduled for delivery, said an Airbus official who spoke on condition of anonymity because of company policy preventing the official from being named.

Fernando Alonso, who heads Airbus Defense and Space, took part as a flight engineer in a symbolic show of confidence.

Alonso got his job in January after Airbus dismissed his predecessor following complaints by governments about continued delays in finishing the cargo plane whose rollout went billions over budget and years beyond deadline.

Four of the five countries that already have A400Ms - Britain, Germany, Malaysia and Turkey -grounded the plane after the crash. France, which has six, says it will only use the aircraft in urgent operations.

The 20-billion-euro A400M program saw its first deliveries in 2013. Some 194 aircraft have been ordered by eight countries - including Spain - to replace their aging military transport fleets.

Airbus patents new plane design to alleviate boarding backup - Fox News,"Thu, 14 May 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveG5ld3MuY29tL3RyYXZlbC9haXJidXMtcGF0ZW50cy1uZXctcGxhbmUtZGVzaWduLXRvLWFsbGV2aWF0ZS1ib2FyZGluZy1iYWNrdXDSAV9odHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3huZXdzLmNvbS90cmF2ZWwvYWlyYnVzLXBhdGVudHMtbmV3LXBsYW5lLWRlc2lnbi10by1hbGxldmlhdGUtYm9hcmRpbmctYmFja3VwLmFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Whatever happened to the good old days of boarding the airline from back to front?

Frequent flyer programs and other boarding allowances have made the modern boarding process a congested mess that seems to take forever. And as passengers scramble for bin space, it can back up boarding even further.

But Airbus has recently patented a design by German transportation design firm Ugur Ipek who sought to alleviate our modern boarding woes.

Ipek and his team first created a new style of cabin with a widened middle section and double doors in the center of the aircraft with a wider aisle in 2006. For the exterior of the plane, he was inspired by the “perfecto” cigar, which is wider in the middle. The interior, with its high ceiling and futuristic open trick-windows using tiny reflective cameras to display the exterior atmosphere, is a nod to the Hagia Sophia in Istanbul.

The new entry way will allow passengers to traverse to the front or rear of the craft without having to walk the entire length of the plane. Ipek said he was inspired by own issues with sometimes time-consuming air travel experiences.

""Many people nowadays commute on airplanes so an early flight on Monday and afternoon flight on Friday on major routes are usually fully booked, "" Ipek explained to FoxNews.com. ""I have experienced many unnecessary long boarding times no matter what kind of boarding principles different airlines are using.""

Ipek and his design firm have created interior designs for airplanes as well as major car companies like Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Volkwagen, believes the new airplane model will revolutionize the boarding process. The designer noted that he has been in talks with Airbus for years and recognizes there may be certain practical building issues from an engineering perspective.

""Moving the boarding door to center doubles the flow rate. The possibility to overtake makes things again faster and from the point of comfort much smoother for all resulting in relaxed passengers,"" Ipek says. The designer added that he estimates a boarding time of about 10 minutes for ""a single aisle aircraft like a Boeing 737 or Airbus A320.""

Airbus has not yet announced plans for a rollout of the newly reconfigured airplanes."
A senior Airbus engineer just showed us 5 new inventions that could transform aviation - Benton Evening News,"Wed, 20 May 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJlbnRvbmV2ZW5pbmduZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzIwMTUwNTIwL2J1c2luZXNzLzcwMTI0MzMzNy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A senior Airbus engineer just showed us 5 new inventions that could transform aviation

Airbus, the 50 billion (£36 billion, $56 billion) French aircraft maker, has potentially uncovered a number of inventions that could transform the aviation industry in the future.

After receiving around 500 submissions for its ""Fly Your Ideas"" competition this year, to seek out ideas from students with a mix of engineering and non-engineering backgrounds, Airbus unearthed a number of pretty incredible innovations that could be created, patented and implemented in aerospace production.

The five finalists' inventions were so cool that a senior Airbus engineer walked Business Insider through the blueprints.

""The competition isn't for us to steal people's ideas and make a massive profit from it, we have been very clear from the start that the intellectual property is owned by the students and the academic insitutions they come from,"" said Professor Ian Lane, senior expert, composite analysis at Airbus to Business Insider. ""This is our version of an outreach programme that can generate and inspire the next world generation of engineers and potentially create some industry changing innovations in the process. Students are a freethinking bunch.""

Airbus invests 2 billion (£1.4 billion, $2.2 billion) a year in research and development and files over 600 patents a year. Some of the ideas are pretty cool and could make the grade for future production.

Drones and ""Birdport""

Team Birdport from the University of Tokyo, Japan, proposes deploying a flock of drones or UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) to guide birds from airports to a comfortable habitat nearby.

It is aimed at significantly reducing the number of bird strikes to aircraft and also enhancing aircraft availability. The drones use tactics of ""separation, alignment and cohesion"" to manipulate flocks and divert them to Birdport, which is a natural habitat where birdsong and decoys are used.

Professor Lane said that this was the first time a drone concept had been entered into the competition, which takes place every two years.



Energy-harvesting skin

Team Multifun from Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands has the idea of dressing the plane wings with a composite skin that harvests energy from natural vibrations or flex in the wings. Using piezoelectric fibres, electrical charges are gathered by even the smallest movements during flight.

The energy can then be stored in battery panels integrated in the fuselage and can be used to power auxiliary in-flight systems, such as lighting and entertainment systems. It is aimed at reducing the energy footprint of the aircraft and has the potential of replacing the entire power source for ground operations.



Game console-inspired infra-red guidance system

Team Aft-Burner-Reverser from the Northwestern Polytechnical University in China proposes applying motion-sensing technology from a games console to an aircraft guidance system for use when the aircraft is taxing.

It is aimed at saving airlines millions of dollars a year by reducing the the turnaround time of aircraft between flights and the cost of damage as the model uses infra-red and visual information to warn the pilot and ground crew of high-risk obstacles.





The faster trolley trash system

Team Retrolley from the University of São Paulo, Brazil proposed a new system that is aimed at reducing waste in-flight and cutting down the time taken to collect and sort rubbish post-flight.

It is also aimed at speeding up airline operations particularly on short-haul carriers.

The bespoke trolley model is designed to intelligently sort rubbish and recycling by minimising the volume of foils, paper and plastic and collecting residual fluid. The team estimates that the model can reduce the weight of galley equipment by up to 30kg. This has the potential to reduce airline fuel consumption while also offering more space for in-flight for refreshments.





Wireless and greener ground operations

Team Bolleboos from the City University London, UK is the only all female team to enter the finals. One is studying Business/Finance/Management and the other two are engineering students.

The group proposes to use a ""WEGO"" system that picks up energy during taxiing. It is aimed at reducing airlines' carbon emissions by 50%. The model uses transmitter sections on the ground, located just underneath the aircraft in the tarmac, transfer electrical power inductively to a receiver placed between the nose-wheels.





The winning team will be announced on May 27, and will receive 30,000 (£21,489, $33,404) in prize money. The runners-up will share 15,000 (£10,744, $16,705).

""The competition doesn't guarantee a job with Airbus at the end of it but it does provide a fantastic platform to get recognised and show us and future employees their ideas, abilities and enthusiasm for engineering,"" said Professor Lane. ""Some previous winners have ended up working for us as either an intern or a permanent employee though. We want to be a company that students aspire to join and I think them meeting us demystifies us as we can come across as scary I suppose.""

Workers at Airbus factories around the world observed a moment of silence for the victims of Saturday's crash, the first of an A400M military airlifter. ""We maintain our confidence in the plane,"" the head of the company's military aircraft division, Fernando Alonso, told reporters at the factory in the southern city of Seville where Airbus assembles the A400M. He said he would take part in the next test flight of the plane on Tuesday in Toulouse in southern France where Airbus's headquarters are located. The A400M plane that crashed in a field and burst into flames just north of Seville's airport was several minutes into a test flight before it was due to be delivered to Turkey in July. Three passersby helped emergency services workers pull two of the plane's six crew members alive from the wreckage. The pair, an engineer and a mechanic, are in hospital in serious condition. German newsweekly Der Spiegel reported that the plane experienced multiple engine failure, citing comments by one of the crash survivors. The seriously injured survivor has so far only been questioned about the crash ""very briefly"", it said. The A400M, a large, propeller-driven transport aircraft, was launched in 2003 to respond to the needs of seven NATO members -- Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Spain and Turkey. - Planes grounded - Difficulties in the development of the plane's giant turboprop engines are among the causes of the sustained delays in building the A400M aircraft, which is designed to meet the needs of military and humanitarian missions. In addition to production and delivery delays, the programme has also run 30 percent -- or 6.2 billion euros ($7 billion) -- over budget. Earlier Monday, Malaysia became the fourth country to ground its A400Ms while it waits for the causes of the accident to become clearer, following similar decisions by Britain, Germany and Turkey. France, which has six of the planes, has said it would only carry out ""top priority flights"" with the A400M until more facts emerge on what exactly went wrong. In Germany, a spokesman for the country's armed forces said an A400M plane received in December 2014 has already put in 57 hours of flight time, including in Senegal. ""No significant security shortcomings which would lead to grounding the aircraft were detected,"" he added. Workers at Airbus's eight factories in Spain downed tools at noon to observe five minutes of silence in memory of the four people who died in the crash. Those at the company's factories in other nations were due to observe one minute of silence, said the Airbus delegate at Spain's largest workers' union Comisiones Obreras (CCOO), Antonio Martin. He refused to speculate on the causes of the accident and its possible impact on the A400M programme. ""The priority is the mourning and looking after the families of the victims,"" Martin said. - 'No hasty conclusions' - Spanish Defence Minister Pedro Morenes said Sunday it was ""extremely important to not reach hasty conclusions"" about the accident. Airbus ""represents the European military industry, we therefore must show our clear support for efforts to clarify this incident"", he added during a meeting in France with his German, French and Polish counterparts. There are a total of 12 A400M planes in use at the moment -- in addition to the six operated by France, Britain and Turkey have two each and Malaysia and Germany each have one. Airbus maintains its goal of delivering 14 A400M planes this year. Twenty A400M planes are currently being assembled. A total of 174 A400M planes have been ordered by the seven NATO nations as well as Malaysia. Airbus's shares were 2.07 percent lower on the Paris stock exchange at the close on Monday, after plunging by more than four percent earlier in the day."

Airbus aims to strike a new sales deal for its A400M military aircraft this year and hopes it will bolster interest in the delay-plagued transporter, a senior executive from its defense division said.Several buyers, including Turkey and Germany, have expressed frustration at repeated delays in deliveries of the heavy cargo and troop carrier, Europe’s largest defense project.“We are targeting a sales announcement for the A400M this year,” Antonio Rodriguez-Barberan, an executive at Airbus Defense and Space, told Reuters on the sidelines of a conference in Istanbul late on May 5.“We hope this will drive a domino effect.”He did not give any details about the potential sale, such as the size of the deal or the purchaser.Airbus acknowledged last year it faced more delays in delivering the aircraft, and took a charge of 551 million euros ($618 million).Ankara has said it would force Airbus to pay a penalty or offer services in compensation for late deliveries.Other European buyers -- jointly represented along with Turkey by defense procurement agency OCCAR -- include Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, Luxembourg and Spain. Malaysia has also agreed to buy the plane, which fits between the smaller Lockheed Martin C-130 and larger Boeing C-17.Separately, Turkey’s defense procurement agency said it expected to sign an agreement on Wednesday with Airbus on maintenance support for the A400M, allowing it to service the aircraft."
Saudi airline cancels contract after plane taken to Israel - The Times of Israel,"Sun, 10 May 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpbWVzb2Zpc3JhZWwuY29tL3NhdWRpLWFpcmxpbmUtcHVsbHMtY29udHJhY3QtYWZ0ZXItcGxhbmUtdGFrZW4tdG8taXNyYWVsL9IBW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpbWVzb2Zpc3JhZWwuY29tL3NhdWRpLWFpcmxpbmUtcHVsbHMtY29udHJhY3QtYWZ0ZXItcGxhbmUtdGFrZW4tdG8taXNyYWVsL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Saudi Arabian Airlines canceled a contract with a Portuguese company for taking an off-duty airliner with Saudi Arabian Airlines branding for maintenance at Ben Gurion International Airport in Israel, a Saudi newspaper reported Sunday.

Last week, footage surfaced on social networking sites of the aircraft on the tarmac in Israel.

The plane was taken to Israel on Wednesday for routine maintenance by Hi Fly, a Lisbon-based airplane leasing company.

According to Arab News, the airline, the Saudi government-owned Saudia, canceled the contract after the plane aroused a firestorm among Israel’s curious media.

“The company had been given a contract for air transport to provide Saudia with planes for commercial operations,” a statement by Saudia said.

“The plane was off duty and under the management of the holding company at the time when it left Saudi Arabia on Sunday, May 3, for Brussels, Belgium, for routine maintenance,” the airline said.

Saudi Arabia has no official ties with Israel and has been among the leaders of the Arab boycott of the country since the 1970s.

According to Saudia, by taking the plane to Tel Aviv, Hi Fly had committed a blatant violation of the contract, which mandates that the leasing company obtain written approval mentioning the airports where it is to land or undergo routine maintenance.

“Such landing or operation process should take place in a country that shares diplomatic relations with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to enable Saudia staff and the Civil Aviation authority to conduct inspection and follow up on the maintenance operation at any time,” Arab News quoted from Hi Fly’s contract with the Saudi carrier.

The aircraft, an Airbus A330, arrived from Brussels with no passengers on board, according to a report in Ynet news Wednesday.

The aircraft is owned by a European company and leased to Saudia — Saudi Arabia’s government-owned national airline.

As per the directions of the company, the plane landed in Israel for routine upkeep by Bedek, an Israeli company contracted by Israel Aircraft Industries.

An IAI spokesperson confirmed the plane’s arrival on Wednesday and said that the “ongoing and routine maintenance” of the Airbus passenger plane was part of the services Ben-Gurion provided to the aircraft manufacturer.

"Using ARM chips and Linux, Barcelona center dreams of being 'Airbus of supercomputing' - ZDNet","Fri, 01 May 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnpkbmV0LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3VzaW5nLWFybS1jaGlwcy1hbmQtbGludXgtYmFyY2Vsb25hLWNlbnRlci1kcmVhbXMtb2YtYmVpbmctYWlyYnVzLW9mLXN1cGVyY29tcHV0aW5nL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Barecelona chapel that houses MareNostrom. Image: BSC

In the Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC), big data isn't a new or revolutionary concept. The center, located on the campus of the Polytechnic University of Catalonia, has been managing huge volumes of data for companies from fields as diverse as energy and pharmaceuticals since 2005, helping them cut costs and boost returns.

Mateo Valero, director of the BSC, told ZDNet that the center has already participated in 3,000 research projects since it was founded. And, despite the ongoing economic crisis, it has created 150 highly skilled jobs in the last five years, and now has a total of 425 professionals working in four areas: computer sciences, life sciences, earth sciences, and computer applications. ""We're very efficient when it comes to getting resources,"" Valero said with a smile.

The BSC, managed jointly by the Spanish government's ministry of education and science, the Catalan government's department of education and universities, and the Polytechnic University of Catalonia, is a research center but also serves as infrastructure for other researchers in both Spain and across Europe.

Its crown jewels, kept in a 120 square metre chapel, is the MareNostrum, a supercomputer made by IBM which runs on Linux, and has fibre connections to universities and European research centers. When it was released in 2004, it became the fourth most powerful computer in the world and first in Europe.

Now it ranks 57th on the Linpack Benchmarck. The number one position on the list is taken by the Chinese Tianhe-2 machine which delivers 33.86 petaflops (quadrillions of calculations per second).

Thanks to an upgrade completed a few years ago, MareNostrum now has a peak performance of 1.1 petaflops, with Intel 48,896 Sandy Bridge processors in 3,056 nodes, and 84 Xeon Phi 5110P in 42 nodes. The system notches up more than 104.6TB of main memory and 2PB of GPFS disk storage.

The supercomputer almost never stops. It churns through €1.4m a year in electricity, a bill that the center didn't want to increase with a uninterrupted power supply (UPS).

If there's a power outage, the machine can still run for two or three hours, but not longer. The supercomputer has a system that makes regular checkpoints to restrict information lost in case of power failure. While that may seem problematic for projects that use large amounts of data, energy savings carry greater weight.

What's more challenging is having processors that crash, Valero said - which is why BSC researchers are working on techniques that allow calculations to switch to another processor when one fails. That way, the research is able continue as if nothing had happened. Fortunately, this kind of situation is rare.

""The third pillar of science""

The supercomputer serves a good list of projects. Seventy percent of its capacity is destined for European researchers and 24 percent for Spanish projects. The remaining six percent is reserved for a diverse array of BSC initiatives.

Valero likes to say that ""supercomputing is the third pillar of science,"" after theory and laboratory research. With MareNostrom performing 1015 operations per second and storing massive amounts of data, it enables countless applications. ""It's like a microscope that can be used in any field,"" said Valero, who began teaching at the UPC in 1974 and still speaks passionately about supercomputing.

For example, the BSC director says Repsol, a global energy company based in Madrid, uses MareNostrum to develop new algorithms to track the seabed and predict with increasing accuracy where there may be oil, bringing considerable savings to an industry where a 25 percent chance of success is considered high.

Iberdrola, another Spanish energy company concentrating on wind power, found that MareNostrum enabled it to study the best location for building turbines in wind farms. With the simulations carried out in the supercomputer, performance has been raised by five percent. BSC researchers are now working on a second phase of the project to get accurate forecasts of energy production in the short term, which are useful for renewable energy companies to plan feeding back energy to the grid.

In the same area of engineering, the center is working on building biosimulators, which show in detail how the heart and respiratory system work.

In the area of life sciences, the center has become an essential partner for different institutions in Barcelona and Spain which are working on issues of genomics and drug development. A few months ago, an article published in Nature highlighted the Smufin software developed by the BSC, looking at how it facilitates the comparison of genomes, both for clinical use and research.

Moreover, the BSC hosts the European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA), which stores genome and phenome data on over 100,000 people, from 200 centres and research groups all around the world. It is a fundamental resource for the advancement of personalised medicine. The amount of data generated is amazing and the concern for security inevitable. But the BSC's director said that ""bioinformatics data is easier to protect than data from thousands of applications we use every day on mobile phones"".

Dreams for the future

While exaflop (1018) machines are predicted to hit the market by 2018, Valero isn't holding his breath. ""We need 100 million processors and these processors have two problems. The first is the cost of energy, which would be in any case substantial: around €500m per year. The second is that as the number of processor grows, 'component failure rate' becomes a serious issue,"" he said. ""We should point to 2022,"" he said, but admitted that he's ""not a guru"" on this issue.

He nonetheless predicts the future lies in cognitive computing and is convinced that mobile technology can increase the power of supercomputers without increasing energy expenditure. After all, the most powerful supercomputer in the world, Tianhe-2, runs up a bill of 25 megawatts per year, or roughly €25m.

Mobile power

As a result, the BSC is already working on the development of Mont-Blanc , a supercomputer based on ARM chips more commonly associated with smartphones; there's already a prototype in the same chapel where MareNostrum is housed. Mont-Blanc is ""what's next"", said Valero. It's a great challenge with a budget of €11.3m (€8m from the EU) for its second version, set to be completed next year. For the moment, the prototype is testing different applications.

""Now it's possible to make competitive supercomputers in Europe, because technology is available and the environment is favorable. Our dream would be to create the 'Airbus' of supercomputing,"" Valero said.

But in the short term, the next logical step is updating MareNostrum - one of the requirements of the European Union's PRACE (Partnership for Advanced Computing in Europe) program, which mandates that a supercomputer in either Germany, Italy, France or Spain has to be renewed each year to maintain European competitiveness in supercomputing. Yet patch-type solutions like adding more processors are not enough. Valero made it clear that the whole supercomputer must be overhauled.

This will be the fourth version of MareNostrum. The third cost €22.7m including taxes and associated overheads such as power and cooling. Its successor is expected to cost more or less the same when it's finished next year. With the new update, the BSC could be among the best in the Linpack Benchmarck again, even if ""it's not the only priority"" for the center, according to Valero.

The BSC aims to combine a good position in the Top 500 list, with an architecture that enables it to serve as many users as possible. Then, old components would be recycled in other supercomputing centers in Spain. ""As good Catalans, we don't throw anything away,"" said the BSC director.

Modern design of Airbus ACJneo is natural fit for new technologies - Skies Magazine,"Wed, 20 May 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vc2tpZXNtYWcuY29tL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL21vZGVybmRlc2lnbm9mYWlyYnVzYWNqbmVvaXNuYXR1cmFsZml0Zm9ybmV3dGVjaG5vbG9naWVzL9IBYWh0dHBzOi8vc2tpZXNtYWcuY29tL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL21vZGVybmRlc2lnbm9mYWlyYnVzYWNqbmVvaXNuYXR1cmFsZml0Zm9ybmV3dGVjaG5vbG9naWVzLz9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A320neo flght testing is already under way, with deliveries to airlines due to begin towards the end of this year.

Launching two new aircraft, the ACJ319neo and ACJ320neo, gives Airbus the ability to offer customers a corporate jet solution with more comfort, range and efficiency. They build on the widest and tallest cabin that is already the cornerstone of the family’s success around the world.

Both aircraft capitalize on new engines now being developed for the modern A320 airliner family, as well as Sharklets and improvements in cabin comfort and fuel capacity.

The more modern design of the A320 Family, which was conceived in the 1980s and has been continuously improved, enables it to better incorporate new technologies than older designs.

As a result, the ACJ319neo will fly eight passengers 6,750nm/12,500 km, and the ACJ320neo 25 passengers 6,000nm/11,100 km, bringing even more city-pairs within nonstop range.

Airbus pioneered the use of new engines and Sharklets, which, in addition to increasing range, deliver a 16 per cent improvement in fuel efficiency on the ACJ320neo, compared with today’s ACJ320ceo. Sharklets also reduce noise and emissions.

Airbus has already won around 3,800 orders for the A320neo Family which, together with today’s A320 Family, has now booked an impressive 11,600-plus orders.

Flight trials of the A320neo are already under way, with deliveries to airlines due to begin towards the end of this year, so the future is already flying.

New engines

Most of the efficiency improvement of a new aircraft comes from its engines.

Early jetliners of the 1950s and 1960s, were powered by small-diameter turbojet engines, in which all of the air entering passed through the hot core, before being ejected out of the back.

More modern jetliners of the 1970s and 1980s are powered by larger diameter, turbofan, engines, which bypass much of their airflow around the hot core.

Turbofan engines are inherently more efficient, because they generate thrust by ejecting a larger mass of air more slowly than smaller ones, throwing away less energy in their exhaust.

Today, the trend is toward even larger diameter turbofan-engines, for even greater efficiency.

Airbus offers CFM International LEAP-1A or Pratt & Whitney’s PW1100G engines on the ACJneo Family. Both have larger diameters than those on the competing aircraft, whose 1960s origins, when engines had small diameters, limits the size of what will fit beneath its wing today.

In addition to their larger diameter, higher bypass-ratio advantage, the new turbofan engines on the ACJneo family feature other new technology. This includes improved aerodynamic flows, advanced materials and higher pressure-ratios, which further reduce fuel consumption.

Sharklets

Wings generate lift by creating high-pressure air underneath their surface and low-pressure air above it. At the wingtips, high-pressure air underneath the wing tries to join the low-pressure air on top, creating large swirls called vortices.

Surfaces at the wingtips, such as Sharklets, limit this airflow around the wingtips. This saves fuel by reducing drag, while also improving take-off and landing performance.

Sharklets are already in widespread service on airliner versions of the A320 Family. They are also flying on the Airbus ACJ320 Family, on which they are both new-build and retrofit options.

Sharklets are standard fit on the ACJneo Family, improving appearance as well as extending range, reducing fuel-burn, and improving performance.

Lower cabin altitude

Civil aircraft typically fly at heights of 30-40,000ft, where thinner air makes breathing difficult. Their cabins are thus pumped up with air as they climb, to provide a breathable atmosphere for passengers (typically the equivalent of about 8,000ft, though this varies from aircraft to aircraft).

A lower cabin altitude makes most sense on long flights, especially towards their end, when an aircraft is able to reach its highest cruising altitude. This because aircraft are laden with fuel at the start of such flights, only being able to climb higher after consuming much of their fuel.

Airbus’ ACJneo Family will feature a lower cabin altitude (LCA), equivalent to an average of less than 6,400ft, delivering an atmosphere that is even closer to that experienced on the ground.

Additional centre tanks (ACTs)

The Airbus ACJ319neo is offered with up to five ACTs in its cargo-hold, allowing space for baggage underfloor – as well as on board. This matches the five ACTs that some of today’s ACJ319 operators currently utilise.

The ACJ320neo is now offered with up to four additional centre tanks (ACTs) in its cargo-hold – two more than previously offered. The disposition of the ACTs in the cargo-hold is also improved, allowing up to 18.4m3/650ft3 of baggage to be carried when all four ACTs are fitted."

PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus Defense & Space on Tuesday ordered engine software checks on the A400M aircraft following a recent crash of Europe's new military transporter.

The request comes after the discovery of a potential anomaly in the system running the plane's turboprop engines.

However, one person familiar with the findings said evidence gathered so far appeared to suggest a ""quality"" problem rather than a fundamental design flaw.

Four crew members were killed when an A400M crashed in Spain on May during a pre-delivery flight test.

Airbus said it had issued an alert asking air forces to examine the plane's 'Electronic Control Unit' before the next flight.

The unit controls the engines and is part of a suite of software systems that were partly blamed for earlier delays and cost overruns in building the troop and cargo carrier.

Additionally, nations operating the plane must carry out other checks whenever this unit or an engine is replaced.

""To avoid potential risks in any future flights, Airbus Defense and Space has informed the operators about necessary actions to take,"" a statement said.

The call for engine-related checks confirms an earlier Reuters report.

So far, few if any clues have emerged from the 'black box' flight recorders, at least one of which has been sent to the United States for examination.

The potential area of concern was discovered by Airbus in its own review.

""It is a precautionary measure which is part of our continued airworthiness activities,"" the spokeswoman said.

The Airbus A400M was developed at a cost of 20 billion euros in Europe's largest defence project.

It is powered by the West's largest turboprop engines, designed by Britain's Rolls-Royce, France's Safran and MTU Aero Engines of Germany.

Problems in developing the engines, and particularly in certifying the engine control software, contributed to three years of delays and a new cash injection by governments in 2010.

The Electronic Control Unit is one of two pieces of complex software that make up the engine control system, or FADEC, whose development was led by Munich-based MTU Aero Engines.

The crash came amid new delays in fitting the aircraft with military systems and raised further questions over the timing of deliveries after Spain suspended pre-delivery test flights.

Airbus has said the deliveries are ""under review"".

The A400M has been delivered so far to Britain, France, Germany, Turkey and Malaysia, which is so far the only export customer. Other buyers include Belgium, Luxembourg and Spain."

The co-pilot who is believed to have deliberately crashed a Germanwings jet in the French Alps may have “rehearsed” steering the plane into a rapid descent on an earlier flight, German daily Bild reported.

Quoting sources close to the French investigating authorities, the newspaper said that the co-pilot, 27-year-old Andreas Lubitz, appeared to have tried out a “controlled, minute-long descent for which there was no aeronautical reason” on the earlier outbound flight from Dusseldorf to Barcelona.

Investigators had discovered this after a close evaluation of the jet’s black-box flight recorder, Bild said.

The French authorities are scheduled to publish an interim report on their investigation into the crash later on Wednesday, but declined to comment on its contents or on the Bild report.

The Germanwings Airbus 320 was en route from Barcelona to Duesseldorf when it crashed in the French Alps on March 24, killing all 150 people on board.

French investigators believe that Lubitz, who had been diagnosed as suicidal in the past, deliberately brought the plane down.

Doctors had recently found no sign that he intended to hurt himself or others, but he was receiving treatment from neurologists and psychiatrists who had signed him off sick from work a number of times, including on the day of the crash.

Police found torn-up sick notes during a search of his apartment after the crash.

Lufthansa, which owns Germanwings, declined to comment on the Bild report, pointing to the ongoing investigation."

The co-pilot of the Germanwings aircraft which crashed into the French Alps in March rehearsed the destruction of the aircraft during its outward flight to Barcelona, it has emerged.

Andreas Lubitz placed the Airbus A320 on a collision course with the ground five times in four minutes but cancelled the instructions before any loss of height became apparent, according to a preliminary report on the disaster.

French accident investigators are unsure whether Lubitz, 27, was contemplating an act of mass murder on the outward flight from Düsseldorf on 24 March or whether he was just practising his plan to destroy the jetliner. “I cannot speculate on what was happening inside his head,” said Rémi Jouty, head of the Bureau d’Enquêtes et d’Analyses (BEA). “All I can say is that he changed the [automatic pilot[ to the minimum setting of 100ft and he did it several times.”

The findings provide new evidence that Lubitz’s actions two hours later – flying the aeroplane at high speed into a mountain in the French Alps, killing all 150 people on board – were planned and not an act of spur-of-the-moment madness. The rest of the 30-page interim report from the BEA broadly confirmed information that had already been released or leaked.

On the return Barcelona to Düsseldorf flight, Lubitz locked the senior pilot out of the cabin when he went to the toilet. He then set the autopilot to 100ft, ignored a dozen automatic and ground control warnings, boosted the power of the engines until the aircraft flew at full tilt into the side of a mountain 100 miles north of Nice, the report said.

As the aircraft careered towards destruction, Lubitz impeded frantic attempts by his senior pilot to open the cockpit door. He blocked the normal entry code and then ignored loud hammering.

The two black box flight recorders found at the crash scene – covering all of the aircraft’s movements that day – suggest that the senior pilot also left the cockpit as the Germanwings plane flew south towards Barcelona earlier that day. The BEA report said that Lubitz then interfered with the automatic pilot altitude settings on five occasions in just over four minutes. As the plane flew over the Mediterranean, he was instructed by air-traffic control to descend to 35,000ft. Instead, he selected 100ft, then 49,000ft, then 35,000ft.

When told to descend to 21,000ft, he set the controls for 100ft several times. The cockpit voice recorder then picked ups noises which suggest that the senior pilot had returned to his seat.

In each case, the changes were cancelled so quickly that neither the passengers nor the crew probably felt any “appreciable effect”, Mr Jouty said. The senior pilot, Patrick Sondheiner, would therefore have had no reason to suspect that his colleague was planning to destroy the aircraft.

The final BEA report, to be released some time next year, will examine factors that may have helped to produce the calamity. It may recommend new rules for mental health checks on pilots and a re-examination of the systems for locking cockpit doors imposed after the 9/11 hijackings and terrorist attacks in the US.

Mr Jouty said his team would look at the “current balance between medical confidentiality and flight safety”. They would also revisit the “compromises” made between different threats to security when unbreachable locks were placed on the cockpit doors of airliners.

Lubitz is known to have had problems with depression during his pilot training, but Lufthansa, the parent company of Germanwings, said that his regular medical checks had revealed no problems. Evidence uncovered by German investigators at Lubitz’s home at Montabaur, in the Rhineland, suggest that he destroyed doctors’ notes advising him to take time off work. He had also studied suicide techniques on the internet.

The interim BEA report said it would now examine the “psychological aptitude” of pilots – “how it can arise that a pilot finds himself alone in a cockpit with the intention of destroying the aircraft and its occupants”."

While there were miraculously no deaths on this occasion, bird strikes can cause serious damage to aircraft and pose a real danger to the safety of passengers.



Team Birdport from the University of Tokyo wants to minimize the number of these collisions with drones which will lead wildlife to a designated safe area away from planes. ""Our drones guide a bird flock by circling around the flock while it is slowly moving to an airport,"" says Birdport team leader Santoshi Miyarani. ""According to our initial simulation, we may need up to 30 drones to guide 100 birds to the so-called 'birdport,' the safe haven away from the airport and aircraft,"" he adds.The safe zone would be located six miles away from the runways, and once the flock is on site, the team would deploy decoys and birdsong in order to keep them there.

Airbus – Be aware a software bug in A400M can crash the plane - Security Affairs,"Wed, 20 May 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vc2VjdXJpdHlhZmZhaXJzLmNvbS8zNjk3Mi9zZWN1cml0eS9haXJidXMtc29mdHdhcmUtYnVnLWE0MDBtLmh0bWzSAU1odHRwczovL3NlY3VyaXR5YWZmYWlycy5jb20vMzY5NzIvc2VjdXJpdHkvYWlyYnVzLXNvZnR3YXJlLWJ1Zy1hNDAwbS5odG1sP2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus – Be aware a software bug in A400M can crash the plane

Pierluigi Paganini May 20, 2015 May 20, 2015

The crash of the Airbus A400M military transport in Spain was caused by a software bug, three engines were shut down immediately after the start due to the flaw.

Recently we have discussed a lot about the possibility to hack a plane, almost everyone has read about the computer security researcher Chris Roberts which reported the FBI that he obtained the control of at least one commercial flight causing it to “climb”.

Which is the impact of technology in these complex systems? A cyber attack, or more simply a software bug, can be the cause of serious problems for a flight?

The answer is affirmative, persistent rumors accredit, as the main cause of the plane crash involving an Airbus A400M in Spain to an Airbus A400M, a software bug.

The crash occurred on May 9, a military transport aircraft Airbus A400M struck down for failure. The Airbus has sent an alert to customers warning of possible problems and instructing them to run specific checks of the Electronic Control Units (ECU) of the engines. Unfortunately, the entire crew was killed in the crash.

“Airbus Defence and Space has today (Tuesday 19 May) sent an Alert Operator Transmission (AOT) to all operators of the A400M informing them about specific checks to be performed on the fleet. To avoid potential risks in any future flights, Airbus Defence and Space has informed the operators about necessary actions to take. In addition, these results have immediately been shared with the official investigation team. The AOT requires Operators to perform one-time specific checks of the Electronic Control Units (ECU) on each of the aircraft’s engines before next flight and introduces additional detailed checks to be carried out in the event of any subsequent engine or ECU replacement.” states the press release.

The News Agency SPIEGEL ONLINE reported that engineers have discovered a software bug in the control unit of the engines that it is likely to have caused the loss of three blowing works.

The German magazine reported that three engines shut down due to “contradictory instructions” sent by the control system. The pilots tried to return to the Seville airport, but the aircraft crashed after hitting a power pole.

An Airbus employee told to the Spiegel that the crash was caused by “a quality problem.”

“”It is very likely to be a quality problem in our work”, says from Airbus circles. In recent months, therefore, the overall management of Airbus subsidiary in Seville has been replaced. Back then reacted Airbus CEO Tom Enders on the significantly delayed delivery of the machines, among others for the German Luftwaffe. Der Spiegel had also about quality problems in the delivery reports of the first German A400M.” states the SPIEGEL ONLINE.

Investigators will provide more information after the analysis of the “black box” that is currently “being kept under wraps by a Spanish judge.”

Airbus shifting to pulse-line assembly for A320 wings - Flightglobal,"Sun, 31 May 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYWlyYnVzLXNoaWZ0aW5nLXRvLXB1bHNlLWxpbmUtYXNzZW1ibHktZm9yLWEzMjAtd2luZ3MvMTE3MDQxLmFydGljbGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus is shifting its A320-family wing production concept away from static assembly to a semi-automated pulse-line to improve efficiency ahead of transition to A320neo production.

The change is being introduced at the airframer’s UK plant at Broughton, which supplies wings to the entire Airbus range.

Airbus is producing A320s at a monthly rate of 42 aircraft but has committed to raise this to 46 next year and hike it again, to 50, in 2017.

Chief operating officer Tom Williams, speaking during a briefing in Toulouse, said that such rates were not envisaged when the A320 wing plant was originally designed.

“If you look at the structural build of the wing box, you’d find something akin to what you’d have found in a shipyard many years ago,” he says.

This static system requires multiple components to be moved to a jig, where they are assembled by several personnel. Airbus has accommodated rate increases through a “risk-averse” duplication of the system, says Williams, “until you have 18 jigs all doing the same thing”.

“Clearly what we want to do now is to go to a flow-line,” he says, adding that Airbus is preparing this for 2017 operations.

“We’re going to move to a full flow-line with intelligent application of robots, to take out a lot of the heavy manual drilling and integration problems.

“We think that’s going to be a very exciting concept in terms of reducing our manufacturing lead-times and giving us some big improvements in quality.”

Airbus is aiming to maintain production rates during the transition to the re-engined A320neo, which is scheduled to enter service this year.

“We don’t have the luxury of ramping down and ramping back up,” says Williams.

He says the manufacturer is already performing “run at rate” testing – notably for newly-designed parts for the A320neo, such as the pylon – to simulate the full production rates which will be demanded.

The Airbus A330-300 flight on 23 May “encountered bad weather at 39,000 feet (11.9 km) about three and a half hours after departure” from Singapore, the airline said in a statement.

“Both engines experienced a temporary loss of power and the pilots followed operational procedures to restore normal operation of the engines,” it said.

“The flight continued to Shanghai and touched down uneventfully at 10.56pm local time,” it said.

It added that the Airbus A330-300 plane’s two Rolls-Royce engines “were thoroughly inspected and tested upon arrival in Shanghai with no anomalies detected”.

“We are reviewing the incident with Rolls-Royce and Airbus,” Singapore Airlines said.

In a Twitter post late on Tuesday, Flightradar24 said the flight, codenamed SQ836, “lost power on both engines & 13,000 feet before power returned”.

In a subsequent post, it said the plane “lost both engines during the cruise” while flying through a “huge storm”, pinpointing an area in the South China Sea off China’s southern coast where the incident occurred.

Singapore Airlines, Asia’s third largest carrier by market value, currently has 29 Airbus A330-300s in its passenger fleet.

It also has a fleet of 19 Airbus A380-800 superjumbos.

The airline, along with its subsidiaries SilkAir, Scoot, and Tiger Airways, flies to 119 destinations across 35 countries.

Last week Airbus warned of a technical bug potentially affecting the engines of its A400M military planes that was discovered during an internal test after one crashed in Spain."

Stratasys has revealed that leading aircraft manufacturer Airbus has 3D printed more than 1,000 flight parts for the A350 XWB aircraft to speed up the manufacturing process and meet tight production deadlines.

Delivered in 2014, the parts were printed on Stratasys FDM 3D Production Systems and used in place of traditionally manufactured parts in a “schedule risk production activity” that was implemented to increase supply chain flexibility.

The parts are 3D printed using Airbus certified ULTEM 9085 resin which provides high strength-to-weight ratio and is FST (flame, smoke, and toxicity) compliant for aircraft interior applications. The process results in strong, lightweight parts and reduced production time and manufacturing costs.

“We are delighted that Stratasys additive manufacturing solutions are being adopted by Airbus for its flagship A350 XWB aircraft,” Dan Yalon, Executive Vice President, Business Development, Marketing & Vertical Solutions for Stratasys, commented. “Our additive manufacturing solutions can produce complex parts on-demand, ensuring on time delivery while streamlining supply chains.”

Leading companies in a variety of industries, from aerospace and automotive to consumer goods and medical, are partnering with the additive manufacturing giant to adopt new production strategies. By adopting additive manufacturing throughout the product lifecycle, companies can lower operational costs, accelerate time to market, decentralise production, and increase product functionality.

Yalon, added: “Additive manufacturing also greatly improves the buy-to-fly ratio as significantly less material is wasted than with conventional manufacturing methods. Stratasys is looking forward to bringing these and other advantages to its collaboration with Airbus and to being part of Airbus’ Factory of the Future initiative.”

Production of the A350 XWB has been a focal point of the industrial additive manufacturing industry including the famous 3D printed seat bracket which was installed on board the aircraft last year and recognised in the 2014 German Industry Innovation Awards. Airbus announced its 3D printing plans for the aircraft in March last year and since then the industry has witnessed a number of groundbreaking aerospace applications including the world’s largest 3D printed aerospace component, the Trent XWB-92 engine implemented by Rolls Royce and developments in dedicated materials like the new the TiPOW (Titanium Powder for net-shape component manufacture) program from GKN Aerospace."

Over the weekend, Singapore Airlines Flight 836, flying from Singapore to Shanghai, lost power mid-flight on both of its Rolls-Royce engines.

According to Flightradar 24, the Airbus A330-343 experienced the problem while cruising at 39,000 feet.

""These engines are designed to shut down if they have severe problems,"" experienced A330 pilot Karlene Petitt told Business Insider in an email. ""Good news is they are also designed to auto-restart.""

Although she has never experienced a ""dual flameout"" in an A330, Petitt believes the ""bad weather"" may have caused an engine glitch.

""Pilots never stop flying the plane, no matter what,"" Petitt said. ""I'm so glad it turned out well.""

According to pilot and author Patrick Smith, the loss of both engines is exceptionally rare.

""One possibility is that the engines succumbed to ice ingestion —perhaps the ingestion of high-altitude ice crystals,"" Smith wrote in an email to Business Insider. ""Of course, jet engines are equipped with sophisticated anti-icing systems, so this would have to have been something unusual. If indeed that was the culprit. Everything at this point is speculation.""

The incident, which took place just south of Hong Kong, caused the airliner to descend 13,000 feet before the crew was able to restart the engines.

There were 182 passengers and 12 crew members on board the airliner. No injuries were reported.

According to The Aviation Herald, Singapore Airlines confirmed that the A330 ""experienced a temporary loss of power"" after encountering some inclement conditions.

Once on the ground in Shanghai, the two-month-old airliner underwent a batch of tests, but a cause for the power loss couldn't be determined, The Aviation Herald reported.

Singapore's Air Accident Investigations Bureau is looking into the incident.

From scrambling for position in the queue to squeezing past passengers blocking the aisles once on board, it can often prove to be a stressful start to the holiday.

However one German designer believes he has a solution that could bring to an end this particular peril of flying - and it's as simple as widening the aisle where the passengers are boarding.

Ipek believes that not only will his design reduce queuing time, but passengers will also find it much easier to locate their seats

Ugur Ipek, 44, who has designed interiors for aeroplanes as well as major car companies such as Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Volkswagen, believes his CIGAR design is the future of air travel.

The two main aspects of his work involve moving the boarding doors to the centre of the plane, where the aisle will be wider, before it narrows as it runs down to each end of the plane.

Speaking to MailOnline Travel, Ipek said: 'I thought, ""how can we increase the flow when boarding a plane and make their less bustle and less queuing,"" and the answer is to board in the middle into a wide aisle.

'With a large, welcoming central point, this would solve that problem, and also people would find it much easier to locate their seats.'

'In planes nowadays, as soon as someone stops to load a bag, it causes a chain, and the backlog takes time to shift.'

The German's design resembles a cigar known as the 'perfecto,' that is fat in the middle and thin at the ends

Ipek believes his double-door entry into a wider aisle will reduce a backlog of passengers we currently see

The design replicates the shape of a 'perfecto' cigar, which is fatter in the middle with smaller ends. Ipek believes that, dependent on how far the plane can be widened, there is potential for a welcome area, a bar, or even a casino in the middle of the plane.

'The design was liked so much by Airbus that it put in a patent for it in 2006, but I've not been able to talk about it until now,' added Hamburg-based Ipek.

'It's true you would have to make planes wider, but from the feedback I have got from engineers, this is favourable as it would be the area over the wings anyway and central.'

Ipek has also put forward designs for the windows in the cabin, with three large panels for viewing located between the two doors.

So when will this design hit the market?

'Airbus have the design and are looking into how this can be developed, but I'm not aware of when this might actually happen,' he said.

Could Ipek's design finally mean an end to time wasted queuing to locate our seats?"

news by Terry Spruce May 22, 2015 Print this page

Acropolis Aviation will be the launch customer of the Airbus ACJ320neo. The aircraft will enter service in early 2020.

John Bousfield, CEO of Acropolis Aviation signed the contract for the newest member of the Airbus family with John Leahy, chief operating officer, Customers and Benoit Defforge, managing director of Airbus Corporate Jets, at EBACE in Geneva.

Bousfield says: “In finalising this order today, we are committing to providing our discerning clientele with the newest and ultimate large-cabin aircraft well into the next decade. Our current ACJ319 performs at the top of the spectrum of client expectations with the largest cabin in its class. It is remarkable that the ACJ320neo will improve even further on these high specifications and standards.”

John Leahy, Airbus chief operating officer, Customers, said: “I am delighted and especially proud to announce Acropolis Aviation as the launch customer for the ACJ320neo. It builds on Airbus’s long relationship with one of the world’s leading private aviation operators. We regard G-NOAH, its existing ACJ319, as an outstanding ambassador for Airbus Corporate Jets, and I am confident that the enhanced capabilities of the Airbus ACJ320neo will help to keep Acropolis at the forefront of the global private aviation market for many years to come.”

Farnborough, UK-based Acropolis began operations with the ACJ319 in 2010. The aircraft has a VVIP cabin with 19 seats.

“Our ACJ319 with its 10-hour non-stop range is extremely popular in the high-end charter market, especially in the Middle East, USA and Europe. With the new aircraft we will gain an improved range of 6,000nm/11,100km, which means clients can fly from London to Los Angeles, Johannesburg or Tokyo direct and London to Sydney with one refuelling stop,” says Bousfield.

“Just like our existing ACJ aircraft, Acropolis’ ACJ320neo will have 180 minute ETOPS and Cat 3A low-visibility operations approvals,” he added. “Importantly too, Acropolis’ pilots and engineers will benefit from crew commonality, enabling a seamless transition from the ACJ319 to the ACJ320neo,” adds Bousfield.

The aircraft will accommodate up to 19 passengers in a VVIP configuration and will be fitted with start-of-the-art in-flight entertainment. “IFE and cabin connectivity is advancing at a rapid pace and we will ensure that our aircraft has the very latest technology, and is optimally configured for both work and leisure,” said Bousfield. “We look forward to keeping the charter community updated on developments as we progress towards service.”

The new Airbus ACJ320neo will replace Acropolis Aviation’s ACJ319. That aircraft – G-NOAH – which will become available for sale in late 2018."

Volaris, a Mexican low-cost carrier, has received its first two Airbus A321 aircraft, the latest being received during a ceremony at the Airbus Delivery Centre in Hamburg, Germany. Volaris’ aircraft will be the first A321s to operate in Mexico and will be deployed on the carrier’s domestic routes to and from Cancun.

The Volaris A321 seats 220 passengers, is equipped with Sharklet fuel-saving wing tip devices and powered by IAE engines. The two A321s will join Volaris’ existing all-Airbus fleet of more than 50 A319s and A320s aircraft. To date, Volaris has ordered a total of 74 Airbus single aisle aircraft.

The delivery highlights the market trend for larger capacity aircraft by Latin American operators as well as Mexico’s strong traffic growth. According to the most recent Airbus Global Market Forecast, the passenger aircraft fleet serving Mexico will more than double in the next 20 years.

“This is a very important step in our growth strategy, and the A321’s increased seating capacity will undoubtedly help Volaris address the increasing passenger demand for cost-efficient and comfortable air travel,” said Enrique Beltranena, Chief Executive Officer of Volaris. “It’s an honour to be reaching this milestone with Airbus, a key partner since our inception, who has played an important role in our growth as a company and the efficient operation of our aircraft.”

“The A321 is instrumental in bringing increased capacity on Volaris’ most popular routes, and it allows the airline to benefit from the lowest cost per seat of any single aisle aircraft,” said John Leahy, Chief Operating Officer, Customers. “We are pleased that the A321 will help Volaris efficiently address growing demand for cost-effective air travel in Mexico while benefitting from the unmatched comfort, operating economics and fuel-efficiency of the benchmark A320 Family.”

The A321 is the largest member of the best-selling single aisle A320 Family. The A321’s unbeatable economics offer a 20 percent capacity increase and an improved operating cost per seat compared to the A320. The A320 Family is the world’s best-selling single aisle product line with almost 11,700 orders to date and over 6,500 aircraft delivered to 400 customers and operators worldwide.

The A320 Family is the preferred choice for Latin American carriers; there are over 500 A320 Family aircraft in operation and Airbus has more than 60 percent of fleet in-service and order backlog in Latin America today. With more than 950 aircraft sold and a backlog of nearly 500, almost 600 Airbus aircraft are in operation throughout Latin America and the Caribbean. In the last 10 years, Airbus has tripled its in-service fleet, while delivering more than 60 percent of all aircraft operating in the region.

Gavin Price Jones, of Saltney, Cheshire, had worked on Airbus A320 aircraft like that involved in AirAsia disaster, in which 162 died when the plane crashed into the Java Sea between Surabaya and Singapore last December.

Family members at his inquest described how the engineer was 'driven mad' by thoughts that he may have contributed to the accident.

A engineer who worked at the Airbus plant in Flintshire (pictured in file photo) killed himself after developing an irrational obsession with the idea that he had caused a plane crash, a inquest has heard

Mr Jones's wife Louise found her husband - who worked for Airbus in Broughton, Flintshire - hanged in January 20 this year. A note had been left nearby.

The hearing at West Cheshire Magistrates Court heard had become depressed due to a combination of his fixation on having caused the crash, the death of his father and a difficult conversation in which he talked a friend out of suicide.

Giving evidence at the inquest, held at West Cheshire Magistrates Court, his wife said: 'The AirAsia flight that came down just after Christmas was an Airbus A320, which is what he works on.

'He thought he was to blame for that aircraft going down. These thoughts drove him mad. He was obsessed.'

Mrs Jones said she had spoken to her husband about the issues and explained he would draw technical pictures to demonstrate 'how he was to blame' for the air crash.

Gavin Price Jones had worked on the Airbus A320 (pictured in file photo) like that involved in the accident but had nothing to do with the crash, a coroner said

She arranged for the 37-year-old to speak to the head of quality and safety at work, who attempted to reassure Mr Jones he was not at fault, but to no avail.

'It got steadily worse over time,' she said. 'It was all he thought about.'

Mr Jones' mother, Susan, said he had also talked to her son about his belief he was to blame for the air disaster a week or so before he died.

'When he told me, I knew that he was ill,' she said.

On the morning his death he told his mother he was going for a walk and 'seemed fine' when his wife left with her young son, the hearing was told.

'He was a quiet person anyway. He kissed me goodbye and then I went,' she said.

Alan Moore, assistant coroner for Cheshire, concluded Mr Jones took his own life while the balance of his mind was disturbed.

The plane was carrying 162 people from Surabaya to Singapore when it crashed in the Java Sea last year

Mr Moore said: 'For reasons only known to Gavin, he formed the belief he was somehow involved in the [AirAsia] disaster.

'His employers and national media events would indicate this was completely and utterly irrational. Gavin played no part in that disaster, but he must have believed he did.

'These irrational thoughts triggered low mood and anxiety. It seems to have become all-consuming.

'His family and friends had no idea what was about to happen. They couldn't have known of his intentions.'

The Indonesian national transportation safety committee is investigating the AirAsia disaster. It is thought the plane was climbing rapidly in an attempted to fly over a storm when it crashed."
ANALYSIS: Airbus keeps pilot conversion to A350 from A330 simple - Flightglobal,"Fri, 22 May 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYW5hbHlzaXMtYWlyYnVzLWtlZXBzLXBpbG90LWNvbnZlcnNpb24tdG8tYTM1MC1mcm9tLWEzMzAtc2ltcGxlLzExNjk3MS5hcnRpY2xl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"With the A350 conceived as the natural replacement in the Airbus product line for the A330 family, the manufacturer had to ensure the desire to introduce advanced technology into the new twinjet did not create too big a step for pilots transitioning from the earlier type.

While on the face of it, the new cockpit with its six huge glass display screens looks a world apart from its predecessor, the reality is that once crews have undergone conversion training the two environments feel very similar, says Christian Norden, head of A350 flight crew training at Airbus.

“When A330 pilots first enter the A350 cockpit they say ‘that’s totally different, that won’t work’, because this is not the A330,” says Norden. “At the end of the conversion course, they make their first take-off and first landing in the A350, and everyone so far has said ‘it’s an A330’.”

The A330's flightdeck (above) looks very different to the A350's (below)....

The A330 and A350 have approval from the European Aviation Safety Agency and the US Federal Aviation Administration for a common type rating. “So every A330 pilot can say ‘hey, I’m an A350 pilot already,’” quips Norden.

“One EASA pilot commented that the handling is so similar that you could probably make a common rating between the A320 and A350. But we are not bold enough yet to try that.”

There is an eight-day differences training course to enable A330 pilots to add the A350 to their rating, including a four-day ground course and four days of systems training, explains Norden.

Early A350 customer Finnair plans to make full use of the common rating, he adds. “From September onwards Finnair plans to make A330/A340/A350 common rating.”

...but flightcrews report no issues with common rating after training

Airbus is currently working on the differences programme between the A380 and A350, with a five-day course being targeted, says Norden. “We have to make a little bit of manoeuvring training because coming from a quad to a twin, engine-out handling is different. So we have to make use of a full-flight simulator.”

The programme is likely to comprise a two-day ground course, two days in the simulator and a one-day skills test, he adds.

Madrid: At least three people were killed when an Airbus A400M military plane crashed near Seville airport in southern Spain on Saturday, the regional emergency services said.

“There are at least three dead and two seriously injured,” a spokesman for the emergency services told AFP.

The plane crashed in a non-residential area around a mile north of Seville airport, which was closed to traffic for about an hour.

Airport authority AENA said on Twitter that the airport’s firefighters were at the scene of the crash, “beyond the airport’s perimeter.”

Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said there had been “eight to 10 people on board”.

Speaking on Tenerife, one of the Canary Islands, where he was attending a campaign meeting, he sent his condolences to the victims, Spanish news agencies reported.

Aviation sources confirmed the plane was one of Airbus’ new A400M troop transporters, which are assembled at a factory in Seville.

Airbus Defence and Space, the Airbus division responsible for military aircraft, said the plane was destined for Turkey.

The group sent a team of experts to the crash scene.

If confirmed as an accident, it would be the first since the aircraft, which was fraught by development and shipping delays, went into service.

UK halts Airbus A400M usage after Seville crash - The Guardian,"Sun, 10 May 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS91ay1uZXdzLzIwMTUvbWF5LzEwL3VrLW1vZC1oYWx0cy1haXJidXMtYTQwMG0tc2V2aWxsZS1jcmFzaC1zcGFpbtIBXWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS91ay1uZXdzLzIwMTUvbWF5LzEwL3VrLW1vZC1oYWx0cy1haXJidXMtYTQwMG0tc2V2aWxsZS1jcmFzaC1zcGFpbg?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Britain has temporarily stopped using a new military transport plane after one crashed near Seville airport in south-west Spain, killing four crew members and seriously injuring the other two.



The Ministry of Defence has two Airbus A400M aircraft, and their operations have now been paused.

The plane was undergoing flight trials at Seville airport, which was closed after the crash.

An MoD spokeswoman said: “The UK’s A400M aircraft operations have been paused while an investigation into the crash in Seville is carried out. Our thoughts are with the family and friends of those involved in the incident.”

The Royal Air Force took delivery of its first Airbus A400M in an official ceremony at RAF Brize Norton last November. In all, 22 have been ordered, to be delivered over the next few years.

Airbus Defence and Space said that of a total crew of six, four were killed and two were in hospital in a serious condition. All the crew members were company employees and of Spanish nationality. A spokesman said: “Our thoughts are with the families and friends of those affected by this tragic accident and we are providing all our care and support.”

An Airbus Group team of technical advisers was being sent to provide full assistance to the official committee in charge of the investigation.

The plane was expected to be the third aircraft to be delivered to a Turkish customer, and formal delivery was scheduled for next month.

The A400M is a large, propeller-driven transport aircraft that is being assembled in Seville. Some 194 have been ordered by eight countries, including Spain, seeking a replacement to its ageing Hercules fleet.



The plane can perform three very different types of duties: tactical and strategic missions directly to the site of action, as well as being able to serve as a “tanker”. It is thought to be the ideal airlifter to fulfil the diverse requirements of nations around the globe in terms of military and humanitarian missions.

It was launched in 2003 to respond to the combined needs of seven European nations (Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Spain, Turkey and the UK), with Malaysia joining in 2005. Its maiden flight took place in December 2009 and the delivery of the first A400M was on 1 August 2013 to the French air force."
At least four dead after military cargo plane crashes in Seville - EL PAÍS USA,"Sat, 09 May 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vZW5nbGlzaC5lbHBhaXMuY29tL2VscGFpcy8yMDE1LzA1LzA5L2luZW5nbGlzaC8xNDMxMTg1Nzk0XzM4MjU3OC5odG1s0gFcaHR0cHM6Ly9lbmdsaXNoLmVscGFpcy5jb20vZWxwYWlzLzIwMTUvMDUvMDkvaW5lbmdsaXNoLzE0MzExODU3OTRfMzgyNTc4Lmh0bWw_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"At least four people have died after a military cargo plane crashed shortly after taking off from Seville airport on Saturday, the Spanish central government’s delegate in Andalusia, Antonio Sanz, has confirmed.

A total of six people – all Spaniards – were aboard the Airbus A400M, Sanz said. Two others are seriously wounded with multiple injuries and second- and third-degree burns.

The plane, which was undergoing tests, crashed into an electricity pylon shortly after alerting air traffic control that it was experiencing problems.

One of the first people to arrive on the scene said that “almost the whole plane had been turned into ash”

A pile of ash, part of the destroyed pylon, and wreckage from the aircraft, including its wheels, are visible at the site.

One of the first people to arrive on the scene said that “almost the whole plane had been turned into ash.”

Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy expressed his sympathy over the incident. “We offer our support to the victims and their relatives and express our sorrow” said the Popular Party (PP) leader, who was in the middle of an election rally when he heard the news. “At this time I have to ask for this meeting to come to an end, because I have just been informed that an Airbus airplane has crashed,” he told those gathered. Both the PP and the Socialist Party have cancelled all campaigning for the May 24 local and regional elections planned for Saturday.

The A400M is the military aircraft with the biggest propellors in the world and undergoes final assembly at the Airbus Military plant in Seville. The aeronautics firm began manufacturing the model in 2011 after a number of delays. The project got underway in 2003 following an agreement between seven countries – Germany, France, Spain, the UK, Turkey, Belgium and Luxembourg – which together promised to buy 180 units.

The original budget for the program was €20 billion but that was increased by another €11 million as a result of the amount of technology required. The aircraft that crashed had yet to be handed over to its buyer, Turkey, and was still the property of Airbus.

Spain has committed to buying 27 of the aircraft, the first of which is due to be handed over at the start of 2016. The aim is for them to replace the US-made C-130 Hercules tactical airlifters that have been in service in the Spanish air force since 1973.

Even thought the accident occurred outside the perimeter of Seville’s San Pablo airport, no planes are currently landing or taking off there on account of the fact that firefighters are unavailable. Flights have been diverted to Málaga and Jerez."
