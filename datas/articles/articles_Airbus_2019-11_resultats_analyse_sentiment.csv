Airbus and its partners unveil details of new Eurofighter ECR concept - Airbus,"Tue, 12 Nov 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOS0xMS1haXJidXMtYW5kLWl0cy1wYXJ0bmVycy11bnZlaWwtZGV0YWlscy1vZi1uZXctZXVyb2ZpZ2h0ZXItZWNy0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"@airbus_defence @eurofighter @hensoldt #ECR

Berlin, 12 November 2019 – At the International Fighter Conference in Berlin Airbus and its partners introduced for the first time concrete details of the new Eurofighter electronic combat role (ECR) concept. This role will enlarge Eurofighter’s multi-role capabilities and further increase the survivability of coalition forces in hostile environments.

Collaborative electronic warfare capabilities are essential for future combined air operations.

Initial Eurofighter ECR capability is expected to be available by 2026, followed by further development steps and full integration into the future combat air system (FCAS) ecosystems.

Eurofighter ECR will be able to provide passive emitter location as well as active jamming of threats, and will offer a variety of modular configurations for electronic attack (EA) and suppression/destruction of enemy air defence (SEAD/DEAD). Latest national escort jammer technology will ensure national control over features such as mission data and data analysis. The concept also features a new twin-seat cockpit configuration with a multi-function panoramic touch display and a dedicated mission cockpit for the rear-seat.

The concept is driven by the leading aerospace companies Airbus, Hensoldt, MBDA, MTU, Premium Aerotec, Rolls-Royce and supported by the German national industry bodies BDSV and BDLI. It specifically targets the German Air Force requirements for an airborne electronic attack capability. Furthermore it is the single opportunity to deliver such capabilities on the basis of national sovereignty, whilst also securing key military technologies within Germany.

Eurofighter is the backbone of German air defence. With more than 600 aircraft under contract and a workforce of 100.000 it is the largest collaborative defence programme in Europe to date.

Airbus business interns bring the 'secret sauce' to the job - Wichita State University,"Mon, 25 Nov 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpY2hpdGEuZWR1L2Fib3V0L3dzdW5ld3MvbmV3cy8yMDE5LzExLW5vdi9haXJidXNfaW50ZXJuc185LnBocNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Alok Dand, a Wichita State industrial systems and manufacturing engineering doctoral student, and Airbus systems and data analyst intern, has complete confidence in his five months of work at the on-campus office.

“We have responsibilities, we solve problems, and we deliver,” Alok said.

Pardhiv Marella, a computer science master’s student, has been an Airbus financial systems and data analyst intern for a year. Pardhiv can finish Alok’s sentences.

“Which transcends what a normal internship would look like,” Pardhiv said.

The business interns at Airbus’ Innovation Campus office feel right at home in their work and understand the importance Airbus places on everything they do. They hail from diverse backgrounds and depend on each other to develop and sustain Airbus’ work.

Angelique Banh, marketing senior and business operations intern, can vouch for the skill each intern brings to the table.

“Alok and I are on the same business operations team, and in our team meetings, our colleagues look to Alok for direction and troubleshooting. They really see him as an integral part of the team, which is really cool – they don’t just treat him as an intern. They really do respect him,” Angelique said.

They’re not just interns. They’re valued team members.

“I’ve never felt like an intern here,” Pardhiv said. “There are real problems and real responsibilities we have to solve all the time.”

Pardhiv and Alok both look at data sources across Airbus Wichita’s finance and operations, connect the sources, analyze them and report their findings directly to managers. They have a direct connection to Airbus senior management.

“It’s a fun job for both of us because I think both of us look at this particular area for our futures as well, and it’s very good exposure we are getting in this place and in experience as well,” Alok said.

For Pardhiv and Alok, it’s a dream job. As engineering students, they have dreamed of being a part of one of the big aircraft manufacturing firms for a long time.

I’ve never felt like an intern here. There are real problems and real responsibilities we have to solve all the time. Pardhiv Marella, financial systems and data analyst intern

Still, Airbus frequently hires people with skillsets beyond engineering and aviation. Pardhiv recognizes the value of the team’s diversity of backgrounds.

“Alok, Angelique… they each have their own definition,” Pardhiv said. “They all have their own ‘secret sauce,’ as I say, which makes us learn and grow from each other every day.”

Angelique is an organizer and facilitator. She communicates among internal, on-campus and community partners to organize media, outreach and sponsorship opportunities.

She cares a lot about Airbus’ presence in the community.

“I feel like Airbus is really trying to have more presence on campus. It’s participating in events – right now it’s mostly engineering and business-related, but Airbus is branching out to other areas,” Angelique said.

Angelique has represented Airbus at events such as the United Way of the Plains campaign kickoff at the Century II Performing Arts Center.

Airbus also sponsored the t-shirts for Wu’s Big Event, a massive WSU volunteer effort that took place on Oct. 5.

These projects and others have helped Angelique expand her range of skills and problem-solving capacity.

“I definitely have grown. Sometimes I run into issues, and I must find a way to resolve them and still make things happen for both parties,” Angelique said.

The business interns’ ability to tackle complex problems from multiple perspectives makes them a cohesive team.

“We always appreciate each other,” Pardhiv said. “When we see problems, sometimes we call on each other to get it done.”

Although they may not be directly working with each other every day, they make a point of developing their network among fellow interns and staff.

Pardhiv has initiated an informal “intern lunch” on Fridays. Interns across business and engineering are welcome to attend. Some of the people who show up for lunch aren’t even interns – they’re just younger full-time employees.

“We are happy, which makes our day happy,” Pardhiv said.

All three interns take time out of work to go to class. Airbus’ place on campus makes going to class and being a part of the WSU community easy.

“I like how it’s really accessible – it’s a 10-minute walk to the RSC. That’s super awesome. I’m able to go back and forth from here to class without having to drive and find parking,” Angelique said.

Angelique manages the “Airbus + Wichita State” social media account. It’s not just Airbus for a reason.

“We are proud to be Shockers,” Pardhiv said.

The Airbus Engineering Center in Wichita is engaged in aerostructures design and analysis of aircraft primary structure such as wings and fuselages for all major Airbus commercial products.

Their In-Service Repair and Customer Service teams are also engaged in Airbus’ “follow the sun” strategy, in which they work with similar Airbus facilities across the globe to provide customers with 24/7 support.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9997596144676208}",neutral,0.9997596144676208,0
Airbus expects updated industry call for Germany's Tornado replacement contest - Defense News,"Tue, 12 Nov 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS9pbmR1c3RyeS8yMDE5LzExLzEyL2FpcmJ1cy1leHBlY3RzLXVwZGF0ZWQtaW5kdXN0cnktY2FsbC1mb3ItZ2VybWFueXMtdG9ybmFkby1yZXBsYWNlbWVudC1jb250ZXN0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"BERLIN — Airbus expects an updated industry solicitation for Germany’s multibillion-dollar Tornado replacement program, for which the company will offer an electronic attack-capable Eurofighter.

Wolfgang Gammel, the head of combat aircraft business development, said he learned about the impending update during conversations with Defence Ministry officials.

A ministerial spokeswoman declined to comment beyond the official line that an announcement about the acquisition program is expected in the first quarter of 2020 and that Berlin is looking to quickly replace its aging Tornado fleet.

The requirement for an electronic attack capability was absent from the original request for information when competitors placed their bids in the spring of 2018, Gammel told reporters Tuesday at the International Fighter Conference, a gathering of senior air force and industry leaders in Berlin.

After Lockheed Martin and its F-35 were eliminated early this year, that left only the Eurofighter and Boeing’s F-18 Growler in the race.

An updated RFI presumably would reopen the competition between the remaining bidders as the acquisition process plays out anew on the question of electronic attack capabilities. Such a move would all but certainly result in a sizable delay, as German officials have been trying to be especially thorough in seeing the program through.

Airbus said introducing so-called escort jammer pods to the Eurofighter fleet, to be carried under the belly or the wings of the aircraft, would require little effort because the proposed integration strategy is meant to piggyback on upgrade efforts already on the books.

Complicating a pick between the Eurofighter and the F-18 is the requirement that Germany must keep a contingent of aircraft capable of carrying U.S. nuclear bombs under NATO’s nuclear doctrine. That seemed to give Boeing’s offering an advantage, German paper Süddeutsche Zeitung claimed in a report last month.

For its part, the F-18 is known for its ability to counter enemy air defenses, an area where Airbus now seeks to lay down its own marker.

Airbus: We should fly like geese to save fuel and CO2 - Leeham News and Analysis,"Tue, 19 Nov 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxOS8xMS8xOS9haXJidXMtd2Utc2hvdWxkLWZseS1saWtlLWdlZXNlLXRvLXNhdmUtZnVlbC1hbmQtY28yL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Bjorn Fehrm

November 19, 2019, ©. Leeham News: Airbus presented a real innovative idea yesterday at the Dubai Air Show to reduce the environmental footprint of civil air transport. In the future we should fly like geese, it saves both fuel and CO2 emissions.

The airframer is starting a program to explore how the geese reduce their energy consumption while flying long distances. They fly in each other’s up-wash. This is to date the most innovative idea in the airframer’s quest to reduce air transport’s environmental footprint. Is it the most unrealistic? Perhaps not.

Fello’fly is flying like the geese

Airbus has started a demonstrator program it calls fello’fly. It says:

“Airbus’ fello’fly project aims to demonstrate the technical, operational and commercial viability of two aircraft flying together for long-haul flights. Through fello’fly, a follower aircraft will retrieve the energy lost by the wake of a leader aircraft, by flying in the smooth updraft of air it creates. This provides lift to the follower aircraft allowing it to decrease engine thrust and therefore reduce fuel consumption in the range of 5-10% per trip.”

The principle of using the bird ahead’s upwash is shown in figure 2.

It this realistic? At least as realistic as the inflated expectations around electric and hybrid aircraft fixing the environmental problems of air transport. To gain 10% in fuel burn using these principles will take huge investments in research and development and the results are not guaranteed before we pass the next decade. For the “flying astern” Airbus expects a faster return:

“Airbus is due to commence flight tests with two of its A350 aircraft in 2020. Given the high potential for a positive environmental impact for the industry, Airbus is targeting an ambitious timeline for a controlled Entry-Into-Service (EIS), which is expected before the middle of the next decade.”

Fello’fly problems?

There are many problems involved but also advantages. Let’s start with the advantages:

Fello’fly will require investments in enhanced autopilot and modified anti-collision/ADS-B equipment to automate the merging/splitting of aircraft and the fly-astern and make this safely. And Air Traffic Control (ATC) routines need to be set up. But this is limited investments compared to the investment we need to gain 5-10% fuel burn by updating aircraft/engines or the investments in electrical/hybrid aircraft.

It will reduce the congestion in the ATC system, for instance when passing the Oceans. Today’s NATS tracks over the Atlantic are getting crowded. In the military, aircraft are handled in two-ship or lager units to alleviate ATC congestion. This can be used for civil flight as well, at least for the cruise segment.

The problem areas:

There is an obvious safety aspect with aircraft flying close together. Military aircraft have been flying like this for 100 years. So, it’s nothing new. In the military, it’s done manually but we have the means to automate it in a safe way with today’s civil airliner technology. Every airliner already has the TCAS (Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System) and will have ADS-B. This gives the basis for an aircraft merging and place-holding system together with the Autopilot.

Aircraft need to coordinate their flights. It can seem like a major obstacle. The question is: it this really needed? Below is a screenshot from the UK’s NATS which shows the traffic over Europe yesterday. At altitude, all aircraft are flying on air traffic highways, after each other. Over the Ocean’s it’s even more pronounced, the aircraft fly in tracks, bunched up after one-another. It’s not inconceivable we can have an automatic merging of adjacent aircraft to fly part of the way as a two-ship, to then split again before the final part of the flight.

The fello’fly idea can seem far-out. For promising a gain of 5-10% in fuel consumption, and by it CO2 emission, and a reduction in air traffic congestion it’s worth a thorough vetting.

Airbus CIO Luc Hennekens' plan to disrupt aviation with data - CIO,"Fri, 08 Nov 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpby5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS8xOTc2NjUvYWlyYnVzLWNpby1sdWMtaGVubmVrZW5zLXBsYW4tdG8tZGlzcnVwdC1hdmlhdGlvbi13aXRoLWRhdGEuaHRtbNIBY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpby5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS8xOTc2NjUvYWlyYnVzLWNpby1sdWMtaGVubmVrZW5zLXBsYW4tdG8tZGlzcnVwdC1hdmlhdGlvbi13aXRoLWRhdGEuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It was also key that the project had active and visible executive support and that non-agile teams were engaged but not guiding the plans.

“You need to protect the agile teams from the organisation trying to apply the old ways of working again to what they’re doing,” said Hennekens. “And there’s always going to be a tendency of managers who have people inside the perimeter of the agile teams to ask for updates and to give instructions and to set priorities, and you simply cannot afford that. What it also means though, is that you have to engage the non-agile teams outside of that perimeter, because you still need these people”.

Digital accelerator

The success of Skywise encouraged greater focus on digital initiatives at Airbus. The company went on to build an API platform that third parties could use to develop applications on Skywise, while also enabling Skywise to connect to legacy systems.

At times, the team were overwhelmed by the requests for support from customers, which led them to increase the self-service capabilities on the platform. The experience taught Hennekens the importance of automation standards in building for scale.

“If you want to do a lot of self service, that means you need to build a lot of automation,” he said. “If you want to build a lot of automation, you can almost only do it if you have sufficient standardisation, because you can not automate customised solutions for everybody.”

Hennekens advises IT leaders considering similar projects to build for their long-term aims from the beginning, which would help them avoid having to go back and redesign components later.

He also suggests they leverage the expertise of partners while ensuring that internal teams build the knowledge they need to take control of the product.

“You need to have the ability to set the technical direction and to drive the partners, as opposed to being driven by your partners, so investing internally in capability and building that up early on is absolutely key,” he said.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9986819624900818}",neutral,0.9986819624900818,0

Airbus and Strata celebrate 10-years of partnership shaping UAE's aerospace industry - Airbus,"Mon, 25 Nov 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOS0xMS1haXJidXMtYW5kLXN0cmF0YS1jZWxlYnJhdGUtMTAteWVhcnMtb2YtcGFydG5lcnNoaXAtc2hhcGluZy11YWVz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus celebrates 10-years of partnership with Strata shaping the UAE’s aerospace industry, highlighting key milestones achieved with the UAE-based manufacturer throughout the past decade.

As part of the UAE’s drive to create a world-class aerospace industry to deliver on its diversification strategy, Airbus is increasing its Middle Eastern footprint through industry cooperation with local entities to contribute to the nation’s economic growth. Abu Dhabi-based Strata Manufacturing has risen to become a regional supplier of Airbus aircraft parts in the Middle East, playing a major role in Airbus’ global supply chain.



Since its inception, Strata has developed expert capabilities to manufacture the latest generation aircraft parts to meet industry demand from its cutting-edge facility in Al Ain. Operating with a 700-strong workforce, Strata plays an integral role in shaping the future of the global aerospace industry that will contribute to growing a knowledge-based competitive economy in the UAE.



Since 2009, Airbus has enjoyed a decade-long cooperation with Strata, which has acted as a key supplier on the assembly line for Airbus’ long-haul commercial aircraft range. The collaboration led to the development of the Al Ain-based manufacturer’s 350,000 square foot facility in the Nibras Al Ain Aerospace Park.



Months after completion of Strata’s world-class facility, the aero composites manufacturer began supplying Airbus with aileron panels and flap-track fairings. In 2010, Strata shipped its first consignment of parts to Airbus for its A330 and A340 aircraft.



Strata further developed its manufacturing capabilities in 2015 by building parts of the wing for the Airbus A330, A340 and flap tracks for the A380. The same year, Airbus appointed Strata as its single-source supplier of ailerons for Airbus’ A330 aircraft. Deepening the level of cooperation between the two companies, 2016 became an important year with Airbus and Strata signing a landmark agreement to manufacture the Inboard Flaps for the A350-900.



Since 2010, Strata has delivered 2,353 shipsets and 30,073 components to Airbus.



Mikail Houari, President for Africa and Middle East at Airbus said: “Strata is a proud example of UAE excellence and success on so many levels.



“In addition to being a regional supplier of Airbus aircraft parts, Strata is also made up of a 700-strong workforce, of which 90 per cent are female and 50 per cent are Emirati. As such, the manufacturer is testament to the UAE’s long-term vision of promoting gender equality and Emiratisation. Strata is also a clear reflection of how we do business, advancing the UAE’s aerospace industry and the importance we place on purposeful collaboration and knowledge sharing at all levels.”



Ismail Ali Abdulla, CEO of Strata Manufacturing said: “As a UAE-based manufacturer, we are proud to enjoy a long and important global partnership with Airbus.



“We have grown rapidly this past decade to cement our role as a leading aerospace manufacturer by enhancing our capabilities to meet the growing complex requirements of global aerospace companies such as Airbus.”



Strata’s strategic partnership with Airbus is a multi-faceted supplier agreement that extends Airbus’ footprint in the Middle East and supports the development of Abu Dhabi and the UAE’s aerospace industry.

Airbus provides an optimum in-flight experience with CIDS - Airbus,"Fri, 08 Nov 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDE5LTExLWFpcmJ1cy1wcm92aWRlcy1hbi1vcHRpbXVtLWluLWZsaWdodC1leHBlcmllbmNlLXdpdGgtY2lkc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has always prioritised the comfort and safety of passengers and crew aboard its commercial aircraft product lines, with numerous innovations over the years ensuring a more pleasant experience in the skies. One of the key developments is CIDS (Cabin Intercommunication Data System), which allows cabin crew to simply manage all cabin functions via easy-to-use centralised interfaces.

Airbus introduced the original CIDS on the company’s A320 in 1988, and it has since been installed in more than 10,000 aircraft. CIDS marked a major milestone, as it was the first time a single system integrated all cabin functionalities by connecting crew, cockpit, cabin systems and passenger services.

CIDS functions and services

CIDS controls many functions that improve the passenger experience onboard, with the goal to provide a pleasant atmosphere in each phase of flight. This includes control functions for such features as lighting and temperature, passenger-related services (e.g. signs, reading lights and passenger calls), as well as audio functions like boarding music or passenger announcements.

Cabin crews simultaneously benefit from the efficiency and accessibility provided by CIDS, which enables them to monitor and control the system via several touch screen interfaces in the cabin. With time and effort saved, flight attendants can dedicate more time and attention to passengers on the flight.

“CIDS provides all services and functions that a cabin crew needs to operate an Airbus cabin. It’s a very unique feature, as you don’t find all these functions together in one system on other aircraft,” said Dr. Wolfgang Fischer, Cabin Networks Expert at Airbus. He added that more than 50 functions have been integrated in CIDS to date.

The future of CIDS

The core CIDS system architecture – which is similar for nearly all Airbus aircraft types – has remained robust and effective over 30 years of operation, while allowing for seamless integration of updates and new capabilities. A high level of adaptability ensures it is suitable to the various Airbus jetliner versions without major hardware changes, while requiring minimal training for operators.

As Airbus further enhances CIDS in the years to come, there will be major pushes toward more digitalisation – allowing computers to process more types of flight-related data – as well as mobile access, with passengers potentially interfacing with crew members via their own mobile devices.

“The more data in the system, the more we can do,” Dr. Fischer added. “However, it is important to keep in mind that any future developments to CIDS must be fully safe and secure before implementation.”","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9991998076438904}",positive,0.9991998076438904,1
Airbus-built telescope for ESA's Euclid mission takes shape - Airbus,"Tue, 19 Nov 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOS0xMS1haXJidXMtYnVpbHQtdGVsZXNjb3BlLWZvci1lc2FzLWV1Y2xpZC1taXNzaW9uLXRha2VzLXNoYXBl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Toulouse, 19 November, 2019 – The Euclid mission is taking shape in Airbus cleanrooms: engineers are now finishing assembly of the telescope, the main instrument of the Payload Module, for which Airbus is responsible within this European Space Agency (ESA) mission led by Thales Alenia Space (TAS) as industrial prime contractor.

The Euclid Payload Module contains the largest telescope with such optical performance ever designed and integrated by Airbus.

After mounting the truss on the base plate, both made of silicon carbide, Airbus is now completing the final phase of integration: the optical alignment. The telescope will then be sent to Thales Alenia Space, where it will go through further testing and be integrated with the platform.

The whole payload integration necessitates extreme clean room discipline with a perfect cleanliness, temperature stability and lack of vibration. For example, during the mechanical assembly, precision of operations is calculated in µm, where for the optical alignment, the scale of precision is in nm (1 million nm in a millimetre).

Giuseppe Racca, project manager of Euclid at ESA said: “Euclid is the second “Medium Class” mission in ESA’s Cosmic Vision programme. With the ultimate goal to understand the origin of the Universe’s accelerating expansion, Euclid will map the geometry of the dark universe with unprecedented accuracy. To achieve that, we need the best team effort from 16 countries, mainly in Europe and America, hundreds of laboratories, etc. A true universal team for unlocking the secrets of the Universe.”

Euclid will collect high resolution images of the sky by pointing the spacecraft to a new field in deep space once every 80 minutes. Within six years of observation, covering more than one third of the entire sky, Euclid will measure the shapes of, and distances to, more than 1 billion galaxies.

“This telescope is the most complex we’ve ever designed and built. It must operate in extremely cold conditions of 100 Kelvin (- 170°C), relying on Airbus’ world-leading expertise in silicon carbide technology for space – already proven in orbit on ESA’s Herschel and Gaia missions,” said Philippe Pham, Head of Earth Observation, Navigation and Science at Airbus.

The Euclid Payload Module has three primary features, the main telescope, a 1.2m diameter mirror and a three-mirror Korsch telescope. The main telescope is made entirely of lightweight silicon carbide (SiC) which gives it excellent thermal stability and enables operation at 130 K (-140°C), making it invisible to near infrared wavelengths.

The 1.2 metre mirror permits diffraction-limited observation of galaxies as faint as magnitude 24.5, while the Korsch telescope supplies light to its two scientific instruments, the Visible Imager (VIS), and the Near-Infrared Spectrophotometer (NISP).

The VIS & NISP instruments are maintained in a very cold environment, at 155 K (-115°C) for the VIS focal plane and 90 K (-180°C) for the NISP one, while the VIS electronics have to be maintained at 290 K (20°C).

The VIS & NISP instruments are developed by the Euclid Consortium and delivered to Airbus and Thales Alenia Space by ESA.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Emirates has ordered 50 Airbus A350 jets, the Dubai state-owned airline announced at the Dubai Air Show on Monday. The order's list price sits at $16 billion, but a steep discount is typically negotiated by airlines. The deal was originally slated to see Emirates order 70 planes from the French manufacturer — 40 of the A350s and 30 A330-900neo jets — but all A330 orders were scrapped in favor of bringing the A350 order size to 50. Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury told a press conference that the European multinational planemaker's flagship A380 would now have a ""younger but very talented brother in the Emirates family."" The A350 is a family of long-range, twin-engine wide-body jet airliners, while the A380 is the world's largest passenger airliner. The 50 jets ordered by Emirates are its cornerstone A350-900 variety, accommodating between 300 and 350 passengers. ""Complementing our A380s and 777s, the A350s will give us added operational flexibility in terms of capacity, range and deployment,"" Emirates Chairman and Chief Executive Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum told press. ""In effect, we are strengthening our business model to provide efficient and comfortable air transport services to, and through, our Dubai hub."" The announcement of the order comes after an underwhelming first day for the Middle East's flagship aerospace expo, with only two jets sold on Sunday.

The Emirates CEO declined to discuss the reasons behind the company's A330 order cancellation, saying only, ""For anybody touching on the A330, that is not part of the discussion today."" The A330-900 is a slightly thinner variant of the A350-900, carrying less passengers and with a slightly slower cruising speed. The A350 is more expensive but lighter, meaning less fuel costs and more savings over time, aviation analysts say. Emirates is the number one buyer of Airbus' iconic A380, the world's largest airliner, but its cutback on orders of the jumbo jet early this year led the French manufacturer to announce it would scrap its production. Aviation analysts called it the ""end of an era,"" as the industry's symbol of excess and luxury flight was sidelined for smaller, more fuel-efficient planes now increasingly preferred by airliners. Asked if a reversal of the decision was possible and the jet's production might be continued, Faury replied, ""The decision is in implementation now, we love the A380 at Airbus, it is a great plane and will continue to fly for decades, we are committed to supporting it. But no, the decision that was taken to cease production is not reversed."" The last A380 will be delivered in 2021. Airbus Chief Corporate Officer Christian Scherer told CNBC on Sunday that the A380 was by no means finished, however, as the company turns to the secondhand market to keep the jet in use. Scherer described the A380 as having ""many, many profitable years"" to come.

737 Max's grounding

The Dubai Air Show, known for record-breaking mega deals, is expected to see fierce competition for deals from rivals Airbus and Boeing, who each own approximately half of the market for large commercial airliners. But the American planemaker's presence has been subdued thus far, weighed down by Boeing's two catastrophic 737 Max jet crashes in a span of five months, which killed a combined 346 people. Boeing's fleet of some 400 737 Max jets has been grounded since March, denting airlines' profits, forcing carriers to cancel thousands of flights and pushing up costs. On the air show's first day, the manufacturer announced a sale of two of its 787-9 Dreamliner jets to Biman Bangladesh Airlines, valued at $585 million at list prices. Asked on Sunday if the 737 Max's grounding benefited Airbus, Scherer forcefully rejected the notion, telling CNBC: ""This does not benefit anyone in this industry, the least of which would be Airbus... it is not good for competitors to see problems on any one particular airplane type."" At the start of the last Dubai Airshow in 2017, Boeing kicked off the event by clinching a major sale of 40 787-10 jets to Emirates Airline at a value of $15.1 billion.

Airbus celebrates the 100th A220 aircraft produced - Airbus,"Fri, 29 Nov 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOS0xMS1haXJidXMtY2VsZWJyYXRlcy10aGUtMTAwdGgtYTIyMC1haXJjcmFmdC1wcm9kdWNlZNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has celebrated the 100th A220 aircraft produced for a customer during a ceremony at the aircraft programme’s headquarters in Mirabel, Canada. The aircraft, an A220-300, destined for Riga, Latvia-based airBaltic, features a brand-new and comfortable cabin layout with 149 seats plus a modernised livery.

The A220 Family is assembled at Airbus’ main Final Assembly Line in Mirabel and more recently, also at the programme’s second assembly line in Mobile, Alabama. The world’s first A220 (formerly called the C Series) was delivered in June 2016 to A220-100 launch operator SWISS.

airBaltic became the A220-300 launch operator when the Latvian airline received delivery of the first-ever A220-300 three years ago, on 28 November 2016. airBaltic has since then re-ordered A220-300 aircraft twice – bringing its firm order to 50 aircraft to become the current biggest European A220 customer. The airline now operates a fleet of 20 A220-300 aircraft.

In an extremely competitive market, the aircraft’s unequalled fuel efficiency and excellent performance has been instrumental to airBaltic, which has an all-A220 fleet as the backbone of its new business plan. airBaltic is operating its A220 fleet to various European and Russian destinations as well as to the Middle East. It currently operates the longest flight on an A220 – a 6.5-hour flight from Riga to Abu Dhabi.

Initially designed and delivered as the Bombardier C Series, the A220 is the only aircraft purpose-built for the 100-150 seat market; it delivers unbeatable fuel efficiency and widebody passenger comfort in a single-aisle aircraft. The A220 brings together state-of-the-art aerodynamics, advanced materials and Pratt & Whitney’s latest-generation PW1500G geared turbofan engines to offer at least 20% lower fuel burn per seat compared to previous-generation aircraft, along with significantly lower emissions and a reduced noise footprint. The A220 offers the performance of larger single-aisle aircraft.

Close to 100 A220s are in operation with six operators on four continents. At the end of October 2019, the aircraft had received 530 firm orders from over 20 customers worldwide.

IndiGo to replace P&W engines on its fleet Airbus A320neo planes - Al Jazeera English,"Fri, 01 Nov 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vZWNvbm9teS8yMDE5LzExLzEvaW5kaWdvLXRvLXJlcGxhY2UtcHctZW5naW5lcy1vbi1pdHMtZmxlZXQtYWlyYnVzLWEzMjBuZW8tcGxhbmVz0gFvaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYWxqYXplZXJhLmNvbS9hbXAvZWNvbm9teS8yMDE5LzExLzEvaW5kaWdvLXRvLXJlcGxhY2UtcHctZW5naW5lcy1vbi1pdHMtZmxlZXQtYWlyYnVzLWEzMjBuZW8tcGxhbmVz?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The airline must replace all Pratt & Whitney engines in its fleet of almost 100 twin-engined Airbus A320neo planes.

IndiGo airlines must replace all Pratt & Whitney (P&W) engines in its fleet of almost 100 twin-engined Airbus A320neo family aircraft with new P&W power units, India’s air safety watchdog said on Friday following recent in-flight engine shutdowns.

The incidents have caused “serious concern” and the decision to order the engines to be replaced was taken after “considerable deliberations”, India’s Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) said in a statement.

“You will appreciate that four successive events have not happened ever before, and therefore, we call for urgent and effective action. We regret the inconvenience, but we need desperate measures to put things in order,” the DGCA said.

“This situation cannot be allowed to go on indefinitely,” it said, adding that the engines would need to be replaced by January 31, 2020.

IndiGo is Airbus’s biggest client for A320neo planes.

Though the engines made by Pratt & Whitney, a United Technologies subsidiary, are fuel-efficient, there have been issues since they entered into service in 2016, forcing IndiGo to ground its planes several times.

The groundings have cost the airline, which last month posted its biggest-ever quarterly loss after being forced to lease aircraft to replace planes grounded with engine issues.

IndiGo said it currently operates a fleet of 98 A320neo family planes in which around 45 percent of its engines are modified.

“We are working with both P&W and Airbus on mitigation so that we have enough modified spare engines by January 31, 2020. In the meantime, our schedule remains intact,” the company said in a statement to stock exchanges.

On Monday the DGCA ordered IndiGo and domestic rival GoAir to modify 29 Airbus A320neo aircraft fitted with Pratt & Whitney engines within 15 days to avoid them being grounded.

The DGCA said that planes fitted with Pratt & Whitney 1100 series engines that have clocked more than 2,900 hours must have at least one modified engine, impacting 16 of IndiGo’s planes.

In its statement on Friday, the DGCA said seven more of IndiGo’s planes had been found to have the same issue, taking the total to 23. It has asked the airline to replace at least one engine on these 23 planes by November 19, and IndiGo would then need to replace both engines on its entire A320neo fleet.

DGCA chief Arun Kumar, who was recently appointed to the position, is making the right decisions relating to safety, said Kapil Kaul, India CEO at consultancy CAPA.

“This gives time for these engine changes to be completed and yet remains firm on safety,” said Kaul, adding that Pratt & Whitney would need to ensure that all engines are replaced by the deadline.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9939244389533997}",neutral,0.9939244389533997,0

The reason could be linked to how the budget airline flies. India’s Directorate General of Civil Aviation told IndiGo’s operator, InterGlobe Aviation Ltd., that its practice of revving A320neo jets at full thrust right after takeoff could wear down the engines, people familiar with the matter said. By contrast, Go Air — India’s fourth-largest carrier by market share — typically uses a so-called alt-climb approach that applies less thrust, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing a private matter.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9966604709625244}",neutral,0.9966604709625244,0

The agreement was signed at the 2019 Dubai Airshow in the presence of Air Arabia’s Chairman Sheikh Abdullah Bin Mohammed Al Thani, Adel Al Ali, Chief Executive Officer Air Arabia and Guillaume Faury, Airbus Chief Executive Officer.

Adel Al Ali, Group Chief Executive Officer of Air Arabia, said: “Air Arabia’s fleet growth strategy has always been driven by commercial demand and we are glad to announce today one of the region’s largest single-aisle orders with Airbus to support our growth plans. This new milestone underpins not only our solid financial fundamentals but also the strength of our multi-hub growth strategy that we have adopted over the years while remaining focused on efficiency, performance and passenger experience.” He added: “The addition of the A320neo, A321neo and A321XLR complements our existing fleet and allows us to expand our service to farther and newer destinations while remaining loyal to our low-cost business model. We look forward to working with Airbus and receiving the first delivery.”

Christian Scherer, Airbus Chief Commercial Officer said: “We are delighted to expand our partnership with Air Arabia, this is a great endorsement for the A320neo Family which will allow the airline to tap into new markets. We are committed to supporting the fast expansion of Air Arabia and the region”

Air Arabia is an all Airbus operator with a total fleet of 54 A320 Family aircraft including the A321LR. All aircraft will feature a comfortable single-class cabin with one of the most generous seat pitches today.

The A321XLR is the next evolutionary step from the A321LR which responds to market needs for even more range and payload, creating more value for the airlines. From 2023, it will deliver an unprecedented Xtra Long Range of up to 4,700nm – 15% more than the A321LR and with 30% lower fuel burn per seat compared with previous generation competitor aircraft.

Featuring the widest single-aisle cabin in the sky, the best-selling A320neo Family, comprising the A319neo, A320neo, and A321neo, deliver at least 20% reduced fuel burn as well as 50% less noise compared to previous generation aircraft, thanks to incorporating the very latest technologies including new generation engines and Sharklets. At the end of October 2019, the A320neo Family had received more than 7,000 firm orders from over 110 customers worldwide.

The Philippines' largest budget airline Cebu Air Inc has ordered 16 Airbus planes worth $4.8 billion, the company said Monday, as it aims to expand carrying capacity with larger, more fuel-efficient jets.

Cebu Air, commonly referred to as Cebu Pacific, said it sees the long-range A330neo jetliner as key to lowering per-seat costs and maximising its existing airport slots.

The carrier will use the new planes for both domestic routes and Asian destinations, as well as long-haul flights to Australia and the Middle East where millions of Filipinos work overseas.

The new aircraft are scheduled to arrive between 2021 and 2024. Once fully delivered, the jets will replace the current A330ceos in the airline's roster.

""The A330neo aircraft is integral to our fleet modernization program,"" Cebu Air president and chief executive Lance Gokongwei said in a statement.

""With this purchase we aim to reduce our fuel emission and build a more sustainable operation,"" he added.

The Philippine carrier has a fleet of 74 planes, most from Airbus, and has received eight new aircraft this year, the majority of them also Airbus planes.

The airline flies to 37 domestic routes and 26 international destinations. It claims to have ""one of the youngest fleets in the world"", with an average age of five years.

The order comes as the budget airline flew more than 20 million people in 2018, up three percent year-on-year.

Air travel in the Philippines has significantly grown, but the nation's airports have struggled to keep up. Cebu Air's larger aircraft will allow the carrier to cope with Manila's congested airport and limited slots.

Airbus has announced a series of Asia deals in recent months, including a $33.2 billion order with Indian airline IndiGo that was one of the manufacturer's largest-ever from a single firm.

The streak stands in contrast to the situation faced by the Boeing's 737 MAX airliner, a direct rival, which has been grounded since March following two crashes that killed a total of 346 people.

However Airbus has hit some turbulence of its own, with Canadian and European air safety regulators saying the A220 model should no longer use full power at high altitudes.

During one Swiss flight in July parts of an A220 engine fell over France, and following incidents in September and October the airline halted all flights with the aircraft until they could be inspected.

A new Airbus plane will be sent back to engineers in France following complaints of a ""smell of wet sock"" from cabin crew in the Pacific island territory of New Caledonia.

The Airbus A330neo came into service on October 4 as part of fleet renewal at Air Caledonie International (ACI), the french territory's international airline.

However ""a smell of 'wet sock' has repeatedly inconvenienced crew members during take off and landing"", ACI's general manager Didier Tappero told AFP.

An investigation was carried out and identified oil fumes.

According to an Airbus report sent to the company, the analysis indicated that the air quality in the cabin was in accordance with international guidelines and below the toxicity threshold, ACI said.

However, blood samples were taken from the flight crew who inhaled the bad smell.

The Airbus A330neo, one of two in ACI's fleet, has been grounded for two weeks and will shortly be sent to Airbus' workshops in Toulouse.

""We are working on a solution to solve odor problems in the cabin of a small number of Airbus A330neo in service,"" Airbus spokesman Sean Lee told AFP.

Similar problems have been encountered by airlines in Portugal and Senegal.

Airbus Defence and Space Works An Incremental Approach to Manned-Unmanned Teaming: International Fighter ... - Second Line of Defense,"Wed, 27 Nov 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL3NsZGluZm8uY29tLzIwMTkvMTEvYWlyYnVzLWRlZmVuY2UtYW5kLXNwYWNlLXdvcmtzLWFuLWluY3JlbWVudGFsLWFwcHJvYWNoLXRvLW1hbm5lZC11bm1hbm5lZC10ZWFtaW5nLWludGVybmF0aW9uYWwtZmlnaHRlci1jb25mZXJlbmNlLTIwMTkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Robbin Laird

At last year’s International Fighter Conference, the team working on the Franco-German Future Combat System program provided an overview on the launch of the effort. At this year’s conference, the team provided an update on progress over the first year, and underscored key timelines into what was called an incremental approach to building a new fighter by 2040.

And now Spain has joined the program as well.

I provided an update on this year’s overview in a separate piece.

But in this piece, I want to look at one key element of the future combat system, one which will need to be introduced into the evolving combat force, and not wait until 2040.

A key element of building the connected force is clearly the question of the nature and capabilities of remote carriers to work with manned systems in the air.

Remote carriers will become part of the evolving combat force in the near to mid-term.

This has become a key dynamic associated with the changes in C2 revolving around enhanced artificial intelligence built into the force, but a clear need to both evolve data linked weapons – which after all are the first round of manned-unmanned teaming already in the sky.

Remote carriers are coming with the various loyal wingman approaches as well within which current fighters work with evolving remote capabilities to deliver a combat effect from the teaming capability.

It is clear that remote carriers will become key force multipliers and shape new concepts of operations going forward as they are added to air combat fleets.

During the conference, I had a chance to continue my conversation began last year on this topic with Bruno Fichefeux, Head of FCAS for Airbus Defence and Space.

From my perspective, Airbus has already delivered two key 21st century air platforms – the MRTT tanker and the A400M airlifter – which should provide useful launch points for the redo of air combat along the lines envisaged by the FCAS.

And doing so makes business interest for Airbus, and not just for those air forces flying Rafale or Eurofighter.

To highlight the opportunities, in an interview I did last year at Amberley Airbase in Australia, the Wing Commander charged with operating the KC-30A or the A330MRTT, a la Australian, focused on how he saw the future of that tanker.

According to Group Captain Steve Pesce, Officer Commanding 86 Wing, comprising the RAAF’s C-17, KC-30A, B300, CL604 and B737 fleets, in a conflict against a “near-peer” adversary the RAAF and allied forces may not have the luxury of secure tanking in uncontested airspace.

Air forces will gain transient advantage rather than total control of the air and will support surface assets that will be more dispersed across a larger Area of Operation (AO). Demand for AAR (and air mobility in general) will increase as the survivability of a large tanker is reduced.

Distributed operations in contested airspace will become a norm, and that means in his view the end of the classic larger tanker operations. The manned tanker will operate further away in the battlespace and become the mother ship for tanking remotes operating as refueling nodes to expendable assets deployed forward,

“My view of the future battlespace is that sensors and shooters will be more proliferated, integrated and reach further and with greater precision.

“There will be a natural move towards dispersion to improve survivability and delivery of fuel will be critical.

“The future of a large tanker will be to support more distributed and dispersed operations and we will be looking at small tactical refuelers providing fuel to tactical air combat assets – these tactical assets will likely be cheaper, unmanned and more expendable.

“That is where A3R comes in.

“I see an advantage in the automatic boom because it reduces the workload on the operator who in the future may be managing or controlling formations of UAV during AAR.

“As we learn to use this technology, it will be part of shaping the skill sets to transition to the next phase, of a large tanker replenishing smaller, automated tactical refuelers….”

As Airbus Defence and Space is a global business, it would make sense as the FCAS program generates manned-unmanned teaming capabilities that such capabilities would be made available to its global customers in the tanker program, for which there are many, and for the A400M program which there are fewer but certainly more than the core participants into the FCAS program itself

Bruno Fichefeux confirmed that this proposition is being studied within Airbus Defence and Space.

He argued that there were two ways in which Airbus Defence and Space was addressing the opportunities within and eternal to the FCAS program.

First, for each of its key platforms such as tanker and A400M, they were shaping road maps for the development of the platforms which highlighted ways to enhance their capabilities within an integrated and connected battlespace.

Second, they are shaping technology streams which are designed to deal with the different challenges within manned-unmanned teaming.

Those technology streams can be drawn upon to shape developmental opportunities for the existing or new platforms envisaged in FCAS.

With regard to the first, the focus of what has been called the smart tanker program is precisely designed to shape ways ahead to use the space within the tanker for enhanced contributions to the integrated battlespace.

It must be remembered that the fuel carried by the A330MRTT is carried in the wings, which leaves the large cabin free to do other missions, which now are largely devoted to movement of warfighters and support staff or to carrying cargo.

According to Fichefeux: “Smart MRTT is focused on how to make use of all the internal space and to leverage it for the other platforms in the combat system and to increase their situational awareness and to handle data transfers.”

Another example is the A400M and its potential role as a remote carrier.

According to Fichefeux: “We have initiated a series of design studies looking at how we can operate the A400M as a launcher and recovery platform for remotes, and operating as a mother ship so to speak.

“In this sense, the A400M becomes the wingman for the fighter fleet, but by functioning as a mother ship to launch and recover remotes which can go deeper into the battlespace to provide broad support for the tip of the spear of the air combat force.”

In addition to working to study capabilities of its two core new air combat assets, namely the tanker and the A400M, Airbus Defence and Space has launched a series of “technology streams” examining how to develop a manned-unmanned teaming capability.’’

According to Fichefeux: “We have launched generic technology streams, where we are looking to mature technologies around swarming, around level of autonomy, around the teaming intelligence, around how do we display this teaming for future fighter cockpit. How does the fighter pilot and the drones work together?

“We are running these technology streams concurrently with developmental streams and are targeting the introduction of remote carriers on the Eurofighter platforms to extend the range of its capabilities and to fill the combat gaps.”

And to my earlier point that in many ways data linked weapons are the precursor of the manned-unmanned teaming envisaged with regard to UAVS, fighters, lifters and tankers working together, he underscored the working relationship between Airbus and MBDA.

Fichefeux underscored that they were working on the spectrum of unmanned platforms with various size and operational characteristics to think through a technology and development tree to introduce such capabilities into the combat force.

For example, with regard to the smaller remotes, they have teamed with MBDA to leverage MBDA’s experience in operating data link weapons.

“In the design of remote vehicles of a smaller size category, Airbus and MBDA are working together which allows us to leverage their experience and gives them access to our thinking and developments with regard to remote carriers which will carry evolving sets of weapons in the future”.

And, of course, the overall technology developments are clearly affecting thinking about new platforms.

In no case is this clearer than the European MALE RPAS program.

When Airbus Defence and Space presented their focus on European MALE RPAS few years ago at the last Airbus Defence and Media day, clearly the European MALE RPAS one saw glimmers of such thoughts.

But with the FCAS launch these glimmers are becoming solidified in a programmatic sense.

In short, Bruno Fichefeux laid out the incremental approach of Airbus Defence and Space in the crucial area of manned-unmanned teaming and the importance of integrating new remote platforms within the concepts of operations of air combat fleets.

While the strategic objective of FCAS is clearly to deliver a new combat fighter, the focus is very much on delivering key building blocks along the way.

And new remote platforms are such a building block.

Airbus Defence and Space are looking to add new remote platforms which can work with existing air combat platforms, including fighters as well as other air combat assets, such as air lifters and airborne tankers.

In short, they are looking to deliver a System-of-Systems, connecting platforms, operating across domains, and being fully interoperable with allied forces instead of “only” targeting a new combat fighter qua a new platform.

Bremen/Friedrichshafen/Ottobrunn, 06 November 2019 – This year has already marked 50 years since the first landing on the Moon and 50 years since Airbus was founded. Now there is another 50th anniversary on the horizon: 50 years ago, Germany was elevated to the status of a spacefaring nation following the successful launch of Azur, its first research satellite. On 8 November 1969 at 2:52 am (CET), a Scout launch vehicle lifted off from Vandenberg, California, USA, carrying Azur into space. In doing so, Germany joined the club of nations that had placed their own satellites in orbit.

Azur was developed and built at what are now Airbus sites in Bremen (formerly ERNO), Friedrichshafen (Dornier) and Ottobrunn (MBB). Specialist magazines at the time reported on the importance of Azur: “The construction of the Azur research satellite, in which all German space companies were involved, heralded the end of the learning phase of the 1960s.” To this day, the Azur, which weighs 72 kg, is often seen as the breakthrough in Germany’s emergence as a space research and industry nation.

The research satellite was used to study cosmic ray particles and how they interact with the magnetosphere, as well as to investigate the Northern Lights and solar winds. Even then, scientific interest was fierce: more than 100 experiments were proposed, of which seven ultimately made it aboard Azur. The mission ended on 29 June 1970.

Airbus Uses Biomimicry to Boost Aircraft Environmental Performance - SME.org,"Fri, 22 Nov 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNtZS5vcmcvdGVjaG5vbG9naWVzL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMTkvbm92ZW1iZXIvYWlyYnVzLXVzZXMtYmlvbWltaWNyeS10by1ib29zdC1haXJjcmFmdC1lbnZpcm9ubWVudGFsLXBlcmZvcm1hbmNlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Dubai, November 18 – Airbus has unveiled fello’fly, its latest demonstrator project inspired by biomimicry, the design and production of materials, structures and systems inspired by nature. According to Airbus, the project will boost the environmental performance of commercial aircraft and make a significant impact on emissions reduction for the aviation industry.

The Airbus’ fello’fly project aims to demonstrate the technical, operational and commercial viability of two aircraft flying together for long-haul flights.

Through fello’fly, a follower aircraft will retrieve the energy lost by the wake of a leader aircraft, by flying in the smooth updraft of air it creates. This provides lift to the follower aircraft allowing it to decrease engine thrust and therefore reduce fuel consumption in the range of 5-10 percent per trip.

The technical solution Airbus is working on involves pilot assistance functions needed to ensure the aircraft pilots are are flying remain safely positioned in the updraft of air of the aircraft they are following, maintaining the same distance, at a steady altitude.

In terms of the operational solution, Airbus is working, in collaboration with airlines and Air Traffic Control (ATC) providers, to identify the operational needs and suitable solutions for planning and executing fello’fly operations. Airbus says this highlights the importance it places on driving industrywide activities to achieve emissions reductions targets defined by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and the Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection (CAEP).

Airbus is due to commence flight tests with two of its A350 aircraft in 2020. Given the high potential for a positive environmental impact for the industry, Airbus is targeting an ambitious timeline for a controlled Entry-Into-Service (EIS), which is expected before the middle of the next decade.

Airbus says this new demonstrator project for optimized aircraft operation strengthens its position in a field where it is already heavily investing and focusing its research efforts on developing, innovating and leveraging emerging technologies, directly contributing to the sustainable offset of emissions reducing the environmental footprint of the aviation industry as a whole.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.999729335308075}",positive,0.999729335308075,1

The Royalux, the first Business Class product from TSI Seats, will be in the catalogue after its certification process is complete.

Turkish Airlines Chairman of the Board and the Executive Committee, M. İlker Aycı said; “In order to provide logistic support for the sector, we adopted a more active role with our partner firm Assan Hanil, and broke new ground in the history of Turkish Civil Aviation in 2011 with a great initiative. Founded to design, manufacture, modify and merchandise aviation seats and spare parts, TSI Aviation Seats entered the BFE Catalogue of Airbus today.

He continued, “We are happy to see the fruits of this beautiful cooperation. As the first and only aircraft seat manufacturer of Turkey, TSI’s goal is to become one of the top five aviation seat brands in the global market by 2023. I think that this success is an important cornerstone on the way to our goal. I also believe that this agreement with Airbus will be the herald of new agreements in the civil aviation sector.

“The success of a national and local company is a proud occasion. I hope that our cooperation will strengthen as it grows. I extend my thanks to all of our personnel and partners who had a part in this success for their contributions.”

During the signing ceremony, Kibar Holding CEO Haluk Kayabaşı stated: “Today an agreement for BFE Catalogue was signed between Airbus and TSI Seats, the joint venture of Turkish Airlines, Turkish Technic and Kibar Holding. According the agreement, TSI Seats will be the first company in its scale that enters the BFE catalogue. It is expected that the catalogue will increase familiarity and accessibility of TSI in the sector. The catalogue not only provides an opportunity to be visible for the suppliers, but also brings the prestige of being approved by Airbus. Considering the Airbus catalogue project’s share in the total aircraft orders and expected increase in the retrofit projects along with the other projects of TSI Seats, we aim to reach over 100 million USD exports in 2023.”

Manufactured for the wide body aircrafts, Skysofa economy class seats were first delivered to Airbus back in September 2015. Last year, Epianka began to fly after gaining the certificates for Airbus A321neo and Boeing B737 MAX narrowbody aircrafts, and they were used in Boeing B787 Dreamliner aircrafts in July this year. With the third quarter of 2019, the deliveries started for the A350 widebody aircrafts.

As the joint venture of Turkish Airlines, Turkish Technic and Assan Hanil, TSI Seats cuts down on the external dependence with its support for local suppliers. TSI Seats maintains its design, engineering, manufacturing and R&D activities in Istanbul Sabiha Gökçen International Airport and the state of Utah, with their team comprised of nearly 150 personnel.

London, 22 November 2019 – Airbus is celebrating a remarkable 50 years of providing global secure military satellite communications to the UK Ministry of Defence with the 50th anniversary of the first Skynet satellite. And it’s a double celebration as this year Airbus is also celebrating its 50th birthday.

Skynet 1A was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida on 22 November 1969 into a geostationary orbit and it was followed less than a year later by Skynet 1B to provide secure communications to the armed forces via voice – and also by fax and even telegraph!

Providing only two voice channels from a satellite about the same size as a small fridge, these first Skynet satellites are now superseded by a fleet of four Skynet 5 satellites weighing more than 6 tonnes at launch and each as big as a large delivery van. The average power of a Skynet 5 satellite is 4.7 kW which is approximately the same as a typical UK home.

In the 50 years since the launch of the first Skynet Airbus has built 25 military communications satellites for the defence ministries around the world. Two Skynet 2 satellites were launched in 1974, one failed due to a rocket motor problem on the satellite, but Skynet 2B provided services for more than 20 years.

Richard Franklin, Head of Secure Communications at Airbus Defence and Space said: ""Making sure that the UK remains at the forefront of secure milsatcoms technology and services has been a cornerstone of Airbus’ approach over the last 50 years. Skynet is a world class capability for UK and we look forward to supporting our Armed Forces in the most challenging environments with innovation for the next 50 years to support the operations of tomorrow; investing internally and alongside a network of SMEs and partners to bring the very best solutions to meet our customer requirements as they evolve.""

The follow on generation was Skynet 4, with six satellites providing global secure communications. Designed to operate in geostationary orbit for 15 years and still providing coverage today. Skynet 4 is the longest serving satellite constellation at 29 years old and continues to deliver vital communications.

Skynet 5 is the current satellite series and for the past 16 years, Airbus has been responsible for delivering all secure beyond line of sight communications to the UK MOD, owning and operating the four strong fleet. During that time Skynet 5 satellites have been crucial to keeping armed forces in theatre in touch with each other and bases back in the UK. And the satellites also provide a key part of service personnel being able to keep in touch with loved ones back home as part of the WelComE service.

Airbus is now looking at the next generation - Skynet 6 – which will continue the vital communication services to the UK MOD.

The MoU was signed today in the presence of HE Alioune SARR, Minister of Tourism and Transport Senegal.

The A220s’ efficiency will enable Air Senegal to reduce the airline’s operating costs while offering passengers unrivalled comfort throughout its fleet. Earlier in 2019, the carrier was the first African airline to fly Airbus’ new generation widebody aircraft, the A330neo, featuring latest technology engines, new wings with enhanced aerodynamics and a curved wingtip design, drawing best practices from the A350 XWB.

Mr Ibrahima Kane Air Senegal CEO said: “These new A220 aircraft will contribute to develop our long-haul network to Europe and our regional network in Africa. Combined with our recent A330neo aircraft, this new Airbus fleet reveals Air Senegal’s ambition to offer the best travel experience for our passengers.”

“The number of A220s operation on the African continent is steadily growing and we are proud to add Senegal’s new flag carrier in our list of A220 African customers. Offering the lowest operating costs in its category, the A220 is the best aircraft for airlines to launch new domestic and international routes efficiently,” said Christian Scherer Chief Commercial officer Airbus.

The A220 is the only aircraft purpose-built for the 100-150 seat market; it delivers unbeatable fuel efficiency and widebody passenger comfort in a single-aisle aircraft. The A220 brings together state-of-the-art aerodynamics, advanced materials and Pratt & Whitney’s latest-generation PW1500G geared turbofan engines to offer at least 20 percent lower fuel burn per seat compared to previous generation aircraft, along with significantly lower emissions and a reduced noise footprint. The A220 offers the performance of larger single-aisle aircraft. By the end of October 2019 the A220 had accumulated 530 orders.

Airbus to launch new single-aisle by 2030s? - AeroTime,"Thu, 21 Nov 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm90aW1lLmFlcm8vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjQyMzUtYWlyYnVzLXRvLWxhdW5jaC1uZXctc2luZ2xlLWFpc2xlLWJ5LTIwMzBz0gFXaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYWVyb3RpbWUuYWVyby9hcnRpY2xlcy8yNDIzNS1haXJidXMtdG8tbGF1bmNoLW5ldy1zaW5nbGUtYWlzbGUtYnktMjAzMHMvYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has said it is planning to build an all-new narrow-body jet that it says could be launched in the early 2030s. But what type of an aircraft will it be and will the technology the manufacturer is banking on be ready in time?

On November 19, 2019, at the Dubai Airshow, Airbus chief executive Guillaume Faury said he believes that the coming together of cutting-edge production, design and propulsion technologies will give rise to the production of a brand-new single-aisle jet. Faury expressed optimism that change will come in time for the manufacturer to build the next-generation airliner in the middle of the next decade.

“I would consider the launch of a [single-aisle] program in the second half of the next decade and entry into service in the early 2030s,” Faury was quoted as saying by Flight Global. “We are at a point of time where we see a number of major changes impacting aviation, and they will probably impact the single-aisle business first.”

According to the Airbus boss, new advancements in production systems will enable the launch of the new program. Above all, the key for the launch will be the expansion of digital capabilities in aircraft design, manufacturing and services.

Faury stressed, however, that the production of a next-generation narrow-body could only begin with the convergence of the necessary technologies and innovations already on the way. “We are working with many partners to anticipate and prepare the technologies and propulsion systems of the future,” the Airbus boss said, adding that, “It will be worth launching the development of a new single-aisle only when we have a combination of those technologies that make sense.”

Will the next Airbus single-aisle be a hybrid-electric A320?

While Airbus’ intentions seems clear-cut, the details of the potential all-new narrow-body program are vague, especially regarding the type of the aircraft Faury talks about. Earlier this year, in June 2019, the European plane maker revealed it was considering bringing to the market the world’s first hybrid-electric airliner as a possible successor to the A320neo narrow-body, according to a report by Bloomberg. Airbus expressed its confidence that the new propulsion system would be ready for rollout on a brand-new single-aisle jet in mid 2030s.

Latest reporting on Airbus’s all-new single-aisle jet plans echoes the target date, indicating that the manufacturer is looking to develop a 100-seat emissions-free regional aircraft. According to Sandra Bour Shaeffer, the CEO of Airbus’ new-product development arm known as ExO Alpha, the company is working with partners including engine manufacturers and startups to build more fuel-efficient engines, explore hybrids and alternative fuels, and to improve aerodynamics.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.995989978313446}",neutral,0.995989978313446,0

The Airbus. came into service on October 4 as part of a fleet renewal at Air Caledonie International (ACI), the french territory's international airline.

However ""a smell of 'wet sock' has repeatedly inconvenienced crew members during take off and landing"", ACI's general manager Didier Tappero told AFP

An investigation was carried out and identified oil fumes.

According to an Airbus report sent to the company, the analysis indicated that the air quality in the cabin was in accordance with international guidelines and below the toxicity threshold, ACI said.

However, blood samples were taken from the flight crew who inhaled the bad smell.

The Airbus A330neo, one of two in ACI's fleet, has been grounded for two weeks and will shortly be sent to Airbus' workshops in Toulouse.

""We are working on a solution to solve odor problems in the cabin of a small number of Airbus A330neo in service,"" Airbus spokesman Sean Lee told AFP.

Similar problems have been encountered by airlines in Portugal and Senegal.

Airbus inspired by nature to boost aircraft environmental performance - Airbus,"Mon, 18 Nov 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOS0xMS1haXJidXMtaW5zcGlyZWQtYnktbmF0dXJlLXRvLWJvb3N0LWFpcmNyYWZ0LWVudmlyb25tZW50YWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has unveiled fello’fly, its latest demonstrator project inspired by biomimicry*, that is set to boost the environmental performance of commercial aircraft and make a significant impact on emissions reduction for the aviation industry.



Airbus’ fello’fly project aims to demonstrate the technical, operational and commercial viability of two aircraft flying together for long-haul flights.

Through fello’fly, a follower aircraft will retrieve the energy lost by the wake of a leader aircraft, by flying in the smooth updraft of air it creates. This provides lift to the follower aircraft allowing it to decrease engine thrust and therefore reduce fuel consumption in the range of 5-10% per trip.

The technical solution that Airbus is working on involves pilot assistance functions necessary to ensure the aircraft they are flying remains safely positioned in the updraft of air of the aircraft they are following, maintaining the same distance, at a steady altitude.

In terms of the operational solution, Airbus is working, in collaboration with airlines and Air Traffic Control (ATC) providers, to identify the operational needs and suitable solutions for planning and executing fello’fly operations. This highlights the importance Airbus places on driving industry-wide activities to achieve emissions reductions targets defined by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and the Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection (CAEP).

Airbus is due to commence flight tests with two of its A350 aircraft in 2020. Given the high potential for a positive environmental impact for the industry, Airbus is targeting an ambitious timeline for a controlled Entry-Into-Service (EIS), which is expected before the middle of the next decade.

This new demonstrator project for optimized aircraft operation, strengthens Airbus’ position in a field where it is already heavily investing and focusing its research efforts on developing, innovating and leveraging emerging technologies, directly contributing to the sustainable offset of emissions reducing the environmental footprint of the aviation industry as a whole.

Airbus boss does not regret A380 decision - Airline Ratings,"Sat, 30 Nov 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyYXRpbmdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FpcmJ1cy1ib3NzLW5vdC1yZWdyZXQtYTM4MC1kZWNpc2lvbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The order by Emirates for 50 Airbus A350s at the recent Dubai Air Show was a last-minute affair, so much so that there wasn’t even time to print press releases in time for the announcement press conference.

This emerged when Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury faced journalists in Hamburg, Germany.

SEE some crazy ideas that never made it onto aircraft

SEE our photo gallery of brave hostesses of the mid-20th century.

READ our list of the best airlines for 2020.

The lengthy exclusive interview the President of Emirates, Sir Tim Clark, had granted AirlineRatings.com recently was apparently very much in the back of Airbus executives’ minds.

Sir Tim had predicted that orders by Emirates at the show were unlikely, and indeed that seemed to be the case initially.

Clark had also criticized OEM’s in general for overpromising and delivering too little of it too late.

“We are very grateful that they have awarded us with a contract for 50 A350s,” Faury told AirlineRatings in Hamburg. “I think we are not disappointing when it comes to the A350.

“Emirates ordering the A350 right after what Tim Clark said is a very strong commitment and testimonial of the strength of the A350.”

Asked about the industry problem of overpromising, Faury declined to comment on Boeing or engine manufacturers’ issues, both of which have been very much in the focus of criticism.

“If we look at ourselves in terms of disappointment, we have difficulties in the speed of ramp-ups of our A320 blockbuster, so we have to be humble,” Faury said.

“I don’t think we disappoint on the product side, rather on the contrary. But yes, we are under strong pressure to deliver the products we have committed to faster, and we had difficulties with it that we try to overcome.”

A major issue between Emirates and the European manufacturer is the ending of the A380 production in 2021, after having delivered a total of 123 of the giants to the airline, which operates more than half of the worldwide fleet of the superjumbo.

Sir Tim had said that Airbus would rue the day it decided to shut the program down.

“The day we were sorry about the closure of the program is in the past, it was earlier this year,” said the Airbus CEO about the announcement of the end of the line in February.

“We love the A380, as do the passengers, and I know Tim Clark has a very personal and emotional relationship with the A380.

“So do we, and as it comes to emotion, yes we are very sad with the situation. But will we regret the A380 shutdown one day? I don’t think so.”

Faury emphasized the benefits of the program now and in the future.

“We would never (have) had such a successful A350 if we would not have learned many things from the A380.

“So in many ways, the A380 is still alive through the technologies we have put in the A350 – which obviously fits very well in today’s market,” stresses the Airbus CEO.

“In terms of architecture, will we again see large planes with 500-plus tons of take-off weight and four engines? Probably not, as Boeing also winds down the 747 and there is no other manufacturer with any four-engine aircraft project in sight.”

Faury also is steadfast in his belief that the A380 was the right thing to do.

“As a manufacturer, we think it’s a success”, he proclaimed. “The commercial success we had envisaged has not come to the expected magnitude because the world has changed, because the twin long-range A350-type planes are very successful, they come with flexibility and point-to-point capacity. Things have moved forward.”

And he is content as long as it is Airbus that has competitive products selling well.

“This is the very nature of innovation to bring new solutions and to keep improving,” he said. “If we have to disrupt ourselves from time to time, well that’s the rule of the game.”

Airbus has been very cautious during the Boeing 737MAX crisis to not appear publicly as taking advantage of its competitor’s misery.

In Hamburg, Faury was emphasizing again that even if Airbus would want to fill the gap in aircraft deliveries caused by the grounded Boeing bestseller, it simply can’t.

“With a backlog of the A320 family of over 6,000 aircraft for eight or nine years of production we have no delivery slot available before 2024 or rather 2025,” he said.

“There is no way we can offer slots to bridge the gap of missing aircraft due to the 737MAX grounding.”

What concerns him more is the overall outcome of the MAX crisis for the aircraft industry, as long-standing procedures of certifying new aircraft might change and complicate procedures and ultimately making them even lengthier.

“More negative is the tension the MAX grounding has created for us in procedures with authorities,” he added. “When it comes to safety, aviation has benefitted from a global framework, a level playing field in safety matters with a very close cooperation of the authorities, we think this is really an enabler of safety. We want this to keep going.”

Of course, Faury wasn’t allowed off the stage in Hamburg before answering at least one question about Qantas’ Project Sunrise.

“We are competing, we think the A350-1000 is the best product in that competition,” he said. “But it’s up to Alan Joyce and his team to decide, also if this whole venture is economically viable for them.”

Editor-in-Chief’s Note: The Emirates A350 order was a conversion of the announcement made in February earlier this year for 30 A350s and 40 A330-900s. That commitment was never ratified and now has been converted to an order for 50 A350s. Emirates says it will proceed with the A330 but ordered 787-9s instead of the 787-10s it earlier committed to.

Airbus presents ground-breaking technology for EUTELSAT QUANTUM - Airbus,"Thu, 21 Nov 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOS0xMS1haXJidXMtcHJlc2VudHMtZ3JvdW5kLWJyZWFraW5nLXRlY2hub2xvZ3ktZm9yLWV1dGVsc2F0LXF1YW50dW3SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Active antenna is a first for European commercial telecommunications

Satellite can be reconfigured in-orbit, giving operator maximum flexibility

Madrid, 21 November 2019 – Airbus, ESA and Eutelsat have presented the new ground breaking multibeam active antenna payload today at Airbus in Madrid. Airbus’ ELSA+ (ELectronically Steerable Antenna+) is a first for commercial satellite communications in Europe. The versatility of its performance represents a step change for communications satellites with a spacecraft able for the first time to adapt to the customers’ business cases as and when needed by means of software control.

The electronically steerable reception antenna, works in Ku-band with eight independent reconfigurable beams. This inherent flexibility enables the operator to reconfigure the radio frequency beams over the coverage zone, allowing for an unprecedented flexibility in multimedia and broadcasting services.

In addition, these capabilities can be implemented on each beam either independently or simultaneously including hop up to several tens of predefined different configurations per beam (beam hopping).

Another new feature is the capability of the antenna to mitigate possible interference, intended or not, thanks to its ability to GEO locate any interference and null them.

This new antenna technology complements new generation fully digital payloads where the operator can thus change the orbit position, frequencies and the power of their spacecraft.

Airbus Defence and Space in Spain is the prime contractor for this advanced instrument developed over four years. Airbus led an industrial group that included a group of 12 European companies, eight of them Spanish, to build this advanced system.

Innovative design and manufacture of active antennas is one of the Airbus strengths in Spain. ELSA+ builds on previous developments such as: the DRA/ELSA for Hispasat 36W1, IRMA (In-orbit Reconfigurable Multibeam Antenna) on board SpainSAT for secure military communications, as well as the Gaia active antenna that transmits large amounts of data as the spacecraft maps a billion stars. These systems are all operating successfully in orbit.

“With ELSA+ we are entering a whole new game in satellite telecommunications, this is just a starting point and a reference for future missions,” said Fernando Varela, Head of Airbus Space Systems in Spain, “we are constantly evolving this technology, and Airbus is already developing the future generation antennas for the SPAINSAT-NG programme.”

This new development for the EUTELSAT QUANTUM satellite positions Airbus in Spain as the leader in Europe for active antennas. The project has been possible thanks to the support of CDTI (Spanish Centro para el Desarrollo Tecnológico Industrial) and the European Space Agency. Quantum is being built under an ARTES Partnership Project between manufacturers Airbus and Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd, operator Eutelsat and ESA. ESA’s Partnership Projects aim to achieve economic impacts and competitive leaps forward federating industry around large-scale programmes.

EUTELSAT QUANTUM satellite is a revolutionary step forward for commercial satellites, offering very high customization and flexibility. It will supply services with unprecedented in-orbit reconfigurability in coverage, frequency and power, allowing complete mission rehaul, including orbital position.

The mass of the satellite at launch is 3.5 tonnes and its design lifetime is 15 years. The EUTELSAT QUANTUM satellite is due to be launched 2nd half of 2020.

Germany's air force said Wednesday it had refused delivery of two Airbus A400M transport planes over technical faults, saying bolts holding the propellers on some already operational aircraft were loose.

""The armed forces have decided not to accept two A400Ms due for delivery,"" the Luftwaffe (air force) said in a statement, adding that ""our soldiers' safety in their daily use of the A400M aircraft is top priority for us.""

Repeated technical problems have dogged the A400M programme, a turboprop transport aircraft developed jointly for Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Spain and Turkey.

Now, routine checks on some of the Luftwaffe's 31 planes have found ""not all 24 nuts per propeller had the correct tightening torque,"" the air force said.

""If these problems are not identified and corrected, they can cause severe structural damage to the propeller and shaft,"" it added.

With each inspection taking around 30 man-hours, the discovery poses ""significant challenges"" to the 62nd Air Transport Squadron, which operates the A400M.

Additional checks are needed on the engines, along with the points where motors are attached to the wings, and for cracks in various parts of the aircraft.

Nevertheless, the Luftwaffe plans to keep flying its existing A400Ms when they are certified as safe.

""The model has more than proven itself in supplying deployment areas with personnel and equipment, in air-to-air refuelling, in transport home of soldiers needing medical treatment and in humanitarian aid missions,"" notching up 4,000 flight hours with the air force, it said.

Airbus said it was aware of the technical problem which it had also communicated to its customers.

It insisted however that ""this is not safety critical and our customers continue to accept and operate their aircraft"".

Earlier this year, pan-European aircraft maker Airbus renegotiated contract terms with the purchasing countries' governments over the huge cost overruns and delays.

Some 81 A400Ms were in operation by July.

The A220: Airbus' all-around performer for the Middle East and Africa markets - Airbus,"Tue, 19 Nov 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDE5LTExLXRoZS1hMjIwLWFpcmJ1cy1hbGwtYXJvdW5kLXBlcmZvcm1lci1mb3ItdGhlLW1pZGRsZS1lYXN0LWFuZC1hZnJpY2HSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus’ newest single-aisle family member – the A220 – is well matched to the evolving air transport needs of both the Middle East and Africa, where this purpose-built 100-160-seat jetliner and its clean-sheet design offers superior range, performance, economics and comfort for the region’s airlines.

The presence of an EGYPTAIR A220 at the 2019 Dubai Airshow highlights the aircraft’s capabilities, with the Egyptian flag carrier currently operating the first four of its 12 ordered A220-300s to destinations within Africa, and increasingly covering a broad range of routes into the Middle East.

Another A220 operator is Air Tanzania, which began A220-300 service within the West African country on such sectors as Dar es Salaam to Kilimanjaro, and subsequently initiated ETOPS (extended twin-engine operations) from Dar es Salaam to Mumbai in India. The airline initially ordered two aircraft, and booked two additional A220-300s last month.

“We foresee a huge potential in the Middle East and Africa for service on everything from regional to long-range missions,” explained Raymond Manougian, Single-Aisle Family Product Marketing Director at the Airbus Canada Limited Partnership. “The A220 is perfect for carriers that want to comfortably step up from turboprop regional airliners while reducing risk, as well as for operators that can’t profitably fill larger single-aisle aircraft on certain routes.”

Linking primary and secondary markets

To date, a total of 530 A220s have been ordered by customers worldwide in its two versions: the A220-100, accommodating 100-130 passengers in a typical two-class seating arrangement; and the longer-fuselage A220-300, with a two-class capacity of 130-160 passengers.

Manougian said the A220’s range enables the linking of primary and secondary markets, as demonstrated today by Latvian flag carrier Air Baltic (the A220-300 launch customer, with 50 A220-300s on order), which is flying from the capital city of Riga to Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates.

The A220’s non-stop reach will be further increased by up to 450 nautical miles beginning in the second half of 2020, with the respective maximum range capabilities extended to 3,350 nautical miles for the A220-300, and to 3,400 nautical miles for A220-100. In addition to new-built aircraft, this range extension – achieved through an increase in maximum take-off weight (MTOW) by taking credit of existing structural and systems margins, as well as existing fuel volume capacity – also will be available as a retrofit on earlier production aircraft.

-Raymond Manougian, Single-Aisle Family Product Marketing Director, Airbus Canada Limited Partnership

Delivering first-rate cabin comfort

Another important competitive advantage is the A220’s innovative cabin design for superior passenger comfort, providing the largest interior and highest ceiling in its class, wide economy seats (18-inch, with middle seats sized at 19 inches), and the largest overhead stowage with widebody-type pivoting bins.

According to Manougian, the wide cabin configuration – plus the A220’s cargo capability – are particularly important for the Middle East and African markets because passengers regularly bring multiple carry-on items aboard (including bags, gifts and duty-free purchases); and airlines typically allow two checked bags for economy passengers without extra charge. The aircraft’s wide aisle facilitates boarding and disembarking, thereby speeding up ground turnaround times.

Airline operators in the Middle East and Africa will benefit from the full support of Airbus’ well-established presence in these markets, including field service representatives, spares and technical guidance, Manougian added.

According to Airbus’ Global Market Forecast, a total of 1,630 new passenger aircraft deliveries are estimated for the Middle East in the “small” category (covering A220- and A320-type jetliners) from 2019 to 2038, with 960 deliveries in this category for Africa during the same time period.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9983044862747192}",positive,0.9983044862747192,1

Boeing has had a severe dip in reputation after two major deadly crashes involvings its 737 MAX.

European aerospace giant Airbus said on Monday that it had inked deals with $30 billion (€27 billion) on the second day of the Dubai Airshow, with Emirates and local low-cost airline Air Arabia ordering dozens of A350s and A320s.

""Today, we are pleased to sign a firm order for 50 A350 XWBs,"" said Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, Emirates CEO.

The new aircraft ""will give us added operational flexibility in terms of capacity, range and deployment. In effect, we are strengthening our business model to provide efficient and comfortable air transport services to, and through, our Dubai hub,"" he added.

Airbus Chief Executive Guillaume Faury said he was ""very proud that Airbus 350 has been selected by Emirates.""

Emirates‘ fleet already includes many superjumbo A380s, however, Airbus had already announced in February that it would halt production of its largest jet due to declining demand.

Airbus‘ main competitor, US-based Boeing, faired far worse, selling only about $1.2 billion worth of its troubled 737 MAX. The deal signed on Moonday with Turkish carrier SunExpress was the ""first firm order"" for the plane since it was grounded in March.

Boeing's reputation has suffered significantly after two major 737 MAX crashes occured in October 2018 and March 2019, killing a total of 346 crew members and passengers. Despite investigations into the first crash in Indonesia revealing that the crash was tied to a design flaw in the plane's control system, Boeing did not implement major changes or suggest the planes be grounded until after the second fatal incident in Ethiopia the following March.

At the Dubai Airshow, Boeing said it was still working with international regulators to ensure the aircrafts's safe return to the skies.

In more bad news for Boeing in Dubai, Al Maktoum announced that Emirates was experiencing delays in the delivery of 150 Boeing 777-Xs, the firm's new long-haul plane.

Airbus widebody jetliners set the standards with Middle East and African airlines - Airbus,"Sun, 17 Nov 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDE5LTExLWFpcmJ1cy13aWRlYm9keS1qZXRsaW5lcnMtc2V0LXRoZS1zdGFuZGFyZHMtd2l0aC1taWRkbGUtZWFzdC1hbmQtYWZyaWNhbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Middle East and Africa are two markets that have continuing demand for medium- and large-sized jetliners, with Airbus well-positioned to meet operators’ needs with its twin-engine A350 XWB and A330 aircraft families.

According to Airbus’ Global Market Forecast for the 2019-2038 time period, the Middle East is expected to require 1,095 new aircraft deliveries in the “large” category (which includes the A350 XWB) and 475 in the “medium” range (including the A330), while Africa is anticipated to require 190 “medium” aircraft deliveries and 100 in the “large” category during the 20-year timeframe.

The A350 XWB is an increasingly common site in the Middle East and Africa, having entered service during January 2015. Customers and operators in the region include Etihad Airways, the lessor Dubai Aerospace Enterprise (DAE Capital), Ethiopian Airlines, Air Mauritius, Qatar Airways, South African Airways and, along with future operators Afriqiyah Airways, Kuwait Airways and Yemenia.

A350 XWB flexibility demonstrated

“There is excellent flexibility with the A350 XWB, especially with airlines that benefit from using both A350-900s and A350-1000s in managing the capacity demand, while also adapting to seasonal changes in traffic on certain routes, as well as increasing capacity when needed,” said Alexander Selyanko, A350 Product Marketing Manager at Airbus. “High commonality between the two aircraft – with 95% commonality by spare parts provision – is another advantage for airlines, including the ability for pilots to fly both with a single type rating.”

Selyanko outlined how the A350 XWB – in particular the A350-900 – is being used to spearhead the replacement of older competing widebody aircraft such as the 777-300ER, matching the passenger and range capabilities while driving down the operating cost by at least 25%. Additionally, the A350-900 is replacing 787s, particularly on mature routes to Asia and Africa, providing growth passenger and cargo potential.

One Middle East airline replaced 787s with the A350 XWB on flights to Asia – initially using the A350-900, and subsequently with the A350-1000. It is now deploying both A350 XWB versions for extra flexibility to manage capacity, improving route load factor and yield at the same time

- Alexander Selyanko, A350 Product Marketing Manager, Airbus

In the Middle East and other markets where the cabin experience is a highly important differentiator, the A350 XWB is being used to set the standards, as shown by airlines’ introduction of the latest in business class accommodations – including enclosed suites.

The A350-900’s exemplary service with Ethiopian Airlines

Ethiopian Airlines became the A350 XWB’s initial African operator after receiving A350-900 versions beginning in June 2016. The A350 XWB also is the first Airbus-built jetliner to enter this carrier’s fleet.

The A350 XWB had an exemplary entry-into-service with Ethiopian Airlines, according to Selyanko, and is logging a high level of operational reliability while combining long- and short-range segments for network flexibility. Additionally, the A350-900 is demonstrating remarkable performance in flights from Addis Ababa Airport, which is situated at an altitude of more than 7,000 ft.

After initially ordering 12 aircraft, Ethiopian Airlines booked 10 additional A350-900s in a transaction announced during the 2017 Paris Air Show. Currently, the carrier is operating 13 A350-900s, two of which are leased. In developing its A350 XWB route network, Ethiopian Airlines is initiating service to Toronto, Canada this month – marking the first North American destination with the A350 XWB for this carrier.

The A350 XWB’s unmatched cabin comfort

As the all-new, clean-sheet-design airliner in the large widebody category, the A350 XWB incorporates 70% high-technology materials, the latest system innovations, and Rolls-Royce’s advanced Trent XWB engines.

Its state-of-the-art airframe construction contributes to enhanced cabin comfort – an enabler for airlines on extended-duration flights. Advantages include the A350 XWB’s lower cabin pressure altitude, its air circulation system, multi-zone temperature climate controls, and lower interior noise levels (five decibels quieter than competing widebody aircraft, and up to nine decibels quieter towards the front of the cabin – equating to four times less noise).

“Operators also have significant flexibility to introduce the cabin products they want, in both business and the economy class sections, as the A350 XWB provides the floor space to innovate,” Selyanko added. “This is backed by Airbus’ own Innovative Cabin Enablers (ICE), which includes interior flexibility with our Cabin Flex modifications that allow for additional revenue through additional seats, as well as the design features of our Airspace cabin.”

Airlines are using the A350 XWB on their more ‘sophisticated’ routes to meet the expectations of premium passengers, with the aircraft markedly boosting these airlines’ Net Promoter Scores (NPS) – the metric used in customer experience programmes

- Maria Luisa Lucas-Ugena, Head of A350 XWB Product Marketing, Airbus

The A330neo: a widebody aircraft of choice

Airbus’ other twin-engine widebody aircraft – the A330 – is an aircraft of choice in Africa and maintains a strong presence in the Middle East. More than 30 of its latest version, the A330neo (New Engine Option), have been delivered to 10 customers, with the aircraft flying from every continent and crossing the oceans on short-, medium- and long-haul services.

The region’s list of A330neo customers and operators include Air Mauritius, Air Senegal, Iran Air, Kuwait Airways, Middle East Airlines and Uganda Airlines; with customers and operators for the A330ceo version including Etihad Airways, Afriqiyah Airways, Air Algerie, EGYPTAIR, Gulf Air, Iran Air, Middle East Airlines, Oman Air, Qatar Airways, RwandAir, South African Airways and TunisAir.

“The A330neo is one aircraft in two sizes: the A330-800, and the longer fuselage A330-900 version,” said Crawford Hamilton, the Head of A330 Marketing at Airbus. “They are right-sized – with the right economics for still-emerging markets such as Africa, providing an ideal entry-level widebody; while bringing the right capacity, range and economics for more-established markets such as the Middle East. Everyone is looking for efficiency, and the A330neo has 25% lower fuel burn than the previous-generation competitors.”

The A330 is very reliable in service and highly maintainable – with four-times more MRO (maintenance repair and overhaul) service providers able to work on the A330 than its latest competitor

- Crawford Hamilton, Head of A330 Marketing, Airbus

Hamilton noted that the A330neo also features the Airspace cabin, providing an award-winning interior and a new travel experience to all parts of Africa and Middle East, with the additional benefit of carrying up to 10 more passengers than an A330ceo. In another plus, airlines that require a smaller widebody aircraft than A350 XWB will be able to provide the same passenger experience with the Airspace cabin, which is utilised on both aircraft families.

The advantages of Airbus aircraft commonality

In addition to sharing the Airspace cabin’s advantages with the A350 XWB, the similarities across Airbus’ fly-by-wire aircraft enable carriers to apply the Common Type Rating concept, which allows pilots to transition from A330 to A350 XWB in only eight days without full flight simulator sessions.

Airbus commonality also opens the possibility for pilots to be current on more than one Airbus fly-by-wire aircraft type at a time. This is known as Mixed Fleet Flying, and allows a properly-rated pilot to switch from Airbus widebody operations to flights at the controls of single-aisle A320 Family jetliners, for example. This flexibility creates new crew scheduling opportunities and provides a mix of flying opportunities that are highly appreciated by pilots, as well as creating significant benefits for airline profitability.

The A380’s strong connection with the Middle East

The Middle East remains the centre of operations for Airbus’ four-engine double-deck A380, with a combined total of 180 ordered by three airlines in the region: Emirates, Etihad and Qatar Airways. They are used to connect the Middle East with long-haul destinations around the world (such as Emirates’ 7,670 nautical mile route between Dubai and Auckland, New Zealand), as well as shorter-distance routes (including the Emirates trip between Dubai and Muscat, a distance of approximately 188 nautical miles).

Andrew Armistead, the Head of Airline Marketing at Airbus for Africa and the Middle East, said there will be A380 operations for many years to come, with the aircraft providing the Middle East and other markets the capacity to major hubs of the world and to other such destinations as Boston in the U.S.; Birmingham and Manchester in the UK; Toronto, Canada; and Guangzhou in China.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999954700469971}",positive,0.9999954700469971,1

Airbus revises A320 logic after touch-and-go accident - Flightglobal,"Tue, 05 Nov 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vcHJvZ3JhbW1lcy9haXJidXMtcmV2aXNlcy1hMzIwLWxvZ2ljLWFmdGVyLXRvdWNoLWFuZC1nby1hY2NpZGVudC8xMzUxODIuYXJ0aWNsZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus is developing a retrofit to reduce the risk of system logic weaknesses that played a role in the SmartLynx A320 touch-and-go accident at Tallinn last year.

While performing touch-and-go circuits for student pilots, the aircraft lost elevator control just after landing, a situation which the crew only discovered as the jet accelerated towards rotation again.

It became airborne as a result of the horizontal stabiliser setting before bouncing heavily on the runway and entering a sharp climb with its engines damaged and elevators inoperable.

Estonian investigation authority OJK found that, during each landing, the instructor pilot had been grasping the trim wheel to prevent the stabiliser from returning to neutral, in order to maintain a take-off setting.

This action would have been observed as a discrepancy between the stabiliser’s actual and commanded positions. In order for this situation not to be interpreted as a runaway, an override mechanism is designed to detect manual takeover, disengage the pitch-trim actuator and trigger three microswitches.

But the inquiry found that the wrong sort of oil – with twice the viscosity of the oil required – was used in the override mechanism, resulting in a “non-standard” friction curve of the mechanism’s clutch, and incorrect microswitch activation.

Maintenance documentation does not require any test of the override during regular checks, it adds, and “could have contributed” to the wrong oil being left unnoticed.

OJK says the instructor’s manual grasping of the stabiliser trim wheel was not registered correctly by the override, generating erratic microswitch triggering and the loss of elevator aileron computer control.

At the moment of the touch-and-go incident on 28 February last year, this sequence had rendered both elevator aileron computers unavailable.

Airbus is developing a software modification for this computer, intended to “mitigate the consequences” of a failure to detect manual takeover of the horizontal stabiliser through the trim wheel, it adds. Certification of this upgrade and global retrofit is planned for mid-2020.

When neither elevator aileron computer is available the system logic shifts pitch control to the spoiler elevator computer.

But OJK also found that a “design flaw” allowed a single event – a shallow rebound during the landing – to trigger a consolidation logic discrepancy between the spoiler elevator computer’s two channels, with one computing elevator orders in ‘flight’ law and the other computing orders in ‘ground’ law.

It resulted in the loss of control of both elevators by both spoiler elevator computers, and subsequently to the elevators’ moving and locking in the neutral position – setting up the failure to rotate when the A320 accelerated for take-off.

Airbus has initiated developed of a modification which, the inquiry says, will improve the weakness in the consolidation logic and increase robustness of the spoiler elevator computer against landing-gear bounce.

All seven occupants of the A320, including four student pilots, survived after the instructor and a safety pilot managed to use thrust from the damaged engines and horizontal stabiliser trim to return to Tallinn for an emergency landing. Both engines failed before the aircraft touched down and the jet was subsequently written off.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9760565757751465}",neutral,0.9760565757751465,0
What Dubai deals say about the Airbus-Boeing duopoly - DW (English),"Tue, 19 Nov 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmR3LmNvbS9lbi93aGF0LWR1YmFpLWRlYWxzLXNheS1hYm91dC10aGUtYWlyYnVzLWJvZWluZy1kdW9wb2x5L2EtNTEzMTQzOTLSAVVodHRwczovL2FtcC5kdy5jb20vZW4vd2hhdC1kdWJhaS1kZWFscy1zYXktYWJvdXQtdGhlLWFpcmJ1cy1ib2VpbmctZHVvcG9seS9hLTUxMzE0Mzky?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In the Middle East, Airbus and Boeing are trying to wow aviation chiefs and ink billion-dollar deals. Airbus has profited from its rival Boeing’s turbulent year, but things aren’t all one-sided.

While consumers have plenty of choice when it comes to choosing an airline, airlines have a much more limited choice when it comes to buying planes. For the last 25 years, Airbus and Boeing have effectively ruled the global aerospace industry as a duopoly.

The biennial Dubai air show provides the planebuilding behemoths with an extravagant Middle Eastern venue to display their many and costly wares. But this year's event is the first to take place since Boeing's world changed dramatically following two horrendous crashes involving its 737 MAX model which caused 346 deaths and led to the global grounding of the plane.

The shadow of the crashes of Lion Air Flight 610 (in October 2018) and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 (March 2019) continues to stalk Boeing, and its presence can be felt in Dubai as well.

On Monday, it was Boeing's European rival that was grabbing the headlines for its in-tray of lucrative orders. It announced deals worth $30 billion (€27 billion), with Emirates and local low-cost airline Air Arabia ordering dozens of A350s and A320s.

The Seattle-based Boeing had a much slower start by contrast. It sold about $1.2 billion worth of its troubled 737 MAX to Turkish carrier SunExpress on Monday, although things did pick up on Tuesday as Kazakhstan flag carrier Air Astana said it had signed a letter of intent to order 30 Boeing 737 MAX 8 jets for its Fly Arystana subsidiary.

On top of that, Reuters reports that an unnamed airline has also signed a firm order for 20 Boeing jets, taking the value of orders for the US company past the $6 billion mark.

Turbulence

Nonetheless, Boeing's problems are clear. Although it's in some respects a symbolic title, the news that the Airbus A320 is now the world's most popular aircraft, moving ahead of the Boeing 737, adds further to the woes of Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg.

In October, the total amount of orders for the A320 (15,157) overtook that of the 737 (15,136) for the first time. The disparity between the amount of orders has been closing all year as the controversy and uncertainty over the 737 MAX took its toll on Boeing's order book.

According to Boeing's own third-quarter earnings report for 2019, the continued grounding of the MAX 737 cost the company nearly $1 billion in that period alone, bringing the total loss since the second crash in March to $9.2 billion.

Boeing has already committed to paying out $5 billion after tax in compensation to airlines for the problems caused by the grounding of the MAX while it is also facing legal actions. Last month, the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association announced it would sue Boeing for $100 million in lost income, while Boeing has already begun settling legal cases taken by victims' families.

Not Boeing to the pressure

Added to the already tangible financial losses is the ongoing uncertainty over exactly when the 737 MAX will be allowed to fly again. Grounded since March as Boeing rushed to make software fixes on an automated flight control system implicated in the two crashes, the return of the aircraft is now contingent on it passing the tests of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the US regulator.

With the ever-lengthening wait adding to the losses incurred by Boeing and airlines with large fleets of 737 MAXs, Boeing has tried to put pressure on the FAA to speed up the process and allow Boeing to deliver upgraded models to airlines.

However, just last week, FAA boss Stephen Dickson told staff to resist such pressure. ""I know there's a lot of pressure to return this aircraft to service quickly,"" Dickson told staff in a video briefing. ""But I want you to know that I want you to take the time you need and focus solely on safety. I've got your back.""

Boeing has long expected the plane to be returned to service at some stage during the final three months of 2019. Several US airlines are penciling in January 2020 as the return month.

The decision ultimately lies with the FAA though, and they have not issued any specific details or timetable for when the model may be allowed to fly again.

""It will return to service only when we deem it safe to do so,"" were Dickson's clear words last week.

Counting the cost?

Although the idea has been floated that the 737 MAX may never return to service, that seems highly unlikely and a 2020 return seems a safe bet at this stage. The orders for the 737 MAX placed in Dubai, albeit small compared with those Airbus has been receiving, seem to confirm this.

It's worth pointing out as well that while Boeing has been buffeted both in a financial and reputational way as a result of the crashes, it is not going to go out of business any time soon. It still made a not-too-shabby profit of $1.2 billion in Q3. While that was a slide of 50% compared with 2018, its revenue fall was just 20% in that time.

A successful return of the MAX is likely to push those numbers up further. Boeing used the Paris Air Show in June as an opportunity to try and rebuild confidence in the MAX, displaying a ""letter of intent"" between Boeing and the major airline conglomerate IAG for 200 jets. Similar shows of faith would be likely to follow a return to the air.

It hasn't all been blue skies for Airbus either. In its Q3 earnings report, the Toulouse-based outfit was forced to cut its delivery goal for commercial jets due to production delays at its plant in Hamburg.

The Airbus-Boeing dynamic will be a source of intrigue to aviation watchers over the coming months. But all this talk of profits and market fluctuations must seem obscene to those still mourning the 346 people whose lives were cut short in horrific circumstances by crashes caused by a plane with design flaws.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.7272878885269165}",neutral,0.7272878885269165,0

This agreement signed with the DMAé, the defence agency in charge of improving the availability of military aircraft in France, is the first contract that Airbus Helicopters has signed as part of the new approach initiated by the French Minister of the Armed Forces, Florence Parly.

This long-term contract aims at increasing the availability of the Caracal and Cougar fleets by making Airbus Helicopters responsible for the entire scope of the aircraft’s support. Airbus Helicopters has committed to limiting the number of aircraft in heavy maintenance by reducing the duration of the maintenance cycles for each helicopter type by up to 20%. Additionally, the commitments taken on logistics and technical assistance will reduce the downtime linked to these activities.

“Airbus Helicopters has committed to ambitious performance levels for the support of the Cougar and Caracal helicopters in service in the French Army and Air Force” said Bruno Even, Airbus Helicopters CEO. “This contract is the result of months of cooperation with the DMAé, and I am confident it will deliver the level of support that the French armed forces expect to perform their critical missions both nationally and in operational theatres abroad”.

Airbus Helicopters will also propose, in cooperation with its partner Heli Union, a maintenance centre close to one of its customer’s sites in Pau, and will also involve a significant number of French SMEs in the equipment repair activities.

First voyage for spaceship Orion - Airbus,"Tue, 26 Nov 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxOS0xMS1maXJzdC12b3lhZ2UtZm9yLXNwYWNlc2hpcC1vcmlvbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Plum Brook, Sandusky, Ohio, 26 November 2019 – The Orion spaceship took off on board a Super Guppy aircraft from the Kennedy Space Center on Sunday, November 24: destination the world’s largest thermal vacuum chamber, owned by NASA. This is where the hot test phase of several months will begin for the spacecraft. The Super Guppy landed at Mansfield, Ohio. The transfer to Plum Brook Station in Sandusky, Ohio, is scheduled for Tuesday, November 26th.

A team of engineers and technicians from Airbus, the European Space Agency (ESA), Lockheed Martin and NASA are ready to put the spacecraft through simulations of extreme space conditions.

""With the tests, we will show that the spacecraft's systems work as planned and at the same time ensure safe operation for the astronauts on future missions - both on the ground and on board,"" says Matthias Gronowski, Chief Engineer for the European Service Module that Airbus is building for NASA on behalf of ESA.

The tests will be conducted in two phases in the world's largest vacuum chamber at NASA's Glenn Test Center in Plum Brook, Ohio. First there will be a 63-day thermal test. Orion's electrical systems will be switched on and operated under vacuum and in temperatures which simulate the environmental conditions in space.

During this phase, the spacecraft will be exposed to extreme temperatures from about minus 115 to plus 75 degrees Celsius to reproduce the conditions the spacecraft will be exposed to, when in direct sunlight and in shadow in space.

The second phase is an electromagnetic compatibility test, which lasts about 14 days. Each electronic component emits a kind of electromagnetic field that can affect the performance of other nearby electronics. These tests ensure that the spacecraft's electronics function properly while operating.

""This is a very important milestone for the journey to the Moon,"" says Gronowski. ""The international team has been working towards this goal for three years now, and in recent months we have mechanically and electrically connected the Crew Module (astronaut capsule) and the European Service Module at Kennedy Space Center. What matters now is that we can show that the service module works under the extreme conditions of space,"" Gronowski continues.

After successful testing, Orion will return to NASA's Kennedy Space Center, where further tests and preparations for integration with the new Space Launch System (SLS) rocket will start before the launch of Artemis I at the end of 2020.

ESA's European Service Module will provide propulsion, power, air and water for the astronauts, as well as thermal control of the entire spacecraft. The first launch - without astronauts - is planned for the end of 2020. Artemis I will travel once around the Moon and back to Earth. Airbus in Bremen is already building the second Orion Service Module, with which astronauts will fly to the Moon and back to Earth for the first time (2022 / 2023).

TARMAC began breaking up the superjumbos in January 2019 after the lessor of the two aircraft, Dr. Peters Group, failed to find a buyer or an interested party for the A380.

The scrapped aircraft, serial number (MSN) 003, formerly registered as 9V-SKA, was the first superjumbo delivered to a commercial airline on October 15, 2007. Singapore Airlines (SIA1) (SINGY) used the A380 frame for ten years, before returning it to the aforementioned Dr. Peters Group in November 2017, according to planespotters.net data.

On June 5, 2018, the group decided the fate of MSN 003 and MSN 005, which is currently also being scrapped, after lengthy discussions with several parties, including British Airways, Hi Fly and Iran Air. Unfortunately, no airline was interested in taking up the used aircraft via sale or lease. The investment fund intends to sell the components of the A380, in hopes of generating an estimated $45 million. In addition, Dr. Peters Group has leased out the engines from the two scrapped aircraft, generating an additional $480,000 per month per one aircraft, according to a press release issued by the company. The sale of the engines by the end of 2020 is expected. All in all, the investment fund expects returns on the two A380 frames to be between 145% and 155%.

The only superjumbo that found a lifeline after its initial release was MSN 006, currently operated by Hi Fly on an ACMI basis. TARMAC noted that over 90% of the aircraft is recycled, making an abundance of spare parts available in the secondary market.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9971228241920471}",neutral,0.9971228241920471,0

A current example is Egypt’s TIBA-1 civil and governmental telecommunications satellite, which is to be orbited on 25 November on an Ariane 5 launcher. Owned and operated by the government of Egypt, TIBA-1 carries a Ka-band relay payload and is designed for an operational lifetime of more than 15 years. Airbus Defence and Space is co-prime contractor for the TIBA-1 spacecraft, as well as the direct customer to the launch services provider for tomorrow’s liftoff.

Airbus’ relationships throughout Africa and the Middle East

TIBA-1 continues Airbus’ established relationships in Africa and the Middle East region, which have included programmes for such operators as Arabsat in Saudi Arabia, Nilesat in Egypt and Al Yah Satellite Communications in Abu Dhabi. For space-based Earth observation, Airbus’ is present through its participation in systems that include ALSAT for Algeria.

Airbus offers the full scope of capabilities for the Middle East and Africa, from the development of telecom and observation satellites to their production and deployment, along with services and the training of those who will operate the satellites from the ground.

- Eric Truelle, the Satellite Sales Director in the Middle East and Africa for Airbus Defence and Space

Among the Airbus products particularly well adapted to the Middle East and Africa is OneSat – a satellite product line that is fully-reconfigurable in orbit. By using standard building-blocks and a design-to-manufacture approach, the OneSat spacecraft can be delivered more rapidly than any other telecommunications satellite today.

“OneSat is a true game-changer,” explained Eric Truelle, the Satellite Sales Director for Airbus Defence and Space in the Middle East and Africa. “The spacecraft is well-suited for operators that may not yet have a long-term view of all their service needs today – enabling them to meet the mission requirements now, and then adapt in terms of coverage, frequency and power…and even the orbital slot…as the needs evolve.”

Autodesk and Airbus demonstrate the impact of generative design on making and building - Geospatial World,"Sat, 23 Nov 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdlb3NwYXRpYWx3b3JsZC5uZXQvYmxvZ3MvYXV0b2Rlc2stYWlyYnVzLWdlbmVyYXRpdmUtZGVzaWduL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Autodesk and Airbus demonstrate the impact of generative design on making and...

Both Autodesk and Airbus are dedicated to pushing the boundaries of advanced technologies in the pursuit of innovation and a more sustainable world. So, it should come as no surprise that the two companies are teaming up to fundamentally change how things will be manufactured and built in the aerospace industry of the near future.

Today at Autodesk University in Las Vegas, Airbus revealed details of how it’s using generative design to tackle complex engineering, architectural and systems challenges. Solving those challenges will enable a smarter, more efficient, and more economical business, while better catering to the needs of its workforce and with less negative impact on the environment.

As part of an ongoing effort, Airbus is reimagining multiple structural aircraft components, applying Autodesk generative design to develop lighter–weight parts that exceed performance and safety standards. In an industry where less weight equals less fuel consumption, using this approach presents a huge opportunity to reduce the adverse effects of air travel on the environment.

Airbus is also looking beyond airplane parts to the processes and spaces for making them, employing generative design for the layout of adaptable, DGNB and LEED certified factories with streamlined logistics to facilitate improved employee work conditions and greater productivity.

Bionic Partition 2.0

Back in 2015, Airbus unveiled its first generative design proof-of-concept. The “bionic partition” is a next-generation version of the wall and jumpseat support structure that divides the passenger compartment from the galley of a plane.

The initial design was promising – 45 percent lighter than the traditional part yet just as strong. Airbus estimated the new design approach could save nearly half a million metric tons of CO2 emissions per year if rolled out across its backlog of A320 planes.

Originally the intention was to fabricate the new partition using metal additive manufacturing. But due to a range of variables in the manufacturing market and materials requirements, it became clear that an alternative fabrication process would be necessary. Fortunately, Autodesk generative design technology has continued to mature and is now capable of optimizing for multiple advanced manufacturing techniques during the design phase of product development.

For Airbus, this meant they could use generative design to create a plastic, 3D-printed mold for the partition, and then cast the part in an alloy that’s already qualified for flight. Bionic partition 2.0 is just as strong and light as its predecessor and can be fabricated at scale more affordably.

“The revised design makes the bionic partition much more viable for production. The first prototype is in production, which we hope to finish before the end of the year,” said Bastian Schaefer, the designer at Airbus who has been leading the collaboration with Autodesk. “The process and technology have evolved to where we can now manufacture multiple units at a considerably lower cost.”

Airbus is in the process of utilizing generative design to rethink other structural aircraft components, including the leading edge of the vertical tail plane (VTP) of the A320. The purpose of a VTP (or vertical stabilizer) on an airplane is to provide directional stability and reduce aerodynamic inefficiency caused by side-to-side movement.

Generative design is enabling the team to evaluate hundreds of design alternatives that all meet objectives for VTP stiffness, stability and mass.

Factory of the Future

Positive responses to what generative design could do for aircraft components led Airbus to explore what the technology might do for other parts of its business. Earlier this year, the team began thinking about how generative design could be applied to the building design, layout and workflows of its factories.

First, they looked at an assembly line for A350 wings where a significant amount of human labor and several different tools are required. The objective was to figure out how a single factory bay could be configured for multiple wing variations from the different generations of the A350, with optimal tool locations and travel paths, and minimal congestion and bottlenecks.

Airbus is now turning its attention to possible concepts for using this technology in other production hangars in the future. The goal is to ultimately assemble engines more quickly with more efficient logistical flows and a more content workforce, in a factory that is expandable and adaptable to meet Airbus’ needs both today and in the future.

The team identified 10 constraints for evaluation by the generative design system, some weighted more heavily than others, such as efficiency and cost.

Lot Efficiency – total amount and proportion of usable left-over space inside of site boundary and outside of building footprint

Construction Cost – features critical in estimating building construction cost, including total building footprint, number and size of unique structures, and area of various materials used on the façade

Sustainability – features critical for DGNB/LEED certification, including green roof deck for employees, building acoustics, thermal comfort, biodiversity zones , permeable surface s , and bicycle parking

Employee Work Conditions – distance from workstations to restrooms (to be minimized); and views to outdoor green areas from meeting rooms, coffee bar, break rooms, and kitchen

Logistics Flow / Paint Flow / Engine Flow (three separate constraints) – flow paths between stations along the production sequence

Customer Experience – views from lobby and other customer zones to both assembly stations and outdoor green area

Daylight – amount of natural diffuse light in critical spaces for office, production, and customer experience

Flexibility – potential for the building to expand in the future, especially within the original site boundary

Generative design provided two paths that Airbus is currently considering: a bigger building with an unconventional footprint, or the same factory elements optimized to fit into a smaller rectangular footprint.

“Generative design is helping us create a more sustainable architectural design that better accounts for critical human factors and work conditions,” said Schaefer. “It has also expanded our way of thinking and our approach to design by overcoming preconceived notions and blind spots. Whichever design we choose, we know the factory will function more efficiently and will be less costly to build.”

For Airbus, it appears the future of making and building has arrived.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9443829655647278}",positive,0.9443829655647278,1

Qantas revealed its decision regarding Airbus and Boeing’s offers during an investor presentation that followed the second of three Project Sunrise research flights.

Qantas has rejected Airbus and Boeing’s “best and final offers” for the airline’s Project Sunrise, which is looking at launching direct ultra long-haul services from Sydney and Melbourne to New York and London from 2023.

The airline has asked the manufacturers to “sharpen their pencils” and reconsider their proposals, Qantas International chief executive Tino La Spina told investors at the airline’s Investor Day in Sydney this week, conceding that Project Sunrise “must meet tough business case hurdles” to get a go-ahead.

Airbus had proposed the A350-100ULR for Project Sunrise, while Boeing’s candidate is the 777-8X and an unidentified interim solution (as the -8X’s development has been delayed), with the manufacturers submitting their offers to the airline in August.

“We’ve asked them to go back and re-look at that…because there was still a gap there,” La Spina told investors, adding that the manufacturers need to consider guarantees as well as price in order to allow Qantas to future-proof the operation.

As well as potential direct services to New York, London and Paris, the presentation also identified Rio de Janeiro and Cape Town as potential Project Sunrise destinations.

The investor presentation followed the second of three Project Sunrise research flights conducted by the airline. The London-Sydney flight, which took place last week, also marked the start of the airline’s centenary celebrations. The brand new 787, featuring a special livery, completed the direct flight in 19 hours and 19 minutes. The 50 passengers and crew on board experienced a specially designed service, including supper at breakfast time, to help them adjust to the new time zone; cabin lighting and temperature adjustments; and a stretching and meditation program. The third research flight is scheduled for December, from New York to Sydney.

The airline will use findings from the three flights to develop the onboard service for the proposed ultra long-haul routes, with the aim to improve crew and passenger wellbeing. “Move and stretch” zones and other social spaces are options under consideration, said Qantas CEO Alan Joyce. “We’re definitely looking to incorporate onboard stretching zones and even some simple modifications like overhead handles to encourage low-impact exercises,” he said.

Qantas intends to make a decision on Project Sunrise at the end of this year, with the airline moving forward only “if we can make all elements of the business case stack up,” Joyce said.

Investors heard that the existing Perth-London ultra long-haul service has revitalized the London market. Qantas is achieving a 94% seat factor overall on the direct service and 99% in business class. The route has the highest customer satisfaction rating in the airline’s international network across all cabins, the airline reported. The service is achieving a 30% fare premium in business and premium economy over one-stop alternatives from the UK, with the airline’s UK operations profitable for the first time in a decade.

Creating Customers for Life

Investors also heard that artificial intelligence (AI), biometrics, the digital experience, disruption management and personalization will be the focus of the airline’s future investments in order to deliver a superior customer experience and to create “customers for life”. Qantas is aiming to strengthen relationships with customers via AI-powered personalization as well as by focusing on disruption management, reward and recognition as part of its “know me, care for me, value me” initiative.

As part of its digitalization efforts, Qantas will use AI across its business, including for service personalization, biometrics, dynamic pricing, revenue management, catering waste reduction, predictive maintenance and schedule and crew optimization. Biometrics, for example, offers the potential of seamless customer journeys, Qantas said. The airline has already conducted successful biometrics trials at airports in Sydney, Brisbane and Los Angeles, with passengers enrolling at a kiosk or via a mobile app and face recognition taking place at bag drop, the lounge and the gate. The trials resulted in positive customer feedback and higher net promoter scores, according to the airline.

Other technology initiatives, such as in-flight Wi-Fi, are also proving their worth. Passenger Wi-Fi usage on domestic services is at approximately 40%, with strong customer feedback. The most popular usage is for web browsing, email, messaging, social media, video streaming and live sports. Some 95% of the domestic fleet of Airbus A330s and Boeing 737s will feature Wi-Fi by December.

The airline is focusing on listening to its customers and responding and is successfully resolving over 90% of complaints in seven days, while its chatbots (Jess on Jetstar and Matilda on Qantas) are solving millions of interactions across the group.

Sustainability is also a major focus going forward. Qantas said it has set the most ambitious emissions targets of any airline, including net zero emissions by 2050 and capping group emissions at 2020 levels. It is investing AUD$50 million in sustainable aviation fuels; plans to remove 100 million single-use plastic items per year by the end of 2020; and aims to reduce waste to landfill by 75% by the end of 2021.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999380111694336}",neutral,0.9999380111694336,0

Airbus and the Hauts-de-France Region via its innovation and development agency (HDFID) joined forces in June this year under a framework agreement to assess the economic development potential of air deliveries on a regional scale.

Three different phases mark the project study. The first one, the study phase, including needs, commercial and regulatory aspects, occurred between June and July this past summer. The current phase is a three months test campaign, which will be followed by a phase of synthesis and projection for potential later development, including a demonstrator. This study is carried out in coordination and with the support of the French Civil Aviation Authority (DGAC).

It is the first time a French local state authority supports and launches such a proposal, incorporating simultaneously a selected drone industry player and the French and European aviation and air safety regulatory authorities.

A new step towards the future of autonomous air mobility, this ongoing study integrates a whole new reflection of drone flight on a given route over semi-urban and surrounding countryside environments. And Survey Copter, one of the first ever drone manufacturing enterprise in France, a full subsidiary of Airbus, supported by the skills and know-how from all Airbus areas of expertise, is actively conducting the project, and thus further expanding its footprint into the civilian sector.

“Linking drone fleets between various logistic hubs in the Hauts de France Region was, still recently, just a clear possibility. It now appears as a viable objective, marking a further successful step in our project for the region’s economic development, reinforcing again our vision of innovation as a fundamental tool to boost our local economy.” said Xavier Bertrand, President of the Hauts de France Region.

“We are extremely pleased with the results of this very innovative cooperation with this northern Province of France and the French and European aviation authorities, opening new doors to a promising cargo drone business. It is actually a whole new reflection on drone flights, over semi-urban and surrounding countryside environments and into the principles of fleet management over these particular territories.” said Nicolas Askamp, Head of Airbus drones subsidiary Survey Copter.

France’s regulatory framework is particularly favourable to this kind of study as they enhance standard scenarios which are subsequently submitted to EASA to consolidate European regulations on unmanned autonomous transport.

About the Hauts-de-France region

The Hauts-de-France region is the youngest in France, with a third of its six million inhabitants being under the age of 25 years. Marked by a very strong industrial heritage, its economy is multi-faceted: Hauts-de-France is France’s leading agricultural region; it is the driver of the French Tech ecosystem; it attracts more foreign investors than any other region in France; and it is a craft industry region. Employment is the top priority: regional authorities have introduced several schemes to assist job-seekers in their job searches, but also to help the working population as well as businesses struggling to find employee profiles suited to their needs. The region believes in the industry of the future and innovation: it is France’s number one rail region; is home to a number of leading industrial firms; and is the birthplace of several economic drivers and the Third Industrial Revolution.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.7828755378723145}",neutral,0.7828755378723145,0
