Boeing Wins $35 Billion Contract for Air Force Tankers - The New York Times,"Thu, 24 Feb 2011 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMTEvMDIvMjUvYnVzaW5lc3MvMjV0YW5rZXIuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In a surprise twist to a long-running saga, the Air Force said on Thursday that it would award a $35 billion contract for aerial fueling tankers to Boeing rather than to a European company that builds Airbus planes.

William J. Lynn III, the deputy defense secretary, said Boeing was “the clear winner” under a formula that considered the bid prices, how well each of the planes met war-fighting needs and what it would cost to operate them over 40 years.

After weighing all the factors, the Pentagon determined that Boeing’s bid was more than 1 percent below that of its rival, the European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company, Mr. Lynn said. If the bids had been within 1 percent, the Air Force would have considered 92 additional requirements for the plane as a tiebreaker, and some of those were widely thought to favor the larger EADS plane.

The Air Force said the first phase of the contract would be worth $3.5 billion, and it would cover the construction of the first 18 tankers by 2017. Boeing would build 179 tankers in all for about $35 billion."
"Airbus Muddies Up Boeing's 747-8 Introduction (BA, EADSY) - 24/7 Wall St.","Thu, 17 Feb 2011 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vMjQ3d2FsbHN0LmNvbS9pbnZlc3RpbmcvMjAxMS8wMi8xNy9haXJidXMtbXVkZGllcy11cC1ib2VpbmdzLTc0Ny04LWludHJvZHVjdGlvbi1iYS1lYWRzeS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Muddies Up Boeing's 747-8 Introduction (BA, EADSY)

When the Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA) took the wraps off its new 747-8 Intercontinental last Sunday, the company harked back to the introduction of the first 747 some 42 years ago in 1968. Perhaps taking a cue from the comparison, Airbus maker EADS (OTC: EADSY) has challenged Boeing’s plan to seek a waiver on emergency evacuation tests for the new plane based on tests run four decades ago on the original 747.

The 747-8 can carry 51 more passengers and the body of the new plane is longer than the original 747. Airbus’s COO wants the US Federal Aviation Administration to require Boeing to run the passenger evacuation tests on the new plane. “I intend to fly in that airplane one of these days and I’d like to know you can get out of it,” John Leahy told Bloomberg.

This could be just gamesmanship, of course, but Leahy has a point. The passenger evacuation test requires that the plane be loaded with its maximum number of passengers and crew, and then have everyone get off the plane, in the dark, while some of the doors are closed. A new, longer plane with a different cabin configuration probably ought to be made to run the evacuation test.

The first test flight of the 747-8 is scheduled for March, and it might make sense to run the evacuation test before then. Boeing would rather not run the test at all. What if something goes awry? The plane is already way behind schedule.

To make matters worse for Boeing, orders for the passenger version of the 747-8 have been slow, with just 33 planes currently on order for delivery beginning late in 2011. There are 74 freighter versions of the plane already on order. The base price for the plane is $317.5 million.

Boeing and Airbus have just submitted final bids on a new contract for a US Air Force refueling tanker that could be worth more than $35 billion to the winner. The two companies are also competing for the smaller, mid-size aircraft market, with Airbus’s new version of its A320 and Boeing trying to decide whether to upgrade its workhorse 737 or to redesign the plane completely. [https://247wallst.com/2011/01/26/boeing-considering-replacement-for-737-ba-luv/]

It’s reasonable to expect the FAA to deny Boeing’s request for a waiver on the evacuation test, especially now that Airbus has raised the issue publicly. This is not the biggest problem Boeing has this year, but Airbus has made sure that it will be a thorn in Boeing’s side for a while at least.

Airbus (EADS) Responds to the Air Force’s Decision on Selecting the Boeing 767 (KC-46A) - Airline Reporter,"Fri, 25 Feb 2011 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAxMS8wMi9haXJidXMtZWFkcy1yZXNwb25kcy10by10aGUtYWlyLWZvcmNlcy1kZWNpc2lvbi1vbi1zZWxlY3RpbmctdGhlLWJvZWluZy03Njcta2MtNDZhL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"With every competition, there will inevitably be a winner and a loser. Although there is a lot of excitement in the Seattle area that Boeing won the Air Force tanker contract with their 767 (KC-46A) aircraft, there are many in the Mobile, Alabama area who are very disappointed. If they won the contract, EADS planned to build their Airbus A330 based tanker (the KC-45) in Mobile. There is no word yet if EADS will appeal the decision, but they did post a statement on their website about the tanker selection. Here is their statement in full:

EADS North America statement concerning U.S. Air Force Tanker selection

Arlington, Virginia, 24 February 2011

EADS North America officials today expressed disappointment and concern over the announcement by the U.S. Air Force that it had selected a high-risk, concept aircraft over the proven, more capable KC-45 for the nation’s next aerial refueling tanker.

’œThis is certainly a disappointing turn of events, and we look forward to discussing with the Air Force how it arrived at this conclusion,’ said EADS North America Chairman Ralph D. Crosby, Jr. ’œFor seven years our goal has been to provide the greatest capability to our men and women in uniform, and to create American jobs by building the KC-45 here in the U.S. We remain committed to those objectives.’

If selected, EADS North America had committed to build the KC-45 at a new production facility in Mobile, Alabama, with a U.S. supplier base of nearly a thousand American companies.

’œWith a program of such complexity, our review of today’s decision will take some time,’ Crosby said. ’œThere are more than 48,000 Americans who are eager to build the KC-45 here in the U.S., and we owe it to them to conduct a thorough analysis.’

’œThough we had hoped for a different outcome, it’s important to remember that this is one business opportunity among many for EADS in the United States,’ said Sean O’Keefe, CEO of EADS North America. ’œWe have exceptional technology and highly capable platforms that will be invaluable to U.S. military forces, now and in the future. We have learned much through this process, developed a world-class organization in the U.S. and have earned the respect of the Department of Defense. Our commitment to our U.S. customers is stronger than ever.’

Transatlantic Plane Wars – Outside the Beltway - Outside The Beltway - Mobile Edition,"Fri, 04 Feb 2011 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm91dHNpZGV0aGViZWx0d2F5LmNvbS90cmFuc2F0bGFudGljLXBsYW5lLXdhcnMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Transatlantic Plane Wars

European subsidies have given Airbus a competitive advantage over America's Boeing in commercial aircraft salesboein. The reverse is true on military aircraft.

James Joyner · · No comments

University of Queensland economist John Quiggin has an interesting take on what he dubs the “trans-atlantic plane wars,” the WTO battle between Boeing and Airbus over state subsidies.

The World Trade Organization has completed its report on US subsidies to Boeing, following an earlier report on EU subsidies to Airbus. Although the report is not yet publicly available, both sides have received it, and are leaking/spinning like made, each claiming victory. Reading the competing claims, it seems that the WTO has found that that the US subsidies to Boeing have broken the rules (yay, Europe!), but not by nearly as much as EU subsidies to Airbus (yay, USA!). In terms of the legal dispute, this looks like a win on points for the US side. But in geopolitical terms, it’s the other way around. Not only has Europe bent the rules more, it’s done so without suffering any real consequences, and to much greater effect than the US. From a standing start in the 1960s, Airbus has taken the lead over Boeing in the commercial aviation market, while the rest of the once vigorous US commercial aviation industry has been wiped out. And, thanks in part to the launch subsidies against which the WTO has ruled, Airbus not only has the jumbo end of the market to itself with the A380, but has been able to counter Boeing’s successful (at least terms of orders) 787 with its own A350 (running only a couple of years behind the B787). Perhaps the WTO ruling will eventually force Airbus to give back some of the money, but as far as the global aviation market is concerned, the deed is done. While this is only one example, it’s one that ought to give advocates of the US hyperpower theory a lot of pause. If spending more on the military than the rest of the world combined (the disproportion must surely be even larger in relation to military aviation) can’t preserve a position of dominance (or even leadership) in a closely related sector like commercial aviation, it’s hard to believe that it can be of any significant value in relation to other sectors of the economy.

One commenter notes that the Boeing 747, the original jumbo jet, is still in service and production. More importantly, however, is that the United States is exploiting its overinvestment in defense spending to dominate the market for foreign military sales. I don’t have the most recent figures at hand but this Marketwatch report from June 2009 — subtitled “Fighter jets, helicopters fill a void left by flagging commercial demand” — seems close enough:

The Lockheed Martin F-16 Fighting Falcon is a case in point. Probably the most popular Western-built jet fighter in the world, with more than 4,000 in operation, the jet first entered service more than 30 years ago. The Teal Group, an independent aerospace research firm, forecast the fighter jet market will grow about 34% over the next nine years. Jet makers are projected to sell 2,909 fighters for $163.7 billion between 2008 and 2017, compared with 2,355 sold between 1998 and 2007 for $122.4 billion, after adjusting for inflation. “This is a strong market,” said Richard Aboulafia, an analyst with teal. “The past three years all saw deliveries above $15 billion per year…a strong recovery form the doldrums of 1995 to 2004, when annual deliveries averaged $10 billion.” It’s also a market set to be dominated by just a couple of key players: Lockheed Martin and its next-generation F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, and the Russian Sukhoi Su-27/30, a lower-cost fighter. Earlier this week, Lockheed said it expects to sell about 1,000 to 2,000 stealthy F-35s to Israel, Singapore and Spain, as well as Japan, Finland and South Korea. And that doesn’t include the more than 3,100 F-35s slated for the U.S. and the nine partnership countries that helped develop the plane. Also in the running is Boeing Co.’s F-18 Super Hornet jet, popular with the U.S. navy for its carrier capability, and the F-15 Eagle. But the plane’s last deliveries are estimated to occur in 2016, according to data provided by Teal. Meanwhile, the Eurofighter 2000 jet, being built by Alenia Aeronautica, BAE Systems and the European Aeronautic Defence & Space Co., is getting elbowed out of the race by the F-35. “Unless some kind of counterweight to the F-35 emerges, everyone other than Lockheed Martin and Sukhoi will either have moved on to different types of defense work, be a fighter subcontractor, or merely be on borrowed time,” Aboulafia said. […] There is some hope for Boeing, with big contracts up for grabs out of India, Brazil and Switzerland. Meanwhile, the U.S. and its allies may order more F-15 and F-18 jets to fill in gaps ahead of F-35 deliveries. Boeing Integrated Defense Systems’ vice president of international strategy, Jeff Kohler, said in an interview that he believed the company could easily sell around 200 to 250 F-15 jets over the next several years, and at least 250 of the F-18. He’s also seeing interest from several overseas buyers for the V-22 Osprey, a tilt-rotor aircraft capable of vertical takeoff and landing.

There’s much more in the piece, including a long discussion of the helicopter market.

There are some serious European players in the competition but the older American companies remain dominant. And the fact that the United States military has large fleets of these aircraft and has proven their capability in active combat operations is surely a key reason.

To be sure, gaining an edge in competition for sales of military equipment is a poor justification for massive defense spending. But it is nonetheless one small benefit.

Airbus’s A350XWB takes wing - Asian Aviation,"Mon, 28 Feb 2011 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vYXNpYW5hdmlhdGlvbi5jb20vYWlyYnVzcy1hMzUweHdiLXRha2VzLXdpbmcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Airbus A350 twin-aisle twinjet development programme took wing for the first time last September, when flying began with a carbon fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP) fuselage panel fitted to an A340 test aircraft.

The European manufacturer intends to use CFRP panels extensively in the A350’s fuselage structure, in place of conventional aluminium-alloy materials. The company’s factory in Nantes, France, produced the panel, which was flown for three weeks in tests to assess the material’s acoustic characteristics under pressurised conditions. Once full flight-testing of the A350 begins, five aircraft are scheduled to take part in the 2,600-hour programme.

Marketed as the A350 XWB (standing for “extra-wide body”), the jetliner is to be available in at least three variants, with 250 to 400-plus seats, that will be aimed at a predicted market for 6,240 twin-aisle aircraft over the next two decades. Airbus, which currently serves the widebody jetliner segment with its A330 twinjet and four-engined A340, values the market at US$1.34 trillion.

By the beginning of this year, Airbus had taken firm orders from 36 customers for some 583 A350s, including 63 during 2010. In the greater Asia region, these clients include AirAsia X (which has ordered ten aircraft), Air China (another ten), Asiana Airlines (30), Bangkok Airways (four), Cathay Pacific (30), China Airlines (14), Hawaiian Airlines (six), Hong Kong Airlines (15), Kingfisher Airlines (five), Singapore Airlines (20), and Vietnam Airlines (ten).

Three variants

The A350 family will comprise the -800, -900, and -1000 variants, offering ranges of up to 8,500 nautical miles. The A350-800 will be a ‘shrunk’ version of the larger -900, accommodating 270 passengers in a typical three-class layout, while the A350-900 and A350-1000 will seat 314 and 350 passengers, respectively. Each model can be configured in a high-density layout with as many as 440 seats.

Airbus says A350 passenger cabins offer more headroom, wider windows, and larger overhead storage space than current competitors. The 220-inch internal cross-section provides “the widest seats in its category”, the manufacturer claims. The cabin interior is only slightly smaller than the 222-inch external diameter of all previous Airbus widebodies, a size the manufacturer has always regarded as having been a “magic” dimension.

Design of the baseline A350-900 was frozen in December 2008 and Airbus is planning for entry-into-service with Qatar Airways in 2013. The smaller -800 is to enter service in 2014, a year ahead of the A350-1000 flagship. With the -900 taking most of the manufacturer’s attention, the planned mid-2010 timing for A350-1000 design freeze has slipped and detail design is now set for completion by the end of this year.

Although the Airbus website’s A350 airport-compatibility information still referred in February to the first example of the new aircraft being “produced in July 2011”, the company has conceded that final assembly will not begin now until the end of the year. Even so, Airbus officials continue to discuss a nine-month assembly and test period and a first flight in mid- 2012. Assembly of “main components” will start in the middle of 2011, Chief Operating Officer Fabrice Bregier says.

Meanwhile, the manufacturer expects this year to begin wing assembly in the UK, start flight trials with a Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engine mounted on an A380 test-bed, and commence A350 systems testing on the company’s ‘Iron Bird’ ground-test rig in Toulouse. Airbus intends that the A350 family will provide a 25 percent reduction in fuel-consumption compared with current long-range competition.

Structural composition

About 70 percent of the A350 airframe will constitute composite material structures, titanium, and advanced aluminium alloys. Composites alone will account for about 53 percent.

As well as improved efficiency, the CFRP-panelled fuselage is expected to offer easier maintenance. Many of the panels and other CFRP components being manufactured by Airbus’s first- and second-tier partners use Cetex CF laminates supplied by TenCate Advanced Composites Europe, part of the Royal TenCate aerospace composites business.

The latest A350 development update, released in January, says some 13,000 engineers are engaged in the programme, about half of them with suppliers and partners, and Airbus expects its in-house A350 workforce to peak at about 12,000. Selection of industrial suppliers is complete and major parts are now being manufactured and prepared for transport to Toulouse for final assembly.

Recent programme highlights include completion of the initial 64.6ft centre-fuselage “crown” panel at Spirit AeroSystems in the USA and curing of forward-section crown panels at Premium Aerotec in Germany. In January, the European Commission authorised a 129 million euro (US$174 million) reimbursable loan to Spain’s Aernnova to develop the A350’s tailplane.

Last November, Airbus began construction of the first 18ft CFRP rear-fuselage ‘Section 19’ barrel in Spain, where production of the first flyable lower wing skin (or “cover” in Airbus parlance) began almost simultaneously. Other recent work starts include that of the upper wing cover in Germany, assembly of the first centre wingbox, and production of the first keel beam in France. In the UK, the landing-gear systems test facility has opened and hydraulic pressurisation of the Iron Bird took place at the end of December.

To support its aim for a high level of maturity at service entry, Airbus is using component demonstrators as it moves from the “virtual” world of the A350 digital mock-up (DMU) to the reality of manufacture. For the first time, Airbus has built a full-scale cabin and fuselage mock-up, on which suppliers and partners can test and optimise systems installation.

A three-part, full-scale CFRP fuselage section that includes a composite door is being used to confirm manufacturing and assembly techniques for the material, as well as fatigue and damage tolerance properties. For systems ground-testing, Airbus has begun to install functional integration benches at a site near Toulouse. Electro-mechanical systems, hydraulic, and wiring tests under static and real flight conditions will be performed on the ‘Aircraft 0’ integration simulator.

The manufacturer has refined programme management to enhance decision-making and improve transparency as manufacturing and assembly begin. The move is seen as enabling Airbus and its suppliers to work more closely as the A350 moves out of the design phase, permitting faster decisions on engineering, manufacturing, and procurement matters.

In-service target

The virtual-to-real transition contributed to the A350 entry-into-service being postponed from mid-2013 to an unspecified date later in the year. Airbus has established a supplier-development process in its procurement department and reportedly has created a “head of A350 operation” position to manage those programme elements not being out-sourced. The function is to ensure parts and assemblies come together in final assembly punctually at the right cost and with the intended quality.

Related to the revised in-service target date is a decision to begin final assembly of the first A350 (MSN001) at the end of 2011, rather than in mid-year as previously planned – a move intended to ensure the new aircraft does not suffer any A380-like delays.

Initially, the programme schedule had included buffers that enabled Airbus to say, almost a year ago, that deliveries would remain unchanged even though the A350-900 schedule had slipped by three months. The machining of certain parts – and, by extension, the beginning of final assembly – was delayed after some detail design work had required more time to be devoted to validation of the finite element model.

Metal cutting began 12 months ago, with machining of the horizontal cruciform that had been scheduled for November 2009, and which held up centre wingbox assembly. A cautious Airbus had wanted to assign sufficient time to understand the implications of working with CFRP, particularly in airframe sizing, electric structural network, and damage tolerance and the wing-root joint.

At the beginning of this year, German supplier Premium Aerotec began machining of the first A350 aluminium-floor beam using high-speed tools introduced for the purpose. The company has invested in other equipment for the production and processing of the A350’s CFRP fuselage shells.

This followed the airframe manufacturer’s initiation of CFRP barrel manufacture in Spain in late 2010. This tapering, 18ft-long rear-fuselage section is distinct from other A350 body sections in being produced using a carbon fibre-placement process rather than being constructed with long, CFRP skin panels.

Also about three months ago, Airbus subsidiary and partner Aerolia began production of CFRP fuselage and shell panels for the A350 nose section at a new composite-materials unit in France. The site comprises five manufacturing areas: a ‘clean’ room for composite lay-up, an autoclave, panel trimming facility, and ultrasonic non-destructive testing section. Three paint booths feed panels to assembly lines, where robot stations attach clips and frames.

In late 2010, manufacture was under way on the centre wing box, upper and lower wing covers, and a landing-gear test facility had been opened.

Extended enterprise

Airbus claims that its “extended enterprise” approach to project partnerships enabled “key” suppliers to be committed to the A350 up to a year earlier than on previous programmes, with larger work packages having been contracted from fewer first-tier providers.

“The implementation of common processes, methods, and tools – including a single, integrated three-dimensional digital mock-up and a unified planning ‘tool’ – are resulting in more- efficient information-sharing,” the company says.

In February, Magellan Aerospace added a ten-year, US$20 million agreement to provide A350 crown fittings to an existing contract for centre wing box and pylon secondary-structure work. The new business covers machining, treatment, and delivery of 800 ship-sets of machined aluminium-lithium detail components, starting in April.

Involvement in the A350 has stimulated some suppliers and partners to invest in manufacturing capacity. For example, after acquiring Airbus’s former UK aerostructures business at Filton and following its selection to make A350 rear spars, GKN Aerospace has committed almost US$200 million to developing a “centre of excellence” (see box).

In attempts to ease Chinese market access, the manufacturer has placed 5 percent of its A350 airframe work in China. Airbus China president Laurence Barron points out that government and airline officials have been following the country’s 2011-2015 five-year plan, the period during which initial Chinese A350 deliveries fall – making orders more difficult to obtain. He says the backlog of almost 600 aircraft on order means prospective owners must wait a long time and “that makes it more difficult here in China”.

Six months ago, Airbus appointed China’s CAC Commercial Aircraft Company (CCAC) to manufacture A350 wing spoilers and leading-edge “droop” panels, largely of CFRP, an arrangement that completed the planned work allocation to the country. Related design work will be performed by the Airbus (Beijing) Engineering Centre joint venture, with Austrian composites specialist FCC charged with defining the industrial process. The spoiler’s centre hinge fitting will be manufactured using resin transfer moulding, a process Airbus describes as “innovative”.

Goodrich has been contracted to design, test, manufacture, and support the A350-1000’s main landing gear, while that for the smaller -800 and -900 variants is being developed by Messier-Bugatti. The higher-weight A350-1000 will sport six-wheel main bogies, while four-wheel units equip the other models. The US company says the business is worth more than US$2 billion over the life of the programme.

In addition, Goodrich is providing – for all three A350 variants – engine nacelles and thrust reversers, landing-gear wheels and brakes, air-data and ice-detection systems, external video equipment, and cabin-attendant seats. Last November, it announced shipment of the first thrust reverser for ground tests on a Trent XWB, initially at Rolls-Royce in the UK and later at the John C Stennis Space Centre in Mississippi.

The nacelle and thrust-reverser work, provided under a 2005 20-year contract, is valued at US$6 billion. “We went from engineering release to shipping hardware within 12 months,” says Tom Donnelly, Goodrich Aerostructures’ vice-president for Airbus business programmes.

Emirates requirement

A call by Arab carrier Emirates for improved A350-1000 payload-range performance is seen as a possible opportunity for General Electric to offer an engine to compete against the Rolls-Royce Trent XWB, a situation Airbus has said it would welcome.

Emirates, which included 20 A350-1000s in its order for 70 aircraft, would like to fly the 350-passenger model, with a near-100,000lb payload, year-round between Dubai and Los Angeles – a service currently operated using Boeing 777-200LRs.

The Gulf operator believes a 100,000-105,000lb-thrust GE90, possibly a derated variant of the Boeing 777’s GE90-115, would permit Airbus to meet the airline’s requirement, which otherwise could be satisfied by an upgraded 777 variant. It is thought that enhancing the 92,000lb-thrust Trent XWB could require a new engine core.

Ironically, GE was the original sole engine supplier for the original A330-derived A350 but did not compete against the UK powerplant manufacturer when Airbus re-launched the planned aircraft as a new, wider-cabined design. Now, the US engine company remains to be convinced of the business case for the A350-1000 – which accounts for only 75 of the 583 A350 orders to date – and is reluctant to make the large investment needed to create a new engine to power all three A350 variants.

GKN invests in A350 parts production

Involvement in the A350 has stimulated some suppliers and partners to invest in new manufacturing capacity. For example, after acquiring Airbus’s former UK aerostructures business at Filton and being selected to make A350 rear spars, GKN Aerospace has committed almost US$200 million to developing a manufacturing ‘Centre of Excellence’.

Participation in the Airbus A350 programme as the rear-spar supplier has enabled GKN Aerospace to establish itself as a manufacturer of large, fully integrated airframe sections. The contract requires GKN to design, integrate, and supply spars and related assemblies, which it began to do early last year after having produced prototype spars for the aircraft’s centre wing box demonstrator in 2009.

GKN will manufacture the near 100ft-long rear spars in three sections, to which it will attach the frames, rib posts, landing-gear fittings, and other accessories. Under the partnership, GKN is using Airbus procedures and design tools to carry out stress analysis of the rear spar and trailing-edge assembly.

GKN derives the main loads being transmitted from the wing panels, landing gear, and fuel tanks into the spar from a finite-element model of the A350 wing. Having inherited the former Airbus UK aerostructures business, it has now set up automated “moving-line” assembly of trailing-edge and landing-gear parts on to the spar.

Airbus has specified that it wants the supplier to use automated fibre placement (AFP) machines in manufacturing, so GKN’s first prototype parts came from such a machine before the equipment left its manufacturer in Spain. GKN will eventually have five AFP machines in the UK, enough capacity to provide Airbus with ten ship sets per month when A350 production is in full swing.

At the 2010 Farnborough Air Show, GKN announced two further A350 contracts to produce composite parts for inboard and outboard flaps at its German factory. The company says the first flap components will be delivered in the early part of this year."

The Etihad Airways aircraft took off from Abu Dhabi for a celebratory flight across the United Arab Emirates, with a group of special needs children from Zayed Higher Organization for Humanitarian Care and Special Needs, taking in some of the country's top landmarks.



Key partners of the initiative, which aims to enhance the emirate's position as a leading tourism and MICE (meetings, incentive travel, conferences and exhibitions) destination, including the Abu Dhabi Tourism Authority, and Abu Dhabi media representatives, were also on board.



Etihad Airways' chief commercial officer, Peter Baumgartner, who hosted the flight, delivered a message to guests about the importance of the campaign to Etihad and Abu Dhabi, and highlighted the many sophisticated business and leisure attractions that Abu Dhabi now offers.



The unveiling of the three-class A330-300 aircraft, which features the airline's new Diamond First Class cabin and which will fly to London, Geneva, Frankfurt, Paris and Mumbai as part of the Essential Abu Dhabi campaign, is just the start of a number of high profile promotional activities planned in the coming months.



Peter Baumgartner said: ""The unveiling of this new aircraft livery with our message to the world to come and Visit Abu Dhabi further underlines our commitment to the growth and awareness of Abu Dhabi, not only as a tourist destination but as a place to do business in a dynamic and friendly environment.



""Since we launched the Essential Abu Dhabi marketing campaign with our partners, we have seen a tremendous amount of excitement and interest from people right across the globe, as well as with local audiences.""



The initiative, which for the first time brings together all of Abu Dhabi's major tourism operators, is designed to promote the very best the UAE's capital has to offer through a wide range of deals in its hotels, dining outlets, shops, adventure parks, cultural attractions and sports facilities.



Using the 'Pass to the Magic', an Etihad Airways boarding pass, visitors - both tourists and business travellers alike - are enticed to spend time in the emirate to enjoy the impressive array of free or discount offers available through the various 'Essential Abu Dhabi' partners.



The website provides dedicated pages for hotels, restaurants, Yas Island, entertainment, shopping, arts and culture, adventures and golf, while an 'Essential Abu Dhabi' on-board brochure is available for passengers to pick and choose from.



""We wanted to provide a convenient 'one stop shop' that will serve as both a directory for the city whilst providing exclusive offers on a range of products and services for our visitors.""



To take advantage of the offers, visitors on flights to Abu Dhabi simply present their Etihad boarding card at participating outlets to redeem the offers within seven days of arriving into the city.



About Etihad:

Etihad Airways is the National Airline of the United Arab Emirates. The airline was set up by a Royal Decree in July 2003, with Abu Dhabi, the capital of the UAE, as its hub. Etihad started commercial operations in November 2003.

"PM, MacKay in 2-year tussle over Airbus paint - CBC.ca","Mon, 14 Feb 2011 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9uZXdzL2NhbmFkYS9wbS1tYWNrYXktaW4tMi15ZWFyLXR1c3NsZS1vdmVyLWFpcmJ1cy1wYWludC0xLjEwNzIyODLSASBodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYmMuY2EvYW1wLzEuMTA3MjI4Mg?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Prime Minister Stephen Harper has been locked in a lengthy tug of war with his defence minister over the future of the military's VIP Airbus, newly disclosed documents show.

Prime Minister Stephen Harper and Defence Minister Peter McKay disagree over the colour of the military's VIP Airbus. ((Adrian Wyld/Canadian Press))

Peter MacKay has repeatedly rejected requests from the prime minister's staff to have the Airbus painted a civilian white and red instead of its current military grey.

MacKay and senior officers argue that the white colour scheme would be too visible whenever the passenger jet is sent on troop and cargo missions to risky locales, as happens now when the aircraft is not needed by the prime minister or the Governor General.

Senior government officials say no final decision has been made.

But internal emails indicate the Privy Council Office — Harper's own department — ordered the military last September to arrange for the new paint job at the next scheduled maintenance.

Documents outlining the two-year tussle over the VIP plane were obtained by The Canadian Press under the Access to Information Act.

PMO repeatedly rebuffed

Since early 2009, the Prime Minister's Office has been raising the possibility of a civilian paint scheme with the minister of defence or directly with the military — only to be rebuffed repeatedly.

""As a result of the multi-role nature of this aircraft, which includes the transporting of Canadian Forces personnel and equipment into areas of operations, it has been painted in a colour scheme appropriate for those tasks,"" MacKay wrote in June 2009, dismissing the suggestion.

The repainting proposal originated early in 2009 with someone in close contact with the Prime Minister's Office and whose identity is withheld in the released documents.

In August 2009, MacKay repeated his initial opposition.

""I am confident that the current policies that govern Department of National Defence decisions regarding colour scheme and markings of all Canadian Forces aircraft ensure consideration of the many and varied missions and are made in the best interests of all those missions,"" he said in a terse email.

""These aircraft reflect our nation's commitment to ensuring that we provide our Canadian Forces personnel with the greatest possible support and advantage when we ask them to do the most demanding of operational missions.""

No decision taken: Privy Council

A spokesman for the Privy Council Office says the proposed paint job is still under discussion.

""No decision has been taken on this,"" said Raymond Rivet.

But a military email from last September suggests otherwise.

""PCO has received direction to proceed with the painting of Airbus 001 in its white configuration,"" a senior military officer reported to air force brass on Sept. 13.

The decision ""to have an Airbus permanently configured for VIP use in a colour other than the standard grey would have an impact both financially and on operations as essentially it would leave you with one less air resource,"" another officer wrote about the plan.

Apparent end run around minister

The Privy Council Office appeared to have made an end run around MacKay early last year, asking the military directly about a new paint job for the twin-engine aircraft, also known as a Polaris CC150.

'Like a zombie in a B movie, this issue won't stay down.' — Officer, Canadian air force

Gen. Walter Natynczyk, chief of defence staff, sent a briefing note to MacKay in February last year to alert him to the fresh request, more than six months after the minister had already twice rejected the idea.

""A member of the PCO staff has again asked if CC150001 can be designated a VIP-only AC (aircraft) and be repainted in the GoC (Government of Canada) colours by June,"" says another internal document.

The staff were asking for a new paint job to be completed by June 10 last year, apparently to spruce up the aircraft in time for the G8 and G20 summits later that month in Huntsville, Ont., and Toronto.

MacKay's office again rejected the request, on April 15 last year, but the prime minister's staff persisted.

Issue won't die

Air force officers chafed at the relentless stream of requests coming from the Privy Council Office, the email trail shows.

""Like a zombie in a B movie, this issue won't stay down,"" one officer wrote last April.

A series of drawings was created showing the proposed paint job, and a senior bureaucrat at Treasury Board was asked to comment on whether the new markings conformed to the federal ""identity"" program.

In the end the prime minister's staff had their way, though they compromised by requiring the new paint job only at the next scheduled maintenance of the VIP aircraft in 2012, the emails indicate. The delay was to help keep costs down.

A one-page briefing note on the issue, prepared for Harper last April, was requested under the Access to Information Act but was entirely censored by the Privy Council Office for security reasons and because it contained advice.

The VIP Airbus has long been a political hot potato.

The air force owns five Airbus 310 transports, one of which is configured on the inside for VIPs. The front section features a self-contained apartment with shower, bed and parlour, though the facilities are utilitarian and not at all luxurious. More than half the interior has regular passenger seating.

The aircraft was outfitted under the Conservative government of Brian Mulroney and dubbed a flying Taj Mahal by then-Liberal leader Jean Chrétien, who won the 1993 election. Chrétien avoided flying in the aircraft during his decade as prime minister."
Airbus Verus Boeing: Twitter & Ads on the Tanker and Subsidies - Airline Reporter,"Tue, 22 Feb 2011 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAxMS8wMi9haXJidXMtdmVydXMtYm9laW5nLXR3aXR0ZXItYWRzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"For quite sometime the tension between Boeing and Airbus over the tanker deal and subsidies has created tension. More recently, it seems maybe they are going too far on Twitter, advertisements and comments made.

With Boeing (@Boeing & @BoeingAirplanes) and Airbus (@AirbusInTheUS) recently getting on Twitter, it has become interesting seeing some of the volleys that go back and forth between the companies. Things have been pretty friendly, until news on subsidies surfaced.

I really don’t feel like hashing out all the subsidy stuff, but the bottom line is Boeing accused Airbus of taking illegal subsidies. The World Trade Organization (WTO) found that Airbus took $20billion in illegal subsidies. Boeing has come out pretty saying, “we told you so” (that’s a paraphrase). Then it became Airbus’ turn and now they are stating that the WTO has found Boeing also took illegal subsidies. There is a lot more going on, so if you aren’t up to date, check out Flight Global’s WTO page.

Airbus released the findings on January 31st and during the day they produced nine Tweets talking about the WTO findings and in many, talking directly to Boeing. For example (help with Twitter lingo):

@AirbusInTheUS: “Confused by #Boeing claims that WTO found Airbus got $20B in illegal subsidies? Us too. Here’s the report. http://ow.ly/3NExm No such #’s.”



Okay, I can see one, but nine Tweets? It seemed to be a little much for me. I see Twitter as a way for companies to relate to their customers, not a place to complain directly about a competitor. Sure, if you are Tweeting for yourself, not a company, complain away, but representing a company is something different. You don’t see United Airlines calling out Delta Air Lines on Twitter — it is kept professional as it should.

Boeing also talked about the WTO reports, but were not directly talking to Airbus. Boeing’s approach seems very different to me. Here is an example of Boeing’s tweet on January 31st:

@Boeing: “#Boeing statement on #WTO decision reports http://bit.ly/gRUgXM #Airbus,” and “Video: #Boeing trade expert discusses #WTO www.boeing.com/wto”

I understand that Airbus might have some built up frustration. Not only did Boeing accuse them of getting subsidies and they find Boeing did too, but there is a lot of emotion around the US military tanker deal. The tanker deal has been plagued with delays, decision changes and some pretty messed up situations.

Boeing placed an ad in DC-area newspapers about the subsidies and tweeted it on February 3rd. That Tweet, caused Airbus to respond with two Tweets arguing that the ad was misleading (Tweet1 and 2). But Airbus didn’t stop there. They took Boeing’s ad and made some edits and placed their revised ad in a newsletter targeting the folks on Capital Hill in Washington, DC (see photo with this blog). It seems like Airbus’ edits bring up some interesting points and questions.

In a way, Boeing has an advantage since they have three separate Twitter accounts (their third is on defense). I think this separation was wise. The @BoeingAirplanes has been the more light and “fun” account, connecting with Boeing fans and direct customers. The other two are able to take the brunt of the controversy and have more of a serious tone. Since Airbus only has one feed, it can be difficult to read a serious tweet one second, then the next learning how many ping pong balls can fit into an A380 (by the way, it is 35million). Boeing has also been in the defense business much longer than EADS (the parent company of Airbus). Boeing has been able to learn the ins and outs of defense communications and even has had a lead with social media.

Although Twitter for the two has seemed to calm down, both airline manufactures are still participating in public conflict . EADS North America Chairman Ralph Crosby Jr. recently stated he feels that Boeing cares more about winning the tanker than American troops getting the best product. ’œOur campaign has been based on enabling the understanding of the superior capabilities and value of our system under the rules that are established. And what I see in terms of advertisement and sort of third-party and paid surrogate statements is that, well, whatever (Boeing executives) do, they may or may not win, but they sure want to keep us from winning and, frankly, from my perspective, if that’s anybody’s approach then I think it’s irresponsible to the warfighters.’

Boeing tanker spokesman Bill Barksdale responded by saying, ’œRather than take shots at our European competitor, the Boeing Company continues to focus on being ready to build tankers if we’re honored with a selection and contract award. The selfless men and women of America’s Air Force deserve no less.’

I know there are a lot of complexities and politics involved with this deal, but it seems to me that both companies are spending too much time concerned about insulting the other. That time, effort and money might be used more wisely to work on their own airplane programs.

I think both companies are still in the learning phases of social media. I just hope that whichever company loses the final contract for the tanker can graciously admit defeat and wish the winner the best of luck. I know in the “real” world, that might be too much to ask, but I think in social media, anything is possible.

Air Force Chooses the Boeing 767 (KC-46A) as Next Tanker - Airline Reporter,"Thu, 24 Feb 2011 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAxMS8wMi9icmVha2luZy1haXItZm9yY2VzLWNob29zZXMtdGhlLWJvZWluZy03NjctYXMtbmV4dC10YW5rZXIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The United States Air Force has announced today that they have granted the tanker contract to Boeing and their 767 aircraft, which will be called the KC-46A. The Air Force is asking Boeing to deliver the first 18 aircraft by 2017.

This has been a heated battle between Boeing and EADS (the parent company of Airbus) for the contract worth $35billion dollars and 179 airplanes. Currently the Air Force has about 400 KC-135s currently used as tankers.Back in 2008, the Air Force initially gave the deal to EADS and their partner at the time Northrop Grumman. Since there were complaints about the bidding process, the whole process had to be started over again.

The Boeing 767 will be built in Everett, WA and modified for tanker duty in Wichita, KA. Washington representative Norm Dicks told Glenn Farely of KING5, “I am so excited that we finally won this after three go-arounds. It’s just the most important victory for Boeing, for the workers of our state.”

Although the decision has been made, it can still be appealed. At this point, I hope it does not get appealed so our troops can start getting new aircraft.

Japanese low-cost carrier to fly 10 Airbus A320s - Times of Malta,"Tue, 15 Feb 2011 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vdGltZXNvZm1hbHRhLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2phcGFuZXNlLWxvdy1jb3N0LWNhcnJpZXItdG8tZmx5LTEwLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzIwcy4zNTA0OTnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"All Nippon Airways’ low-cost carrier will fly 10 leased Airbus A320 aircraft when it starts operating, the European plane maker said, hailing the victory in a market dominated by US rival Boeing.

The announcement comes after Japan’s low-fare Skymark Airlines in November said it would buy four Airbus A380 superjumbos, with an option to buy two more, as it plans to launch international routes in a deal worth $2.8 billion.

“This is a further breakthrough for Airbus in the Japanese market in just three months,” said John Leahy, Airbus chief operating officer customers, in a statement. Joint venture A&F Aviation was established by ANA and Hong Kong’s First Eastern Investment Group with the aim of launching a low-cost airline in the second half of the fiscal year starting this April from Kansai airport in western Japan.

The 10 A320s will be leased from GE Capital Aviation Services, a division of General Electric, and will seat 180 passengers, Airbus said.

ANA is the inaugural customer for Boeing’s high-tech but much delayed 787 Dreamliner, with 55 aircraft due to be delivered in the third quarter of this year.

Airbus to join Qantas case - Sydney Morning Herald,"Wed, 02 Feb 2011 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNtaC5jb20uYXUvYnVzaW5lc3MvYWlyYnVzLXRvLWpvaW4tcWFudGFzLWNhc2UtMjAxMTAyMDEtMWFjZTcuaHRtbNIBTmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnNtaC5jb20uYXUvYnVzaW5lc3MvYWlyYnVzLXRvLWpvaW4tcWFudGFzLWNhc2UtMjAxMTAyMDEtMWFjZTcuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"AIRBUS is poised to intervene in Qantas's legal action against Rolls-Royce for damages arising from a mid-air engine explosion involving an A380 aircraft.

The maker of the superjumbo has filed two affidavits and been granted leave by Justice Steven Rares to file a motion in the Federal Court in Sydney today. It is understood Airbus will ask the court to keep secret its contracts with Qantas.

Qantas launched the claim in December against Rolls-Royce, the maker of the Trent 900 engines on the A380s, to try to stymie any bid to shift the matter to British courts if talks over a commercial settlement break down. Rolls-Royce's lawyers have failed to attend hearings.

All but one of the flagship aircraft returned to service last month. They were grounded after the emergency on November 4. Analysts estimate the grounding could cost the airline up to $207 million - $70 million in repairs and $137 million in lost revenue.

Qantas claims written advice from Rolls-Royce in 2000 and 2001 was ''misleading or deceptive''. It was told the Trent 900s would not have to be replaced ''at any point before the end of the projected useful engine life''."
Skymark Airlines signs for six Airbus A380s - Times of Malta,"Sun, 20 Feb 2011 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vdGltZXNvZm1hbHRhLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy92aWV3L3NreW1hcmstYWlybGluZXMtc2lnbnMtZm9yLXNpeC1haXJidXMtYTM4MHMuMzUxMjI10gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Skymark Airlines said it had signed a firm contract to buy up to six Airbus A380 jetliners, making it the first Japanese carrier to purchase the double-decker super-jumbo aircraft.

Skymark is aiming to go head-to-head with Japan’s two dominant carriers – Japan Airlines (JAL) and All Nippon Airways (ANA) – and stunned the industry last year when it ordered the A380s at a cost of $2.8 billion. For Airbus, the deal gives the European firm a foothold in a market where US rival Boeing has long had a near-monopoly

“Skymark Airlines Inc. signed a firm contract with Airbus SAS for purchase of Airbus A380s on Thursday” in Toulouse, France, where Airbus is headquartered, the Japanese carrier said in a statement.

The airline ordered six A380s, including two on an optional basis, it said.

The first aircraft is scheduled for delivery in 2014 and will be deployed on international routes. The Japanese discount airline operator will use the six jetliners to operate its international passenger services linking Tokyo’s Narita airport and three destinations, New York, London and Frankfurt, scheduled around the fiscal year ending March 2015."
Fire extinguishers deployed on Singapore Airlines Airbus A380: smoking wiring - Executive Traveller,"Tue, 01 Feb 2011 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5leGVjdXRpdmV0cmF2ZWxsZXIuY29tL2ZpcmUtb24tYS1zaW5nYXBvcmUtYWlybGluZXMtYWlyYnVzLWEzODAtZnJvbS1ob25nLWtvbmctbm8taW5qdXJpZXMtYnV0LWV4dGluZ3Vpc2hlcnMtZGVwbG95ZWTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"UPDATE 3rd February | Singapore Airlines has issued an updated statement today. See our followup story: ""There was no fire"" on A380, Singapore Airlines insists.

A Singapore Airlines A380 crew set off an emergency fire extinguisher system after smoke was reported in a toilet on a flight from Hong Kong to Singapore.

The superjumbo, reported to be the eighth plane manufactured and Singapore's fourth aircraft, landed safely after the incident. There were no reports of injuries among passengers or crew. Scorched wiring was later discovered in the forward cargo hold of the A380.

Australian Business Traveller spoke to a Singapore Airlines spokesperson this afternoon, who told us:

""The crew of a Singapore Airlines Airbus A380 operating to Singapore from Hong Kong on 31 January reported smells of smoke in a lavatory while the aircraft was on its descent. As a precaution a halon extinguisher was discharged by the crew. The aircraft landed without incident at Singapore.""

The spokesperson continued: ""Ground crews later found signs of burns to electrical wiring in the forward cargo hold. Singapore Airlines and Airbus are currently carrying out an investigation.""

While not a serious emergency, Airbus and airlines must be concerned about the latest in a series of problems with the A380.

Qantas still has no schedule for repairing the A380 that was damaged when a Rolls-Royce engine exploded while taking off from Singapore last November. Qantas was only able to return the A380 to its trans-Pacific routes to Los Angeles from Sydney and Melbourne in January this year.

Major Airbus rival Boeing won't take much consolation in this, though: its own newest aircraft, the 787, had to be evacuated via the emergency slides in Laredo, Texas after an electrical panel caught on fire. The 787 fire forced the entire 787 test fleet to be grounded, with the last test plane returning to duty just yesterday."
South African Airways becomes Airbus A330 operator - defenceWeb,"Wed, 09 Feb 2011 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuY2V3ZWIuY28uemEvYWVyb3NwYWNlL2Flcm9zcGFjZS1hZXJvc3BhY2Uvc291dGgtYWZyaWNhbi1haXJ3YXlzLWJlY29tZXMtYWlyYnVzLWEzMzAtb3BlcmF0b3Iv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"South African Airways has become the latest operator of Airbus’ eco-efficient A330 family. The A330-200 is the first of six to be delivered to Aircastle Limited this year, all of which will be leased to South African Airways. President Jacob Zuma officially welcomed the arrival of the first airliner yesterday afternoon.

Seating 36 passengers in business class and 186 in economy, the aircraft will feature the latest in-flight entertainment and will be used primarily on long haul routes from the airline’s bases in Johannesburg and Cape Town. The new A330 will join South African Airlines existing Airbus fleet of 11 A319s, 14 A340-200/300s and 9 A340-600s enabling the airline to reap the benefits of Airbus’ unique cockpit and operational commonality.

This allows airlines to use the same pool of pilots, cabin crews and maintenance engineers, resulting in operational flexibility and significant cost savings. “With the new A330s South African Airways continues to modernise its fleet, ensuring we meet our customers’ expectations. Simultaneously, the new A330s will provide savings and efficiencies to support our profitability and growth strategies,” says SAA CE Siza Mzimela.

Zuma said the arrival was “set to change and improve the way we fly.” He said the lease marked “a bold leap forward by SAA to utilise advancements in technology to access markets and opportunities to destinations once deemed unreachable.”

The president added one of government’s priorities was to contribute to the development of a revived Africa. “Transport is a key instrument to keep us in touch with the continent, so as to boost people to people links and inter-Africa trade. Our democratic government has long called for our trade and industry sector to take advantages of the opportunities in the continent. We must explore the world too, especially the developing world and emerging economies, as there is a lot to be gained there too.

“By renewing its fleet, the national carrier is in a better position to advance our objectives as a developmental state, as well as those of playing a more meaningful role on the continent. Africa presents a great possibility for new ventures. As a leading economic force on this continent we must encourage other South African entities to forge ahead with investment into Africa.

“I would therefore like to congratulate the minister, the board and executive management of SAA, for bringing the Airbus A330-200 into our country, the first of which will enter the SAA fleet in the next few days. The national carrier will be a better position to offer its customers service of the highest value comparable to the best airlines in the world,” Zuma said.

SAA is not a newcomer to the A330 as the airline operated two A330-200s leased from British Midland (BMI) in 2002/2003 and another two A330-200s leased from Brazilian airline TAM in 2003/2004. They were used primarily on international flights.

“The A330-200, with its superior economics and proven passenger appeal, will fit seamlessly into the South African Airways fleet,” adds John Leahy, Airbus Chief Operating Officer Customers. “Airbus has a long history of partnership with South African Airways and the local industry, and we look forward to continuing to build this mutually beneficial relationship.” With a typical range capability of 7250 nautical miles (for a two-class configuration), he adds the A330-200 has the versatility to cover all ranges from short-haul to true long haul – ideal for point-to-point operations. A330 cabins are widely recognized as among the best in the sky, offering a bright atmosphere with the quietest cabins in their class.

The A330 is one of the most widely used widebody aircraft in service today, with one taking off each minute every day. To date, Airbus has won over 1100 orders for the different models of the aircraft. Some 750 A330s have already been delivered and the aircraft is currently flying with 90 operators worldwide in 50 countries.

The new aircraft forms part of the national carrier’s fleet renewal project with new, more efficient aircraft replacing old ones. The A330 deal was first announced in March last year following 2009’s Airbus-assisted profit turnaround at SAA and a resolution to a dispute between the two parties over the botched cancelling of 15 A320s. In 2009 SAA posted a R398 million net profit, up from a R1.085 billion loss in 2008 and losses the previous six years. Its 2010 it recorded a pre-tax profit of R595 million for the year to March. SAA will also receive 20 new Airbus A320s, worth $1 billion, between 2013 and 2015.

Aircastle yesterday said debt “financing for this purchase was arranged and provided by Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation and supported by a guarantee from Compagnie Francaise d’Assurance pour le Commerce Exterieur (COFACE), the French export credit agency. This debt bears interest at a rate of 3.78% per annum and will be repaid over twelve years.”

Ron Wainshal, CE at Aircastle, added his company is “building a significant relationship with SAA… These aircraft will provide the airline with significant improvements in fuel efficiency and operating costs and its passengers with a comfortable, state-of-the-art cabin.”"

Passengers flying on Air New Zealand's black Airbus A320 will be soon able to use their cellphones, but pay more for the privilege, the airline announced today.

The black-liveried Airbus A320 aircraft, which commences its first commercial flights today, will be fitted with new in-flight mobile technology which, within the next month, will enable the safe use of phones to make and receive phone calls, text messages and emails, during the cruise stage of flights.

The system, which will be available on the domestic A320 aircraft only, is designed so that passengers' cellphone signals are routed through an aircraft cell site.

The service is a deal with Vodafone New Zealand and OnAir.

Inflight roaming costs will apply; 80c per outbound text, $3.50 per minute to make a call, $2 per minute to receive a call and $20 per megabyte of data. Other mobile providers may have different rates for their customers.

"Student, MPs ask government to keep VIP plane grey - CTV News","Mon, 14 Feb 2011 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmN0dm5ld3MuY2Evc3R1ZGVudC1tcHMtYXNrLWdvdmVybm1lbnQtdG8ta2VlcC12aXAtcGxhbmUtZ3JleS0xLjYwNzYxMdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"OTTAWA - A Grade 9 student from Hamilton joined opposition parties in asking the prime minister to abandon any plan to repaint the government's VIP jet from military grey to civilian white and red.

Stephen Harper's staff have been pushing the new colour scheme for two years, but the air force resisted because the white colour would make the plane more visible in risky zones overseas.

The VIP Airbus, with a self-contained apartment as well as regular seating, is used to transport troops and supplies when the prime minister or Governor General aren't using it.

The Airbus 310 is one of five such planes the air force has used to ferry soldiers into Kandahar, Afghanistan, for example -- but only at night because none of the aircraft have self-defence systems.

Documents obtained by The Canadian Press show one of the strongest opponents of the new paint scheme has been Defence Minister Peter MacKay.

Ally Dunlop, a 14-year-old student at Hillfield Strathallan College in Hamilton, warns that the red colour -- found on many civilian passenger jets -- could result in more bird strikes.

Dunlop's recent science-fair experiment demonstrated that ducks, Canada geese and other wild birds are attracted to the colour red.

She placed seed tubs of five different colours in an area park, and found the feeding birds far preferred the red tubs.

""I then looked at the colour of logos of many airlines in North America,"" she said. ""It appears, without statistical analysis, that planes with red in their logo are more susceptible to bird strikes.""

""Peter MacKay is right, they should not paint the military's VIP airbus white and red!""

Opposition parties on Monday were more concerned about politics than birds.

""The prime minister's personal meddling is robbing the forces of a valuable air resource for his own personal vanity,"" Liberal MP Francis Valeriote said in the House of Commons.

""Will the prime minister drop his airplane makeover vanity project designed solely to enhance his image?"" the NDP's Jack Harris added.

Internal documents indicate the order to change the VIP Airbus colour was handed down last September, but MacKay said there's been no decision.

""There has been no decision taken with respect to the repainting of transport aircraft,"" he told the Commons.

""In fact, the repainting of military assets occurs on a regularly scheduled, established maintenance cycle. It is done when the operational tempo will not be affected.

""I can assure the honourable member and members present that we would never do anything that would interfere with the operations of the Canadian Forces or that would negatively impact it in any way."""
"PMO, Peter MacKay at odds over repainting VIP plane - CTV News","Sun, 13 Feb 2011 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmN0dm5ld3MuY2EvcG1vLXBldGVyLW1hY2theS1hdC1vZGRzLW92ZXItcmVwYWludGluZy12aXAtcGxhbmUtMS42MDcxNjjSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"OTTAWA - Prime Minister Stephen Harper has been locked in a lengthy tug of war with his defence minister over the future of the military's VIP Airbus, newly disclosed documents show.

Peter MacKay has repeatedly rejected requests from the prime minister's staff to have the Airbus painted a civilian white and red instead of its current military grey.

MacKay and senior officers argue that the white colour scheme would be too visible whenever the passenger jet is sent on troop and cargo missions to risky locales, as happens now when the aircraft is not needed by the prime minister or the Governor General.

Senior government officials say no final decision has been made. But internal emails indicate the Privy Council Office -- Harper's own department -- in fact ordered the military last September to arrange for the new paint job at the next scheduled maintenance.

Documents outlining the two-year tussle over the VIP plane were obtained by The Canadian Press under the Access to Information Act.

The air force owns five Airbus 310 transports, one of which is configured on the inside for VIPs. The front section features a self-contained apartment with shower, bed and parlour, though the facilities are utilitarian and not at all luxurious. More than half the interior has regular passenger seating.

Since early 2009, the Prime Minister's Office has been raising the possibility of a civilian paint scheme with the minister of defence or directly with the military -- only to be rebuffed repeatedly.

""As a result of the multi-role nature of this aircraft, which includes the transporting of Canadian Forces personnel and equipment into areas of operations, it has been painted in a colour scheme appropriate for those tasks,"" MacKay wrote in June 2009, dismissing the suggestion.

The repainting proposal originated early in 2009 by someone in close contact with the Prime Minister's Office, and whose identity is withheld in the released documents.

In August 2009, MacKay repeated his initial opposition.

""I am confident that the current policies that govern Department of National Defence decisions regarding colour scheme and markings of all Canadian Forces aircraft ensure consideration of the many and varied missions and are made in the best interests of all those missions,"" he said in a terse email.

""These aircraft reflect our nation's commitment to ensuring that we provide our Canadian Forces personnel with the greatest possible support and advantage when we ask them to do the most demanding of operational missions.""

A spokesman for the Privy Council Office says the proposed paint job is still under discussion.

""No decision has been taken on this,"" said Raymond Rivet. ""As is currently the case, the Canadian Forces will continue to use the plane in appropriate environments when it is not being used for VIP transportation purposes.""

But a military email from last September suggests otherwise.

""PCO has received direction to proceed with the painting of Airbus 001 in its white configuration,"" a senior military officer reported to air force brass on Sept. 13.

The decision ""to have an Airbus permanently configured for VIP use in a colour other than the standard grey would have an impact both financially and on operations as essentially it would leave you with one less air resource,"" another officer wrote about the plan.

The Privy Council Office appeared to have made an end run around MacKay early last year, asking the military directly about a new paint job for the twin-engine aircraft, also known as a Polaris CC150.

Gen. Walter Natynczyk, chief of defence staff, sent a briefing note to MacKay in February last year to alert him to the fresh request, more than six months after the minister had already twice rejected the idea.

""A member of the PCO staff has again asked if CC150001 can be designated a VIP-only AC (aircraft) and be repainted in the GoC (Government of Canada) colours by June,"" says another internal document.

The staff were asking for a new paint job to be completed by June 10 last year, apparently to spruce up the aircraft in time for the G8 and G20 summits later that month in Huntsville, Ont., and Toronto.

MacKay's office again rejected the request, on April 15 last year, but the prime minister's staff persisted.

Air Force officers chafed at the relentless stream of requests coming from the Privy Council Office, the email trail shows.

""Like a zombie in a B movie, this issue won't stay down,"" one officer wrote last April.

A series of drawings was created showing the proposed paint job, and a senior bureaucrat at Treasury Board was asked to comment on whether the new markings conformed to the federal ""identity"" program.

In the end the prime minister's staff had their way, though they compromised by requiring the new paint job only at the next scheduled maintenance of the VIP aircraft in 2012, the emails indicate. The delay was to help keep costs down.

A one-page briefing note on the issue, prepared for Harper last April, was requested under the Access to Information Act but was entirely censored by the Privy Council Office for security reasons and because it contained advice.

MacKay's repeated rejection of the repainting proposal, and the persistence of the prime minister's staff in reviving it, suggest bad blood with the defence minister, who was rumoured to be looking for other work last year after a separate run-in.

A spokesman for MacKay declined to answer specific questions about the Airbus tug of war, but said the minister supports Harper.

""He's proud to serve with a prime minister who values the incredible contributions of our soldiers, sailors, airmen and airwomen and appreciates everything the prime minister has done for the men and women in uniform,"" said Jay Paxton, director of communications.

Paxton also said the PMO never blind-sided MacKay on the paint job, noting that both sides ""worked closely together on this file to ensure an optimal solution was found. There was no end running.""

The VIP Airbus has long been a political hot potato. The aircraft was outfitted under the Conservative government of Brian Mulroney and dubbed a flying Taj Mahal by then-Liberal leader Jean Chretien, who won the 1993 election. Chretien avoiding flying in the aircraft during his decade as prime minister.

Two of the five CC-150 aircraft, based in Trenton, Ont., have been fitted as air-to-air refuelling tankers. The planes have been used to transport personnel and VIPs, including the Governor General, to such far-flung places as Pakistan and the Persian Gulf, as well as for domestic operations, such as fire-fighting near Kelowna, B.C.

The VIP Airbus, built in 1987-88 for the now defunct airline Wardair, is expected to be flying until at least 2026. The military says it's in excellent condition, with a solid service record. All of the Airbuses were purchased used between 1992 and 1993.

The VIP aircraft receives about 25 hours of maintenance for every hour it flies."
