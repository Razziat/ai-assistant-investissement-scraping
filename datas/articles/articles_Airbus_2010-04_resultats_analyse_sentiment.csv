Airbus workers to disrupt production in France - FRANCE 24 English,"Mon, 26 Apr 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyYW5jZTI0LmNvbS9lbi8yMDEwMDQyNi1haXJidXMtd29ya2Vycy1oYWx0LXByb2R1Y3Rpb24tZnJhbmNlLXN0cmlrZS11bmlvbi1hZXJvc3BhY2XSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"AEROSPACE

AFP - Airbus workers decided to disrupt plane production across France on Monday to press demands for better pay and new hires, union officials said.

Starting at noon, thousands of workers at the main Toulouse plant and in factories in Nantes and Saint-Nazaire in western France were to halt work on some assembly lines and block parts deliveries.

The protest action came amid tough negotiations over pay rises and resistance to moves to shift production to Germany.

""It is the first time that the five unions have mobilised together on the issue of salaries, work conditions and jobs,"" said Alain Milhau, from the CGT union.

Union officials said production of A330 and A340 long-haul planes would be disrupted on Monday and that rotating strikes would affect the A320 assembly lines on Tuesday before moving to the A380 on Wednesday.

In Toulouse, unions called on workers to block deliveries of plane parts on Monday and a full strike was planned for Friday.

Airbus workers downed tools for 90 minutes last Friday and vowed then to step up their action if no better offer from management was made.

Management is offering a 1.9 percent salary increase for 2010 but the unions are seeking 3.5 percent, a pay hike comparable to the 2009 level.

Unions argue production has suffered from the massive Power 8 restructuring plan in 2007 that led to 10,000 job cuts, and are calling for new hires.

Airbus has countered that it has added 1,700 employees to its payroll in 2009, half of whom work in France and that 1,500 more will be hired this year.

Worries among Airbus employees have been heightened with the recent decision to move production of the medium-haul A320 to Germany.

""The A320 programme is the company's lifeblood and while German workers have the right to earn a living, so do the French workers,"" said union official Jean-Francois Knepper.

""If Airbus wants to keep all of the ailing programmes in Toulouse, we can see that France will be getting that part of the industry that is doomed,"" he said.

Airbus plans A320 life-extension - Asian Aviation,"Sun, 11 Apr 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vYXNpYW5hdmlhdGlvbi5jb20vYWlyYnVzLXBsYW5zLWEzMjAtbGlmZS1leHRlbnNpb24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Having overseen reductions in required maintenance frequency for the A320 single-aisle twinjet family, Airbus is now working to understand the design’s ultimate service potential. The goal is to extend the type’s operational life beyond its nominal 48,000 flight cycles (FC) and 60,000 flight hours (FH).

“Customers’ in-service experience, along with [our] own fleet-monitoring data supports extending the service goal,” says ESG programme head Clemens Hermann.

More than 20 years after delivering the first A320, and with over 4,000 examples of the model and its variants in service, Airbus has analysed the type’s operational and maintenance experience and established an “extended service goal (ESG)” development programme that includes major full-scale fatigue tests.

If its targets are achieved, the programme will permit operators to fly their fleets for longer, increasing revenue and benefiting from enhanced residual value, according to the manufacturer. The move follows a general reduction in the frequency of regular in-service maintenance tasks, based on feedback from operators’ experience.

The 4,110-strong A320-family fleet includes about 50 variants and sub-variants of the basic design, including A318, A319, A320, A321 and Airbus Corporate Jet models powered variously by CFM International CFM56-5, International Aero Engines (IAE) V2500 or Pratt & Whitney (P&W) PW6000 turbofan engines. Under a common maintenance programme, principal maintenance tasks are governed by configuration (including service-bulletin and modification status), annual utilisation, and operator policy.

Airbus’s overall intention is to extend the scheduled maintenance programme up to 90,000FC and 180,000FH through two steps, dubbed “ESG1” and “ESG2”. The initial step, planned for introduction this year, is aimed at providing operators with a service goal of 60,000FC/120,000FH.

The manufacturer says the programme will “achieve a balanced development of [airframe] structural potential and optimised maintenance activities” for the A320 family. ESG1 development tests conducted at the company’s headquarters in Toulouse, France, and its German base in Munich have involved some 120,000 simulated flights, each characterised by monitored operational data that Airbus has collected from operators. These development tests have been followed in the ESG programme by detailed inspection, preparation, and decision phases.

Airbus has run four major fatigue tests as part of the overall A320 aircraft programme. These are focussed on the forward fuselage, engine pylon, rear fuselage, centre fuselage and wings. Subsequent testing, which simulates up to 180,000FC and 360,000FH and is planned to continue until next year, aims to validate the higher 90,000FC/180,000FH ESG2 service goal.

“These aircraft have impressive reliability,” says Clemens Hermann, Airbus’s A320-family life-extension programme project leader. “Customers’ in-service experience, along with [our] own fleet-monitoring data supports extending the service goal. A huge number of A320-family aircraft have experienced no major fatigue findings, [which] has encouraged Airbus to do these tests.”

A320s are subject to industry-standard MSG-3 provisions, under which historic ‘A’ and ‘C’ maintenance check intervals have become flexible. Tasks now carry FC, FH, or calendar-time maximum intervals that permit operators to optimise MRO planning, with the A- and C-check labels still used generically.

According to Airbus, A320 operators adjust maintenance intervals to suit their own schedules. For example, one has adopted a 20-month C-check cycle, distributing six-year tasks between 60- and 80-month checks to ensure maximum aircraft availability, while another operator uses 24- month C checks to save one heavy-maintenance shop visit every six years.

Good “in-service experience feedback” from operators has contributed to the introduction of extended A320 scheduled-task intervals that Airbus says have reduced maintenance costs by up to 70 percent since service entry in 1988. For example, FH intervals for C-check equivalent work have grown by a third, while the frequency of heavy-maintenance shop visits has fallen by half and the typical period between A-check equivalent jobs has increased by 70 percent.

Specifically, maintenance tasks scheduled in the original 350-FH A-check may now be performed at any time up to maximum intervals of 600 FH, 750 FC, or 100 days. Likewise, the 15-month C-check interval has become a 20-month, 6,000-FH, or 4,500-FC minimum frequency and permitted intervals between heavy checks have grown from four and eight years to six and 12 years.

A further 25 percent increase in A-check intervals (to 750 FH, 750 FC, or 120 days, or a combination) has been agreed by the A320 Industry Steering Committee (ISC), while airworthiness authorities – led by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) – have approved the Maintenance Review Board Report (MRBR) adopting the longer intervals, which now appear in the A320 maintenance-planning document.

The ISC launched “an evolution exercise” in 2009 under which it might extend C-check intervals by a further 20 percent this year. The resulting 24-month/7,500-FH/5,000-FC interval, if subsequently approved, would enable maintenance planners to synchronise such activity with the existing six- and 12-year heavy-check intervals.

In response to demand from operators in Asia, especially from low-cost carriers, Lufthansa Technik Philippines has established A320 maintenance capacity to accommodate two aircraft simultaneously. This work has begun with the provision of A and C checks for local customer Philippine Airlines.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9735366702079773}",neutral,0.9735366702079773,0
Airbus makes headway on A350 catalogue | News | Flight Global - Flightglobal,"Thu, 29 Apr 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYWlyYnVzLW1ha2VzLWhlYWR3YXktb24tYTM1MC1jYXRhbG9ndWUvOTMxNTYuYXJ0aWNsZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus's catalogue for the A350 XWB is taking shape, with the airframer having completed the selection on the majority of suppliers for its initial book.

""Most of the work packages for the cabin are on board and we are in the middle of the joint definition phase. Most of them are even being finalised so they start the detailed design by the end of this year,"" says head of A350 XWB product offering Alexander Herkner.

For supplier furnished equipment, such as lavatories and galleys, Airbus is taking a modular customisation approach. Galley inserts follow Arinc standards for flexibility and ease in exchanging equipment.

For in-flight entertainment and connectivity, the airframer is largely forgoing a traditional buyer furnished equipment (BFE) approach. Instead, it has designated an ""Airbus contracted supplier"" (ACS) category for these items to ensure suppliers participate in the joint definition phase of the programme and understand the design language of the cabin early on.

To date, Airbus has signed ACS deals with B/E Aerospace, Recaro and Zodiac Group unit Weber Aircraft for the provision of economy-class seats and with EADS Sogerma for premium-class seats.

""The initial offering should be three economy-class products and three business-class products,"" says Herkner, noting that the airframer ""intends to add two more products"" to the premium segment.

Additionally, he says, to offer ""more differentiation"" in the premium cabin, airlines are permitted to ""go for a classical BFE approach"". However, this can only be arranged with one of the ACS suppliers and is limited to premium seats.

For in-flight entertainment, airlines can choose hardware from Panasonic Avionics or Thales. An ACS agreement has already been signed with the former, and Herkner says a deal with Thales is being finalised.

Carriers that select Panasonic IFE hardware will be offered a choice of two in-flight connectivity solutions. The first comprises Panasonic's own connectivity platform for Ku-band satellite-based high-speed internet plus mobile connectivity courtesy of partner AeroMobile. The second entails Airbus's Airline Network Architecture version 2 (ALNA V2), a modular connectivity platform that uses the Inmarsat SwiftBroadband aeronautical service over L-band satellites and supports mobile connectivity and wi-fi services from Airbus/Sita joint venture OnAir.

Theoretically, says Herkner, additional in-flight entertainment and connectivity solutions could be offered in the future. He notes that Airbus is also looking for more standardisation on the integration of IFE into seats, and this can be optimised under the ACS process.

By employing a more modular approach in the cabin, and avoiding a lot of complex engineering work after an airline has placed its order, Airbus believes it can shave at least four months off the lead time that an airline needs to decide on customising its A350s.

On current programmes, airlines need to make catalogue choices about a year before delivery and then face a lot of engineering work. ""We want to shorten this time. We have a vision to go to something like eight months,"" says Herkner.

If airlines freeze their configurations at a later point, it also means less working capital for Airbus, adds A350 programme manager Didier Evrard.

The A350 is due to enter into service in mid-2013 with Qatar Airways.

B&H Airlines is never short of being confusing and events this week have only confirmed this even further. For the past few months the management at Bosnia and Herzegovina’s national carrier has claimed that the airline will receive 1 Boeing B737-700 this summer, to replace the Boeing B737-400. Now however, Government officials say that B&H will receive an Airbus A319.

During the week, Turkish Airlines and the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina signed an agreement which will see both sides fork out 8 million Covertable Marks (4 million Euros) for the national carrier. A Government official told the “Dnevni avaz” newspaper that the airline will receive a new aircraft during the summer season, most probably an Airbus A319. He also mentioned that the Bosnian Government gave an advance payment to Airbus years ago for the purchase of a new plane for B&H. However, the money is still with Airbus and further payments were never made. He hopes that this issue will also be resolved soon. No mention was made of Boeing.

The Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina last week also announced that B&H Airlines is 1 of 2 publicly owned companies to record financial losses in 2009 although it did not specify how big of a loss the airline recorded.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9943952560424805}",neutral,0.9943952560424805,0
Aircraft wing worker for the world - Reinforced Plastics,"Tue, 20 Apr 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlaW5mb3JjZWRwbGFzdGljcy5jb20vY29udGVudC9mZWF0dXJlcy9haXJjcmFmdC13aW5nLXdvcmtlci1mb3ItdGhlLXdvcmxkL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"GKN Aerospace is heavily involved in the manufacture of the composite wings for the new Airbus A350 aircraft. George Marsh visited the company's Filton, UK, site to see the composites technologies involved.

Boeing has established a new level of composites penetration in civil airliners with its 50% reinforced plastic B787 Dreamliner. However, Europe’s Airbus Industrie looks set to trump even this, albeit by a narrow margin, since its new A350 XWB (extra wide body), now in gestation, is advertised as being some 53% plastic. Practically all of the A350’s visible airframe – wings, fuselage, empennage, nacelles and control surfaces – will be very largely of carbon composite.

This is good news for the aerospace composites supply chain and good news for UK industry which, as long-time builder of Airbus wings, is to construct the extensively composite wings for all three variants of the A350, the -800, -900 and -1000. A major player in the wing build programme is GKN Aerospace, now installed on the site at Filton, near Bristol, that it acquired from Airbus in January 2009, with the aim of making it an acknowledged global centre for designing and building advanced wings for new-generation passenger jets.

Airbus was already building primarily metal wings for the full range of Airbus commercial aircraft in the UK. With the acquisition of the Airbus manufacturing operation at Filton, GKN Aerospace has inherited this work for the lives of the aircraft programmes concerned, and is adding the ability to produce composite wing assemblies.

Wing ambitions

GKN Aerospace needed new Europe-based facilities in order to achieve its wing ambitions. The chance to co-locate itself with Airbus UK (which retains the rest of the site) in a refurbished facility at Filton not only offered the space needed to assemble large A350 wing sections in parallel production streams able to turn out anything up to 14 aircraft sets per month, but also fitted in with its wider aim to produce wings for other new aircraft as well.

In line with the expected high composite content of those new-generation wings, the company is commissioning about now (early Spring), a new advanced composites production facility at Weston Approach, close to its major Filton site. This features the latest in production automation to meet airframer requirements for a continuous stream of wings that meet ever more stringent standards for aerodynamic efficiency, low weight and affordability.

Together, these two sites, along with its original facility at Cowes, Isle of Wight, UK, underpin GKN Aerospace’s drive to become an ‘advanced wing maker for the world,’ as Frank Bamford, senior vice president business development and strategy, puts it.

Bamford explains that the company is investing some $280 million over five years in its risk sharing partnership with Airbus to design and build the fixed trailing edge (FTE) section of the A350 wing. This comprises the fixed internal wing structure aft of the main wing box, but excluding the carbon wing skins, for which Airbus plants in Germany and Spain are responsible. The most significant part of the GKN Aerospace contribution is the rear spar, the crucial longitudinal strength member that forms the after edge of the central wing box and supports all the fixed sub-structures that carry the movable surfaces and, in the inboard portion, landing gear fixtures. The spar is subject to high loadings and stresses, a situation that favours composites with their high strength/low weight characteristics, tailorability and high fatigue tolerance.

Thorough material characterisation and painstaking design are pre-requisites for an optimum structure, of course, and GKN Aerospace can call on its extensive experience in engineering a wide range of composite items for aircraft including nacelles, flight control surfaces, cowls, ducts, engine fan blades and containment casings. It produces the primary composite wing spar for the Airbus A400M military airlifter and wing trailing edge sections for the world’s largest airliner, the Airbus A380. Not that its wing work is entirely Airbus focussed; it also produces the wing leading edge ice protection system for the B787, recently won a contract to build performance-enhancing composite winglets for Bombardier’s new C-Series airliner and also produces winglet structures for Aviation Partners-Boeing. Its sites in the USA manufacture wing spars for the Lockheed F22 fighter, airframe structures for unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) and parts for various business and light jets. All these components have substantial or majority composite content.

A350 wing

The Airbus-designed wing for the A350 wing is a largely composite assembly, though with ribs, internal frames and certain other sub-structures of metal. The wing’s beam strength derives from a central wing box in which two full-span spars form the forward and rear faces of the box. The spars have to be of carbon composite, both for weight saving and so that their coefficient of thermal expansion matches that of the wing’s carbon composite outer envelope.

GKN Aerospace is responsible for the rear spar and assembling it to all the fixed structure that attaches to it, these together comprising the fixed trailing edge (FTE). The composite spar, along with its attached structures, is produced in three 10 m sections that are joined for final checks before the full FTE is disassembled again for transportation to Airbus UK’s wing final assembly facility at Broughton, North Wales, where the complete wing is integrated.

The most substantial, inboard, FTE spar section weighs some 500 kg and includes the tough spar root with composite laminates up to some 25-30 mm thick. The mid-section, which has many attachment points, weighs about 150 kg, while the outboard section weighs 100 kg. Each spar section is produced by laying composite tows onto a large rotating mandrel, the formed part subsequently being autoclave cured under slight pressure. The spar tool is of Inconel metal and the mandrel for laying up spar sections is of carbon, in high modulus grade so that deflection is minimised. The mandrel concept contrasts with traditional metallic tooling philosophies, resulting in lighter, more affordable tooling.

Hexcel’s M21E pre-impregnated carbon/epoxy composite material, as specified by Airbus, is used throughout. Comprising a toughened epoxy resin reinforced with unidirectional carbon fibres, this system confers superior mechanical properties, in particular high impact resistance. Advanced 5-axis automated fibre placement (AFP) machines, purpose-designed and built by M. Torres in Spain, each wind 0.25-inch-wide tapes from up to 16 bobbins via a pulley system onto the rotating mandrel. Machines can be programmed to lay varying thicknesses of material onto the mandrels and can, for instance, build up thickness locally to provide integral pads for rib attachment points along the spar.

“AFP is part of our drive for a high level of automation so that we can efficiently produce wing sections to a consistent high quality while requiring as little manual work as possible,” comments chief engineer Chris Gear. “It will enable us to achieve high production rates so that we can meet our commitments as A350 production builds to a possible 14 aircraft a month. We’re also incorporating robotic drilling and machining and assembly.”

Interestingly, GKN Aerospace developed automatic tape laying (ATL) technology for its previous similar project, the spar for the A400M. (This is claimed to be the first major primary structure to be produced in carbon composite for the wing of a large transport aircraft).

ATL machinery at Cowes can lay up composite tapes 150 mm or 300 mm wide at the rate of about 18 kg (40 lb) of material per hour compared to hand lay-up rates of just 1-3 lb/hr for a similar item. For the A400M spar, the resulting flat laminate is then formed to the required ’C’ section spar shape over a heated tool, using a double-diaphragm press forming technique. The part is then put into an autoclave for final cure.

For the A350, however, automated fibre placement (AFP) is the preferred lay-up method. This is partly because the toughened resin used in the Hexcel M21E prepreg flows less readily than that in Cytec’s 977-2 used for the A400M spar, and partly because of the ability of AFP to produce more complex shapes. The A350 wing has significant curvature, particularly in the inboard sections where the profile is distinctly gull-winged. While ATL is viewed as excellent at producing large, reasonably flat structures, it can cause composite fibre buckling in more highly shaped components. AFP, on the other hand, while no better at laying up large flat surfaces, is accurate over more extreme curves and changes in direction because it uses narrower, independently controlled separate tapes to make up varying laminate thicknesses, including three-dimensional features.

Both methods enhance quality consistency and accuracy. ATL, for example, can produce the 14 m (45.9 ft) spars for the A400M wing to a dimensional tolerance of 0.5 mm. The metallic equivalent usually has to be adjusted during the build process. The method also enables the company to achieve void content as little as 1-1.5%, compared with 4% considered a more normal value for hand lay-up. AFP results in similar dimensional precision and laminate quality, while being potentially faster.

Essentially, each A350 spar section is layed on the mandrel, which is a long four-sided box, with cross-section, profile and wall thickness all varying according to location along the span. The AFP machine can lay two 10 m spars at one time, these subsequently being removed and placed onto a metal mould tool for curing in an autoclave.

Composite work takes place at the new Weston Approach facility near Filton in a 5000 m2 clean area. Two M. Torres winding machines are at one end of this space while a number of autoclaves plus ultrasonic testing and finishing facilities occupy the remainder. As production rate increases, more machines will be added in the clean room to cope with the volume.

At the time of a recent visit by Reinforced Plastics to Filton, GKN Aerospace had produced and evaluated a prototype composite spar for Airbus’ A350 wing box demonstrator and was preparing to embark on series production. The prototype milestone was achieved by a collaborative team comprising engineers from GKN Aerospace sites in Munich in Germany, Cowes and Filton, and utilised expertise gained at Cowes in manufacturing the A400M spars. Completed A350 production spars will be moved from the composites centre to the Filton assembly facility where they will be integrated with other fixed trailing edge components. Each FTE is assembled on a fixture, the spar section being placed therein hollow face up so that it can be drilled and machined as necessary, and the various ‘A’ frames, fitments and other structures can be attached.

Evolution

Chris Gear emphasises that the pace of composite manufacturing evolution is rapid, with significant changes being evident between successive generations of wing manufacture. Resin film infusion was developed for the Airbus A380 ‘superjumbo’ FTEs, designed by the company at the start of the millenium and in build from that time. ATL technology followed and went into production on the A400M spar in 2004. AFP is making its debut on the A350 FTE production line this year.

On the assembly side, another sign of evolution is the difference between the A380 and A350 programmes over the basic assembly method. In the A380 shop, the wing FTE remains fixed in position, on static jigs, requiring personnel and machines to move around the structure. On the more highly automated A350 line, however, there are no static jigs. Instead, FTE sections are moved on assembly jigs through a sequence of workstations where assembly, drilling, reaming and other machining operations are carried out robotically, to extremely tight tolerances. Flow line movement takes place on automatically guided vehicles (AGV), under the precise positional control needed to maintain overall wing geometry.

This change permits the faster assembly process needed to meet anticipated high production rates for the A350 wings. As Frank Bamford points out, both the A380 and A350 are remarkable for their large scale, but in the A380’s case this is in terms of sheer structure size, whereas for the A330 the scale is related to fabrication volume.

To win the A350 FTE work package, GKN Aerospace has had to develop its new fibre placement manufacturing process for a wing that is 50% greater in span, has the main landing gear attached to it and is much heavier than that of the A400M. Meeting production commitments called for high rates of material deposition onto the rotating spar mandrel along with further development of automated machining, spar and trailing edge tooling, flexible assembly, waterjet cutting of composites, single-step drilling and reaming of composites and inspection techniques. Methods for laying up, forming and processing the primary M21E composite material at speed had to be devised and refined. Modular tooling concepts had to be engineered so that tooling can adapt to the different component sizes required for the three aircraft variants.

Much of this technology has been developed at GKN Aerospace’s Composites Research Centre at Cowes on the Isle of Wight, though not without external assistance. Evolution has benefited from collaborative research, often supported by external funding.

“We are a builder and integrator of aerospace assemblies and have limited resources for research,” Chris Gear explains. “The R&D that we carry out is generally part-funded by GKN with support from the Government and other partners. We have engaged with a number of projects funded by the European Union and aimed at enhancing Europe’s competitive position in aerospace.”

For example, the Advanced Low-Cost Aircraft Structures (ALCAS) programme, funded as part of the EU’s sixth framework (FP6) research platform, helped the company to move on from the ‘black metal’ syndrome, characterised by designers simply substituting existing metal parts with carbon copies of the same thing, towards fully integral composite structures with much reduced part counts.

“Ideally, one would like to see a large composite structure infused as a single integrated whole in one hit,” declares Gear. “We‘re moving progressively towards this ideal.”

ALCAS, which resulted in a full-scale partial wing and some representative spars, itself built on the earlier FP5 Technology Application to the Near term business Goals and Objectives (TANGO) programme, which helped pave the way for more integrated airframe structures to be built in reinforced plastic materials. ALCAS supported development of technology underpinning the design and build of the complex composite spar for the A350.

The company has also taken part in the EU’s Aircraft Wing with Advanced Technology Operation (AWIATOR) research and is active on the Next-Generation Composite Wing (NGCW) programme, a £103 million UK initiative designed to keep Britain at the cutting edge of wing innovation and development. GKNA brings its composites manufacturing and ice protection capabilities to this latter programme, which is targeting high manufacturing rates and standards for future composite wings. Extending over three years from 2008, NGCW has helped the company optimise its factory layout for high-volume production and investigate new tooling developments.

Technology drive

As A350 production gets into its stride and progresses through the variants, GKN Aerospace will further refine its methods and processes. While it looks forward to a long continuation of its close partnership with Airbus, GKN Aerospace sees Filton as key also to opening doors into other future wing projects. In particular, it is targeting a share of the glittering prizes associated with next-generation single aisle (NGSA) aircraft, especially the yet-to-be designed types which, sometime late in this or early in the next decade, will start to replace the thousands of Boeing B737 and Airbus 320 jets that are the backbone of air transport today. GKN Aerospace aims to be airframer agnostic and hopes that its technology will appeal to both the established giants as well as regional aircraft builders like Bombardier and Embraer, plus up and coming aspirants like China’s Comarc.

To do this, it knows it will have to maintain the intensity of its technology drive, developing wings that improve still further on the state of the art represented by the A350 wing, itself the most efficient ever designed by Airbus. Wing design is likely, for instance, to benefit from laminar flow, an extremely smooth flow of air closely over the wing surface promoting maximum aerodynamic efficiency and lift. This will require the engineering of ultra-smooth composite wing skins, a fresh challenge for composite engineers. Future wings may evolve more towards a closed-cell, fully composite type of structure.

Efforts are on-going to achieve shorter composite manufacturing cycle times and cost reduction. One focus already yielding promising results is the use of microwave curing, with a view to reducing reliance on expensive and wasteful autoclaving methods. Such methods can also help bring about increased melding of parts by co-curing, so reducing part counts substantially. Further robotisation of machining and assembly operations should bring down the costs of volume production. Other developments will centre on effective integration of metals with composites since trends suggest that reinforced plastics will never entirely supersede metals and that the future lies in a creative partnership between the two.

Inclusion of sensing elements within composite laminates could assist the development of the ‘all-electric wing’, in which control surfaces are moved electrically rather than hydraulically. For example, sensors able to detect the formation of ice on leading edges could trigger de-ice heater mats.

GKN Aerospace is intimately involved with these and many other developments in its strategy, greatly facilitated by the Filton acquisition and the A350 FTE partnership, to be a very special Tier 1 supplier, a wing worker for the world in fact.

The pair will ""pursue our goal of convincing airlines in Japan that they really have a choice: our modern, eco-efficient Airbus aircraft and all the benefits they offer,"" Airbus CEO Tom Enders said in the statement.

Airbus has less than five per cent market share in Japan, compared with what it says is around half in other markets worldwide. Since Mr Fukushima became head of Airbus in Japan in 2005, the company has sold only eight aircraft there, including three leasing contracts, a spokesman said.

Mr Ginoux's appointment ""will further strengthen our ties with Japan's aviation industry,"" the statement added.

Mr Ginoux, 42, who has 18 years' experience working in Japan, will also continue to head Eurocopter Japan, another EADS affiliate, in charge of selling civil and military range helicopters.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9932522177696228}",neutral,0.9932522177696228,0
Airbus focuses on family commonality as it begins A350-800 detailed design - Flightglobal,"Wed, 28 Apr 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYWlyYnVzLWZvY3VzZXMtb24tZmFtaWx5LWNvbW1vbmFsaXR5LWFzLWl0LWJlZ2lucy1hMzUwLTgwMC1kZXRhaWxlZC1kZXNpZ24vOTMxNTMuYXJ0aWNsZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus is about to begin the detailed design effort of the next XWB iteration, the A350-800 shrink, in parallel with its efforts to begin the industrial ramp-up for the initial -900 variant.

The second member of the A350 family is due to enter service in the third quarter of 2014, around a year after the baseline -900. A stretched variant, the -1000, will follow at the end of 2015. Launch customer for all three variants is Qatar Airways.

The -800's concept was revamped in 2009 to be developed as a simple shrink of the -900, incorporating minor changes to the systems and structure, rather than as an optimised variant.

""We had been planning to optimise the -800 design a lot for its lower take-off weight with a different structure, landing gear and so on,"" says A350 chief engineer Gordon McConnell. ""We were chasing economics to provide the lightest possible aircraft.""

However, McConnell says that there was pressure from airlines to rethink this plan because of commonality concerns and the wish for additional range - the original A350-800 was designed to fly around 15,360km (8,300nm).

""The airlines said that the optimisation wasn't good for their cost of ownership if they operated both -800 and -900 variants. Some airlines also asked if we could use the -900's structural capability to give the -800 more range. Industrially, it also wasn't very good for us to optimise it.""

Airbus is going forward with the revamped -800 plan, based around the -900, having reached the design freeze late last year. ""We've issued the design loads for the -800 and we'll start the detailed design this year with improved payload/range performance,"" says McConnell.

The new -800 has a common wing with the -900 in terms of size, configuration and high-lift devices, while much of the structure is also identical. The A350-1000, now being defined, will have a wing around 4% bigger than the -800/900's, through a trailing-edge extension.

The -800's fuselage is shortened by 10 frames (six forward and four aft), which McConnell says requires changes to the geometry of section 13/14 (forward), section 16/18 (rear) and the upper shell of section 15 (centre fuselage).

""We're only changing systems where we need to because we're shortening the fuselage - for example there'll be some adaptation of the flight-control software because the aircraft will handle slightly differently.""

McConnell says some equipment has been altered and relocated as a result of the fuselage being shorter, specifically the crew and fire-extinguishing oxygen bottles.

""The basic weights of the -800 are unchanged [the 248t maximum take-off weight, for example], but we have increased weights available as an option,"" says McConnell.

An optional 11t increase in MTOW, to 259t, gives up to 460km more range than the old -800 variant. ""We have two max zero fuel/max landing weights, which allows us to offer 3t more payload capability as an option,"" McConnell says.

The -800 engine will be common to the 84,000lb-thrust (374kN) Rolls-Royce Trent XWB that powers the -900, but offered at various deratings as a result of its lower operating weights.

The basic 248t MTOW -800 will be offered with a 75,000lb sea level thrust rating, while the 279t MTOW option will have 79,000lb thrust. ""We'll also offer a 'hot and high' rating option flat-rated at 79,000lb at higher altitudes and temperatures which uses the full capability of the -900's 84,000lb-thrust engine,"" says McConnell. ""Typically this might be used by someone operating to Mexico City, for example.""

The A350-900 is due to fly in mid-2012 - three months later than previously planned due to a hold-up in the completion of some of the structural design. Airbus does not expect this to impact the delivery schedule or the development timetable of the other variants.

PICTURE: Airbus builds 'physical mock-up' of XWB fuselage to avoid A380 mistakes - Flightglobal,"Fri, 30 Apr 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vcGljdHVyZS1haXJidXMtYnVpbGRzLXBoeXNpY2FsLW1vY2stdXAtb2YteHdiLWZ1c2VsYWdlLXRvLWF2b2lkLWEzODAtbWlzdGFrZXMvOTMyMTEuYXJ0aWNsZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus aims to avoid a repeat of the A380 production dramas caused by over-reliance on the digital mock-up (DMU), by building a physical mock-up of the A350's fuselage.

""The DMU is a fantastic tool, but the lesson learned from the A380 was that we needed to go further to anticipate system installation problems,"" says A350 programme manager Didier Evrard. ""This was a large burden we carried on the A380 programme and this is why we've built this physical mock-up.""

On the A380, Airbus relied solely on digital mock-up software to test the installation of wiring and other systems, which it found to its cost was inadequate at replicating the reality of the actual assembly effort. The airframer was forced to redesign and reinstall wiring looms and re-invent its assembly process, leading to the major production delays suffered by the programme.

The A350's fuselage and cabin physical mock-up is being assembled at Airbus's Hamburg plant, with the front fuselage so far having been constructed. ""In the coming months the whole fuselage will be built - we have already used it a lot last year for testing design, assembly processes, tools and jigs,"" adds Evrard.

Next year the physical mock-up will be used for a dry run of the systems installation into the entire fuselage before this is attempted on A350-900 MSN001, says Evrard. ""This will be a very strong de-risking measure for the MSN001 final assembly.""

Airbus opts for larger wing on A350-1000 through trailing edge extension - Flightglobal,"Thu, 22 Apr 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYWlyYnVzLW9wdHMtZm9yLWxhcmdlci13aW5nLW9uLWEzNTAtMTAwMC10aHJvdWdoLXRyYWlsaW5nLWVkZ2UtZXh0ZW5zaW9uLzkzMTA3LmFydGljbGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus is working to reach the design freeze for the largest A350 variant, the -1000, in the middle of this year and has revealed that the stretched aircraft will feature a slightly larger wing the -800/900 models.

The 369-seat -1000, which has an 11-frame stretch over the -900, is due to enter service at the end of 2015. A separate A350-1000 design team was set up in 2009, headed by the XWB programme's deputy engineer Alain De-Zotti, which is examining trade-offs for the design, says chief engineer Gordon McConnell. Detailed definition is due to be completed at the end of 2011.

Airbus's operational requirement targets for the -1000 include keeping the approach speed to 150kt (277km/h) at maximum landing weight, compliance with London's QC1 noise requirements for arrival and QC2 for departures, and the capability to reach an initial cruise altitude of 33,000ft (10,000m) in less than 30min.

""With these parameters we were able to do the work to design the wing, and we found that with some changes to the trailing edge we can meet all these requirements,"" says McConnell.

The wing will feature a trailing-edge extension increasing its area by 4%, which McConnell describes as ""quite a big change because it extends the high-lift devices and the ailerons, making the chord bigger by around 400mm. We've been able to optimise the flap lift performance as well as gain more performance in the cruise.""

The -1000 design team will work this year to finalise the changes over the -800/900, with some other less significant trade-offs to be completed on the configuration. Windtunnel tests will be run this year based on the enlarged wing, covering both performance and loads. ""This will allow us to size the structure properly, which will give us a good idea on the weight delta of the aircraft,"" says McConnell.

Airbus devises plan to compress A350 flight-testing by three months - Flightglobal,"Fri, 23 Apr 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYWlyYnVzLWRldmlzZXMtcGxhbi10by1jb21wcmVzcy1hMzUwLWZsaWdodC10ZXN0aW5nLWJ5LXRocmVlLW1vbnRocy85MzEwMS5hcnRpY2xl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus aims to meet the A350's mid-2013 service-entry target by compressing the flight-test programme into 12 months, after revealing that it has burnt up some of the development programme's "" buffer"".

The A350-900's 12-month, 2,600h flight-test programme will begin in mid-2012 with the maiden flight of the first of five development aircraft.

The date for the first flight has slipped by three months because of development delays in the aircraft's structural design, but Airbus is confident it can meet the mid-2013 service entry target for launch customer Qatar Airways by reducing the original 15-month test programme by three months.

""We've got five aircraft in the flight-test programme - which is more than we usually have,"" says A350 chief engineer Gordon McConnell.

He says that the original 15-month plan had been generous - some customers had questioned why it would take Airbus so long - and the airframer has been running projects with its flight-test and engineering teams to devise ways of compressing it.

One example is the flight manual process, says McConnell: ""In the past we've done the aerodynamic testing to freeze the configuration, then the performance testing, and then built the flight manual. We've been working to make that a more concurrent effort.""

The flight manual will now be built ahead of flight testing and will then be checked during flight-testing, with adjustments being made when necessary. ""We've been able to save quite a lot of time on that critical path,"" he says.

The first two A350s to fly (MSN001 and 003) will be heavily instrumented. MSN001 will undertake all of the flight-envelope opening at the beginning of programme, to enable the aerodynamic and flight-control configurations to be frozen.

""MSN003 will be more devoted to performance and systems testing, but the two aircraft will be interchangeable because they have the same instrumentation,"" says McConnell.

The third A350 to fly will be MSN002, which will have a cabin installed. ""We'll fly that early in the programme so we can do proper operational testing on the cabin and deliver a mature aircraft to customers,"" says McConnell.

MSN004 and 005 will undertake operational tests and extended twin-engine operations trials towards the end of the programme, with Airbus planning to have up to four of the first five aircraft airborne before end-2012.

Airbus to flight-test XWB carbonfibre skin panel on A340 this year - Flightglobal,"Wed, 28 Apr 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYWlyYnVzLXRvLWZsaWdodC10ZXN0LXh3Yi1jYXJib25maWJyZS1za2luLXBhbmVsLW9uLWEzNDAtdGhpcy15ZWFyLzkzMTY2LmFydGljbGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus will fly a carbonfibre fuselage panel on its A340-300 testbed this year as part of its investigation of acoustic transmission within the A350 XWB's composite cabin.

The new twinjet is Airbus's first design with a carbonfibre fuselage skin instead of aluminium. Acoustic ground tests to compare the material's behaviour with a metallic skin have already been carried out. ""The question is what that means for noise inside the aircraft when in a flight environment,"" says A350 chief engineer Gordon McConnell. ""So to be able to get that correlation correct, we'll test-fly a carbon panel inserted into A340 MSN001.""

This aircraft, which is the 19-year-old original A340-300 development testbed, will be modified this summer with a 4.3m (14ft)-long section of its aluminium fuselage skin aft of the wing replaced with a 14m² (151ft²) carbonfibre panel. It is due to begin testing later this year with different types of acoustic insulation material to understand the effect in a real flight environment, to help Airbus ""de-risk"" the A350's production and flight-test programmes.

""We'll measure the noise transmission through this panel,"" says McConnell. ""This will allow us to freeze the design with a good level of confidence that we've got the acoustic treatments right to provide a good environment inside the aircraft and avoid having to play with the material later on during the A350 flight-test programme.

"Update: TMA delivers first Airbus. Sammak : ""we want to complement the services of MEA"" - Lebanon - Businessnews.com.lb","Tue, 06 Apr 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHA6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3NuZXdzLmNvbS5sYi9jbXMvU3RvcnkvU3RvcnlEZXRhaWxzLzU4Ny9VcGRhdGU6LVRNQS1kZWxpdmVycy1maXJzdC1BaXJidXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"“The aircraft was leased from Airbus- the European airline manufacturer,” said Mazen Sammak, one of the company’s shareholders.

The aircraft is an Airbus 300-600 and it has a capacity of 50-tons. TMA chose the 300-600 series in particular because it is a plane initially designed to act as a cargo freighter. It also has an encouraging fuel consumption option.

TMA benefited from the misfortune of the global financial crisis in the past one and a half year. It took advantage of the lower valuations and pricings “to finance the whole restructuring plan at lower costs- and thus lease the Airbus at a competitive price,” said Sammak.

Throughout the period, TMA was teaming up with a global consulting partner to offer training for its team. The company was updating its manuals, re-setting the offices, and re-building its contacts.



In 1953, TMA was founded. It owned permits to fly to all worldwide countries. But in 2004, it halted its entire operations when its fleet became relatively old and as it struggled with a $60 million debt.

Despite this, businessman Mazen Bissat, also owner of the Mazen chain of pharmacies bought the debt-plagued company in late 2008 from Farid Raphael, Chairman and General Manager of Banque Libano-Francaise for only one dollar. He pledged to restructure the company and take it back to its earlier era of success.

Today, TMA is owned by Bissat, and two other shareholders. Bissat owns the largest share of the company. Mazen Sammak, and Adolph Naim, who also acts as the company’s lawyer also own part of it.

Sammak expects the newly leased Airbus to be operational very soon at the Rafik Hariri International Airport. The company is still awaiting to receive all permits from the Airport’s Authority before it operates the aircraft, he said.

Sammak said that TMA might consider expanding its fleet by one or two airplanes in the future. However, “it is still too early to consider this option… we want to successfully resume operations first,” he said.

TMA does not rule out the competition factor despite being the only pure cargo airline among the 268 airlines that currently operate at the Airport, according to Sammak. ""There is competition but it is minor, we as TMA can carry larger volumes than others,"" he said.

Sammak said TMA is also looking forward to complement its services with that of the national carrier, the Middle East Airlines. “MEA cannot offer the services we can offer, and we cannot deliver MEA’s services.. We want both services to complete each other,” he said.

As the company gears up to resume its operations, 150 TMA employees in Lebanon, Milano, India, and Paris continue to do their tasks. Sammak is optimistic. “We will fare better than many would expect ... We are believers, we own a history and the trust of our financing partners,” he said.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.8395361304283142}",neutral,0.8395361304283142,0
