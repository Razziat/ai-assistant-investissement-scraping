Airbus to launch a new A320 version: Cleared for take-off - The Economist,"Thu, 23 Sep 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVjb25vbWlzdC5jb20vYmxvZ3MvbmV3c2Jvb2svMjAxMC8wOS9haXJidXNfbGF1bmNoX25ld19tb2RlbF9hMzIw0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"

AIRBUS is about to unveil a new version of its best-selling A320 aircraft. Along with its main rival, the Boeing 737, such single-aisle planes are the workhorses of worldwide aviation, accounting for four out of five commercial jets sold. But the Airbus A320 NEO will not be an all-new aircraft built from scratch; instead it will be an upgraded version of the classic A320, with a choice of two new, advanced engines which will offer big savings in fuel consumption.

Airbus bosses will meet on September 30th to put the finishing touches to the $1.3 billion project before putting it to the parent company, European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS). John Leahy, an Airbus executive, hopes to begin marketing the new plane as early as mid-October. Airbus's chief executive Tom Enders says his only remaining concern is to be reassured that his core team of 200-300 senior engineers can move on to the new single-aisle plane without disrupting other programmes, such as the A350 wide-body jet or the A400M military transporter—both of which have already suffered delays. That hurdle should be cleared at next week's meeting.

One of the new engines, Pratt & Whitney's geared turbo-fan, cuts fuel consumption by incorporating a gearbox that allows the air-intake fan to run at a different speed to the turbine that generates the thrust, unlike conventional jet engines. The other, an advanced version of the CFM56 engine made by a joint venture between America's General Electric and France's Safran, improves mileage by running at hotter temperatures than the current version.

Developing an all-new A320 would cost at least $10 billion. But Airbus does not believe the technology is currently available to make a big enough leap forward to justify spending that much. Mr Leahy points out that on smaller planes, unlike on large wide-bodies, it is difficult to achieve significant fuel economies through weight reduction, by using carbon-fibre composites instead of aluminium. Moreover, both Airbus and Boeing have found on their large-aircraft programmes that switching to carbon fibre is a lot harder than they had expected.

Mr Leahy thinks the new A320 NEO—which is likely to cost up to $8m more than the current model—will keep the product line going until 2025. He foresees sales of a further 4,000 planes, which is as many as it has delivered since the first A320s were launched in 1988. By 2025, he believes engine and composite fuselage technology should be ready for a dramatic improvement in weight and fuel economy. In the mean time, a touch of “frugal innovation” will keep the orders rolling in from cost-conscious airlines.

Atkins wins major contract to supply Airbus with landing gear engineering services - Professional Engineering,"Thu, 09 Sep 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmltZWNoZS5vcmcvbmV3cy9uZXdzLWFydGljbGUvYXRraW5zLXdpbnMtbWFqb3ItY29udHJhY3QtdG8tc3VwcGx5LWFpcmJ1cy13aXRoLWxhbmRpbmctZ2Vhci1lbmdpbmVlcmluZy1zZXJ2aWNlc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Engineering news

Engineering consultancy Atkins has won what it says is a “very significant” contract to supply engineering services for Airbus landing gear.

The contract, which will see Atkins working with independent landing gear specialist Stirling Dynamics, is for three years and will involve providing conceptual, analytical and design engineering services to Airbus’ UK-led Landing Gear Centre of Competence, which is based in Bristol.

Atkins’ aerospace division said that the deal would entail the creation of a number of new jobs – about 100 engineers are expected to work on the contract – and the development of the company’s existing aerospace engineering capability.

“This is genuine growth,” said Neil Kirk, managing director of the aerospace division. “We have to develop our in-house capability, and we will be training, developing and investing in people to fulfil the demands of the contract.

“This is about sustainable, high-tech engineering work.” Kirk added that landing gear was not an area that Atkins had traditionally been involved in, and that beating off competition to win the contract had been something of a coup for the company. He said he hoped successful fulfilment of the deal would lead to its extension in three years’ time.

The contract covers a wide range of existing aircraft, including the A380 and A320 families, where continuous development of landing gear to cut down costs and improve reliability is required. Atkins will also work on the landing gear for the newer A350 XWB aircraft, which is at an early stage of development. The company will also be involved in the research and development phase of engineering landing gear for aircraft at a conceptual stage.

The award of the contract for landing gear structures follows a deal to develop landing gear systems awarded by Airbus to Atkins Aerospace earlier this year."
BBC - Why the Airbus A380 is a big deal for Manchester - CBBC Newsround,"Wed, 01 Sep 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHA6Ly9uZXdzLmJiYy5jby51ay9sb2NhbC9tYW5jaGVzdGVyL2hpL3Blb3BsZV9hbmRfcGxhY2VzL25ld3NpZF84OTU5MDAwLzg5NTk3ODcuc3Rt0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Why the Airbus A380 is a big deal for Manchester

The Airbus A380 touched down in Manchester on 1 September 2010

The arrival of the world's biggest commercial airliner in Manchester certainly grabbed the headlines. At the airport, hundreds of staff joined thousands of plane spotters to watch the twin deck aircraft touch down for the first time [1st Sept 2010]. But why is the A380 such a big deal for Manchester and the North West? Its supporters say the A380 has put Manchester Airport on the map and boosted the economy. Critics, however, have dubbed it ""a green monster."" Investment Capable of carrying up to 800 passengers, the development of the Airbus A380 is something of a revolution in the airline industry. A380 IN NUMBERS 2: number of showers on board 239: length in feet 800: passengers that can be carried 1,000: jobs secured by the A380 at Broughton £3,000: the price of a first class return to Dubai £7.5bn: the value of A380 work placed in the UK To accommodate such a big plane, Manchester Airport has spent more than £10m on new fire engines, a new aircraft stand and two bridges to connect the super jumbo to the terminal. It's a major investment that puts it an elite group of the world's top 17 airports big enough to take an airliner of this size. Which is why both the airport and Emirates were keen to celebrate the arrival of Manchester's first A380 complete with luxury features like on-board showers for its first class passengers. Maurice Flanagan, vice chairman of the Emirates Airline and Group said he was confident that bookings for the A380 would prove that it was money well spent. ''The A380 is proving to be a big hit with our customers,"" he said. ""Our advance bookings are already 20% up from the same period last year,'' he said. Services Emirates will be operating two daily services to Dubai from Manchester - one of them serviced by the new A380. For Manchester Airport, it's the culmination of nearly ten years' work. Airport fire engines welcomed the plane with a water spray It had to secure Civil Aviation Authority approval to take the super jumbo which has involved widening taxiways, re-aligning junctions and turns and moving dozens of runway signs so the giant plane can pass safely. The airport's managing director Andrew Cornish said it was a ""proud day"" for Manchester. ''A lot of hard work and planning has gone into the arrival from many people and we're pleased that we can now accept the newest type of aircraft flying today.'' Size So what's different about the A380 apart from its size? It's quieter for a start and more fuel efficient than many of its older rivals. But there are still concerns about its impact. Supporters say it's a greener aircraft and moving large numbers of people on one journey is a better way forward. It's a green monster not a green dream, it's as simple as that.

Jeff Gazzard, Manchester Airport Environment Network But critics have claimed the move towards this kind of super jumbo will ultimately have a negative environmental effect. Jeff Gazzard runs the Manchester Airport Environment Network. He disputed the aircraft's green credentials. ""The flight to and from Dubai will make 800 tonnes of CO2. Its fuel efficiency is actually 10.4 miles per gallon. ""That isn't fuel efficient: it's a green monster not a green dream, it's as simple as that."" Jobs Wings for the giant A380 are made at the Airbus factory at Broughton near Chester. They have to be shipped by special barge along the Dee for final assembly in France. Nigel Harvey, head of operations for the A380 at Broughton said its arrival was extremely important in terms of employment. ""It's created an awful lot of jobs within the local community,"" he said. ""It's secured jobs for about 1,000 people here within the factory."" Emirates is one of Airbus's best customers with twelve A380s in its fleet and a further 78 on order. 'Mark Barclay, Airbus senior vice-president, said it was also big business for the British economy. ""On the A380 programme, work valued at over £7.5 billion has already been placed in the UK,"" he said. ""Over the lifetime of the programme this is set to more than double.''

Qantas A330 plunge passengers sue Airbus – Australian Aviation - Australian Aviation,"Mon, 20 Sep 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vYXVzdHJhbGlhbmF2aWF0aW9uLmNvbS5hdS8yMDEwLzA5L3FhbnRhcy1hMzMwLXBsdW5nZS1wYXNzZW5nZXJzLXN1ZS1haXJidXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A class-action lawsuit against Airbus and Northrop Grumman has been filed in the US by attorneys acting on behalf of passengers and crew injured in a serious incident involving a Qantas Airbus A330-300 in 2008.

The lawsuit is being led by a US law firm following contact from Australian law firms which will represent passengers and crew injured when A330 VH-QPA plunged over 1000ft in two uncommanded dives while on a flight from Singapore to Perth on October 7 2008, forcing the crew to make a mayday call and an emergency landing at Learmonth. The latest interim report from the ATSB suggests that the uncommanded dives may have been caused by erroneous data inputs from a faulty air data inertial reference unit (ADIRU), which was manufactured by Northrop Grumman.
