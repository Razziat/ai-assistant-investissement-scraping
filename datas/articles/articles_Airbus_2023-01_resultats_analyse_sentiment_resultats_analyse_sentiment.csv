Airbus tests new technologies to enhance pilot assistance - Airbus,"Thu, 12 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMy0wMS1haXJidXMtdGVzdHMtbmV3LXRlY2hub2xvZ2llcy10by1lbmhhbmNlLXBpbG90LWFzc2lzdGFuY2XSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Developments in flight safety and operational efficiency

Automatic landing, incapacity and taxi assistance explored in a demonstrator

Toulouse, 12 January 2023 – Airbus UpNext, a wholly owned subsidiary of Airbus, has started testing new, on ground and in-flight, pilot assistance technologies on an A350-1000 test aircraft.

Known as DragonFly, the technologies being demonstrated include automated emergency diversion in cruise, automatic landing and taxi assistance and are aimed at evaluating the feasibility and pertinence of further exploring autonomous flight systems in support of safer and more efficient operations.

“These tests are one of several steps in the methodical research of technologies to further enhance operations and improve safety,” said Isabelle Lacaze, Head of DragonFly demonstrator, Airbus UpNext. “Inspired by biomimicry, the systems being tested have been designed to identify features in the landscape that enable an aircraft to “see” and safely manoeuver autonomously within its surroundings, in the same way that dragonflies are known to have the ability to recognise landmarks.”

During the flight test campaign, the technologies were able to assist pilots in-flight, managing a simulated incapacitated crew member event, and during landing and taxiing operations. Taking into account external factors such as flight zones, terrain and weather conditions, the aircraft was able to generate a new flight trajectory plan and communicate with both Air Traffic Control (ATC) and the airline Operations Control Centre.

Airbus UpNext has also explored features for taxi assistance, which were tested in real-time conditions at Toulouse-Blagnac Airport. The technology provides the crew with audio alerts in reaction to obstacles, assisted speed control, and guidance to the runway using a dedicated airport map.

In addition to these capabilities, Airbus UpNext is launching a project to prepare the next generation of computer vision-based algorithms to advance landing and taxi assistance.

These tests were made possible through cooperation with Airbus subsidiaries and external partners including Cobham, Collins Aerospace, Honeywell, Onera and Thales. DragonFly was partially funded by the French Civil Aviation Authority (DGAC) as part of the French Stimulus plan, which is part of the European Plan, Next Generation EU, and the France 2030 plan.

Airbus joins Starlab commercial space station project - SpaceNews,"Wed, 04 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9haXJidXMtam9pbnMtc3RhcmxhYi1jb21tZXJjaWFsLXNwYWNlLXN0YXRpb24tcHJvamVjdC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"WASHINGTON — Airbus Defence and Space is joining a commercial space station project led by Voyager Space, a move that could potentially make it easier for European governments to use the station after the retirement of the International Space Station.

Denver-based Voyager Space announced Jan. 4 a partnership with Airbus on its Starlab commercial space station project. Airbus will provide “technical design support and expertise” for Starlab, the companies said, but did not disclose additional details about the partnership or financial terms.

Voyager Space announced plans for Starlab in October 2021 working with Lockheed Martin. Starlab, as described at the time, would feature in inflatable module, docking node and bus, capable of hosting up to four astronauts at a time.

Voyager Space, through its subsidiary Nanoracks, won one of three NASA Commercial Low Earth Orbit Development, or CLD, awards from NASA in December 2021. The $160 million Space Act Agreement is intended to support design work on Starlab as NASA prepares to transition from the ISS to commercial space stations by the end of the decade.

That transition will also involve NASA’s international partners on the ISS, something that both Airbus and Voyager Space officials alluded to in the announcement of their partnership. “Working with Airbus we will expand Starlab’s ecosystem to serve the European Space Agency (ESA) and its member state space agencies to continue their microgravity research in LEO,” Dylan Taylor, chairman and chief executive of Voyager Space, said in the announcement.

“This collaboration is an important step in making Starlab a reality, providing a foundation for long-lasting European and American leadership in space,” said Jean-Marc Nasr, executive vice president of space systems at Airbus Defence and Space, in the same statement.

ISS partners have pondered how they will make use of commercial space stations run by American companies. Current ISS arrangements, where space agencies barter for services, are unlikely to apply to commercial facilities, where agencies may have to work directly with the station’s operator rather than through NASA.

“We need to find ways to work together, certainly in other ways than we did before,” said Peter Gräf, director of applications and science at the German space agency DLR, during a panel discussion at the AIAA ASCEND conference in October. “There are a lot of options available and the main players are in heavy discussions on that.”

Direct payments from European governments to American companies for use of commercial space stations could be politically problematic. “The taxpayers in Europe don’t want to pay directly to private American companies,” said Nicolas Maubert, space counselor at the French Embassy in the U.S. and representative of the French space agency CNES in the U.S., at the conference panel. Those concerns may be alleviated, though, if companies from Europe and other ISS partners are involved with the stations.

ESA officials, who are beginning work on their post-ISS plans, are aware of those concerns. “Shall we pay directly to commercial providers in the U.S.? We can, of course, but that is euros directly supporting U.S. industry. Is that something Europe wants to do, that our member states want to do?” said Frank De Winne, head of ESA’s European Astronaut Center, in an interview during ESA’s ministerial council meeting in Paris in November.

How ESA will deal with commercial space stations is something the agency will study leading up to its next ministerial council meeting in 2025, but he said one option would be for ESA to fund development of a European crewed vehicle that could service those stations.

“If we talk to the commercial providers today, to the CLDs that are being funded by NASA, they all tell us the same thing: they are interested in transportation,” he said. “For them to keep their costs low on transportation, they want competition. It’s as simple as that.”

Airbus is not the first European company to be involved in a commercial space station project. Thales Alenia Space is building modules for Axiom Space that will initially be installed on the ISS but eventually be detached to form a commercial space station.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999741315841675}",neutral,0.9999741315841675,0

The name DragonFly is no mistake; Airbus says the technology is meant to mimic the insect’s ability to recognize certain locations. The aim is to use this ability to help an airplane taxi autonomously before takeoff, handle incidents when crew members might be incapacitated, and perform automated takeoffs and landings.

“These tests are one of several steps in the methodical research of technologies to further enhance operations and improve safety,” said Isabelle Lacaze, head of DragonFly demonstrator, Airbus UpNext, in a statement. “Inspired by biomimicry and nature in the same way that dragonflies are known to have the ability to recognize landmarks, the systems being developed are designed to identify features in the landscape that enable an aircraft to ‘see’ and safely maneuver autonomously within its surroundings.”

Could the humble dragonfly help pilots during flight? - Airbus,"Thu, 12 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIzLTAxLWNvdWxkLXRoZS1odW1ibGUtZHJhZ29uZmx5LWhlbHAtcGlsb3RzLWR1cmluZy1mbGlnaHTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Airbus UpNext DragonFly demonstrator takes inspiration from the incredible vision and intelligent flight capabilities of the dragonfly.

Airbus UpNext Dragonfly demonstrator show more show less Airbus UpNext DragonFly is a demonstrator exploring new pilot assistance technologies to further enhance flight safety and aircraft operational efficiency.

When safety is concerned, continuous improvement is the name of the game. At Airbus, we are constantly looking to different sources of inspiration to find proactive solutions that can enhance safety and improve performance.

And what better to be inspired by than the wonderful, natural world? Biologically-inspired engineering – or biomimicry – has led us to many of our creative solutions, from our “sharklet” wing-tip design that reduces drag, to our fello’fly demonstrator that mimics the formation flying of snow geese for improved performance.

Our latest demonstrator to use biomimicry is DragonFly, inspired by – you guessed it – the dragonfly. A dragonfly has phenomenal vision, the ability to see in 360°, and can recognise landmarks, which in turn help it to define its territorial boundaries. The systems we are developing and testing are similarly designed to review and identify features in the landscape that enable the aircraft to “see” and safely manoeuvre within its surroundings.

These innovations can offer an additional layer of safety for aircraft, particularly in the context of emergency operations. In the unlikely situation where a crew is unable to control the aircraft, DragonFly can redirect the flight to the nearest appropriate airport and facilitate a safe landing.



So how does it work?

DragonFly could be a game-changer when it comes to derisking emergency operations. Its focus is on three key areas, each one drawing on a combination of data captured during flight and a vast corpus of flight information to promote automated yet intelligent decision making.

DragonFly offers a solution to help ensure safe flight and landing. If the crew are unable to control the aircraft, the onboard function detects the issue and automatically selects the most suitable airport to redirect the aircraft towards.

But of course flight paths and external factors are complex and changing. A dragonfly scans its surroundings and adapts its journey accordingly. Our DragonFly demonstrator does much the same thing, taking into account external factors such as flight zones, terrain and weather conditions as it chooses where to land. But unlike a regular dragonfly, our DragonFly also benefits from a constant channel of communication between the aircraft and both Air Traffic Control and the Operations Control Centre of the airline to ensure a safe and coordinated approach.





In the same way that dragonflies can recognise landmarks that help them to define boundaries, our demonstrator is equipped with cutting-edge sensing technology and software, capable of managing in-flight and landing operations. The DragonFly demonstrator has been made possible through cooperation within the Airbus engineering community and with our trusted external partners, and we look forward to the insights that this final stage of testing will deliver.

Safe, automated landing at any airport in the world

A dragonfly’s vision works far more quickly than a human’s, which is why we have designed a system that combines sensors, computer vision algorithms and robust guidance calculations to make landing in low visibility or difficult weather conditions much easier.

These innovations pave the way for automated landing (if necessary), or can be customised according to the pilot’s flying skills to relieve them of additional processes in the event of an emergency or critical situation.

In time, DragonFly’s innovations could allow the aircraft to land at any airport in the world regardless of whether it is equipped with existing ground equipment technology currently used for automatic landing.

The final aspect of the DragonFly demonstrator incorporates pilot assistance technology to help the crew manage taxi guidance and instructions, including navigation and surveillance, freeing them up to focus on other important tasks.



What’s next?

DragonFly has now entered the final three months of its testing phase. These testing flights will enable Airbus UpNext to update or confirm the technology with the view to integrating improvements into future programmes.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.958141028881073}",positive,0.958141028881073,1

87th Airbus Eurostar satellite delivered

Multi-beam Ka-band and L-band and digitally processed payload for maximum flexibility

Toulouse, 30 January 2023 – The second Airbus-built Inmarsat-6 geostationary telecommunications satellite (I-6 F2) has arrived on board an Airbus Beluga at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida ready for its launch in February.

The second satellite of the Inmarsat-6 generation is based on Airbus’ ultra-reliable Eurostar E3000 spacecraft and will be the 58th Eurostar E3000 built by Airbus. It will be the ninth Eurostar in orbit that is equipped with electric propulsion for orbit raising, reinforcing Airbus’ position as the world leader in electric propulsion.

François Gaullier, Head of Telecommunications & Navigation Systems at Airbus, said: “I-6 F2, with its sophisticated digitally processed payload, will join Inmarsat-6 F1 (I-6 F1) in orbit giving Inmarsat even more flexibility, capability and capacity. This is the 10th geo-telecommunications satellite we have built for our long-term customer Inmarsat, a leading provider of global mobile satellite communication services, and with I-6 F1 the satellites will enable a step change in the capabilities and capacity for their ELERA services, and deliver significant additional capacity for their Global Xpress network.”

I-6 F1 and I-6 F2 each feature a large 9m aperture L-band antenna and six multi-beam Ka-band antennas, giving a high level of flexibility and connectivity. They also carry new generation modular digital processors to provide full routing flexibility over up to 8000 channels and dynamic power allocation to over 200 spot beams in L-band, per spacecraft. The Ka-band spot beams are steerable over the full Earth disk, with flexible channel to beam allocation.

The satellites will enable Inmarsat to further enhance its world-leading ELERA(L-band) and Global Xpress(Ka-band) networks respectively, for customers across land, sea, and air. They are also the next step in the company's plans for the world’s first multi-dimensional network, Inmarsat ORCHESTRA. The ‘network of networks’ will build on Inmarsat’s existing space-based capabilities to provide a transformational growth in capacity and new features for customers into the 2030s and beyond.

Investments made by Airbus in platform and payload technologies used on I-6 are supported by the European Space Agency and national agencies, in particular the UK Space Agency and CNES, France’s National Centre for Space Studies. I-6 F2 has a launch mass of 5.5 tons, spacecraft power of 21 kW and a design life of more than 15 years.

The first Airbus built Inmarsat-6 (I-6 F1) satellite was successfully launched in December 2021. It reached its geostationary testing location in summer 2022 and is scheduled to enter service in early 2023. I-6 F2 is set to follow after its successful launch and enter service in early 2024.

Airbus’ geostationary telecommunications satellites have clocked up more than 1300 years of successful operation and are in service or being built for all of the world’s leading geostationary satellite operators.

Aerodynamics and the art of aircraft design - Airbus,"Tue, 31 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIzLTAxLWFlcm9keW5hbWljcy1hbmQtdGhlLWFydC1vZi1haXJjcmFmdC1kZXNpZ27SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Aviation’s decarbonisation relies on a mixture of incremental steps and outright technological breakthroughs. To succeed, both approaches need to exist inside a collaborative ecosystem. In this spirit Airbus, DLR and ONERA, two leading European research institutions, are exploring how high-performance computing can improve our understanding of the relationship between aerodynamics and aircraft efficiency.

Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) combines applied mathematics, physics and high-performance computing. It’s used to understand how air moves over complex shapes, helping designers maximise lift and minimise drag to make an aircraft as efficient as possible at both low and high speeds.

“I always say that CFD is where science meets art. It’s a beautiful thing, a kind of computerised wind tunnel,” grins Airbus’ Head of Aerodynamics Simon Galpin. Galpin oversees a five-year-old partnership with French aerospace lab ONERA (Office National d'Etudes et de Recherches Aérospatiales) and the German Aerospace Center DLR (Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt) on behalf of Airbus.

“Experts at our fingertips”

DLR and ONERA are decades-long Airbus allies. Historically each had worked on separate computer codes, the foundations on which CFD is built. Although the codes were effective in their own right, communication between the different development teams was limited.

Gradually it became clear that the codes required collective re-engineering for extreme-scale parallel computing platforms. The partnership addresses that shortfall. “It made sense to combine our efforts,” says Galpin. “We’re developing a new generation CFD code that is ‘industry-ready’ for flow prediction and equally applicable to aircraft, helicopters and space systems.”

The signing of the agreement in 2017 was big news in an area that demands substantial time, resources and investment. “From one day to the next the workforce doubled!” remembers ONERA’s Aeronautics Director Philippe Beaumier. “We had a team of experts on both sides of the Rhine at our fingertips.”

The partners renewed their commitment in late 2022, with the goal of extending the code to current and future Airbus projects, such as ZEROe, EcoPulse and Open Fan research. In fact, it’s already being used to mature test cases previously thought unfeasible because of limited physical representation and computational capacity. Soon those cases could influence propulsion, engine integration and wing technology choices that will determine the blueprints for a new generation of fuel-efficient aircraft.

“We want to improve the predictability of performance right from the design phase,” says DLR’s Dr Markus Fischer, Division Board Member for Aeronautics. “The new code can also help specialists investigate even more radical design concepts, such as the flying wing, with a degree of speed and accuracy that wasn’t within the grasp of previous software.”

I always say that CFD is where science meets art. It’s a beautiful thing, a kind of computerised wind tunnel.” Simon Galpin, Airbus Head of Aerodynamics

Every gram of energy counts

Fischer argues that without unfettered digitalisation to accelerate the pace of innovation, decoupling air traffic growth from emissions can’t be guaranteed. DLR shares Airbus’ and ONERA’s ultimate vision of clean aerospace aviation, which he says will require a disruptive approach. “Decarbonisation calls for a twin revolution,” agrees Beaumier, “one technological and one methodological. Aircraft development cycles need to be halved to realise those ambitions. This is where mature numerical simulation plays a major role.”

How does CFD contribute to this vision of clean aerospace? Galpin answers by pointing out that kerosene substitutes are likely to be more costly. “We better be extracting every gram of energy from every kilogram of alternative fuel, using the most efficient aircraft architecture. Using advanced CFD helps us shave off drag little by little.”

Attracting future engineers

Airbus has access to some of the highest-performing extreme-scale computational systems in the world to help develop and validate the code, helping boost engineers’ confidence in their predictions. It’s an inspiring and rewarding exercise, Beaumier insists, with a real-world application: “To directly support the aeronautical industry’s sustainability goals.”

The final word goes to Pascal Larrieu, Airbus Computational Simulation Expert and the company’s lead for developing the new flow solver: “This project opens doors to a diverse, dynamic and Europe-wide research network. We’re convinced our work will help attract future aeronautics engineers to join us in meeting our decarbonisation ambition together.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9912198185920715}",neutral,0.9912198185920715,0

In addition to advances in medicine or helping to face the issues we have on Earth — such as water and air quality — the research conducted on the ISS is critical in our journey to the Moon and Mars and helping humanity explore the confines of the universe.

However, the ISS cannot keep operating forever and has already well exceeded its original lifetime of 15 years: it is planned to be deorbited towards the end of this decade. NASA is likely to transition away from the ISS towards the next generation of continuously crewed, free flying space stations, and Airbus intends to be part of the future of human presence in space.

This is why Airbus Defence and Space is teaming up with Voyager Space to help design the next space station for NASA, ESA and other customers. The space station of the future, Starlab, could be launched as early as 2028 to ensure a sustained human presence in low-Earth orbit. Designed and architected to provide 100 percent of the International Space Station’s payload capacity with the ability to conduct over 400 experiments or technical investigations per year, Starlab could provide a foundation for continued international cooperation in space, with the goal of accelerating a sustainable ecosystem in space.

“The partnership with Voyager Space is the first step toward fielding the next generation space station serving international astronauts. We are excited to partner with Voyager on a project aimed at changing history,” said Jean-Marc Nasr, Executive Vice President of Space Systems. “Our team is looking forward to diving in on the technology and putting our best engineers to work.”

Working together to bring Starlab to life is a step towards expanding and engaging international participation and customer support for this inspiring project. At Airbus, we have extensive expertise in human spaceflight and a vision to create an advanced infrastructure in space to serve the scientific community and to create a better future for humanity in space and on Earth.

Airbus and VDL Group join forces to produce an airborne laser communication terminal - Airbus,"Tue, 10 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMy0wMS1haXJidXMtYW5kLXZkbC1ncm91cC1qb2luLWZvcmNlcy10by1wcm9kdWNlLWFuLWFpcmJvcm5lLWxhc2Vy0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Leiden, 10 January 2023 – Airbus and VDL Group have signed a partnership agreement for the development and manufacturing of a laser communication terminal for aircraft, known as UltraAir. Based on the development led by Airbus and the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO), the two companies will now prepare a demonstration of a prototype and a first flight test in 2024.

As of 2024, Airbus and VDL Group – a Dutch high-tech industrial supplier – will further industrialise the prototype in order to make it ready for integration with a hosting aircraft. VDL brings design for production to the partnership and will manufacture critical systems. A flight test of this industrialised prototype is planned in 2025 on an aircraft.

UltraAir will enable the exchange of large amounts of data using laser beams in a network of ground stations and satellites in geostationary orbit at 36,000 km above the Earth. With unparalleled technology including a highly stable and precise optical mechatronic system, this laser terminal will pave the way for data transmission rates that could reach several gigabits-per-second while providing anti-jamming and low probability of interception.

In this way, UltraAir will allow military aircraft and UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) to connect within a multi-domain combat cloud thanks to laser-based satellite constellations such as Airbus’ SpaceDataHighway. This is a key milestone in the roadmap of Airbus’ overall strategy to drive laser communications further, which will bring forward the benefits of this technology as a key differentiator for providing multi-domain combat collaboration for government and defence customers. In the longer term, UltraAir could also be implemented on commercial aircraft to allow airline passengers to establish high-speed data connections.

Regarded as the solution for data traffic in the quantum age, laser communication technologies are the next revolution in satellite communications (satcom). As satellite bandwidth demand is growing, the traditional satcom radio-frequency bands are experiencing bottlenecks. Laser communication brings 1,000 times more data, 10 times faster than the current network. Laser links also have the benefit of avoiding interference and detection, as compared to already-crowded radio frequencies they are extremely difficult to intercept due to a much narrower beam. Thus, laser terminals can be lighter, consume less power and offer even better security than radio.

Co-financed by Airbus and VDL Group, the UltraAir project is also supported by the ESA ScyLight (Secure and Laser Communication Technology) programme and by the “NxtGen Hightech” programme, as part of the Dutch Growth Fund, led by TNO and a large group of Dutch companies.

Airbus has announced the selection of Eaton and Crouzet to provide the EPDS and the human-machine interface of CityAirbus NextGen, respectively. The providers’ valuable experience in electrical power management and flight deck controls will ensure the seamless integration of the two subsystems into the prototype’s architecture. Additionally, as key contributors to the aircraft’s performance levels, reliability, and safety, the two parts will have an important impact on the vehicle’s capabilities.

Stefan Hedtstück, Head of UAM procurement at Airbus, said: “Eaton and Crouzet bring a unique mix of aviation expertise to our journey with CityAirbus NextGen. From full electrification to advanced ways of piloting, they are key partners in our mission to develop the features that will make our eVTOL a true game-changer for air mobility.”

CityAirbus Nextgen's

A collaboration dedicated to pioneering air mobility services

As the provider of CityAirbus NextGen’s electrical power distribution system, Eaton has mobilised its teams to create an optimal solution to deliver electrical power from the Airbus-designed batteries to CityAirbus NextGen’s eight electrical power units. The power distribution system ensures that the eVTOL is flying safely, by compensating for any reduction of battery performance in flight. Leveraging the company’s extensive experience in electrification for the aviation industry, Eaton is designing, analysing and manufacturing the power distribution unit to be fully integrated within the electrical propulsion system of the Airbus’ prototype.

“We designed a high voltage, intelligent solution for the eVTOL’s electrical power distribution system in line with CityAirbus NextGen’s architecture”, explains Tyler Ford, General Manager Engine Solutions and Electrification, at Eaton. “The use of the latest generation electronic and protective components plays an important part in this endeavour”, he adds.

This also applies to Crouzet, who will equip CityAirbus NextGen’s flight deck with the piloting control device. Benefiting from extensive experience in flight deck controls, the electromechanical and electronic components company has developed a whole new human-machine interface concept that complies with the most stringent requirements for size, weight and safety: the pilot will manage the trajectory of the vehicle rather than the attitude of the aircraft. The actual control action on the propellers is then managed by the advanced flight control system. The new piloting interface radically simplifies flying and thus reduces pilot workload.

“Airbus and Crouzet jointly designed a cutting-edge human-machine interface that allows pilotsto fly CityAirbus NextGen and to control peripheral functions such as the radio and the autopilot”, explains Philippe Defrance, Marketing segment leader at Crouzet. This innovative subsystem will be a compact combination of electronics, mechanical, and software technologies.

CityAirbus NextGen

Ready to make zero emission flights possible

To rise to the challenge, Eaton and Crouzet have powered end-to-end technical solutions that will deliver advanced air mobility requirements for the highest levels of safety and innovation.

Consequently, the human-machine-interface is a major asset for the cockpit concept retained for CityAirbus NextGen. Indeed, it will rely on Crouzet's piloting device to let the pilot choose either a fully automated flight, or manual control take-over for a smooth and easy steering of the aircraft anytime during the flight.

""This new generation of pilot control is an important step toward air mobility services with Airbus’ eVTOL"", mentions Defrance. ""We worked side by side with Airbus - a long term trusted partner - to shape the most ergonomic pilot control device for CityAirbus NextGen "".

Eaton has fostered the development of electrical flight through years of collaboration with Airbus, and by investing in base technologies such as materials, processes and controls, in order to deliver a state-of-the-art, innovative eVTOL system that is safe, accessible and secure.

“Electrified flight is a major milestone for this industry and a key-element of Eaton’s Aerospace strategy for the next decades. As an expert in power systems, selective coordination and power distribution, Eaton has a key role to play”, emphasised Krishna Jonnalagadda, SVP and General Manager of Eaton’s Fluid and Electrical Distribution Division. “We are providing Airbus the latest of our innovative technologies and aerospace processes to comply with safety of flight.”","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9658440947532654}",positive,0.9658440947532654,1

The Armed Forces will utilise channels of the Airbus UHF (Ultra High Frequency) military communications hosted payload on-board a commercial telecommunications satellite manufactured by Airbus.

“With this new UHF payload, Airbus will be able to offer a new UHF communications service, scheduled for launch in 2024, to the armed forces, particularly those of European countries and NATO allies” said Eric Even, head of Marketing and Sales, Connected Intelligence, at Airbus Defence and Space.

As the UHF frequency band is a relatively scarce orbital resource, this offering will make up for the capacity shortage around the world. Airbus has already signed several firm orders for this capacity, well ahead of the satellite’s scheduled launch.

The UHF payload will be operated from Airbus’s Network Operations Centre in Toulouse. Its 18 UHF channels will enable up to 200 simultaneous communications over Europe, the Middle East, Africa, large parts of Asia, as well as the Atlantic Ocean (to eastern Brazil) and the Indian Ocean (to western Australia).

Military UHF satcoms are used by the armed forces for operations on land, at sea and in the air. They have a high level of interoperability and are therefore very useful for multinational and coalition operations. The UHF band is very flexible and offers a lightweight, robust and highly secure means of communication. An extensive range of terminals for use on land, at sea and in the air is available to meet the needs of the various armed forces.

Airbus has unique experience in operating UHF milsatcom services. This new payload will enhance its portfolio throughout the lifespan of the satellite.

Galileo tribute plaque unveiled in Airbus’ cleanroom and mounted on the spacecraft

ESA’s mission will study Jupiter’s three largest icy moons and the Jovian system’s magnetic fields

Toulouse, 20 January 2023 - The Airbus-built JUICE (JUpiter ICy moons Explorer mission) spacecraft will shortly leave Toulouse, France, for Kourou, French Guiana, for lift-off on an Ariane 5 in April 2023. Shipment is expected in early February.

The spacecraft has been at Airbus in Toulouse since August 2021 for final assembly and test. This included integration of the final instrument units and the largest solar arrays ever to fly on a planetary exploration mission, needed to power the mission at 740 million kilometres from the Sun.

“With JUICE's departure for the launch site fast approaching, we look back at its long Earthly journey through various Airbus sites in Europe towards final integration and involving close to 500 Airbus employees who prepared the spacecraft for its eight-year cruise,” said Cyril Cavel, JUICE Project Manager at Airbus Defence and Space.

“It has been an incredible adventure, along with more than 80 companies across Europe, to bring ESA’s vision to life and ultimately study Jupiter and its icy moons in fine detail.”

Today a commemorative plaque was unveiled during a press event in Toulouse as a tribute to Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei. The plaque has been mounted on the spacecraft to honour Galileo who was the first to view Jupiter and its largest moons through a telescope in 1610.

On its more than 2 billion-kilometre long journey, the 6.2 ton JUICE spacecraft will collect data on the icy moons to try to understand whether there is any possibility that these moons could host microbial life. Carrying 10 state-of-the-art scientific instruments, including cameras, spectrometers, an ice-penetrating radar, an altimeter, a radio-science experiment, and sensors, the JUICE spacecraft will complete a unique tour of the Jupiter system that will include in-depth studies of three potentially ocean-bearing moons: Ganymede, Europa and Callisto.

During its four year-long mission, JUICE will spend nine months orbiting the icy moon Ganymede analysing its nature and evolution, characterising its subsurface ocean, and investigating its potential habitability.

After being selected by ESA as prime contractor in 2015 Airbus has led a pan European industrial consortium to design and build this unique spacecraft.

Safety Innovation #6: Flight Management System (FMS) - Airbus,"Thu, 26 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIzLTAxLXNhZmV0eS1pbm5vdmF0aW9uLTYtZmxpZ2h0LW1hbmFnZW1lbnQtc3lzdGVtLWZtc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It's a fact, our industry has made huge progress in safety since the 1950s. This is especially true of the past three decades, when technology has facilitated substantial improvements.

In this series, we revisit some of the innovations that have provided step changes in improving product safety. Here, we look at the Flight Management System, or FMS.

The FMS, which was integrated into the flight deck during the early 1980s, is an avionics system comparable to the satnav used by many car drivers. It uses a predefined flight plan to calculate and display an aircraft’s lateral and vertical trajectory, providing guidance throughout the flight.

The system provides the estimated flight time that pilots announce to passengers before take off, and the amount of fuel expected to remain on arrival. If an aircraft is diverted during flight, the FMS can calculate whether it has enough fuel remaining to reach its new destination.

The FMS also contributes to flight safety by helping pilots manage their workload, assisting them with navigation tasks and enabling them to make informed decisions.

During takeoff and landing, the FMS provides valuable assistance by calculating trajectories based on numerous parameters, including terrain altitude, runway location and the specifics of a given airspace. This support is even more useful around airports with high traffic density or in mountainous areas.

In cruise, the FMS contributes to flight safety in airspaces without radar coverage by providing air traffic controllers with reports containing information on the aircraft’s current position (latitude, longitude, altitude, heading, etc.), its estimated time of arrival, and its altitude at specific waypoints. This information is typically fed to satellites, enabling air traffic controllers to accurately manage the distance between aircraft over areas such as the North Atlantic.

One important input to the FMS is the navigation database, which contains all routing and airport data that the FMS needs to function correctly. This database, essential to the proper functioning of the aircraft as well as global air traffic management, is updated by operators – mainly airlines – every 28 days.

This means the FMS can fully play its role and continue to contribute to safe air transport.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9581822752952576}",neutral,0.9581822752952576,0

Airbus tests renewable marine fuel - Airbus,"Wed, 11 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIzLTAxLWFpcmJ1cy10ZXN0cy1yZW5ld2FibGUtbWFyaW5lLWZ1ZWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In line with its ambition to reduce its carbon emissions, Airbus is introducing renewable fuel on one of the vessels it uses for transportation by sea. A test campaign has been launched on the route Saint-Nazaire-Tunis-Naples at the end of December 2022, which will run for 18 months.

In order to reduce the impact of its industrial activities on the environment, Airbus is continously introducing alternative energy solutions across the different transportation methods it uses: air, road and maritime. In 2019, Airbus introduced Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) for its Beluga operations and initiated the use of biogas trucks in 2021 to transport aircraft sections and major components across its production sites in Europe. In addition, in December 2022, Airbus launched its first test campaign to explore the use of renewable fuel for its fleet of vessels over the course of 18 months.

Provided by Neste and produced in Rotterdam, the renewable diesel fuel is made of HVO (Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil, or residual cooking oil) which contains no fossil fuels or additives. The fuel will be used for the first time on the Airbus vessel ‘Ciudad de Cadiz’ on the route Saint-Nazaire-Tunis-Naples-Saint-Nazaire operated by LDA, Louis Dreyfus Armateurs, and carrying major components for the A320 family between its production sites. During the 18-month test campaign, around a third of the total fuel (around 330 tons) is expected to be renewable, which will reduce CO 2 emissions by up to 20% per trip compared to fossil fuel. In one year, on this route only, Airbus aims to save around 6,000 tons of CO 2 .

This test campaign will enable Airbus and its partners to evaluate the performance of the renewable fuel and the vessel’s engine, and confirm by how much it has been able to reduce its CO 2 emissions.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999386072158813}",neutral,0.9999386072158813,0
Airbus A3R completes certification with support from Wind River safety-critical multi-core platform | Wind River - WIND,"Mon, 23 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy53aW5kcml2ZXIuY29tL2Jsb2cvYWlyYnVzLWEzci1jb21wbGV0ZXMtY2VydGlmaWNhdGlvbi13aXRoLXN1cHBvcnQtZnJvbS13aW5kLXJpdmVyLXNhZmV0eS1jcml0aWNhbC1tdWx0aS1jb3JlLXBsYXRmb3Jt0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Congratulations to Airbus on the A330 Multi-Role Tanker Transport (MRTT) aircraft becoming the world’s first tanker to be certified for automatic air-to-air refueling (A3R) in daylight! This is a major achievement and thank you for allowing Wind River to be part of your multi-core certification journey (read the news here).

A3R is a very significant milestone in the evolution of airborne refueling systems, as the automated system enables more efficient operation, reduces air refueling operator (ARO) workload, reduces inherent risk of this operation and optimizes the rate of air-to-air refueling transfer, as shown in this informative Airbus video.

The A3R enhanced capabilities are achieved by using state-of-the-art technologies to identify the receiving aircraft’s shape and its refueling receptacle, then perform automated contact and fuel transfer while flying at high altitude.

With this development, Airbus has successfully implemented and certified a complex use case through Spanish National Institute for Aerospace Technology (INTA), involving multiple ED-12C / DO-178C DAL A applications running simultaneously on multiple cores on a multicore processor. Airbus has also met the objectives of CAST-32A (now AM(C) 20-193) published jointly by EASA and FAA. This is a very significant step forward compared to other safety-critical avionics systems which only run on a single core on a multi-core processor with the other processor cores deactivated.



The Advent of Multi-core Safety-critical Avionics

This automation involves sophisticated applications which require a step change in computing performance, necessitating the transition from a single-core processor safety-critical avionics platform to a multi-core processor safety-critical avionics platform. This enables more ARINC 653-compliant safety-critical avionics applications with compute intensive requirements to be hosted. However, this also dramatically increases system complexity and can result in challenges related to determinism, multi-core interference channels, worst-case execution timing (WCET) analysis and increased safety certification costs (as discussed in the Wind River blog series on Assured Multicore Partitioning for FACE systems).

Wind River had previously supplied the VxWorks 653 safety-critical real-time operating system (RTOS) platform which Airbus used on a single-core processor platform for the original air-to-air refueling boom system (ARBS) used on the A330 MRTT. This system comprised multiple ARINC 653-compliant applications running at a multiple levels of safety-criticality and achieved DO-178B DAL A certification.

A Trusted Partner for Multicore Certification

When Airbus decided to transition to a multicore platform to support A3R capabilities, Wind River was able so support Airbus on its multi-core journey, working as a trusted advisor to identify milestones, potential obstacles, and develop metrics to prove that the system architecture was on the right track.

Airbus was also able to achieve software reuse by porting its existing ARINC 653-compliant applications from VxWorks 653 running on a single-core platform to VxWorks 653 Multi-Core Cert Edition integrated with ecosystem partners’ graphics and multi-core processor platform .

Airbus Helicopters performed steadily in a complex 2022 - Airbus,"Wed, 25 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMy0wMS1haXJidXMtaGVsaWNvcHRlcnMtcGVyZm9ybWVkLXN0ZWFkaWx5LWluLWEtY29tcGxleC0yMDIy0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Marignane, In 2022, Airbus Helicopters logged 374 gross orders (net: 362), highlighting the ongoing market recovery with an impressive 216 light single engine helicopters sold. Deliveries increased from 338 in 2021 to 344 in 2022, contributing to Airbus Helicopters’ preliminary 52% share of the civil and parapublic market. Airbus’ helicopter fleet flight hours are now back to pre-COVID 2019 levels.



“2022 was a year in which Airbus Helicopters solidified its recovery, in a context of instability with the war in Ukraine and a fragile supply chain. I’d like to thank our customers for their continued trust in Airbus Helicopters. Our teams will continue to work hard to meet their needs and deliver on our commitments in 2023,” said Bruno Even, Airbus Helicopters CEO. “Our orders came from 203 customers in 48 countries, underlining the importance of our global network as well as showing that in uncertain times, the role of helicopters is more essential than ever.”



New ground was broken, with important first deliveries.The first ACH160 was delivered to a Brazilian customer, transported by an Airbus Beluga, in July 2022. Shortly after, All Nippon Helicopter’s H160 entered into service in Japan and the French Navy took delivery of the first H160 for SAR operations. In October, the Company delivered the first H135s to the Spanish Ministry of Interior following the major order just ten months prior.



Significant support and services contracts were signed for both the civil and military range. Highlights include an NHIndustries contract with NAHEMA for the French and German NH90s, a follow-on contract with the US Army for more than 480 UH-72A and UH-72B Lakota helicopters. The Helicopter Company signed In-Service HCare contracts for its fleet of 20 H145s and six ACH160s.



“It is no surprise that security is currently a priority for many countries. This is reflected in our order book with an important contract for 27 H125s with our longstanding partner, the Brazilian armed forces. We launched a major upgrade of the Tiger helicopter for the French and Spanish armies and we are also progressing with the design of the H175M assembly line in Broughton should we win the New Medium Helicopter campaign in the UK,” continued Even.



Airbus Helicopters also continued to make inroads on its decarbonisation roadmap which is based on a threefold approach using SAF, hybridisation, and electrification.



”The unveiling of our DisruptiveLab demonstrator at the Airbus Summit is another significant step to decarbonising vertical lift. The aircraft that took flight on 13 January will demonstrate our capability to reduce CO2 emissions by 50%. Our commitment to sustainability also saw us forge more partnerships that will support the optimal entry into service of the CityAirbus NextGen, our eVTOL prototype,” continued Even.



Airbus Helicopters continued to innovate for the military market as well. The Company furthered the development of its own unmanned aerial system (UAS), the VSR700, which began trialing autonomous take-off and landing capabilities at sea. In June 2022, Airbus Helicopters was named coordinator of the “EU Next Generation Rotorcraft Technologies Project” (ENGRT) which is a Research and Technology project funded by the European Defence Fund, paving the way for the next generation of military rotorcraft in Europe.



The 2022 full year financial results will be disclosed on 16 February 2023.

Delta Air Lines firms order for 12 additional A220 aircraft - Airbus,"Wed, 18 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMy0wMS1kZWx0YS1haXItbGluZXMtZmlybXMtb3JkZXItZm9yLTEyLWFkZGl0aW9uYWwtYTIyMC1haXJjcmFmdNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Herndon, USA / Mirabel, Canada - 18 January 2023 – Delta Air Lines has firmed up an order for a dozen more A220-300 aircraft, bringing the airline’s total firm order for A220s to 119 aircraft - 45 A220-100s and 74 A220-300s. Throughout the years, Delta has reordered the A220 four times and is today the largest A220 customer and operator.

""These 12 additional A220 aircraft will help power our increasingly streamlined fleet while also providing our customers with the elevated in-flight experience they’ve come to expect from Delta,” said Kristen Bojko, Vice President of Fleet, Delta Air Lines.

“Delta Air Lines was the U.S. launch customer for the A220 and this fourth reorder in just four years by a leading carrier as Delta is a most gratifying endorsement,” said Christian Scherer, Airbus Chief Commercial Officer and Head of International. “The aircraft is currently connecting Delta passengers on more than 100 routes at 25 percent* less fuel and CO2 emissions. If you want to connect today and tomorrow, you can’t do any better!”

Delta took delivery of its first Airbus A220 in October 2018, and was the first U.S. carrier to operate the aircraft type. Delta currently owns a fleet of 415 Airbus aircraft, including 59 A220 aircraft, 266 A320 Family aircraft, 62 A330s and 28 A350-900 aircraft.

The A220 is the only aircraft purpose-built for the 100-150 seat market, bringing together state-of-the-art aerodynamics, advanced materials and Pratt & Whitney’s latest-generation GTF™ engines. The A220 brings customers a 50 percent reduced noise footprint as well as around 50 percent lower NOx emissions than industry standards.

With 246 A220s delivered to 16 airlines operating on four continents, the A220 is the optimal aircraft to offer operational flexibility for both regional as well as long-distance routes. To date, more than 70 million passengers have enjoyed the A220. The fleet is currently flying on over 825 routes and 325 destinations worldwide. As of the end of December 2022, nearly 30 customers have ordered close to 800 A220 aircraft - confirming its leading position in the small single-aisle market.

Opinion: Why Airbus Needs To Update Its Supply Chain Model - Aviation Week,"Tue, 24 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9hZXJvc3BhY2UvbWFudWZhY3R1cmluZy1zdXBwbHktY2hhaW4vb3Bpbmlvbi13aHktYWlyYnVzLW5lZWRzLXVwZGF0ZS1pdHMtc3VwcGx5LWNoYWluLW1vZGVs0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus is in a historic position of strength, with the opportunity to become the world’s most important aerospace OEM. It is breaking out of its duopoly with Boeing, pursuing a production rate of 75 A320s per month, operating final assembly facilities in five countries (including two in North America) and seeking to position itself as the leader in sustainability. This raises the question: Why is it operating an antiquated supply chain for aircraft produced in North America?

Consider the Airbus wing supply chain for A320 wings assembled in Mobile, Alabama. Raw material, mostly aluminum, comes from mills in Europe and North America. It is shipped to component manufacturers for skins, ribs, stringers, winglets and control surfaces in Austria, France, Germany, Italy, South Korea, the UK and other countries. These components are then shipped to its wing fabrication facility in Broughton, England. Fully completed wings are shipped via a Beluga aircraft to Germany. There, they are loaded onto a specialized ship for a multiweek journey to Mobile, Alabama. These wings are then mated at the final assembly facility to other major assemblies, which also come from Europe.

Really?

This is closer to a 19th century mercantilist supply chain than a leading aerospace OEM 30 years after the Toyota Production System—which emphasizes speed and proximity of major Tier 1 suppliers to final assembly—became the global benchmark for manufacturing productivity.

It is time for Airbus to create a North American supply chain to match its soaring ambitions. The logic is compelling. First, it creates additional manufacturing capacity when the company needs it most. It is no secret that Airbus is at loggerheads with key suppliers as it pursues ever higher production rates for the A220, A320neo and other aircraft. The updated supply chain also would tap into North America’s low energy costs and relatively flexible labor compared to Europe. Importantly, this would provide a currency hedge for a company that sells its jetliners in U.S. dollars yet sources 74% of its spending from Europe. Just 19% is sourced from North America (principally engines and components), where it employs just 5.5% of its workforce.

From a financial perspective, a North American supply chain would speed up Airbus’ cash conversion cycle. Owning enormously expensive subassemblies stuck on ships for weeks is hardly a recipe for financial success or asset productivity. The revised supply chain also would expand Airbus’s defense opportunities in the lucrative and vast U.S. defense sector. Placing production facilities in strategic states would expand its U.S. political influence and improve its odds of winning a future defense program—such as the KC-Y next-generation tanker.

Resilience is another reason to diversify. If the COVID-19 crisis taught manufacturers anything, it is that redundant and more regional and local supply chains offer critical defense against black swan events and soaring shipping costs.

Finally, a North American supply chain would help Airbus meet one of its hallmark goals: sustainability. Its dispersed global supply chain, which supports seven final assembly facilities in five countries, consumes a lot of energy. Nearly 20% of the 3,774 GWh that Airbus consumes annually to produce aircraft is spent on operating its Beluga and maritime fleet as well as ground transportation. Local supply chains are greener.

Airbus should set up wing, fuselage and perhaps empennage production facilities in North America, supported by local subtier suppliers. Airbus need not own all these facilities; it could encourage its current suppliers to invest. Or it could tap into the rich aerostructures capability in the region—from suppliers such as Spirit AeroSystems (the world’s largest aerostructures supplier) or Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Aerospace Canada, a wing specialist in Ontario. Local subtier suppliers, coping with Boeing’s struggles and the aftermath of the COVID-19 crisis, would welcome the additional work.

The timing for supply chain modernization is perfect. It would relieve the pressure on Airbus’ European suppliers to invest in additional capacity, and it would position Airbus to be a more diversified aerospace OEM at a time when global defense budgets are surging.

This idea is not without risk. Aerostructures manufacturing is a notoriously low-profit endeavor, and some business cases for new capacity could be difficult to close. Airbus also would have to cope with the inevitable learning curve and quality escapes associated with new facilities and suppliers. And the OEM would have to deal with political blowback from European governments and labor unions.

Market leadership, however, entails taking risks and updated business models. It is time for Airbus to “think globally and produce locally” and update its supply chain model in North America.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9980800151824951}",neutral,0.9980800151824951,0
Airbus is Teaching Planes to Land Themselves - Datanami,"Wed, 18 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhdGFuYW1pLmNvbS8yMDIzLzAxLzE4L2FpcmJ1cy1pcy10ZWFjaGluZy1wbGFuZXMtdG8tbGFuZC10aGVtc2VsdmVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Most people are familiar with autopilot, the system that controls an airplane’s speed, altitude, and heading under the watch of trained pilots. For the most part, pilots are still in charge of takeoffs and landings, but what if elements of those crucial manual tasks could be automated as well?

Airbus has announced it is in the final testing phase of DragonFly, an autonomous technology designed for automated landing, taxiing, and diversions that uses computer vision, sensors, and guidance calculations derived from flight data. “DragonFly has now entered the final three months of its testing phase, which will put its flightpath capability, automated landing technology, and pilot assistance technology through its paces,” the company stated in a news release. The new technology is being tested by Airbus UpNext, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Airbus.

Taxi assistance features were tested in real-time conditions at Toulouse-Blagnac Airport, where the technology reacted to obstacles by giving audio alerts to the crew, assisted with speed control, and used an airport map to guide aircraft to designated runways.

“These tests are one of several steps in the methodical research of technologies to further enhance operations and improve safety,” said Isabelle Lacaze, head of DragonFly demonstrator at Airbus UpNext, in a release. “Inspired by biomimicry, the systems being tested have been designed to identify features in the landscape that enable an aircraft to ‘see’ and safely maneuver autonomously within its surroundings, in the same way that dragonflies are known to have the ability to recognize landmarks.” The French aircraft manufacturer says it was inspired by the 360-degree vision of dragonflies that allows the insects to recognize landmarks and define territorial boundaries.

Internet of Things (IoT) technology like sensors and CV are already in use in the highly regulated aviation industry. IoT applications and devices can assist with many aspects of flight safety and efficiency. For instance, in the area of aircraft maintenance, IoT sensors can provide real-time monitoring of aircraft systems and detect equipment problems before an incident occurs. If unforeseen weather conditions cause a need to change a flight path, predictive systems can help reroute the aircraft to safer skies. There are even sensors that collect data on cabin conditions like temperature, noise, and humidity levels for optimizing passenger comfort.

So far, DragonFly is being marketed for safety, as Airbus claims it is meant to de-risk emergency operations and assist pilots who may become incapacitated during flight or landing: “If the crew are unable to control the aircraft, the onboard function detects the issue and automatically selects the most suitable airport to redirect the aircraft towards,” Airbus said. External factors like flight zones, terrain, and weather are always changing, and the company asserts that DragonFly maintains a constant channel of communication between the aircraft and air traffic control, though it is not clear how that will occur without vocal interaction.

Despite this “for emergencies only” spin, it’s easy to see how this technology could advance toward eventually eliminating one or both pilots in a cockpit for reasons such as cost savings or staff shortages. Airbus says the current testing is aimed at evaluating the feasibility of further exploring autonomous flight systems in support of safer and more efficient operations.

Tony Lucas, an Airbus A330 captain and president of the Australian and International Pilots Association, seems to agree. The pilot was interviewed live on Sky News Australia about his thoughts on DragonFly: “I think what they’re trying to achieve is a situation where you can remove a pilot from the flight deck. [With] the way our flight decks are set up at the moment, it’s very difficult for me to see out of the right side of the airplane at all. That’s why I need a first officer sitting beside me,” he gave as an example.

Lucas is not convinced that any technology could replace well-trained pilots and sees anything that reduces pilots’ capacity for decision making as a retrograde step in aviation. “I think it’s a shortsighted thing to be trying because, at the end of the day, flying is a team sport. There’s a whole decision-making chain that relies on two [pilots] to make decisions efficiently and effectively.”

He seems especially skeptical about the claims that DragonFly could help in an emergency situation: “When things go wrong in an airplane, they tend to go wrong fairly quickly, and it frequently takes the combined efforts of two well-trained pilots to be able to respond to those situations,” said Lucas.

Airbus Progresses With Folding-Wing Project - Aviation Week,"Wed, 04 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9haXItdHJhbnNwb3J0L2FpcmJ1cy1wcm9ncmVzc2VzLWZvbGRpbmctd2luZy1wcm9qZWN00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"One of the principles engineers follow when designing an aircraft is that it must withstand rare instances of extreme conditions. That approach is used in the design of the wing, a part of the airframe that may have to face exceptional turbulence. Engineers make the wing’s structure strong enough for those occurrences, adding weight in the process. Therefore, for most flights, the wing is heavier than necessary.

What if that design margin could be eliminated? That is exactly what engineers at UpNext, Airbus’ technology innovation arm, are endeavoring to do.

UpNext’s “Extra Performance Wing” targets efficiency

Morphing-wing concept to become a reality

The design of the OEM’s Extra Performance Wing combines the reduced drag of a high-aspect-ratio wing with the greater efficiency of an adaptive profile. Whereas a greater wingspan usually comes with increased weight, engineers will test features that should keep the weight unchanged.

They are making gradual progress toward the first flight of an Extra Performance Wing—on a modified business jet—aiming at a 5-10% improvement in fuel consumption.

UpNext relies on so-called agile methods, enabling fast evaluation of the technologies. The timing of the program makes it compatible with the launch of a next-generation single-aisle aircraft.

“All the technologies will be validated in a relevant environment by the end of 2024,” says Sebastien Blanc, UpNext technical director for the Extra Performance Wing. That stage corresponds to Technology Readiness Level 6, which OEMs usually take as the basis for a full product development.

UpNext has purchased a pre-owned Cessna Citation VII. The technology arm plans to replace the original wing with an extended, composite one measuring approximately 20 m (66 ft.) in span, including 2-m movable tip sections.

Increasing the aspect ratio reduces the wingtip vortex and therefore drag. However, as the wing must be able to withstand extreme turbulence, increasing the span generally calls for strengthening its structure. In turn, the weight grows.

“The overall objective is to make the greater aspect ratio neutral in terms of weight,” Blanc says. “That requires active control.”

At the root of the wingtip extension, a semi-aeroelastic hinge is triggered in cases of strong turbulence. That hinge frees the wingtip to flap and alleviates the loads induced in the wing structure by that turbulence. The need for reinforcements is eliminated.

The hinge is designed to be activated by a mechanism incorporating a drive-gear system and clutch. The electro-mechanical system, which is being developed by Curtiss-Wright, also will be able to position the wingtip to specific angles for various flight modes, as well as takeoff and landing. In addition, the hinge will be used to keep the wingspan compatible with airport infrastructures.

The demonstration wing’s trailing edge will be fitted with three flaps, each with four multifunctional trailing edges, or tabs, which can change position very fast. “Like a bird’s wing, the demonstrator’s wing will adapt to flight conditions: altitude, speed and aircraft weight,” Blanc says. The flaps can retract, thus modifying the chord. Also to make the morphing-wing concept a reality, tabs can move to alter camber.

Just as with the semi-aeroelastic hinge, the additional control surfaces also help curb wing load in demanding maneuvers and strong turbulence. Pop-up spoilers, to be found on the folding wingtips and possibly elsewhere, will contribute as well, Blanc says.

Another result of the additional control surfaces is passenger comfort, as they can limit vertical acceleration in turbulence, Blanc says. In addition, they can control the flutter induced by the more flexible wing, itself a consequence of the greater aspect ratio.

The Citation VII will be transformed into an uncrewed aircraft and the wing flight-tested remotely. “The idea is that such a breakthrough technology will be evaluated to the limits,” Blanc says.

Antennas and probes, to be used with the remote-control system, are being installed in Toulouse. Flight testing of the slightly modified Citation VII will involve on-board pilots in 2023.

The new wing then will be put in place. A lidar involving two lasers will be installed simultaneously in the cockpit, making the system able to anticipate turbulence 0.5-1 sec. ahead and move the control surfaces accordingly.

Set for the second half of 2024, the flight-test campaign is planned to last about 100 flight hours. It will take place in an area measuring 200 km (124 mi.) in radius from the French Air and Space Force base in Cazaux. Airbus test pilots will conduct the flight-test program from the ground.

The wing will be representative of a 52-m wing on a single-aisle aircraft, whereas the A320 family uses a 36-m wing. “All the learnings from the reduced-scale wing on the Citation VII may be applied to a future aircraft wing design, for any platform, using any fuel,” Blanc says. The data would be scaled up by using computational models, such as factoring in the difference in Reynolds number.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.8704543709754944}",neutral,0.8704543709754944,0

The A350F’s will allow the airline to retire its existing older generation freighters and replace them with a clean sheet cargo aircraft that offers a big step towards more sustainable cargo operations.



“We are delighted to make this major step forward to the A350F. It accelerates Air France KLM Martinair Cargo sustainability ambitions with significant improvement on fuel emissions and complying with most stringent ICAO Chapter 14 for noise and CAEP 8 for NOx. We are fit for the future!” said Adriaan den Heijer, Executive Vice President Air France KLM Cargo and Managing Director Martinair.

“Another A350F endorsement, and a great one too! We are delighted to see the A350F enter the KLM/Martinair world, confirming the relevance this most modern high capacity long range cargo aircraft brings to the airfreight segment. I am very pleased with the way our program is taking off. With 50% less noise, and 40% less fuel burn and CO 2 emissions compared to the previous generation aircraft it is replacing, that is hardly a surprise! We thank Air France-KLM Group for their continued confidence.” said Christian Scherer, Airbus Chief Commercial Officer and Head of Airbus International.



The A350F is based on the world's most modern long range leader, the A350. The aircraft will feature the largest main deck cargo door and a fuselage length optimised for cargo operations. Over 70% of the airframe is made of advanced materials resulting in a minimum 30 tonnes lighter take-off weight, which together with efficient Rolls-Royce engines generate an advantage of at least 20% lower fuel burn and CO 2 emission over its current closest competitor. Delivery to Martinair will be in time to comply with the latest ICAO CO 2 emissions standards that will come into effect by the end of 2027. With a 109 tonnes payload capability (+3t payload / 11% more volume than its competition), the A350F serves all cargo markets (Express, general cargo, special cargo…).

Launched in 2021, the A350F recorded 35 orders from seven customers.

The system, called DragonFly, tackles automated operations like diversions, landings, and taxi procedures through a combination of sensors, computer vision algorithms and robust guidance calculations.

Airbus pitches the system as an extra layer of safety for emergency operations.

""In the unlikely situation where a crew is unable to control the aircraft, DragonFly can redirect the flight to the nearest appropriate airport and facilitate a safe landing,"" enthused the aerospace corporation. The eventual hope is for the technologies to pave the way for automated landing – or at least compensate for a less than perfect pilot during an emergency situation. If the captain had the fish, for example.

A marketing video of the Airbus UpNext DragonFly details that a safe landing feature is included in the Automated Emergency Ops application. It works by detecting the most suitable airport for landing and calculates a trajectory to get there, with consideration for weather, military zones and other factors.

YouTube Video

Airbus assures viewers that Air Traffic Control (ATC) and Operations Control Center (OCC) communication links are in place. The video does not, however, explain how the aircraft communicates with air traffic control for clearance into controlled airspace if the pilot is incapacitated, as that task is completed through human verbal interaction.

An automated landing is assisted by sensors that enhance the view of the runway, computer vision algorithms, and guidance computation.

Furthermore, the demonstrator is kitted out with a pilot taxi assistance application to manage its maneuvers on the ground in a heavily trafficked airport. Air traffic control clearance is interpreted and translated into taxi guidance cues. Crew receive audio alerts in reaction to obstacles, assisted speed control and an interactive airport map.

The taxi assistance element was tested at Toulouse-Blagnac Airport.

""The functionality frees up the crew to focus on other crucial actions,"" said Airbus.

Here's hoping disengaged pilots with an automated system are less of a concern than car drivers.

The subsidiary reckons one day DragonFly will allow for automatic landing at any airport, regardless of whether the ground equipment is equipped for such landings.

Airbus UpNext has pitched DragonFly as a biomimicry project with its namesake as the inspiration. A photo is on display to prove it.

""In the same way that dragonflies can recognize landmarks that help them to define boundaries, our demonstrator is equipped with cutting-edge sensing technology and software, capable of managing in-flight and landing operations,"" said head of DragonFly Isabelle Lacaze.

""A dragonfly has phenomenal vision, the ability to see in 360°, and can recognize landmarks, which in turn help it to define its territorial boundaries,"" explained Airbus. ""The systems we are developing and testing are similarly designed to review and identify features in the landscape that enable the aircraft to 'see' and safely maneuver within its surroundings."" ®","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999216794967651}",neutral,0.9999216794967651,0
Airbus and Boeing 2022 orders and deliveries - Leeham News and Analysis,"Tue, 10 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMy8wMS8xMC9haXJidXMtYW5kLWJvZWluZy0yMDIyLW9yZGVycy1hbmQtZGVsaXZlcmllcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Bjorn Fehrm

January 10, 2023, © Leeham News: Airbus and Boeing released their 2022 delivery and order data today. With a delivery of 661 airliners, Airbus is a 38% larger supplier than Boeing at 480 aircraft.

Airbus had a target of 700 deliveries but came short due to supplier constraints in a year of COVID recovery, raising energy prices due to the war in Ukraine and labor shortages. Boeing is not out of a tunnel caused by 737 Max crashes and 787 quality problems.

On the order side, Airbus booked 820 net orders versus Boeing’s 774. The Airbus backlog is 33% larger at 7,239 aircraft versus Boeing’s 5,430 jets.

Airbus’ 2022

Airbus hosted a question and answer with CEO Guillame Faury and Chief Commercial Officer Christian Scherer after the publication of the data. It also publicized an infographic that puts the 2022 figures in perspective, Figure 1.

The orders were 62% higher than in 2021, and Scherer said that single aisle orders are now delivery slot limited with the first free slot in 2029.

Widebody orders have picked up, which is less visible as the year includes large widebody cancellations from AirAsia (a reset of its inflated A330-900 order) and A350-1000 cancellations from Qatar Airways, as seen in Figure 2.

The modest Airbus delivery increase of 8% from 611 in 2021 to 661 aircraft for 2022 was partly due to the more complex A321 now out-delivering the A320 for the first time (264 versus 246), but also because the A220 doesn’t increase more than three units (53 versus 50). The supply chain is the limiting factor for these product lines, as Airbus had hoped to deliver more aircraft.

The 661 deliveries shall be compared with 863 before COVID. Airbus high single-aisle sales put pressure on deliveries, and Faury said the delivery rate increase is still 65 per month by 2024, up from last year’s 43 per month. By “the mid-decade,” Airbus wants to be at 75 A321/A320 per month.

The A330 line has seen a 78% increase in deliveries at 2.7 per month instead of 1.5 per month in 2021. According to Scherer, the sales are healthy, masked by AirAsia resetting its old order for 78 A330-900 to 15.

A350 was produced at rate five during 2022 with 60 deliveries compared with 55 during 2021. The 60 includes a reduction of two Aeroflot machines that were recorded as delivered 2021, but where the actual fly-out to Russia could not be done due to sanctions.

Boeing’s 2022

Boeing has net orders of 774 jets and delivered 480 commercial aircraft during 2022, an increase in sales of 62% from 479 orders in 2021 and an increase in deliveries of 41% compared with 340 in 2021.

The different programs ran as follows:

737 had 561 orders versus 749 in 2021 and deliveries of 387 versus 263 the year before.

767 had 31 orders versus 38 in 2021. Boeing delivered 33 767s versus 32 during 2022

For 777, the numbers were 68 (53) and an even 24 deliveries for both years

The 787 had 114 orders in 2022 versus 21 2021. Deliveries reached 31 versus 14 for 2021

Finally, 747 had no order in 2022 versus five 2021 and five deliveries versus seven.

The numbers show how Boeing is still suffering from its MAX debacle, where the delivery rate during 2022 only reached 32 per month for the 737 despite a large stock of produced aircraft.

The 787 manufacturing problems are halfway resolved, with a doubling of deliveries to 31 in 2022, despite a late restart of deliveries in 3Q2022.

Airbus Training: 50 years of innovation for our customers - Airbus Aircraft,"Thu, 26 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vYWlyY3JhZnQuYWlyYnVzLmNvbS9lbi9uZXdzcm9vbS9uZXdzLzIwMjMtMDEtYWlyYnVzLXRyYWluaW5nLTUwLXllYXJzLW9mLWlubm92YXRpb24tZm9yLW91ci1jdXN0b21lcnPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"For five decades, Airbus has been adapting and innovating to provide world-class training to thousands of pilots and mechanics around the world.

Recently, Airbus presented a new concept in recurrent pilot training: Evidence-Based Training (EBT). This solution is one of the latest examples of Airbus' 50 years of adaptation and innovation in the training sector.

Airbus recognised early on the need for pilots and maintenance personnel to continually develop the skills they need to operate itstechnologically innovative aircraft. In December 1972, the company and its partner FSI founded the GIE Aeroformation, which became Airbus Training in 1994.

50 years training - 2

Led by Jean Pinet, a test pilot who contributed to the development of Concorde, Aeroformation defined and implementedoriginal training methods for the supersonic aircraft’s crews as well as Airbus Family aircraft, from the A300 to the A340 and A320.

During the early 1970s, when the importance of training as a factor in safety and operational efficiency was becoming apparent, Aeroformation defined three fundamental training principles: teaching the ‘need to know’ - ‘learning by doing’ - ‘teaching to proficiency’. These principles have endured to the present day. Enriched by other developments, such as adapting each programme to the level of the trainees, from 1987 onwards, Airbus training is now globally-recognised as best-in-class.

Aeronautical training requires regular updating and adaptation. Aeroformation, and later Airbus Training, have constantly improved their teaching methods. The computerisation of the Toulouse Training Centre in 1980, the advent of Computer Based Training and the introduction of laptop PCs the same year, followed by the innovation and integration of Video And Computer Based Instruction (VACBI), starting with the A310, were all important steps.

50 years training - 3

The use of simulators was first initiated with a mock-up of model scenery and moving cameras, to eventually become the full flight simulator with motion that we know today. Aeroformation saw the number of its full flight simulators increase from one to six between 1974 and 1994. Today Airbus Training has43 simulators in its worldwide network. At the same time, other trainee communities such as flight attendants and aircraft maintenance specialists have also been able to benefit from simulator-based training adapted to all Airbus programmes.

50 years training - 1

The Airbus Flight Training Reference, created in 2015, marked the beginning of a redesign of the different training programmes into a single, global programme. Later, in 2019 saw the launch of an 'ab initio' programme for student pilots. For the first time, Airbus had created a training programme spanning the entire flying curriculum, from absolute beginners to Air Operations (Ops) training. Since 2016, Maintenance Training has been developed in line with this concept, in conjunction with schools and universities to better prepare future maintenance technicians and engineers.

50 years training - 6

For several years now, digitalisation, virtual reality, holograms and augmented reality have been investigated and developed into training systems, whenever their use can bring added value. ""Our objective remains to optimise efficiency, quality and the overall training experience,"" emphasises Maïa Kuilenberg, Head of Airbus Training.

The deployment of these technologies was accelerated by the Covid-19 crisis. Airbus Training had to implement remote solutions to continue its mission, when physical contact was no longer possible.

Airbus Training has developed its global presence to meet the needs of its customers. 14 training centres compose the network, including Miami – opened in 1985 – and Beijing – opened in 1993 – as well as two flight schools and 5 maintenance training partners.

In the years to come, Airbus Training will continue to pursue a stronger global presence and further remote solutions. Its objective is to expand its network and partnerships in order to spread the 'Airbus Training Reference' philosophy, which guarantees the quality of Airbus training, always at the service of its trainees.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.6605929136276245}",positive,0.6605929136276245,1

Airbus Spools Up For Major A380 Demonstrator Campaign - Aviation Week,"Thu, 12 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9tcm8vZW1lcmdpbmctdGVjaG5vbG9naWVzL2FpcmJ1cy1zcG9vbHMtbWFqb3ItYTM4MC1kZW1vbnN0cmF0b3ItY2FtcGFpZ27SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has provided more detail about the accelerating design work underway on two A380 technology demonstrators targeting advanced propulsion evaluations for next-gen single-aisles planned for launch in the 2027-28 timeframe.

The airframer is collaborating with GE Aerospace and Safran Aircraft Engines joint venture CFM International on two major flight-test programs that will run almost concurrently. One A380 will be used to evaluate a GE Passport engine modified for direct combustion of hydrogen fuel while the second will flight test the open-fan propulsion system being developed under CFM’s Revolutionary Innovation for Sustainable Engines (RISE) program.

In November 2022, Airbus revealed the hydrogen-fueled Passport A380 test-bed will also be adapted to evaluate a hydrogen-fuel-cell-powered high-speed propeller engine. The 2.1-megawatt engine, resembling a conventional turboprop, will be fitted on the same upper-fuselage wing stub that is also being designed to test the Passport. The fuel-cell engine test campaign is scheduled for the same period, 2026-28.

Hydrogen tested as separate system

Both technologies use liquid hydrogen and are being explored in parallel, says Glenn Llewellyn, Airbus vice president for zero-emission aircraft. A decision will be made later, in time for entry into service by 2035, he adds.

Although both testbeds are not due to enter flight until after the middle of this decade, work on the sophisticated demonstrators is already getting underway, says Frank Haselbach, head of propulsion engineering at Airbus. “The teams are spooling up. We’re having good cooperation with CFM on both programs so we’re quite happy about that,” he says.

Both the RISE and hydrogen flight-test campaigns form part of Airbus’ technology push toward a “ZEROe” carbon-neutral airliner for service entry by 2035. The modified A380s will be used to conduct tests in the second half of this decade based at the company’s flight-test facility in Toulouse. Ahead of the A380 test flights, CFM will perform engine ground tests, along with flight-test validation on GE’s Boeing 747-400 flying testbed at GE Aerospace’s Flight Test Operations center in Victorville, California.

The hydrogen test effort is aimed at “how we actually make sure that we have a safe or safer operation than today with such a sustainable aircraft—and that includes things like liquid hydrogen, because with gaseous hydrogen you wouldn’t get the range,” Haselbach says. Focus areas will include tests of higher-density liquid hydrogen, storage tank and fuel-system distribution technology, ground and flight operations, fueling infrastructure and combustor design.

“But to really make this meaningful, we decided to put it toward a flight test that also helps to drive the teams together and gets us thinking about how we get this integrated into the aircraft,” Haselbach adds. “How do we make it safe for flight, even in an experimental environment? That was the key decision here.”

The A380 hydrogen testbed is still “a technology demonstration and by no means a product,” he emphasizes. “It will give us the answers we need, and working toward a flight demonstration helps to actually do it with the right focus.” The demonstrator will be modified to carry the Passport on a pylon projecting from the aft fuselage of the A380, while the interior will be equipped with liquid-hydrogen tanks.

“We could have done it on a smaller platform than an A380, but it will be good to actually have more space. Also, the layout of the fuselage structure enables us to have a reasonably short distance between the tank and the engine, so all of that actually helped a little bit,” Haselbach says.

“In addition, you can almost set up the entire hydrogen test system as a separate section or area on the aircraft,” he continues. “We’re not going to be interacting with any of the other systems, so rather than modify the fuel and propulsion system on an existing aircraft, it made a lot more sense to develop this as a pure flying testbed.”

For the hydrogen fuel-cell work, Airbus has been cooperating with power specialist company ElringKlinger; the two formed a joint venture in 2020 called Aerostack. The fuel cell in the test engine uses a scalable arrangement that puts together cells in stacks and channels. The test engine is being assembled in Hamburg, Germany, and has been assessed at the subsystem level. Airbus says electric motor tests are also underway.

“At scale, and if the technology targets were achieved, fuel-cell engines may be able to power a 100-passenger aircraft with a range of approximately 1,000 nm,” Llewellyn says. “We are giving ourselves additional options that will inform our decisions on the architecture of our future ZEROe aircraft.”

A hydrogen fuel cell and its associated electric motor and propeller are expected to be more efficient than burning hydrogen in a gas turbine. Other benefits include the absence of NOx and an even lower probability of forming contrails, which are proved to contribute to global warming.

The RISE demonstrator on the A380 is aimed at testing the potential fuel-burn savings from CFM’s open-fan configuration and will be the first single rotating and stator-stage tractor configuration of its type to be flight tested at full scale. “We’ve seen the fairly promising concept of the open fan before in the 1980s and 2000s, and so this is really the third time,” Haselbach says. “It’s still a technology demonstration and not a product concept at all today, but clearly it is a promising offering because you have a single fan rotating rather than two counter-rotating. That makes noise management easier, and the mechanics are simpler.”

Building on previous open-rotor and propfan concepts and demonstrators, RISE takes the approach to new levels, he adds. “Now you have the adjustability of the fan and the stator, and that gives you effectively a high-performance sort of low-pressure system at a good sort of cruising Mach number. The second stage takes the swirl out, so that’s the key benefit. Otherwise, a normal turboprop would actually fall off [in performance] at around Mach 0.6 or thereabouts,” Haselbach says.

The open-fan demonstrator will be fitted with a large support pylon on the No. 2 inboard left engine test position. The inboard wing structure and adjacent areas of the fuselage also will be reinforced to accommodate the CFM engine, which is currently expected to feature a rotor diameter of around 13 ft.

“We will be looking at the aerodynamic integration of that concept because it’s quite a big fan,” he notes. “Specifically, this means studying how it will interact with the lift/drag ratio of the wing and the structural interaction in terms of the moments that an open fan generates with extra forces,” Haselbach says. Other areas will include acoustic evaluations—both in terms of community and cabin noise as well as monitoring of interactive noise generated between the fan and the stator.

“From what we have seen so far of this in simulation, the first set of work is quite promising,” he notes. “Not everything is solved, but it’s actually good enough to say ‘OK, let’s have a closer look.’ And that’s exactly what we have decided to do together.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999991774559021}",neutral,0.999991774559021,0
Towards climate studies using quantum technologies - Airbus,"Wed, 18 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIzLTAxLXRvd2FyZHMtY2xpbWF0ZS1zdHVkaWVzLXVzaW5nLXF1YW50dW0tdGVjaG5vbG9naWVz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The impact of climate change is one of the most severe challenges of the 21st century. It is therefore of high importance to understand the underlying processes and causalities. A powerful tool to gain this vital knowledge on a global scale is the satellite-based observation of changes in Earth’s mass distribution e.g. from melting glaciers or loss of groundwater. The required high-precision measurements are reachable with novel quantum sensors. Due to the extensive European heritage and a close collaboration within the European Union an independent development and operation of a quantum sensor based space mission can be realised.

On December 14th, 2022, the CARIOQA-PMP project (Cold Atom Rubidium Interferometer in Orbit for Quantum Accelerometry – Pathfinder Mission Preparation) under the European Commission’s Horizon Europe program was kicked off with the aim to develop such a quantum sensor for space application. European industry in collaboration with European research institutions will build an engineering model of an accelerometer based on atom interferometry for a Quantum Space Gravimetry pathfinder mission. Benefitting from the heritage of its research institutions, this project aims to bring Europe into a leading position for sustainable quantum technologies in space.

Atom interferometry is a powerful tool for high-precision measurements of Earth’s gravitational field. It profits from the quantum properties of atoms that serve as a test mass. The sensitivity of atom interferometers with respect to gravity can be increased using long free-fall times that are available in space. In orbit, these devices can be used to observe global processes like a rise of the sea level with unrivaled sensitivity. However, their adaptation and qualification for space is challenging. The CARIOQA-PMP project will mature these quantum sensors and therefore prepare the ground for future high-precision gravimetry missions in space.

CARIOQA-PMP brings together leading players from five EU countries. These include experts in satellite instrument development (Airbus, iXblue, TELETEL, LEONARDO), in quantum sensing (LUH, SYRTE, LP2N, LCAR, ONERA, FORTH), space geodesy, Earth sciences and users of gravity field data (LUH, TUM, POLIMI, DTU), as well as in impact maximisation and assessment (G.A.C. Group). The pathfinder mission preparation is coordinated by the French and German space agencies CNES and DLR under CNES lead.

Airbus Defence and Space will lead the instrument development and integration. Additionally, Airbus will be responsible for the design, construction and initial operation of the sensor head, the so-called Physics Package, including an ultrahigh vacuum chamber, the atomic reservoir, the magnetic shield as well as surrounding optics and electronics. After verification of the source preparation, the engineering model modules will be integrated at CNES facilities in Toulouse.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9978556036949158}",neutral,0.9978556036949158,0

In July 2022, the European Commission selected, among others, eight collaborative projects that Airbus is part of, covering different innovative technology areas. The EDF promotes cooperation among European companies and research institutes of different sizes and geographical origin in the EU, strengthening the resiliency and strategic autonomy of Europe.

Among the 61 collaborative defence R&T and R&D projects that were selected and funded with €1.2 billion, Airbus Defence and Space is coordinating the European Defence Operational Collaborative Cloud (EDOCC) project, while Airbus Helicopters is coordinating the EU Next Generation Rotorcraft Technologies Project (ENGRT). The contracts for these projects were signed in December 2022.

EDOCC will create a virtual platform to increase the interoperability, efficiency and resiliency of military operations, which will strengthen collaborative services on the battlefield. The project will study, design and conceptually validate the virtual platform and develop the first version of a services catalogue while identifying appropriate standards and technologies for high performance and interoperability.

ENGRT will focus on analyzing and understanding the needs of European armed forces for rotorcraft operations beyond 2030. The project's partners will study military rotorcraft concept of operations and define key technologies needed for future military rotorcraft. Alternative rotorcraft concepts and architectures will be explored. This project will pave the way for the next generation of military rotorcraft in Europe.

DALLAS – Seattle-based Alaska Airlines (AS) retired its Airbus A320ceo family aircraft fleet with N849VA completing the last revenue flight on Monday.

The final flight went from Seattle (SEA) to Los Angeles (LAX) as AS1196, which departed at 20:37 local and landed at 22:58, thus marking the end of the type within the AS fleet.

Subsequently, N849VA was flown to Victorville (VCV) on Tuesday afternoon as AS9800. Brandon Farris, Airways Director of Photography, was on hand at SeaTac Airport on Monday morning, managing to capture the sendoff of two of the A320s to storage.

Alaska’s Airbus’

Alaska acquired its Airbus A320s from the merger with Virgin America (VX) in 2016, which included a mix of A321neos, A320s and A319s, with the latter retired in 2020 at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Before that, however, AS had never previously operated or owned any Airbus aircraft. In total, Alaska received 73 Airbus aircraft from the merger, the bulk of them being A320s.

Winner Winner, “Proudly All Boeing”

Besides the A320 family aircraft fleet, AS also inherited from Virgin America an order for 30 additional Airbus A320neos. After several deferments, the carrier opted to cancel the order in the third quarter of 2021 after announcing its future flight plans, relying on the Boeing 737 MAX family aircraft instead.

According to information from planespotters.net, AS took delivery of 26 Boeing 737-9 in 2022, including nine aircraft originally built for other airlines but not taken up. As of the publishing date of this story, AS mainline fleet comprises 214 aircraft, of which 204 are Boeing 737s.

Alaska Airlines plans to operate a small fleet of Airbus A321neos, which also came from the merger with Virgin America, and are expected to remain in the fleet until January 2024, as leasing terms expire.

The announcement of this phase-out took place at the March 2022 investor conference, when the airline also announced plans to retire its Bombardier Dash 8 Q400s, expected to leave the AS fleet later this month.

The partnership will bring together CERN’s expertise in superconducting technologies for particle accelerators and Airbus UpNext’s capabilities in aircraft design and manufacturing to develop a demonstrator known as SCALE (Super-Conductor for Aviation with Low Emissions).

Superconducting technologies could drastically reduce the weight of next-generation aircraft and increase their efficiency. If its expected performances and reliability objectives are achieved, the CERN–Airbus collaboration could reach the ambitious target of flying a fully integrated prototype within the next decade, says the firm. The joint initiative seeks to develop and test in laboratory conditions, an optimised generic superconductor cryogenic (~500 kW) powertrain by the end of 2025. SCALE will be designed, constructed and tested by CERN using Airbus UpNext specifications and CERN technology. It will consist of a DC link (cable and cryostat) with two current leads, and a cooling system based on gaseous helium.

“Partnering with a leading research institute like CERN, which has brought the world some of the most important findings in fundamental physics, will help to push the boundaries of research in clean aerospace as we work to make sustainable aviation a reality,” said Sandra Bour-Schaeffer, CEO of Airbus UpNext. “We are already developing a superconductivity demonstrator called ASCEND (Advanced Superconducting and Cryogenic Experimental powertrain Demonstrator) to study the feasibility of this technology for electrically powered and hybrid aircraft. Combining knowledge obtained from our demonstrator and CERN’s unique capabilities in the field of superconductors makes for a natural partnership.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9874793887138367}",neutral,0.9874793887138367,0
Airbus and Boeing jet delivery delays spark penalties battle - CNBC,"Wed, 18 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDEvMTgvYWlyYnVzLWFuZC1ib2VpbmctamV0LWRlbGl2ZXJ5LWRlbGF5cy1zcGFyay1wZW5hbHRpZXMtYmF0dGxlLmh0bWzSAWVodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS9hbXAvMjAyMy8wMS8xOC9haXJidXMtYW5kLWJvZWluZy1qZXQtZGVsaXZlcnktZGVsYXlzLXNwYXJrLXBlbmFsdGllcy1iYXR0bGUuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"An Airbus A321 is being assembled in the final assembly line hangar at the Airbus U.S. Manufacturing Facility in Mobile, Alabama September 13, 2015.

A battle for compensation is brewing over delays in the delivery of commercial jets, with a Dublin aviation summit descending into a blame game over the worst industrial disruption in years.

Airbus and Boeing are on average delivering new jetliners three-to-six months late, blaming post-pandemic havoc in supply chains, delegates at two major aviation finance conferences said.

Powerful leasing companies heaped pressure on planemakers over the delays, with Air Lease Executive Chairman Steven Udvar-Hazy telling this week's Airline Economics conference that manufacturers had ""grossly misjudged"" their output.

Airbus and Boeing defended their record, saying the situation is the result of a mix of factors, from the pandemic to weak supply chains, and a sudden snapback in travel demand.

The public exchanges reflect the battle lines in negotiations behind the scenes over whether manufacturers should bear contractual responsibility by paying penalties, even when suppliers are at fault, people involved in the discussions said.

With January already marked by fresh delay notices being sent to airlines and leasing companies, experts said millions of dollars of exposure are riding on one word: ""excusable"".

Aircraft contracts contain dense descriptions of adverse factors which excuse manufacturers for multiple types of delay, meaning they can avoid paying penalties or ""liquidated damages"".

Excusable delays include ""acts of God"", natural disasters, fire, flood, earthquakes and epidemics, among other examples, according to extracts of past contracts filed with regulators.

They may give the manufacturer a get-out in the event of a failure to obtain parts. Wars and strikes are also excusable.

Non-excusable delays include anything that falls outside this catalog, but are rare, experts say. Only the grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX over design defects was treated as a non-excusable delay on a significant scale, resulting in hefty compensation payments from Boeing, industry sources said.

With last year's deliveries below target and doubts rising over 2023, planemakers are once again invoking the ""excusable delay"" clause, buyers said. Airbus and Boeing declined comment on contractual matters.

But three years after the early spread of COVID-19, with demand now surging and China coming back onto the market, lessors used their annual summit to argue enough is enough.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9891024827957153}",negative,0.9891024827957153,-1

Airbus to Fly Inmarsat's Next-Gen Satellite to Florida - Payload,"Thu, 19 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiKWh0dHBzOi8vcGF5bG9hZHNwYWNlLmNvbS9haXJidXMtaW5tYXJzYXQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Breaking: Whale, Bird Will Skip Across Pond

This week, Inmarsat and Airbus announced the kind of complicated logistical operation that you can only see in the space sector. But for this specific mission, neither company is launching anything into space yet. Instead, they’re shipping a next-gen GEO satellite across the Atlantic.

Unpacking the announcement

Airbus Defense and Space will use its parent company’s A300-600ST Super Transporter aircraft—aka, the Beluga—to fly Inmarsat’s second I-6 satellite from a test facility in Toulouse, France, to Cape Canaveral. Beluga and I-6 will have multiple layovers en route to Florida to allow for refueling. Upon reaching the Cape, the I-6 will be processed and prepared for launch aboard a Falcon 9 in February.

Airbus Defense and Space built the I-6 twins in the UK and assembled them in Toulouse. It shipped the first I-6 to Japan last year using an Antonov air freighter. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries launched I-6 F1 from Japan in December 2021.

Precious cargo

Inmarsat awarded Airbus nearly $600M to build the two satellites back in 2015. The communication satellites have an expected 15-year lifetime and they’re beasts, weighing 5,470 kg apiece.

The technology in the I-6 F1 satellite

Bells and whistles

Inmarsat fitted its sixth-gen satellites with dual payloads, and the I-6 satellites will be able to transmit data over the L- and Ka-bands. Each satellite will have 20 Ka-band spot beams that the maritime/aviation connectivity provider can steer to users on a “second-by-second” basis.

The bigger picture

Pending regulatory approval, American operator Viasat will acquire Inmarsat, based in London, for $7.3B. And we’ll hear soon on that first piece. EU antitrust regulators say they’ll decide by Feb. 13 whether to let the deal move forward.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999946355819702}",neutral,0.9999946355819702,0

DALLAS — Flag carrier Azerbaijan Airlines (J2) is planning to modernize its fleet by introducing more narrow-body Airbus A320neos and twin-aisle Boeing 787 Dreamliners.

From its hub at Heydar Aliyev International Airport (GYD), the 30-year-old national carrier operates a diverse fleet of 24 aircraft: four A319s, 10 A320s, three A340s, one Boeing 757, three 767s, one 777, and two 787s.

The average age of these aircraft is 12.5 years; hence, the fleet overhaul. As of now, with three A320neos and two Boeing 787s, J2 functions well, but it is clear it is ready to revamp its fleet.

The airline has not revealed the number of A320neo and Boeing 787 aircraft it aims to acquire in the coming seven years.

A320, Dreamliner Benefits

With brand new and modern Airbus A320neos having comfortable 186 seats along with the latest technologies that aircraft possess, J2 will have a slight edge over its rivals.

The A320neo comes with new-generation, less noisy engines that provide more efficient and environmentally friendly results for the airline. It also consumes less fuel, resulting in less carbon dioxide and a more sustainable flight.

When discussing the Boeing 787-8 Dreamliners, the aircraft is, of course, built for comfort on long-haul flights. With a seating capacity of around 248 in a two-class configuration, it’s the finest aircraft in this product space. The type is fuel-efficient and capable of flying non-stop for a distance of 7,305 nautical miles (13,530 km).

With its planned fleet optimization, J2 hopes to strengthen its position in the international market and provide customers with affordable fare options.

Airbus tops Boeing in 2022 plane orders and deliveries - Tech Xplore,"Tue, 10 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaHhwbG9yZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIzLTAxLWFpcmJ1cy10b3BzLWJvZWluZy1wbGFuZS1kZWxpdmVyaWVzLmh0bWzSAUtodHRwczovL3RlY2h4cGxvcmUuY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMy0wMS1haXJidXMtdG9wcy1ib2VpbmctcGxhbmUtZGVsaXZlcmllcy5hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies .

Airbus led Boeing in terms of both deliveries and new orders in 2022.

Airbus consolidated its leadership in civil aviation for 2022 on Tuesday, reporting more orders and deliveries than American archrival Boeing as both companies contend with lingering supply chain challenges.

In terms of deliveries, Airbus finished the year having 661 planes arrive with clients, much higher than Boeing's 480.

But the Airbus lead in new contracts was slimmer, with its 820 net orders outpacing Boeing by just 12.

Still, the US giant notched a 40 percent jump in annual deliveries in its best year since 2018, prior to the lengthy global grounding of the 737 MAX after two deadly crashes and the massive travel downturn due to Covid-19.

Boeing's performance was plagued by a halt of more than one year to deliveries of the 787 Dreamliner, its other best-selling plane, which resumed deliveries only in August after an extensive back-and-forth with US air safety regulators.

""We worked hard in 2022 to stabilize 737 production, resume 787 deliveries, launch the 777-8 Freighter and, most importantly, meet our customer commitments,"" said Boeing Commercial Airplanes President Stan Deal.

""We will stay focused on driving stability within our operations and the supply chain as we work to deliver for our customers in 2023 and beyond,"" he added.

For Boeing, 2022 marks the fourth straight year it lagged Airbus by a wide margin in deliveries.

Engine trouble

At Airbus, deliveries rose eight percent from the 2021 level, but lagged the company's earlier targets due to lingering supply chain problems. The European giant had initially aimed for 720 deliveries in 2022.

The level of actual deliveries is ""obviously less than we were targeting but given the complexity of the operating environment I want to thank the teams and our partners for the hard work and the ultimate result,"" said Airbus Chief Executive Officer Guillaume Faury.

Key suppliers in aviation have struggled with labor shortages, difficulties tracking down key materials and volatile energy prices following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Both companies have been forced to reset expectations about their capacity to build planes as quickly as the industry would like.

This comes as airlines are eager to boost flight numbers to take advantage of pent-up travel demand from the pandemic, while also looking to improve fuel efficiency and lower their carbon footprint.

Airbus reduced its output of the A320 to 40 per month during the pandemic, while previously targeting a monthly level of 65 at end-2023. But the company has pushed back this goal to 2024, citing supply chain issues.

United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby and Stan Deal, head of Boeing's commercial division, signed a giant airplane order in December 2022 in South Carolina.

Boeing in particular pointed to engines as a constraint on raising production of the 737 MAX beyond the current level of 31 per month.

Boeing Chief Executive Dave Calhoun said in October that the company had made progress with suppliers in terms of understanding the problem, but it would not be until late 2023 ""before we can really make sizeable rate increases with respect to that constraint.""

For Boeing, 2022 marks the fourth straight year it has lagged Airbus by a wide margin in terms of deliveries, which are closely monitored by Wall Street because they are tied to company revenues.

But the company's fourth-quarter was its strongest of the year for deliveries.

During that period, Boeing also announced significant new orders, including an agreement with United Airlines to add 100 units of 787 planes, in a sign of strengthening demand for long-haul transport amid the travel recovery.

In November, at Boeing's first investor day since 2016, the company signaled its expectation to return to a period of more robust financial performance in the 2025 to 2026 timeframe, with free cash flow reaching $10 billion in that period.

Airbus insists A350 lightning-protection change unconnected to Qatar dispute - Flightglobal,"Thu, 19 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vc2FmZXR5L2FpcmJ1cy1pbnNpc3RzLWEzNTAtbGlnaHRuaW5nLXByb3RlY3Rpb24tY2hhbmdlLXVuY29ubmVjdGVkLXRvLXFhdGFyLWRpc3B1dGUvMTUxNzI3LmFydGljbGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Qatar Airways has highlighted Airbus’s introduction of an alternative to expanded copper foil for lightning protection on the A350, but the airframer insists it is not a reaction to its skin-paint dispute with the carrier.

The airframer attributes paint cracking on the A350 to different thermal expansion rates of the aircraft’s composite fuselage skin, paint layers, and the expanded foil, but insists this does not amount to a safety matter.

Qatar Airways, however, has grounded several A350s in response to the skin-paint issue and the situation is the subject of a high-profile legal dispute.

In skeleton arguments presented at the High Court in London on 19 January, Qatar Airways referred to the airframer’s introduction of an alternative lightning protection layer – formed from perforated copper foil – in its manufacturing.

It claims Airbus has implemented “certain changes to the design” of the A350 which are directed at preventing the surface degradation from appearing on newer aircraft.

These include introducing perforated copper foil instead of expanded copper foil, to avoid thermal stress concentrations and insufficient resin adherence, and making other changes to window frames and fasteners.

“Full details of all design changes are relevant to [Qatar Airways’] claim for specific performance of the A350 contract, and any decision on [Qatar’s] part as to whether to accept future deliveries of [redesigned] A350s,” the carrier states.

Airbus insists the use of perforated copper foil – used on parts of the aft fuselage, but not the wings, of aircraft delivered towards the end of last year – is unconnected to the Qatar dispute, but rather part of a weight-saving programme for the type.

The airframer filed a European patent on use of perforated copper foil for lightning protection in 2019, some two years before the Qatar grounding.

Expanded metallic foils have become an “industry standard”, the patent states, because they do not unravel and have a homogenous composition.

But such expanded foils have to be produced to tight tolerances to meet weight and conductivity requirements, and be able to withstand lightning strikes – perhaps with currents of 200,000A – in particularly susceptible zones on the aircraft.

Thinness is limited by the expansion process, says the patent. Use of perforated metallic foil, however, enables the production of thinner and lighter materials for integration with composite aircraft skin panels, with perforation apertures optimally spaced to achieve the required weight, strength and electrical performance.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998754262924194}",neutral,0.9998754262924194,0
A350-1000 autonomy tests aimed at supporting dual-pilot cockpit: Airbus - Flightglobal,"Fri, 13 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vc2FmZXR5L2EzNTAtMTAwMC1hdXRvbm9teS10ZXN0cy1haW1lZC1hdC1zdXBwb3J0aW5nLWR1YWwtcGlsb3QtY29ja3BpdC1haXJidXMvMTUxNjI3LmFydGljbGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has trialled further autonomous flight concepts using an A350-1000 test aircraft, including emergency diversion and automatic landing, but insists they are aimed at supporting a dual-pilot, rather than single-pilot, cockpit.

Part of the airframer’s UpNext initiative the ‘DragonFly’ programme takes its inspiration from insects of the same name – using biomimicry of dragonflies’ combination of high-speed senses, spanning a wide field of view, feature recognition and precision flight control.

DragonFly has focused on three particular aspects of autonomous operation – diversion, landing and taxiing – including assistance during a simulated incident of pilot incapacitation.

The aircraft relies on automatic intelligent decision-making based on flight data obtained through a combination of sensors, including cameras on the A350’s nose, and backed up by vision algorithms and guidance calculations.

DragonFly head of demonstrator Isabelle Lacaze says the programme has been running for two years, but flight-testing using aircraft MSN59 commenced in July 2022 and the airframer is “enthusiastic about the first promising results” obtained towards the end of last year.

Among the achievements, she says, was the simulation of sudden pilot incapacitation over Limoges during a flight to Lyon, in a real air traffic environment.

“The system took over and diverted the [aircraft] safely to the nearest appropriate airport – Toulouse in that scenario,” says Lacaze.

“It was really amazing to see that all our stakeholders in this scenario [including test pilots and air traffic controllers] were really positive about the feasibility and the acceptability of the solution.”

She states that the diversion function can activate automatically or act as a support to the pilots.

Addressing the possibility of incapacitation remains one of the contentious issues when considering a possible shift towards single-pilot operations.

But Lacaze insists that DragonFly is intended to develop and evaluate assistance to a two-pilot crew, to help manage workload during intensive phases of flight, such as diversion – with cases of incapacitation or medical emergency among the possible causes.

“We consider there is already huge value [in this],” she says. “We are in exploratory field of research. Our framework – to mature, to explore, see what we can do with the new technology – is really focusing on… assistance for dual-pilot operations, meaning the current crew composition.”

But DragonFly does envision support for extreme circumstances in which pilots are no longer able to control the aircraft.

The criteria for detecting incapacitation are “sensitive”, says Lacaze, and she does not elaborate on the techniques involved, but says that the system is designed to take over “seconds” after detection.

Lacaze says the DragonFly demonstration team has had to “fine tune” the implementation through a step-by-step process, gradually integrating different aspects, to ensure that safety was preserved as the aircraft took control. “It was not an easy walk in the park,” she says.

She says the programme is intended not only to offer diversion assistance but to support crews in taxiing at congested airports, through computer-vision obstacle detection, to maintain speed control and centreline tracking, as well as alerting pilots to the risk of runway crossing. The taxi functions have been tested at Toulouse airport.

Prior autonomous flight testing using an A350-1000, under a programme named ATTOL, demonstrated a fully-autonomous take-off using vision systems to track the runway, and carry out automatic rotation.

DragonFly has extended this to automatic landing, including in low visibility conditions using sensors and vision systems, and Airbus believes the capability could be broadened to approaches to any airport, even those not equipped with the ground technology to support landing automation.

Airbus says its demonstrator takes into account a range of external factors – including terrain, weather and military flight zones – as part of its assessment of where to land, and generates a new trajectory.

It adds that the aircraft also uses constant communication with air traffic control and the airline operations centre to co-ordinate a safe approach.

Several Airbus divisions and a number of partner companies, including Collins Aerospace, Honeywell, Thales, Onera and Cobham, have co-operated with the DragonFly programme, which has embarked on its last three months of testing.

“These tests are one of several steps in the methodical research of technologies to further enhance operations and improve safety,” says Lacaze.

She says the UpNext initiative is launching a project to advance landing and taxi assistance with a view to taking advantage of new-generation computer-vision algorithms.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999758005142212}",neutral,0.9999758005142212,0
Airbus to Change A350 Design Despite Qatar Airways Dispute – Airways - Airways Magazine,"Fri, 20 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vYWlyd2F5c21hZy5jb20vYWlyYnVzLWNoYW5nZS1hMzUwLWRlc2lnbi1xYXRhci_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus to Change A350 Design Despite Qatar Airways Dispute

DALLAS — French aerospace giant Airbus has started the process of changing the core design of its A350 series due to a flaw in the exterior coating. The change comes despite Airbus being in a legal battle with Qatar Airways (QR).

The dispute follows a claim from Qatar Airways (QR) that the paint is prone to cracking and chipping, which in turn exposes the metallic lightning protection of the aircraft.

This also increases the risk of corrosion on the aircraft. The multi-billion dollar dispute has recently been set for a split trial in 2023.

The current material, known as ECF (expanded copper foil), has been implemented on the A350 as the outer skin of the aircraft.

Airbus has recently announced studies on a new material dubbed PCF (perforated copper foil), which has a lighter weight compared to the current material. The new PCF will also aid in solving the cracking issue cited by Qatar Airways (QR).

In a statement from Qatar Airways (QR), dated May 3, 2022:

The judgment handed down by the justice, Mr. Justice Waksman in a hearing in the High Court on Thursday (26 May) has exposed for all in the aviation sector to see, the fiction of the Airbus narrative that the condition affecting the Airbus A350s is a simple “cosmetic” paint issue. Qatar Airways

The Airbus A350

The Airbus A350 is a wide-body aircraft capable of holding up to 480 passengers in an all-economy configuration. The aircraft has also been cited by Airbus to be lighter than similar competitor aircraft.

The Airbus A350 family has also been cited to have a 25% lower fuel burn than its competitors due to a combination of a cutting-edge wing design as well as being powered by two Trent XWB engines.

Since its first delivery in 2014, Airbus has delivered over 500 aircraft. Major carriers such as Singapore Airlines (SQ), Qatar Airways (QF), and Delta Air Lines (DL) all operate the Airbus A350 family.

The latest major order, placed in mid-2022 by Qantas, has gathered international attention due to Qantas’s new and innovative Project Sunrise.

The jet, registered as N849VA, will be joining 11 other A320s phased out by Alaska Airlines in January 2023. Overall, the airline retired 52 aircraft of the type between October 2019 and January 2023, excluding a final A320 still assigned to the Seattle Tacoma International Airport (SEA)-based airline, according to planespotters.net. The airline also retired 10 Airbus A319s in February and March 2020.

As the airline looks to move on the aircraft, which previously belonged to Virginia America, only 10 Airbus A321neos remain in the carrier’s fleet. Following the merger of Alaska Airlines and Virgin America in April 2016, the former’s brand survived, absorbing the latter’s fleet and network, which included the Airbus aircraft. Prior to the merger, Alaska Airlines did not operate any jets built by the European plane maker.

In March 2022, the Alaskan airline announced that it would fast-track the retirement of its Airbus aircraft, as well as the retirement of its De Havilland Dash 8 Q400 regional fleet. At the end of 2021, it had 40 A320s and 32 Q400s, according to the company’s Investor Day presentation on March 24, 2022. The presentation also outlined that the benefits of simplifying its fleet would be greater revenue opportunities, more premium revenue, lower cost per seat, and a better environmental profile.

Currently, Alaska Airlines has 204 Boeing 737s of various types, counting 38 737 MAX-9s. Its regional partners operate a fleet of 11 De Havilland Canada Dash 8-400 and 75 Embraer E170 aircraft, flying regional and other smaller routes from and to the carrier’s hubs, including Anchorage Ted Stevens International Airport (ANC) in Alaska.

In October 2022, the company placed a firm order for 52 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, with options to add 105 more aircraft to the deal. Deliveries have been scheduled to begin in 2024 and be completed by 2027.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998767375946045}",neutral,0.9998767375946045,0

A Wednesday announcement from Airbus and Voyager was light on details but said that Airbus will provide technical design support and expertise.

Starlab is planned as a free-flying space station to support NASA, global space agencies, and researchers, set to launch in 2028.

“This partnership with Voyager Space is the first step toward fielding the next generation of space stations to serve international astronauts. We are excited to support a project aimed at changing history,” said Jean-Marc Nasr, executive vice president of Space Systems at Airbus Defence and Space. “This collaboration is an important step in making Starlab a reality, providing a foundation for long-lasting European and American leadership in space. Our team is looking forward to diving in on the technology and putting our best engineers to work.”

Voyager CEO Dylan Taylor commented that working with Airbus expands Starlab’s ecosystem to serve the European Space Agency (ESA) and its member state space agencies.

Starlab is partially funded by NASA as part of contracts awarded in 2021 to develop commercial space stations in LEO to transition from the International Space Station (ISS). Voyager and Voyager-owned company Nanoracks received $160 million in Space Act Agreement for Starlab.

Lockheed Martin is also working with Voyager on the project. Nanoracks will be the lead, using its experience with Bishop Airlock, the commercial airlock on the ISS. Voyager Space leads strategy and capital investment, and Lockheed Martin serves as the manufacturer and technical integrator.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9018130302429199}",neutral,0.9018130302429199,0

Airbus strengthening positions

Overall, Airbus delivered 661 commercial aircraft throughout 2022, registering 1,078 gross new orders. At the end of the year, the Toulouse, France-based manufacturer’s backlog stood at 7,239 aircraft, as demand for commercial aircraft continued to pick up yearly following 2020. Compared to a year prior, Airbus delivered 50 more aircraft and booked 313 more orders, increasing its backlog by 177 airplanes.

Its most popular products remained the A320 family. The Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) handed over 252 A319 and A320s, as well as 264 A321s. Additionally, 53 A220s found their way to customers across the globe. Airbus built 40 more A321s compared to 2021 and the type overtook the two smaller aircraft in the A320 family, the A319 and A320, as the most popular single-aisle jet in the planemaker’s product portfolio. The manufacturer delivered 10 fewer A319s and A320s in 2022.

In November 2022, it began assembling the first A321 at the Final Assembly Line (FAL) in Tianjin, China. The European company also plans to add another FAL in Mobile, Alabama, where it has been assembling the A220 and A320 family of aircraft. The new assembly line should come online by 2025. Airbus plans to build 65 A319, A320, and A321s in 2023, ramping up that number to 75 by mid-decade, with the manufacturer yet to clarify an exact date.

However, the OEM fell short of its goal to deliver 700 aircraft in 2022. In December 2022, citing “a complex operating environment”, Airbus announced that it would fail to reach that mark. The problems were present throughout its supply chain, where suppliers suffered from labor and COVID-19-related issues, resulting in mounting delivery delays.

Nevertheless, the failure to achieve the goal would not have an impact on its previous financial guidance for the year, according to the announcement from December 2022. Per its latest financial results, as of September 30, 2022, Airbus expected to achieve Earnings Before Income and Taxes (EBIT) adjusted of €5.5 billion ($5.9 billion) and a Free Cash Flow (before Mergers & Acquisitions (M&A) and Customer Financing) of €4.5 billion ($4.8 billion) in 2022.

Boeing catching up

While COVID-19 dampened the demand for aircraft from all manufacturers, Boeing’s positions prior to the outbreak of the virus were much more difficult. The 737 MAX groundings, which lasted from March 2019 to late 2020/early 2021, as well as production issues with the 787, which eventually resulted in deliveries of the wide-body jet to be paused between May 2021 and August 2022, had a significant impact on the United States OEM. As such, Boeing delivered 480 aircraft in 2022, 140 more than the previous year.

But that marks a recovery year for the US OEM. Plagued by similar supply chain issues as its European rival, Boeing’s year was focused on returning to normal. “We worked hard in 2022 to stabilize 737 production, resume 787 deliveries, launch the 777-8 Freighter and, most importantly, meet our customer commitments,” said Stan Deal, the CEO and President of Boeing Commercial Airplanes (BCA), as the manufacturer announced its year-end results on January 10, 2023. During the last month of the year, it delivered 69 aircraft, including 53 737 MAXs. The month’s results make up 14% of total deliveries in 2022.

Out of the 53 MAXs delivered in December 2022, 14 airframes had their first flight sometime in 2019, per planespotters.net data compiled by AeroTime. Of the 31 Boeing 787s handed over to customers in 2022, 10 were delivered during the 12th month of the year, planespotters.net data showed. However, the problem with the 787 is that analysts estimated it takes more hours to restore one than to build a new airframe. The same could not be said about the 737 MAX, which “could imply the 787 inventory burn down will take longer than expected,” stated Ron Epstein, a Senior Equity Analyst at Bank of America, in December 2022.

One area where Boeing has managed to maintain an advantage is the wide-body aircraft market. Airbus delivered 92 twin-aisle jets, after removing two Airbus A350s destined for Aeroflot due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, while the American planemaker shipped off 93 wide-body planes, even if it could not deliver Dreamliners for the first eight months of the year. Commercially, though, the US manufacturer won 213 orders, while Airbus’ customers signed up for 63 twin-aisle jets, including 24 newly launched A350F cargo-only aircraft.

Guillaume Faury, the CEO of Airbus, believed that demand for the largest commercial jets will soon recover, stating that 2023 and 2024 would be more positive years for that market.

Boeing, meanwhile, managed to end the year with a huge order from United Airlines, with the US-based carrier ordering 100 737 MAX and 100 787s on December 13, 2022.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9618786573410034}",neutral,0.9618786573410034,0
How Airbus and Boeing attempted to conquer China’s civil aviation skies - AeroTime,"Mon, 02 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm90aW1lLmFlcm8vYXJ0aWNsZXMvaG93LWFpcmJ1cy1hbmQtYm9laW5nLWF0dGVtcHRlZC10by1jb25xdWVyLWNoaW5hcy1jaXZpbC1hdmlhdGlvbi1za2llc9IBbWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm90aW1lLmFlcm8vYXJ0aWNsZXMvaG93LWFpcmJ1cy1hbmQtYm9laW5nLWF0dGVtcHRlZC10by1jb25xdWVyLWNoaW5hcy1jaXZpbC1hdmlhdGlvbi1za2llcy9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"December 9, 2022, marked a monumental day for China’s commercial aviation industry when the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) delivered the first COMAC C919 to its launch carrier, China Eastern Airlines.

While not the first Chinese mass-produced aircraft, the C919 is the country’s first direct shot at attempting to overthrow the Airbus-Boeing duopoly in the best-selling narrow-body aircraft market segment. The Chinese manufacturer’s other jet, the ARJ21, which was recently delivered to the first foreign airline in Indonesia, has not amassed the same attention and order book compared with the C919.

However, the C919 has also failed to amass similar levels of attention as the Airbus A320 or Boeing 737 families of aircraft. On the one hand, it is understandable. COMAC outselling an already-established aircraft type with its own supporting infrastructure would be highly unusual. On the other, knowing how tightly controlled business enterprises are in China, it is slightly questionable that state-owned carriers have not ordered thousands of C919s from a state-owned manufacturer.

Perhaps there has to be a fine balance between delivering results and supporting the local industry. After all, the various A320 and 737 variants have proven to be capable aircraft and have helped airlines save money on fuel, maintenance, and other costs by being more efficient with each generation. The C919, on the other hand, must still be put through its paces before it can even fly passengers. China Eastern Airlines will need to do this before the Chinese narrow-body aircraft begins carrying paying customers in early 2023.

Still, the two narrow-body aircraft from the duopoly have sold very well in the country. According to Airbus’ latest Orders & Deliveries data, as of November 30, 2022, Chinese airlines have ordered 1,638 variants of the A320 family, including current engine (ceo) and new engine option (neo) aircraft. Meanwhile, Boeing’s data as of the same date shows that carriers in the country have signed up for 1,348 various variants of the 737 family, ranging from the 737-200 to the latest iteration, the 737 MAX. Some orders are associated with third-party leasing companies, including those based in other countries that have delivered aircraft to Chinese airlines and might not showcase the full scale of orders.

It is no surprise that both Airbus and Boeing have managed to establish a presence in China. The pair have long sought to become the go-to manufacturer for the Chinese government, securing business in a country where demand for air travel has blossomed, including domestically. Even the COVID-19 pandemic, which is still affecting China with strict policies and huge outbreaks, should not derail that growth.

But the duopoly’s players have each adopted different approach to handling their business in China.

Emphasizing domestic production in China

The C919, nevertheless, could become a headache for executives at both Airbus and Boeing, especially considering how much emphasis was put on innovation-driven development in China in the latest five-year plan.

According to a summary by PwC, the government considers self-reliance and self-strengthening in science and technology the pillars of national development strategy.

“The innovation-driven strategy is followed by an initiative to build up a modern industrial system,” the summary continued, emphasizing that the 14th five-year plan has put more emphasis on that strategy compared with the 13th five-year plan. “The Proposals stresses that China will unswervingly build itself into a manufacturing power, put more emphasis on quality and enhance its strength in cyberspace and digital technology, signaling the focus and general orientation of our roadmap to the future modern industrial system,” PwC’s analysis of the latest economic policy in the country continued.

“In addition, it also underlines that China will foster strategic emerging industries, such as the new generation information technology, biotechnology, new energy, advanced materials, high-end devices, new energy vehicles, green environmental protection, aerospace, and marine equipment, and accelerate the development of modern service industry, new infrastructure, and digital economy,” one of the Big Four accounting firms concluded.

Does this mean that the opportunity for Airbus and Boeing to sell and deliver aircraft will vanish sooner rather than later?

Well, the newest five-year plan also reiterated the importance of the dual circulation strategy. According to Breugel, an economic think tank established in Brussels, Belgium in 2005, since Donald Trump, the now-former United States president, began his trade war endeavors against China, the country has been attempting to rely on a policy that insulates “the domestic market from the rest of the world by eliminating any bottlenecks, whether in terms of natural resources or technology, so as to vertically integrate its production and achieve self-reliance served by China’s huge domestic market”.

Trade tensions have continued to boil, despite a meeting between the current US President Joe Biden and Xi Jinping in November 2022, where the former proclaimed that both sides “can manage our differences, prevent competition from becoming anything ever near conflict, and to find ways to work together on urgent global issues that require our mutual cooperation”.

The latest flareup was when the US banned the sale of advanced chips and chip-making tooling to China in October 2022, with Biden remarking that 0% of advanced chips were manufactured in the US and that is why “China was lobbying in the United States Congress against passing this legislation [the CHIPS and Science Act – ed. note]”. Those restrictions began to spill over to other countries, such as the Netherlands, even after the meeting in Indonesia.

And that is where a fundamental difference between the US and the European Union (EU) is shown. The Netherlands, while planning on joining the 50-state country in restricting chip access to China, would “not copy the American export restrictions one-to-one,” stated Liesje Schreinemacher, the Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation of the Netherlands, in an interview with NRC, a local daily newspaper. Schreinemacher also emphasized that talks are not done just yet because “more time is needed for that”.

Diplomacy matters

Still, not all trade wars are fought equally and not all of them affect every industry within a region or geopolitical area.

In July 2022, Airbus announced a deal for 292 A320 aircraft with various Chinese carriers and the list includes Air China, China Eastern Airlines, China Southern Airlines, and Shenzhen Airlines. In November 2022, Airbus’ Tianjin Final Assembly Line (FAL) in China began assembling its first A321 aircraft, the largest of the A320 family. These are just some of the examples showcasing the fact that Airbus has managed to successfully conduct business in the country. For Boeing, though, orders from China have been an area of struggle. In the past five years, China-designated customers in the manufacturer’s Orders & Deliveries data have ordered 59 aircraft, with the last order coming in September 2021. Then, Air China signed up for five Boeing 777F cargo aircraft, which means that the last passenger aircraft that was ordered by a China-based company was the 737 MAX when the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China’s (ICBC) aircraft leasing arm ordered three of the type in August 2020.

Interestingly, though, China “recycled” the 292-strong Airbus aircraft order from July in November 2022, when the state-owned China Aviation Supplies Holding Company (CASC) announced a deal for 140 aircraft from the European Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM): 132 A320-family jets and eight A350s. The day of the announcement correlated with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s visit to the country. Industry sources noted that the eight A350s were already ordered in 2019, while the narrow-body aircraft part of the deal was already included in Airbus’ backlog in July 2022, according to Reuters.

Announcing deals in coordination with diplomatic visits was nothing out of the norm in China or in the aviation industry, for that matter. When then-French President Jacques Chirac visited the country in October 2006, Airbus announced a deal for 150 A320 aircraft and, most importantly, the manufacturer and Chinese officials finalized an agreement to establish the Tianjin FAL starting in 2008. Airbus broke that record by agreeing to an order for 160 jets destined for Chinese airlines in November 2007.

That record-breaking order also coincided with an official visit from Nicolas Sarkozy, the successor to Chirac.

Boeing’s relationship with the country is much more complicated. When China ordered the first aircraft from the Seattleite OEM in 1972, the US did not even have a formal diplomatic relationship with China. The first order was for 10 Boeing 707 aircraft, the first-ever jetliner from the manufacturer, and came shortly after Richard Nixon visited China the same year in a visit that is considered an icebreaker. Akin to European leaders’ visits, when George Bush traveled over the Pacific Ocean in November 2005, Boeing officially shook hands with Chinese officials for 70 737s, during the then-President’s visit to Beijing, China. When Donald Trump, another ex-US President, visited the Asian nation for the first time in 2017, a deal for 300 aircraft was announced. However, according to a Chicago Tribune report, the announcement included – much like the Airbus order – already backlog-booked aircraft.

Boeing’s difficulties in China

Turning back the clocks a few decades reveals that this story has repeated itself in modern times, as Boeing struggles to gain new orders from China.

Even already-built aircraft, namely 737 MAXs, which are still grounded by the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), remain on tarmacs across the US.

“We have just had to deal with the realities we faced. For geopolitical reasons, I am guessing, we have been unable to make deliveries that we would like to make to our Chinese customers,” David Calhoun, the current CEO and President of Boeing, told CNBC on December 13, 2022, as the manufacturer and United Airlines announced a huge order for 200 aircraft. Calhoun reiterated that the company wants to deliver the airplanes but, due to the huge demand for planes across the globe, as the duopoly’s members struggle to build aircraft within the deadlines written in contracts with customers, Boeing has had “to take advantage of that market”.

“We still have airplanes on the tarmac that they can take,” Calhoun concluded.

“This year provides a dramatic opportunity to advance U.S.-China relations,” said Ron Woodard, President of Boeing Commercial Airplanes (BCA) in April 1998, a few months before his retirement. While then-China President Jiang Zemin’s visit to the US in 1997 was deemed “highly successful” by the executive, he hoped that Bill Clinton’s endeavor to China a few months later would become an opportunity “to further strengthen commerce and trade ties between our two countries”.

Still, despite the complicated nature of the two countries’ relations, Boeing managed to dominate Airbus in China and by 2002, it held a 70% market share versus the European aircraft maker’s 20%. The US-based manufacturer has worked long and hard to gain this share, teaming up with local officials to ”develop the country’s aviation infrastructure”, between 1972 and 2002.

“In the mid-’80s, for example, the Civil Aviation Institute in Tianjin and Boeing created training programs for maintenance technicians. In order to facilitate repairs, Boeing helped develop the Beijing Capital Airport Spares Center. And Boeing, the CAAC, and the Aviation Industries of China joined forces to begin intensive training of pilots, technicians, and support staff,” read Boeing Frontiers from December 2022, a magazine dedicated to current and former employees of the OEM. The manufacturer invested a further $300 million to help China “develop and expand its air transportation system”, between 1990 and 2001.

The same year, Boeing headhunted David Wang, an executive from General Electric (GE), to lead its China efforts. Based in Beijing, China, Wang became President of Boeing China, holding that role until 2011. In 2002, as well as throughout the first decade of the 21st century, the company’s executives continuously reiterated that relationships mattered most.

”There’s an old Chinese saying that [goes], ‘When you drink from the well, never forget who helped you dig the well.’ We helped the Chinese aviation industry dig the well, and our Chinese friends will continue to remember,” said Larry Dickenson, the then-Senior Vice President of Sales at BCA in December 2002.

At some point in time, the well began to dry up. By 2005, the Chicago Tribune indicated that Boeing controlled two-thirds of the market. However, Airbus began taking back control of the market even more aggressively, and the European manufacturer’s new aircraft deliveries “rocketed from 18 percent in 1993 to 67 percent last year, according to Back Aviation Solutions,” noted a Seattle Times report from 2005. Both manufacturers knew that China was the market (with an emphasis on the) and that they would have to give everything to conquer it.

Boeing, however, became complacent, according to C.C. Tien, who was quoted in the same Seattle Times article as saying that it was important for the OEM to show interest in Chinese headlines and daily developments. “Those are subtle things. You don’t see the direct payback for a long time,” said Tien, who left Boeing and at the time was consulting COMAC on its ARJ21 program.

Wang, who at that point had been working as the US planemaker’s China President for three years, noted that US and Chinese relations needed to become stronger, as Boeing and China’s “friendship and cooperation will suffer if those relationships are not strong”.

Much like with the previous chipmaking example, politics has helped Airbus to access the market. Wang indicated that the realities of traveling between China and the US for the former’s nationals “seriously affected our competitiveness”, European politicians were not as pressing on various issues within China. In 1993, while Bill Clinton was yet to meet Zemin following the events in Tiananmen Square in 1989 when a month-long protest resulted in the deaths of hundreds, if not thousands of people, the German Chancellor Helmut Kohl was already in China making deals with the local government, including an order for six Airbus A340 aircraft in November 1993, according to the Chicago Tribune. Politics has continued to play a part in how the two manufacturers play their game in China, as the duopoly is intertwined with geopolitical developments whether they like it or not.

The US government has no official stake in Boeing. Airbus, a publicly traded company, has institutional shareholders from the governments of France, Germany, and Spain, who collectively own a 25.9% stake in the company.

Drifting apart with the A350 and 787

Airbus and Boeing approached the new millennia quite differently in terms of product strategy. The European OEM moved its chips towards big hubs that would connect millions of people between major urban centers, resulting in the Airbus A380, while the US planemaker came in with a leaner approach in the form of the 787 Dreamliner.

Sure, Airbus managed to sell five A380s to China Southern Airlines, but the double-decker jet could never catch up to the Boeing 787 in terms of sales in the country or globally, for that matter. The Europeans recognized the gap in their product offering, including the lackluster performance of the A340, and introduced the A350. Their strategic partner to develop this was China. Boeing, meanwhile, turned to Japan to help them develop the 787, even if it tried its best to save face with the Chinese.

In June 2005, just as Airbus was about to launch the A350, the direct competitor to the Dreamliner, Boeing issued a press release titled “Boeing 787 Highlights $600 Million in Contracts with Chinese Suppliers”. It highlighted various parts that were built by local companies, from the composite rudder or the wing-to-body fairing panels of the 787, and 737’s forward-entry doors, to interior panels for the 777’s control cabin, among others.

“China’s aviation industry is providing outstanding technological capabilities and resources that help us meet quality, cost, and delivery imperatives in our programs – particularly on the new 787. China has been a reliable partner to Boeing for many years and we are honored that they are part of our future with the 787 airplane,” said Carolyn Corvi, BCA Vice President and General Manager of Airplane Production at the time.

Still, Japan became one of the most important industrial partners for the Dreamliner, while Airbus turned to China to help them with the A350. In 2009, Laurence Barron, who headed Airbus China, said that if local suppliers were willing to offer competitive prices, the manufacturer would be willing to allocate more than 5% of the airframe work to China. At the time, the European OEM already signed deals with local companies to produce rudders and maintenance doors and was looking to negotiate for more, according to Barron’s statement at the time.

There is perhaps no better indication of the warm relationship Airbus has enjoyed with China than the fact that the Tianjin FAL, which primarily dealt with assembling the A320 family aircraft, has also become a Completion & Delivery Centre (C&DC) for the A330 and A350. The lines to finalize the assembly of the A330 opened in 2017, while the center delivered its first A350 in July 2021.

The C&DC’s employees install cabins, paint aircraft, conduct production flight tests, and perform customer flight acceptance flights that lead to a jet’s delivery to the customer. Boeing, meanwhile, has had a facility akin to Airbus’ C&DC – also called a Completion and Delivery Center – located in Zhoushan, China. At the center, 737 MAX interiors are installed, as well as liveries are painted prior to deliveries to Chinese carriers. As mentioned previously, the CAAC has still not ungrounded the 737 MAX, leaving the center without a purpose for now. While the Chinese aviation authority held a meeting with Boeing in September 2022, “to carry out a comprehensive evaluation of the aircraft type-based training standards for the improved 737 planes”, the CAAC said in its announcement, there have not been any recent developments regarding the plane’s ungrounding.

Germany’s Scholz visited Xi in Beijing in November 2022, noting in his op-ed for Politico that “China remains an important business and trading partner for Germany and Europe,”, Biden met Xi in Indonesia prior to the G20s get-together the same month.

“China and the United States need to have a sense of responsibility for history, for the world, and for the people, explore the right way to get along with each other in the new era, put the relationship on the right course, and bring it back to the track of healthy and stable growth to the benefit of the two countries and the world as a whole,” read a statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China released shortly after the meeting ended.

In July 2022, Airbus estimated that it had a 53% market share in China.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999662637710571}",neutral,0.9999662637710571,0
Airbus to spin-out Zephyr HAPS business as a separate company - DatacenterDynamics,"Mon, 23 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhdGFjZW50ZXJkeW5hbWljcy5jb20vZW4vbmV3cy9haXJidXMtdG8tc3Bpbi1vdXQtemVwaHlyLWhhcHMtYnVzaW5lc3MtYXMtYS1zZXBlcmF0ZS1jb21wYW55L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The FT reports the company intends to spin off Zephyr into its own telecoms and earth observation company named ‘Aalto’ and is looking to raise funds to enable this commercialization.

Defense giant Airbus is looking to begin commercial operations of its Zephyr high-altitude drone and may spin-out the company.

HAPS can be airships, balloons, or fixed-wing drones like Zephyr, and are designed to stay airborne for months at a time and offer an alternative method of connectivity in rural and sparsely populated areas without the upfront costs of cell towers or satellites. The technology can also be used to provide temporary connectivity after traditional telecoms infrastructure has failed, for example after an earthquake.

The Zephyr, originally designed by defense group Qinetiq in 2003, was sold to Airbus in 2013. Since then, Airbus has been developing and testing the platform in order to prepare it for commercial use. According to Samer Halawi, who has been leading the program since last summer, the Zephyr is ‘now at a final design stage’.

The latest iteration, Zephyr Z8, has a wingspan of 25m while weighing only 75kg. The HAPS is designed to fly at around 70,000 ft (21 km), above the weather and commercial airlines, and is powered by solar panels - enabling it to fly during the day and recharge its batteries which power it at night.

“Airbus is not a company that offers telecom services,” Halawi told the FT. “The idea of the carve-out is to bring like-minded partners to the equation and to be able to scale this business.”

To help with this, the defense company has hired Morgan Stanley to help them find external partners who can offer financial support. Airbus is reportedly intending to maintain ownership of Aalto, though will consider outside investment.

In August last year, the Zephyr broke a record for the longest flight in history, staying in the air for 64 straight days. The failure on day 64 occurred when the Zephyr dipped below its standard altitude of 70,000 ft to 45,000-50,000 ft, before eventually plummeting to the ground. Halawi stated that this was due to a component failing during bad weather.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9993902444839478}",neutral,0.9993902444839478,0

Boeing vs. Airbus: The Key Reason Why Airbus Stock is Better - TipRanks.com - TipRanks,"Thu, 19 Jan 2023 02:05:29 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpcHJhbmtzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FydGljbGUvYm9laW5nLXZzLWFpcmJ1cy10aGUta2V5LXJlYXNvbi13aHktYWlyYnVzLWlzLWJldHRlctIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The travel industry is recovering from COVID-19, benefiting top airplane manufacturers like Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Airbus (OTC:EADSF). But which stock is better? While similarities exist, I compared BA and EADSF and found that EADSF is the better stock due to one critical difference that should be pointed out — profitability.

Boeing (BA)

The biggest difference is that Boeing is unprofitable, while Airbus is turning a healthy profit. Boeing is struggling under heavy losses in its Defense division, and it doesn’t look like those problems will be going away anytime soon. Thus, a neutral view may be appropriate for Boeing — with the caveat that a review is likely in order if or when the company gets its act together.

As the world’s oldest aircraft manufacturer, Boeing enjoyed a monopoly for over 50 years — until Airbus was founded in 1970. With Boeing’s status as a blue-chip stock, it might come as a surprise to some investors that the last time the company turned an annual profit was in 2018.

Even with $61.4 billion in revenue for the last 12 months, the company has lost over $8.4 billion. In the third quarter of 2022, Boeing reported a surprise loss due to hits from its Air Force One and Starliner programs, which resulted in a $2.8 billion charge.

Boeing had returned to profitability in the second quarter of 2022, and analysts expected another profit in the third. Part of the issue for Boeing’s Defense and Space divisions is the fact that the company can’t pass along cost increases (fixed contracts) to its government clients, making 2022’s runaway inflation an enormous problem.

Boeing’s core commercial jet division also continued to rack up losses during the third quarter despite the growing number of deliveries boosting its revenue. The company delivered 112 commercial jets during the third quarter, up from 85 in the year-ago quarter.

Boeing also looks expensive on a price-to-sales (P/S) basis, with a trailing multiple of 2.0 times versus the three-year average of 1.8 for the aerospace and defense industry. Finally, its balance sheet is quite troubling, as summarized by its debt/equity ratio of -323%. In other words, BA has a negative net worth and lots of debt.

What is the Price Target for BA Stock?

Boeing has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 10 Buys, four Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned over the last three months. At $218.77, the average price target for Boeing stock implies upside potential of 4.5%.

Airbus (EADSF)

Last year marked the fourth straight year for Airbus as the number one airplane manufacturer. The company’s fundamentals and larger number of orders and deliveries put it clearly ahead of Boeing. In fact, Airbus’ P/E and P/S multiples also make it look cheap, so a bullish view appears appropriate.

Airbus generated €4.15 billion in net income on €55.1 billion in sales for the last 12 months. Although both Boeing and Airbus struggled to deliver airplanes due to issues like component and labor shortages, Airbus managed more deliveries and received more orders.

For all of 2022, Airbus delivered 661 planes and received orders for 1,078 planes, while Boeing delivered 479 jets and received orders for 774. The company’s balance sheet also looks far better than Boeing’s, having much less debt, although the bar was set extremely low.

Airbus also looks cheap based on its P/E of and P/S ratios of 21.9 and 1.6 times, respectively, versus the three-year industry averages of 28 times and 1.8 times, respectively. As a bonus, the company even has a 1.35% dividend yield.

What is the Price Target for EADSF Stock?

Airbus has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 11 Buys, three Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned over the last three months. At $154.75, the average price target for Airbus stock implies upside potential of 22.3%.

Conclusion: Neutral on BA, Bullish on EADSF

The large jet airliner market has been considered a duopoly between Boeing and Airbus since the 1990s, but decades into the fight, Airbus is the clear victor. Boeing lost billions of dollars and years of sales when the 737 MAX airplanes were grounded due to a pair of crashes, putting it far behind Airbus.

Today, Boeing is still in recovery mode, and it keeps facing challenges. It’s unclear if or when Boeing will recover, making Airbus the clear victor.
