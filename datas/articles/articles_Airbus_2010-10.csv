A319 MPA Maritime Patrol Aircraft - Naval Technology,"Thu, 28 Oct 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdmFsLXRlY2hub2xvZ3kuY29tL3Byb2plY3RzL2EzMTltcGEv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A319 MPA is based on the airframe of Airbus A319 commercial aircraft. Cabin layout of the A319 MPA. A319 MPA cockpit features six multi-functional displays and a head up display (HUD). A319 MPA can fly at a maximum speed of Mach 0.82.

The A319 MPA is a long range maritime patrol and ASW aircraft developed by Airbus Military. The aircraft can be deployed in anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare, intelligence, reconnaissance and surveillance missions.

The low-altitude loiter or search capability, exceeding range, endurance and fast transit speed make the A319 the best maritime patrol aircraft in its range.

A319 MPA aircraft design

The A319 MPA is a derivative of the Airbus A319 passenger aircraft. The airframe is made of corrosion resistant lightweight composite materials for lower fuel consumption.

Designed with larger access doors, the aircraft allows easier component replacement. The centralised maintenance system monitors the key aircraft components and automatically transfers anomalies to the aircraft base. The A319 MPA comes with an option for universal aerial refuelling receptacle slipway installation (UARRSI) for aerial refuelling.

The 3.7m long fuselage cross-section allows setting up of a spacious cabin housing six operator consoles, a galley, a toilet, electronic equipment racks and sonobuoy storage. The cabin has enough space to incorporate operator areas and a rest area for long endurance missions. The lower deck has been shaped to provide optimum space to house a bomb-bay and additional fuel tanks for extended range and endurance.

A319 MPA missions

The A319 MPA is equipped for classical fighting roles and new operations. In addition to maritime patrol roles, the aircraft can conduct joint operations with other units and international and coalition forces.

Flight deck

""The A319 MPA is equipped for classical fighting roles and new operations.""

The flight deck is installed with six multi-functional displays. A head-up display (HUD) is also provided to increase pilot situational awareness during approach and landing operations.

The cockpit’s ergonomic design allows an unrestricted view of instruments and features two side stick controllers of the fly-by-wire system. The fly-by-wire flight control system reduces the pilot workload by providing flight envelope protection and responsive flight controls.

It also provides precise handling during turbulence. The onboard information terminal (OIT) transfers situational and sensor information to crew members. It also enhances crew coordination and mission assessment.

Weapon systems

The A319 MPA is fitted with anti-submarine and anti-surface weapon systems. The aircraft can carry a variety of weapons internally and on wing-pylons. The internal bomb-bay can house eight weapon stations for torpedoes, depth charges, mines and other ASW weaponry. Four under-wing points can hold missiles to attack naval or land-based targets.

Sensors / radars

The open architecture mission system of A319 MPA integrates a set of multi-mission sensors. The sensors coupled with modern communication systems enable the aircraft to conduct operations in a network centric operations (NCO) environment.

The complete suite of ASW sensors tracks and identifies under sea and surface targets.

The mission systems include a surveillance radar, IFF interrogator, IR/EO turret, acoustic system and magnetic anomaly detector (MAD).

Navigation and communication

The A319 MPA features fully integrated tactical system (FITS), a system successfully installed on the Airbus MPA family and on the P-3 Orion.

""The open architecture mission system of A319 MPA integrates a set of multi-mission sensors.""

FITS integrates aircraft communication and datalink systems.

Six operator consoles installed in the cabin provide better situational awareness to conduct patrol and anti-submarine operations at low altitudes.

The aircraft can also be fitted with Link 11/22, Link 16, TCDL or enhanced message datalink systems to provide data, picture and video exchange with the network.

The communications equipment onboard allows dissemination of time-critical intelligence based on the information gathered and analysed during the mission.

The aircraft can be operated in a network including helicopters and unmanned platforms.

Countermeasures

The self-protection suite includes radar and missile warning systems. It is fully integrated with a decoy dispenser. The directed infrared countermeasures (DIRCM) system can be optionally fitted to protect against IR-guided missiles. An electronic support measures (ESM) system is also installed onboard.

Engine

The A319 MPA is powered by two IAE V2527M-A5 or CFM56-5B7 engines providing a thrust of 26,500lbf or 27,000lbf. The twin-turbofan configuration provides a maximum speed of Mach 0.82."

Aviation World at Odds Over Loans for Aircraft - The New York Times,"Mon, 18 Oct 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMTAvMTAvMTkvYnVzaW5lc3MvZ2xvYmFsLzE5c3Vic2lkaWVzLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Back in the mid-1980s, Boeing and Airbus avoided a trade war by making a gentlemen’s agreement not to seek government financing to sell planes in each other’s home markets. The deal symbolized an aviation world dominated by the United States and Europe.

That world is a lot different now.

No longer can Airbus and Boeing count on being the biggest manufacturers of large airplanes. Manufacturers in Canada and Brazil are seeking to gain a foothold in this lucrative market. And not too far in the future, China, Japan and Russia will be competing as well.

At the same time, airlines from Asia and the Middle East that did not exist three decades ago, or were small players, are now vying for a much bigger piece of the global aviation market.

The old rules, some airlines and plane manufacturers contend, are not working anymore.

This week, negotiators from the European Union and countries including the United States, Japan and Brazil will meet in Ottawa to grapple with the politically charged issue. Their goal is to draw up a new agreement by the end of the year on the rules for financing the airplane business  and specifically, how much government assistance is permitted."

The big Airbus that’s flying into our future

Toulouse, FRANCE - With a business-class boarding pass in hand, you climb a spiral staircase with twinkling lights and enter a spacious chamber. Your roomy seat can flatten out into a bed, but not before you watch a first-run movie on a widescreen monitor with a glass of champagne to ease you into a comfy ride.That’s the experience awaiting travelers from Korea to North America after Korean Air finally gets its Airbus A380s - the newest aircraft in Korean Air’s lineup - delivered next May.Some 30 local reporters were invited by Korean Air, the nation’s largest airline, to visit the A380 production site in Toulouse, France on Oct. 20. The A380 is the world’s largest passenger aircraft, capable of flying 853 passengers if all the seats are configured to be economy class. Korean Air will have the traditional three classes - first, business and economy - and only 400-450 seats in its A380s, instead of the normal A380 configuration of 525 seats for three classes.“Our customers will have more leg room,” said Lee Ki-kwang, vice president of Korean Air’s International PR, Communications Strategy and Corporate Communications.Although the first of five Korean Air A380s is near completion, its interiors haven’t been completed, so reporters enjoyed an in-flight experience in an Airbus mock-up of the jet.“Korean Air’s first A380 will have its test flight within this month, possibly in 10 days,” said Susana Martin-Romo, A380 marketing analyst at Airbus.The plane still has to undergo some tests in relation to cabin pressure and fuel systems, and a test flight to Hamburg, Germany, Airbus’ other assembly line, is still required. After that it will be painted and get final quality control tests in Toulouse.Airbus has 52,000 employees working in subsidiaries, parts and training centers all around the globe.In the mock-up center, reporters were able to see models for each seating class. Some airlines have chosen the option of having a prestige economy class, an upgraded version of the regular economy class with more spacious seats, to have four total classes. Korean Air opted out of prestige economy, and is planning to offer better service for its customers in economy.Out of the 400-450 seats in Korean Air’s A380, 12 will be first-class seats and 94 in business. The remainder will be economy.A sense of spaciousness was obvious in the aircraft mock-ups. Airbus’ seat and monitor design in the A380 is wider than in its competitor’s Boeing 747. The A380 economy-class seat is 1.5 to 2 inches wider than that of the Boeing 747, while the in-flight entertainment-system screen is 3 to 4 inches wider, according to Keith Stonestreet, product marketing director for the A380.An official from Korean Air said it is likely to use a corner of the A380 as a duty free shop, which can be operated throughout the flight.After leaving the mock-up center, the highlight of the journalists’ tour was a visit to the A380 assembly line, where Korean Air’s jets are being manufactured. The first A380 that caught the journalists’ eyes was an aircraft with a huge taegeuk symbol outside the vast assembly-line complex - the first that will be delivered to Korean Air. Inside the complex, two more A380s with taegeuks on their tails were in the process of getting assembled. The second A380 is about half done with all four engines installed, while the third and fourth are only 20 percent complete. After the first delivery in May, the second, third and fourth A380s will be delivered in June, July and August. Assembly on the fifth plane will start next month and be delivered next November.The 500-meter-long (1,640 feet) assembly line, built in 2004 for A380 production, can hold eight aircraft at any time. Of the eight A380s currently being manufactured in the line, half are for Korean Air.“The Korean market is a very important customer, especially Korean Air,” said Alain Flourens, group executive of the A380 program at Airbus.Korean Air will be the sixth airline to operate the A380 after Singapore Airlines, Emirates, Qantas, Air France and Lufthansa, officials at Airbus said.Despite a strong partnership between Korean Air and Airbus, officials at Airbus said that Korea is still not one of their top 10 biggest customers because the number of aircraft that Korean carriers - Korean Air and Asiana Airline - purchase is still far fewer than European carriers.However, Airbus said the Asian region is expected to take the lead in global air traffic - currently dominated by Europe - by the year 2028.*The Airbus A380 is a double decker, wide-body aircraft manufactured by Airbus SAS, a subsidiary of EADS. Each A380 is priced at about $350 million and is currently the most expensive passenger aircraft.*The first commercial flight of the A380 was conducted by Singapore Airlines in October 2007 from Singapore to Sydney. Currently, a total of 37 A380s are in operation by five carriers - Singapore Airlines, Emirates, Qantas, Air France and Lufthansa.By Jung Jae-yoon [jyj222@joongang.co.kr]"
Boeing Sky Interior delivery today - Leeham News and Analysis,"Wed, 27 Oct 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxMC8xMC8yNy9ib2Vpbmctc2t5LWludGVyaW9yLWRlbGl2ZXJ5LXRvZGF5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Boeing is delivering its first 737 “Boeing Sky Interior” today to FlyDubai. The interior is inspired by the 787, which was also adapted to the 747-8.

Here is a link to a feature story prepared by Boeing’s Corp Com specialist Bernard Choi that was dated last July.

We had the opportunity to first be introduced to the interior in April 2009 when Boeing first revealed it and technical enhancements to the 737 that improve its fuel consumption by an estimated 2%.

The Boeing Sky Interior (that’s its correct name, but with apologies to Boeing we’ll shorten it henceforth for this post) has what we call the “wow” effect when you first enter the cabin. This is a step-change from the interiors we road warriors are all so used to, and for those of us who are really old, it’s as much of a step change in appearance as was the overhead bin look from the open hat racks of the 1970s.

This sounds like hyperbole, but it’s what we think and feel. It knocks the socks off the current 737 and Airbus A320 interiors, the latter which was updated in 2007-2008. The A320 interior is really nice, and its functionality is very good, with one feature that the Sky Interior doesn’t have (a handrail to hold on to when walking to or from the aft lavs)–but the A320 interior is the traditional look of the 20th Century.

The 787 design team created a 21st Century look that was the original “wow,” and which was adopted in most respects for the 747-8. But delays in these two programs means the 737’s Sky Interior is the first the traveling public will see of the new look.

The Sky Interior doesn’t include the 787’s fancy tinting windows–the weight-and-cost associated with it wasn’t deemed worth it for the very different mission of the 737 compared with the 787. But in many other respects, the similarities between the Sky Interior and the 787 is readily apparent.

So what, you may ask?

Boeing’s Kent Craver, regional director of passenger satisfaction and revenue marketing, said yesterday that studies indicate a pleasing (our word) interior like this will attract one additional coach passenger every three or four flights and one first class passenger every 35 flights. Over five years, this adds about $400,000 in revenue (on a net present value basis) per airplane so equipped. This may not sound like much, but in an industry that is charging a la carte pricing for just about everything, every penny counts.

Incident: KLM A332 at Entebbe on Oct 10th 2010, bird strike

By Simon Hradecky, created Monday, Oct 11th 2010 11:12Z, last updated Tuesday, Oct 12th 2010 15:46Z

Grey Crowned Crane (Photo: Tom Tarrant) A KLM Airbus A330-200, registration PH-AOB performing flight KL-562 from Entebbe (Uganda) to Amsterdam (Netherlands), ingested a bird into the right hand engine (CF6) shortly after takeoff from Entebbe and returned to Entebbe for a safe landing a few minutes later.



The flight had to be cancelled. The passengers were rebooked onto other flights.



Passengers reported, that they heard a loud bang just after the main wheels had left the runway.



The Civil Aviation Authority of Uganda reported, the bird was identified to be a grey crowned crane populating the dry savannahs south of the Sahara. Adult birds are about 1 meter (3 feet) tall and weigh around 3.5kg (7.7lbs).

Bombardier wins Libya aircraft contract - CBC.ca,"Thu, 07 Oct 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9uZXdzL2J1c2luZXNzL2JvbWJhcmRpZXItd2lucy1saWJ5YS1haXJjcmFmdC1jb250cmFjdC0xLjk2ODA4MNIBH2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9hbXAvMS45NjgwODA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Bombardier's aerospace division has obtained a third order in as many years for regional aircraft from Libya with a $131.5-million US contract for three CRJ900 NextGen passenger jets that will be operated by the North African country's national carrier.

Bombardier's aerospace division won a $131.5-million US contract to supply three CRJ900 NextGen passenger jets to Libyan Airlines. ((Bombardier Aerospace))

Montreal-based Bombardier said Libyan Airlines also has options for an additional three planes, potentially increasing the value of the sale to $267.8 million.

Capt. Sabri Shadi, head of Libyan African Aviation Holding Co., which is purchasing the aircraft, said the acquisition is part of the airline's continuing fleet renewal.

""The CRJ900 NextGen aircraft will provide lower operating costs, increased passenger comfort and reduced environmental impact compared to Libyan Airlines' older jet aircraft,"" Shadi said.

Libyan Airlines currently operates three CRJ900 and two CRJ900 NextGen aircraft that were ordered in 2007 and 2008 respectively. Its fleet also includes four Airbus A320s and two ATR42s, and it has 15 Airbus planes on order.

Gary Scott, president of Bombardier Commercial Aircraft, said the latest order confirms that CRJ900 aircraft are meeting the airline's expectations and business requirements.

As of July 31, Bombardier had delivered almost 1,600 CRJ Series aircraft to customers around the world, including 234 CRJ900 and CRJ900 NextGen aircraft.

Meanwhile, Bombardier delivered its first Q400 turboprop planes to South America on Tuesday, with four used 78-seat planes being added by Colombia's Aires.

The 29-year-old airline serves 22 domestic and four international destinations. Its fleet also includes 11 Bombardier Q200 planes. The first Dash-8 planes were introduced to the fleet in 1994.

Bombardier has sold 391 Q400 and Q400 NextGen aircraft as of July 31 and delivered 312 planes to more than 30 operators.

Bombardier is the world's third-largest airplane manufacturer after Airbus and Boeing, Bloomberg News reports. The transportation giant's railway and plane businesses had total revenue exceeding $19 billion last year."
"A400M close to first air drop, refuelling tests, says Airbus - Flightglobal","Thu, 28 Oct 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYTQwMG0tY2xvc2UtdG8tZmlyc3QtYWlyLWRyb3AtcmVmdWVsbGluZy10ZXN0cy1zYXlzLWFpcmJ1cy85NjU5My5hcnRpY2xl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Military is poised to perform its first air-drop assessments with the A400M transport, while long-running contract negotiations with its seven European customers appear to also be making significant progress.

Development aircraft MSN1, which is undergoing artificial ice trials flying from Toulouse, will soon start air-drop tests, says Fernando Alonso, Airbus Military's senior vice-president flight and integration test centre. The process will first involve releasing balls from the transport's cargo ramp and doors, before progressing to dropping instrumented dummies and then paratroops from France and the UK.

Other planned activities for the A400M for the rest of this year include braking trials at Spain's Moron air base, and completing around five outstanding flutter test flights. ""We have done sufficient [tests] to be confident that our predictions are good,"" Alonso says, with these having already been completed at up to Mach 0.7.

Further work with a tail bumper installed will also prove the A400M's expected maximum take-off angle of around 12°, with 10° having already been demonstrated (below).

MSN1 is also to undergo receiver trials behind a Vickers VC10 tanker over a period of seven to 10 days, with the Royal Air Force type to support operations from Toulouse. To involve only dry contacts, the work will de-risk further work to be done using MSN4 next year.

Alonso says the priorities for early 2011 are to conduct natural icing trials and make the first series of landings on unprepared runways (artist's impression, below). Cold weather trials will be performed in Sweden and Canada, high-altitude operating tests made in La Paz, Bolivia, and hot weather activities conducted in Al Ain, the United Arab Emirates.

The A400M programme's current three test assets had flown a combined 200 sorties and 672 flight hours by 25 October, with Alonso revealing that the latter is around 100h fewer than planned.

One factor in this shortfall was the need to replace two Europrop International TP400-D6 engines during September: one from each of the programme's Toulouse-based aircraft. One suffered foreign object damage, while the other had an actuator failure due to pollution in its oil system. ""EPI was very reactive in isolating the root cause of the problem and fixing it,"" Alonso says, but each change took two to three weeks to complete.

Nonetheless, he says no major problems have been encountered to date, and Airbus expects to complete certification activities late next year.

Aircraft MSN4 is on track to make its flight debut before year-end, having recently been moved from the final assembly line at San Pablo airport near Seville to receive its hydraulics fluid and fuel. The first structure for programme's remaining development aircraft, MSN6, has also arrived at the site, with the centre wingbox to be followed within the next few weeks by its wings.

Airbus expects to sign a new production contract with Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Spain, Turkey and the UK before the end of the year. Germany is understood to have agreed to trim its purchase from 60 A400Ms to 53, which when combined with the UK's planned removal of three transports will reduce the European order to 170 aircraft.

Wired for success: Embraer fly-by-wire executive jets - Flightglobal,"Mon, 11 Oct 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vd2lyZWQtZm9yLXN1Y2Nlc3MtZW1icmFlci1mbHktYnktd2lyZS1leGVjdXRpdmUtamV0cy85NjIyNi5hcnRpY2xl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Embraer has chosen to use a side-stick cockpit controller for the Legacy 450/500, but the throttles will be back-driven.

With its Legacy 450/500 executive jets, Embraer is promising to ­develop and field a full three-axis closed-loop fly-by-wire ­controlled aircraft.

While a clean-sheet aircraft with FBW is not revolutionary, Embraer plans to bring the technology to a jet priced at one-half to one-third the cost of the only current FBW business jet, the Dassault Falcon 7X.

FBW controls on jet aircraft are not a recent development. The defence sector led the way in the 1970s with the US Air Force and General Dynamics developing and fielded the F-16. In the civil sector, Airbus has long been at the forefront of FBW development, selling thousands of its FBW A320 family.

But FBW applications in the business sector have lagged defence and civil applications by a good margin. The reasons are several, with cost and market acceptance perhaps being the major obstacles. When it was launched, Bombardier's large-cabin, long-range Global Express was to be the first FBW business jet. When the business jet was certificated, however, Bombardier had reverted to conventional flight controls.

It should be no surprise that the first FBW business jet, the Falcon 7X, was developed by a firm with much defence FBW experience.

BASIC FLY-BY-WIRE

FBW control schemes can offer many benefits, including increased performance and comfort, enhanced safety and reduced pilot workload. Whether all these benefits are realised depends heavily on how FBW is employed.

The simplest FBW systems are open loop, there being no control-feed back loop. The accelerator pedal in many automobiles is connected to the engine not with a mechanical linkage, but with a by-wire system. How far the pedal is pushed signals how high the engine is to rev. At this level, it is an open-loop system with speed controlled by the foot. Engaging the cruise control to maintain a desired speed closes the loop. Engine RPM is modulated by a feedback circuit to keep a steady speed.

Many aircraft FBW applications are open loop - the brake-by-wire systems of the Embraer Phenom 100/300, for example. While the system has an anti-skid feature, brake pedal displacement does not set a deceleration rate - rather, it only determines how much pressure is applied to the brake pads.

Embraer's first major FBW application on a civil aircraft is the flight control system in its E-Jets. Controls are digital in pitch (elevator) and yaw (rudder) axis. In the roll axis, spoilers are digital, but ailerons are conventional. While the system architecture is digital, actual pitch control is for the most part an open-loop affair. Embraer's goal in the E-Jet's pitch axis was to ""digitise"" a conventional pitch control system. Yoke displacement and aircraft speed are the primary inputs to a ""look-up"" table that determines how much the elevator is to be displaced. Only when angle-of-attack approaches a critical level does the control loop close on elevator displacement to prevent a stall. FBW spoiler control in the Phenom 300 and new Boeing 747-8 are also two examples of open-loop FBW control systems.

LEGACY IMPLEMENTATION

Embraer's control law design philosophy is to have ""soft limits"" that define the edges of the normal flight envelope and ""hard limits"" that define the edges of the limit flight envelope. Control laws in the normal flight envelope restrict pitch attitude to +30°/-15°, limit bank angle to 33° and speeds to a range between the maximum operating speed (VMO) and a minimum speed 10% above the stall speed (1.1 VSTALL).

These soft limits can be exceeded by holding the side stick out of neutral, but releasing the stick will automatically return the aircraft to the normal flight envelope. The limit flight envelope is defined not by pre-determined pitch/roll attitude limits, but rather by actual structural and controllability limits. Any combination of pitch and roll attitude is available as long as no limit is exceeded.

Embraer is working to define specific control laws for the Legacy 450/500. While in Brazil to fly the Phenom 300 in April, I had a chance to fly Embraer's flight-control development simulator and get a first look at the fruits of its efforts. Embraer has chosen to use a sidestick cockpit controller, but unlike Airbus, the throttles will be back-driven just as they are on Boeing aircraft.

The sidestick will be a displacement controller with a fixed force gradient in each axis. The two sidesticks are not interconnected, their inputs are summed to send a signal to the flight controls. In the event of a dual input, visual, aural and tactile warnings are provided. Yaw axis is controlled by a spring-loaded interconnected dual rudder pedal system.

Closed-loop FBW control systems seek to normalise aircraft response to pilot inputs such that regardless of the flight conditions, a set stick input will always generate the same aircraft response. In a conventional aircraft, moving the elevator merely changes the AOA on the horizontal stabiliser, which should change the aircraft's pitch attitude.

How much it changes is dependent on several factors including speed, altitude, gross weight and centre of gravity. The challenge for flight-control law developers is to pick a control scheme that mimics a conventional control system while still providing a normalised response. While in up and away conditions, not in take-off or landing configuration, longitudinal control stick displacement commands a rate of flightpath angle (gamma) change (gamma dot).

Broadly speaking, Embraer's gamma dot control is analogous to pitch rate (theta dot) control, used at slow speeds in Airbus civil aircraft. At higher speeds however, Airbus longitudinal (pitch) control shifts to a g command system.

While it might be preferable to have a single pitch control law over the entire speed range, flight experience has shown g command systems to be overly sensitive at low speeds, guiding the adaptation of a blended g command and theta dot longitudinal control scheme. Given Embraer's use of a single pitch control scheme over the entire speed range, it will be interesting to see how the gamma dot command system works at high speeds.

Conventional pitch controls only move the elevator, which generally gives conventional aircraft a level of speed stability. From a trimmed condition, advancing or retarding the power will cause the aircraft to climb or descend at the trimmed speed. Control schemes such as g command and theta dot/gamma dot will not by design exhibit speed stability. Whether speed stability is desirable or not is a matter of debate - Airbus does not include it while Boeing provides apparent speed stability in its 777.

At low speeds Embraer is investigating the addition of a trim control speed concept to give the Legacy apparent speed stability. My brief exposure to it was in a landing configuration, and it made the Legacy feel more like a conventional aircraft.

In a conventional aircraft the lateral-directional (roll-yaw) axes are interconnected, a fact to which any pilot experiencing a Dutch roll can attest. In a FBW control system they can be decoupled if desired. Airbus and Embraer have both decoupled the roll and yaw axes, and made the sidestick a roll rate controller. Lateral stick displacement only rolls the aircraft, without the adverse yawing found in a conventional aircraft.

Returning the stick to the centre position commands zero roll rate, and depending on the manufacturer's specific scheme limits, keeps the aircraft at a set bank angle. Roll axis control in the 777 is more like that of a conventional aircraft, lateral yoke displacement commanding aileron and roll spoiler deflection not a desired roll rate. Having flown the 777 and several Airbus aircraft, both roll control schemes work well when in an up and away condition.

With the advent of features such as yaw dampers and aileron-rudder interconnects, rudder use in conventional large aircraft is mostly limited to the take-off and landing phases of flight. In a conventional aircraft, side slip usually generates a roll in the direction of the rudder pedal input, termed roll due to yaw. With an FBW control scheme the roll and yaw axes again can be decoupled: rudder displacement only generating a wings level side slip.

Pilots, however, do expect some roll due to yaw, and some limited apparent roll due to yaw effects can be built into an FBW control system. The need for some roll due to yaw is most apparent in an engine failure scenario. Allowing the wing corresponding to the failed engine to drop is a good alert to the developing emergency situation. Airbus aircraft drop the dead engine's wing. Embraer is still fine-tuning its lateral-directional control laws, but an engine failure causes a gentle wings level turn (skid).

FBW BENEFITS

FBW controls schemes offer many benefits, the foremost perhaps being safety. Control laws can be designed so the pilot cannot exceed the authorised flight envelope, no more overspeed or over-g events. Embraer's pitch axis system limits gs at higher speeds transitioning to an AOA limiter at slower speeds.

The AOA limiter function negates the need for a stick pusher, as the aircraft cannot be pulled to a dangerous AOA. The g and AOA limiting feature also allows the pilot maximum performance in avoiding controlled flight into terrain and in windshear recovery manoeuvres.

Finally, a docile response to an engine failure can greatly stack the odds in the pilot's favour in a very demanding situation.

FBW control schemes also enhance aircraft performance. Automatic limiting features of Embraer's FBW control scheme should allow for a lighter aircraft as safety margins can be reduced. This is also applicable to the yaw axis, as sideslip limitations can reduce vertical tail loads and allow for a lower structural weight.

While not employed by Embraer for the Legacy, active load alleviation systems found on many large aircraft can further reduce structural weight. Reduced structural weight means less drag, while overspeed limiting features allow for cruise at speeds near the maximum design speeds VD/MD. AOA protections enhance runway performance as take-off and approach speeds can be flown closer to the actual stall speed.

FBW control systems can also enhance passenger comfort while reducing pilot workload. Transient aircraft motion due to power and configuration changes can be written out of the equation, a boon to both pilot and passenger. Uncommanded aircraft motions due to turbulence can be rapidly dampened out without reducing aircraft responsiveness to pilot control inputs. Lastly, FBW control systems can deliver an aircraft with predictable responses to control inputs throughout the entire flight envelope.

MEASURED PROGRESSION

Over the years Embraer has gained FBW experience in a measured step-by-step manner. Development of brake-by-wire systems and digital spoiler, rudder and pitch control systems in the E-Jets has given Embraer a foundation upon which to tackle a far greater challenge, the FBW Legacy 450/500 models.

Based on my brief flight in Embraer's flight-control development simulator, it appears to have a handle on the magnitude of the task, and is well on its way to developing a flight-control system for the prototype Legacy 500's first flight.

Promising simulation results, however, do not always pan out in real flight and Embraer has a long road ahead to certificate the FBW Legacy. If the past is prologue, Embraer will no doubt deliver a very capable midsized business jet with fine flying qualities.

A HARD-WORKING football coach has been nominated for a Trinity Mirror/ScottishPower Your Champions award, in the sport category.

Lee Starkey, 40, of Mold, has been nominated by Chronicle sport reporter Alec Doyle for his work with young people at the Airbus Football Academy.

“He is a hard-working, popular coach who has helped many youngsters take one step closer to their dream of a career in professional football,” said Alec.

“He maintains and expects high standards but ensures that barriers such as ability to pay never stand in the way of a talented youngster’s opportunity.

“His key achievement is not however providing players with the hope they may get to play for a Premiership youth academy, it is in helping players make the most of their ability, whatever level is right for them, and allowing them to enjoy the game to their fullest, a fact highlighted by Airbus U14s winning the FW Academy Cup last season.”

Lee has been training aspiring footballers, both boys and girls, at the Airbus Academy for five years.

Each week he trains 90 young people aged seven-19.

“I like giving the kids in the area the opportunity to progress to a higher level and getting them on the pitch,” said Lee.

“We’re the cheapest academy around and we’ve had the highest number of applications and players this year than we’ve ever had.

“Being part of the Academy gives the young people a sense of self-esteem, we want them to be proud of the academy.

“Last week the goalkeeper from the under-14s team signed a two-year contract with Manchester United, which we’re all very pleased with.”"
