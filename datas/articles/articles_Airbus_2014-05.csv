It takes more than an hour to walk from one end of the Airbus campus in Toulouse to the other. The snow-capped Pyrenees on the horizon are mirrored in the huge assembly-line buildings where the world’s largest commercial aircraft, the A380, is put together. The view is interrupted only by the planes taking off and landing from the nearby airport at Toulouse-Blagnac. Twenty thousand employees work at the campus, which sprawls over 600 hectares, the equivalent of more than 800 football pitches. It feels like a small town.

The chaos of transition

The size of the aerospace group’s operations in this city in southwest France and the humming activity in its offices, hangars and assembly lines are not only a testament to Airbus’s success but also a symbol of how Europe’s companies can compete in the 21st century.

It is fashionable to write-off the continent’s competitive future. “Europe has no competitive advantage,” says Jim O’Neill, adviser to the World Bank’s International Finance Corporation and former chief economist at Goldman Sachs. He also came up with the acronym Brics to identify a group of emerging markets (Brazil, Russia, India and China) whose economic growth was going to challenge the dominance of western Europe and North America.

According to the popular view, Europe labours under many disadvantages – high costs and regulation, unionised and not very mobile workforces and a sluggish regional economy. The World Economic Forum says the European Union underperforms against other advanced economies in three main areas: innovation, higher education and training systems, and the creation of an efficient labour market. With the continent in apparently permanent decline, the theory goes, its companies will be increasingly overtaken by competitors from more dynamic parts of the world.

But the near-universal gloom obscures what is a more complex and encouraging reality. In many areas of business, Europe is not just competitive but leading the field. Nine of the top 20 countries ranked by the World Economic Forum by competitiveness are in western Europe. And despite the sovereign debt crisis which has rocked the continent, the European Commission calculates that the eurozone has a comparative advantage on the world markets in about two-thirds of manufacturing sectors, concentrated in products with a high degree of sophistication and technical knowledge.

Airbus’s aircraft are one example of the strength of the European model.

The company should not really be successful. It has been repeatedly subjected to political meddling and unable to respond freely to commercial imperatives. The wrangles between its parent companies and the French, German and British governments have often been seen to hamper its development, forcing it to retain operations in parts of Europe which it would not necessarily have chosen had it been able to develop in the manner of a typical private sector company. “If we had started with a blank sheet of paper, this is not how the company would have developed,” acknowledges one company official.

Its genesis, 47 years ago, was more a political decision than a commercial one. In the late 1960s, the US had four-fifths of the world’s commercial aircraft market and, with the launch of the long-planned 747 jumbo jet imminent, looked set to consolidate its supremacy. Europe’s aircraft manufacturing industry, despite triumphs such as the launch of Concorde, the product of French and British collaboration and the world’s first supersonic passenger plane, appeared in terminal decline. Politicians in France, Germany, the UK and the Netherlands decided to act, committing at a meeting in July 1967 “for the purpose of strengthening European co-operation in the field of aviation technology and thereby promoting economic and technological progress in Europe, to take appropriate measures for the joint development and production of an airbus”.

The company began as a consortium of national aerospace manufacturers and at several points in the early years it seemed doomed to failure. It was only in 2001 that the company’s structure was consolidated under the ownership of the Franco-German group EADS and the British aerospace and defence company BAE Systems . The British sold out in 2006 but the governments of France, Germany and Spain, which became a full partner in 1971, continue to own stakes, either directly or indirectly.

Wrangling between the different owners, including over engine choices and manufacturing locations, failed, however, to overshadow the achievements of the Airbus pioneers Roger Béteille and Felix Kracht, who launched its first plane – the twin-engine wide-body A300B – in 1972.

Within 25 years, Airbus controlled 50 per cent of the global commercial aircraft market, and in 2003 it became the world’s largest supplier, measured by plane deliveries, beating arch-rival Boeing for the first time. The company has notched up other global records. It makes the world’s largest passenger aeroplane, the A380; its most advanced military transport plane, the A400M; and its A320 is one of the best-selling jetliner aircraft ranges ever. In 2013, it delivered more than 600 aircraft, received $240bn in orders and has a backlog of 5,000 planes to be delivered.

…

Airbus’s success lies in its political roots. While the original partners in the company recognised that the only way to compete was to consolidate national industries on a regional European basis, consolidation required negotiation and political finesse. Most sensitive was the decision where to site the different manufacturing operations. The easiest way to defuse tensions was to build different bits of the first plane, the A300B, in the different partner countries. The French made the cockpit, the control systems and the lower-centre section of the fuselage; the UK made the wings, and the Germans made the rest of the fuselage and a part of the centre section. The Dutch made the moving parts of the wing, the flaps and the spoilers, while the Spanish made the horizontal tailplane.

Another reason for this dispersed supply chain was to minimise arguments about the cherry on the cake of the whole process – who would put the plane together on the final assembly line. This was established in Toulouse but the decision was made to do as much of the work as possible in each separate manufacturing location, minimising the time at the end of the process, which ended up representing only one-40th of the total hours spent building the A300B.

“We got to develop deep expertise in each location,” says Tom Williams, who has been in the aerospace industry for more than 40 years, and is now in charge of programmes at Airbus. “That vision, that competitive advantage is now extremely difficult to replicate.”

The impact of that expertise can be felt on the ground. Like the original Airbus plane, each bit of the A400M military transport plane, which is put together in Seville, comes from a different part of Europe: the wings from the UK, the fuselage from Turkey and Germany, the nose and cockpit from France, and the engine from a consortium of European manufacturers that includes Rolls-Royce. Each component is transported in one of Airbus’s five specially built cargo planes, which have the biggest holds of any aeroplane in the world. One squats outside the main hangar in Seville, its protuberant front fuselage – which give the plane its nickname, the Beluga – flush to the doors of the final assembly line.

The A380’s journey for final assembly is even more like some modern-day pilgrimage. The wings, fuselage sections and tailplane are shipped from manufacturing sites in France, Germany, Spain and Britain, some parts in Belugas, others on special ferries, then by boat, barge and road in a convoy of six articulated lorries in the middle of the night to Toulouse.

The dispersed supply chain is fixed in stone – it would be a practical impossibility to switch the company’s mammoth operations in Bremen or Hamburg to somewhere possibly cheaper or more efficient. But Airbus believes that spreading out the process has enabled each site to develop a level of specialisation which has led to innovations and lowered the costs of its planes: laser beam welding for civil aircraft, for example, which reduces weight and corrosion, or the computerised flight attendant system developed in Germany and first installed in planes in 2005. The spread-out nature of its manufacturing operations also means Airbus has developed innovative means of collaborating on projects remotely. The engineers in Seville hold discussions with their colleagues in Hamburg over a 3D digital mock-up of the A400M which shows every bolt in the plane.

And that discussion is in English. Béteille, the French engineer who pioneered Airbus’s first plane, insisted that the company’s working language had to be English; every work station in the Seville final assembly line is labelled in English, and every senior manager is required to speak it.

Despite such achievements, the Airbus story is far from an entirely rosy one. It may be a company with a stock market capitalisation of €38bn but it made its first operating profit only in 1990. And although analysts forecast an operating profit of just under €4bn in 2014, its profit margin is only a relatively measly 6 per cent.

Analysts at UBS estimate that the A380 programme will lose $1bn this year, while the A400M suffered years of delay and cost overruns in development and is struggling to find export orders.

Airbus’s ownership ructions also continue. In 2012, it attempted a second marriage with its former British partner, BAE Systems. But the deal was scuppered by Angela Merkel, who apparently believed that it would shift too much power away from Germany. Although the final outcome – a dramatic reduction of indirect state ownership in Airbus – should reduce political meddling in the company in the future, it was a huge setback. Airbus has since restructured and abandoned its target of reaching a 50/50 split between commercial and military sales by 2020.

Underpinning this challenge is the constant drumbeat of rows with Boeing in the US , its main rival. Boeing has continually protested over “launch aid” and other forms of government support to Airbus, while Airbus has argued that Boeing receives illegal subsidies through military and research contracts and tax breaks.

But Boeing is not the only competitive threat. The most buoyant demand for aeroplanes in the future will be from emerging markets. To compete, Airbus has opened facilities overseas in Indonesia, Tianjin, China and, last year, in Mobile, Alabama. As one Airbus official puts it, the assembly line design was “copied and pasted to Tianjin and Mobile”.

The reasons behind moving production out of Europe, though, are not what might be expected. They were made not because it is cheaper or easier but because of the difficulties of breaking into certain markets and the lure of government support. Production of the C295 military aircraft was moved to Indonesia because its government provided financial and regulatory incentives to foreign aircraft manufacturers to shift its domestic industry up the value chain. In China, it would also have been difficult to increase sales without a joint venture.

The long-term threat is that those countries will develop competitive aircraft manufacturing industries of their own. China, Russia, India and Brazil all have aspirations to become global players.

Similarly, Airbus’s decision to open a facility in the US last year was to help it compete for government and commercial contracts. In 2008, for example, the federal government’s decision to acquire its military tanker plane, the MRTT, was overturned on political grounds. “When we can offer American Airlines an American-built plane, it will make a difference,” says Williams wryly.

But the company’s decision to stay predominantly European is not just political or the result of its history. It is also because by doing so it can benefit from one of the region’s main competitive advantages in the 21st century: its ability to innovate, particularly in technology. “Innovation is not sudden,” says Jesús Portillo, who manages the A400M programme in Seville.

…

The lessons Airbus’s success holds for Europe and its businesses are as complex as the company’s political roots. Quite how to apply them is just as unclear. The most obvious is for Europe’s leaders to select another industry in which to build a global presence and nurture it as they did Airbus. But the aerospace company was born in the heady days of euro-optimism and the likelihood of a similar project today seems low. “Another path for Europe to consider would be to pick a couple of other sectors where it could pose a global competitive challenge,” says O’Neill. “But this doesn’t sit with the philosophy of the UK and Germany.” Overcoming national resistance might prove worthwhile.

Colm Reilly of PA Consulting has conducted in-depth research on companies’ global competitiveness. “The smartest countries are tailoring the levers,” he says. “Countries with a clear industrial strategy … target particular foreign direct investors, they develop trade prowess in certain sectors. They go to five multinational companies and ask, ‘How do I get you to invest here in the next five years?’”

Reilly believes one strategy is to focus on filling gaps in current capability – as Indonesia and China have done in attracting Airbus to invest. He argues that there is a need for a pan-European strategy to focus on developing sectors where Europe already has an advantage, such as pharmaceuticals, cybersecurity or life sciences.

Peteris Zilgalvis, visiting EU fellow at St Antony’s College, Oxford, agrees that there are areas where Europe can replicate past successes. “We had Concorde, we had high-speed trains, the start of the internet… but they are all now some way back,” he says. “But the big jumps are going to be made in areas where so far there has been little innovation up until now, such as healthcare, education and the public sector.” He also emphasises the positive role the state can play and says that Europe has an advantage here over the US. “We can support an essential sector by saying we do and will need finance, for example, and we will invest in it. But [Europe] needs to be more active in leading on research, in providing government support on finding markets.”

If governments had not argued to keep manufacturing capacity in their individual countries, not only would Airbus have turned out to be less competitive but the skills that go with such capability would have been lost.

The European Roundtable of Industrialists, an influential lobby organisation which groups together chief executives and chairmen of the continent’s 50 top companies, believes that as the world’s biggest market, Europe is most likely to succeed if it operates as a region. “Europe’s industrial renaissance must remain the priority,” says chairman Leif Johansson, who also chairs AstraZeneca. “This can best be achieved if the EU renews its political determination to complete the single market.”

“We need to have more of a single market, more of an integrated market,” agrees Nani Beccalli-Falco, head of GE Europe, the US conglomerate which employs 90,000 people in Europe. “Europe has to become more united rather than less united.”

Airbus is certainly one example of a company that is only competitive because it was a pan-European endeavour. If the individual countries had pursued purely national objectives, their domestic industries would have succumbed to global rivals.

“Airbus is one of very few examples of successful European state planning,” admits O’Neill. “If Europe operated as one single entity, you can explore the economies of scale of a single entity.”

The challenges of replicating Airbus in another industry are great: getting the choice of industry right, whether Europe has the skills and technology needed, who would lead the project, whether the region or its companies can pull in one direction. But the same challenges existed nearly 50 years ago when Airbus was born.

“If there could be one lesson… to be learnt from the Airbus Industrie experience,” says Jean Pierson, Airbus’s chief executive from 1985 to 1998, “it would be that co-operation is the key to prosperity and that there simply is room no more for narrow nationalistic endeavours.”

Airbus Defence and Space launches new Multi-Standard Base Station for broadband in the 400 MHz frequency range - Airbus,"Tue, 20 May 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxNC0wNS1haXJidXMtZGVmZW5jZS1hbmQtc3BhY2UtbGF1bmNoZXMtbmV3LW11bHRpLXN0YW5kYXJkLWJhc2Utc3RhdGlvbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Summary

New important component for the Evercor offering, the mission-critical broadband solution that complements existing Tetra and Tetrapol radio systems.

New Multi-Standard Base Station for broadband in the 400 MHz frequency range<br /> <br /> ""prohibited use without consent of the author""

At the Critical Communications World (CCW) fair in Singapore, Airbus Defence and Space introduced a new Multi-Standard Base Station (MBS) platform, combining the Professional Mobile Radio (PMR) technology of Airbus Defence and Space with the Long Term Evolution (LTE) technology of Alcatel-Lucent. This important network element allows PMR networks to add broadband services to their existing Tetra (terrestrial trunked radio) or Tetrapol systems with no impact on the quality of the voice services.

With the MBS, Airbus Defence and Space presented at the CCW the first commercially available LTE solution (eNB) of its kind that operates in the 400 MHz frequency range, which is reserved for the military and for public safety organisations. It completes the Evercor offering of Airbus Defence and Space and Alcatel-Lucent for mission-critical broadband, enabling larger data transmission by using existing PMR networks.

Public safety organisations like the police, fire and rescue services, as well as military users, are facing an increasing need for larger data capacities. “Traditional PMR technologies like Tetrapol and Tetra are evolving to cope with the new needs, aiming for very high-speed broadband capacities that are required more and more by public safety and emergency service users,” said Eric Davalo, Head of Product and Service Portfolio at Airbus Defence and Space. “Our users need to be sure their systems will be operational today and also support tomorrow’s ways of working. We have designed the eNB with that in mind, by using an architecture that supports a smooth and cost-efficient migration towards LTE 400.”

The new MBS operates across all traditional ultra-high frequency bands, such as 380- 400 MHz, 410-430 MHz and 450-470 MHz. As a prerequisite of the development, it is fully compliant with the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), which defines new LTE specifications to set the path for the mission-critical solutions of the future.

The Evercor solution – launched by Airbus Defence and Space and Alcatel-Lucent during the Tetra World Congress 2011 in Budapest – brings the benefits of the latest 3GPP standards to mission-critical users in the preferred and available frequency range. After first complementing currently proven mission-critical PMR systems like Tetra or Tetrapol with true broadband data performance, the system will evolve to support today’s needs for data and tomorrow’s requirements for efficient group calls, security, resilience and control by the user organisations. At CCW, a high-power modem in the 400 MHz spectrum (HiPo Modem) was also introduced as another new element of Evercor."
Airbus ACJ319 Modular Interior - Business Insider,"Fri, 16 May 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vYWlyYnVzLWFjajMxOS1tb2R1bGFyLWludGVyaW9yLTIwMTQtNdIBSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vYWlyYnVzLWFjajMxOS1tb2R1bGFyLWludGVyaW9yLTIwMTQtNT9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus's new ACJ319 Elegance corporate jet has a truly ingenious interior.

But Airbus did something smart with the middle of the plane: it divided the interior into three separate zones that can be customized with various off-the-shelf modules. Customers can choose from pre-designed modules for dining, conducting business, socializing, and even for watching movies.

Airbus's modular concept is a fundamental departure from traditional corporate jet design, which emphasizes individuality and customization. The company's off-the-shelf modules will not only simplify the sometimes daunting interior design process for would-be buyers, but also allow existing owners to upgrade and modify their jets' interiors with ease. The plug-and-play interior may signal a shift in the way future buyers appoint their jets' interiors. Since all the modules are designed and built in-house at the Airbus Corporate Jet Center in Toulouse, France, the Elegance interior could become a new revenue driver for the aerospace giant.

Aesthetically, the new interior is truly elegant; the design is plush without being gaudy, and luxurious without sacrificing practicality. Based on the A319 airliner, the ACJ319 is powered by pair of CFM56 turbofan engines that give the eight-passenger jet a range of 6900 miles and a top speed of roughly 600 mph. According to the Robb Report, ACJ319 Elegance with its pre-designed modules will have a price tag of around $80 million; a full $7 million less than one with a fully customized interior."
ADAC Luftfahrt Technik and Airbus Helicopters sign parts-by-the-hour contract for EC145 T2 fleet - Vertical Magazine,"Wed, 21 May 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2FkYWNsdWZ0ZmFocnR0ZWNobmlrYW5kYWlyYnVzaGVsaWNvcHRlcnNzaWducGFydHNieXRoZWhvdXJjby_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters and ADAC Luftfahrt Technik (ALT), the maintenance arm of ADAC Luftrettung, have signed a parts-by-the-hour service contract for the air rescue organization’s EC145 T2 fleet. The ten-year service agreement with a volume of some 25 million euros covers a comprehensive range of services for the new aircraft.

The package for 14 new EC145 T2 helicopters includes technical services adapted to ALT’s requirements and provided at fixed costs. In addition, maintenance is organized so as to ensure the highest levels of helicopter availability possible.

“The availability and safety of our helicopters is absolutely fundamental to our daily missions in Germany, from responding to emergencies to transporting intensive care patients from one hospital to another,” said Thomas Hütsch, chief executive officer of ADAC Luftfahrttechnik GmbH. “Accordingly, we rely on fast and efficient maintenance processes, which is exactly what Airbus Helicopters supplies under this power-by-the-hour contract. We’re looking forward to this new phase of our successful decades-long partnership.”

“The chief priority of Airbus Helicopters is the satisfaction of our customers—over the entire life cycle of their helicopters,” says Guillaume Faury, president of Airbus Helicopters. “So we’re delighted that ADAC Luftfahrttechnik has chosen our parts-by-the-hour contract. They can depend on us to deserve their confidence in our service and to help keep their helicopters flying safely and cost-effectively.”

With a fleet of more than 50 helicopters, ADAC Luftrettung is one of the largest air rescue organizations in Europe. In Germany, the company operates the EC135, BK117 and EC145 models of the Airbus Helicopters range. The new EC145 T2 will gradually replace the BK117."

Emirates began service between Dubai and Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport on Feb. 2, 2012, using 266-seat Boeing 777-200 jets. But the route has proven so successful that on Oct. 1, Emirates will replace the Boeing 777 with the world’s largest passenger jet, the 489-seat Airbus A380.

“The time is right now for coming with bigger capacity,” said Emirates executive Hubert Frach, who visited North Texas this week to promote the route. “Compared to the aircraft we’re operating right now, the Airbus A380 is offering 83 percent more capacity.”

Frach, Emirates divisional senior vice president for the Americas, Europe and Africa, discussed the carrier's plans in an interview with the Dallas Morning News. Here are some edited excerpts from that conversation:

Does Emirates have any doubt that it will be able to fill the larger A380?

We never have concerns about filling it up. No, in general, I have to tell you, in the U.S., we are flying with A380s to New York, double daily, and we also going with an A380 to Los Angeles and it hasn’t been a problem. The aircraft is extremely popular among our customers. We have operated the aircraft since 2008, and more than 20 million have flown on an Emirates Airbus A380.

Advertisement

It’s really, really driving demand. A lot of customers really want to fly Airbus A380s. They book intentionally to fly it where we deploy an Airbus A380, so it will not be a problem. The jump in Los Angeles when we took from a 777 to an Airbus A380 was no issue at all. We don’t see dips in load factors. We do not expect that in Dallas, either.

One of the surprises for us has been the large number of your North Texas passengers going into India and Pakistan. Why is that?

It’s a matter of where you have the so-called ethnic communities based in the U.S. It’s different, by the way, between Seattle and JFK [New York]. It’s different between Los Angeles and Dallas. Dallas has a strong ethnic population from the Indian subcontinent. In Los Angeles, for instance, you have a strong population from Iran. In Seattle, you have a strong Ethiopian population.

Advertisement

I don’t know how originally all of this developed in the U.S. But you know, I do think families do follow families, and they emigrate into the U.S. I think this is how certain catchments develop their sort of strength in terms of specific traffic flows.

Advertisement

With our flights, with our connectivity, we certainly also try to support that. You will see that our flights out of Dallas have perfect connections into India. We have very short transit times in Dubai.

It always very important that you know exactly what kind of market you see — where do people fly — and then you build an infrastructure beyond Dubai. You don’t want to offer a product where passengers have to wait eight, nine hours in your connecting hub.

Are more than half your passengers out of D/FW Airport going to the Indian subcontinent?

Advertisement

What I can say is usually 40 percent are point-to-point passengers into Dubai, so they end in Dubai, and 60 percent go beyond. There, the majority is Indian subcontinent. But we also have solid traffic flows into southeast Asia.

American Airlines recently ended its interline agreement to exchange passengers with Emirates. Did the arrangement feed many passengers to Emirates?

Well, it definitely provided feed. But even without the interline agreement with American Airlines, we see right now that we don’t face a different seat factor. Our stand-alone operation as we do it right now is very successful. Otherwise, we wouldn’t increase from a 777 to an Airbus A380.

Besides that, in the U.S. we have other partners. We have JetBlue as a code-share partner. ... We also have Virgin America as a frequent-flier partner, and we have Alaska Airlines. I think we have a solid foundation of operations and partnerships here in the U.S. beyond American. And Dallas is big enough really to be operated and filled out of the catchment of Dallas alone.

Two other Middle Eastern carriers will enter the D/FW market this year: Qatar Airways from Doha on July 1 and Etihad Airways from Abu Dhabi on Dec. 3. Discuss that looming competition, please.

D/FW is not the first destination where we compete with three or more competitors. I think it will just add additional choice to the consumer. It doesn’t surprise us, and it doesn’t scare us away. The situation where you have three carriers from geographically close proximity is also well known. … It is competition.

And I have to tell you with the Airbus A380, I think we have a competitive advantage. ... Customers really book specific flights only because they want to go on the Airbus A380. How will we compete? It’s product quality and it’s a network quality because we have 140 destinations in our network, way more than others might have right now. I think we have the right destinations in our network. And I think the product will be really the decisive factor here.

Airbus’s New ACJ319 Derivative Aims at Easing the Buying Process"
Airbus Helicopters displays a Russian-operated AS350 B3 rotorcraft at HeliRussia - Vertical Magazine,"Fri, 23 May 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2FpcmJ1c2hlbGljb3B0ZXJzZGlzcGxheXNhcnVzc2lhbm9wZXJhdGVkYXMzNTBiM3JvdG9yY3JhZnRhdC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"As the leading supplier of foreign-made turbine-powered rotorcraft in Russia, Airbus Helicopters’ participation at this week’s HeliRussia industry show focuses on its product range and mission diversity – including the display of a single-engine AS350 B3, a best-seller that has earned its reputation with customers in Russia and abroad.

Airbus Helicopters’ AS350 B3 is the only foreign-made rotorcraft chosen by Russian companies for a full range of missions: pipeline monitoring, the airlift of sling loads weighing up to 1.4 tons, geophysical surveys and passenger transportation, among others. This multi-role helicopter also is actively used in VIP flights with up to five passengers.

Its popularity among Russian customers is confirmed by the numbers: 43 rotorcraft of this type are used in the country, along with 12 EC130s – which also are members of Airbus Helicopters’ popular Ecureuil family.

Airbus Helicopters’ presence at HeliRussia is the seventh time it has joined this annual event, with the 2014 edition marking the first since the company’s rebranding from Eurocopter. Under the new identity, and benefitting from the strength of its Airbus Group parent company, Airbus Helicopters Vostok retains the region’s market leadership by a broad margin, accounting for over 60 percent of the foreign-built rotorcraft delivered in Russia and the CIS – with more than 225 helicopters operating in the region.

“HeliRussia has become the industry gathering of choice to meet customers, discuss support operations, as well as to showcase new rotorcraft and technologies,” explained Laurence Rigolini, the general manager of Airbus Helicopters Vostok. “This is why we are an active supporter again in 2014, being the general sponsor of the region’s largest helicopter exhibition for the seventh time.”

Also at HeliRussia, Airbus Helicopters will be highlighting the upcoming introduction of its new EC175, which will enter service in 2014 with launch customers that include Russian operator UTair. Deliveries of this seven-ton-class medium rotorcraft will begin before year-end, with UTair introducing the EC175 on missions for the oil and gas industry, as well as deploying it for further market expansion. The major Russian heli-lift service provider has a total of 15 EC175s on order.

Another element of Airbus Helicopters Vostok’s presence at HeliRussia is a scale model display of the twin-engine EC135, which is well-suited to medical evacuation missions in Russia and the CIS – as well as utility duties, business transport and law enforcement missions.

Airbus Helicopters developing utility version of EC145 - Vertical Magazine,"Tue, 20 May 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzaGVsaWNvcHRlcnNkZXZlbG9waW5ndXRpbGl0eXZlcnNpb25vZmVjMTQ1L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters is developing a new variant of its EC145 specifically designed for the utility market. Known as the EC145e, the aircraft will offer an increased payload of 324 pounds (147 kilograms) over the standard EC145 utility configuration.

Airbus Helicopters, Inc. president and CEO Marc Paganini hinted at the aircraft’s development at the company’s press breakfast at Helicopter Association International’s Heli-Expo 2014, in Anaheim, Calif., when he told Vertical that the company had been looking at offering a more affordable medium-twin helicopter to suit the needs of utility and commercial operators.

“We [have] looked at this market; we think it is a very promising market,” he said at the event. “We are looking at the [EC]145 with a very simple interior . . . in order to be more competitive in terms of price, and deliver the aircraft that the utility operator needs for their mission.”

In technical data sheets released by the manufacturer, the EC145e, with the designation Bk117 C-2e, is described as a twin-engine, multi-purpose helicopter in the three-four ton class, with up to 12 seats for pilot/s and passengers. The aircraft, powered by two Turbomeca Arriel 1E2 engines, will be certified for single pilot VFR (visual flight rules) day/night operation with a new cockpit concept, increased payload, and increased pilot visibility.

The equipped empty weight of the EC145e is 4,156 lb. (1,885 kg), which allows for a payload of up to 2,031 lb. (921 kg). This compares with an equipped empty weight of the EC145 reference utility configuration of 4,486 lb. (2,034 kg), resulting in a payload of up to 1,707 lb. (775 kg).

The weight of the basic configuration of the EC145e has been kept minimal through the removal of items such as the tinted sun shades for the cockpit windshield roof section (saving 4.6 lb./2.1 kg), automatic flight control system (67.3 lb./30.5 kg), MEGHAS sensor kit (45.9 lb./20.8 kg) and the co-pilot flight controls (14.6 lb./6.6 kg).

The slimmed-down instrument panel for single pilot operation will have the Garmin G500H as primary flight displays and multifunction display, suited with two 6.5-inch LCD displays. The GPS and communication functions are provided by a Garmin GTN 650, while the central panel display system, consisting of two additional LCD displays, includes Airbus Helicopters’ first limit indicator. The manufacturer said this system simplifies engine and torque monitoring, allowing pilots to dedicate more of their attention to the mission requirements.

Optional equipment will include a rescue hoist, internal long-range fuel tank, and cargo hook. “The EC145e is ready to take diverse missions ranging from firefighting support to internal and external load transport, or passenger transport,” the technical data sheet states.

The aircraft successfully performed flight tests in August 2013, and European Aviation safety Agency (EASA) and United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) type certification is expected by the third quarter of this year, with deliveries scheduled to begin in the fourth quarter."

Leading the field is the aviation industry because it’s easy to make lightweight parts that are very durable.

Imagine an airplane with a huge window where passengers look out at the sky around them through a transparent membrane. The struts holding the planes's fuselage together are geared more than ever before to the actual forces and load that affect the plane's rigidity and stability. They look tangled and more like a network of roots and not at all like components designed by simulation software.

Bastian Schäfer has presented this visionary aircraft at the International Laser Technology Convention in Aachen. The German engineer is researching designs for the aircraft of the future at Airbus in Hamburg.. ""The lighter we design planes, the more fuel we will save,” said Schäfer. “That's why bionic lightweight construction and 3-D printing are the key technologies which will dramatically affect the aviation industry.”

Up to 70 percent less weight

And that is why the Laser Convention in Aachen had such a strong focus on the aviation industry. Components designed on a computer and printed by a laser printer are gaining in popularity. Such manufacturing techniques create lightweight, resilient constructions that withstand extreme forces.

The Airbus idea has a lot to do with science and not much with fiction. Today, more and more aircraft components are already produced by 3-D laser printers. The weight reduction achieved by using so-called bionic designs is illustrated by a new cabin mount made of titanium. At only 0.6 kilograms (1.3 lbs.) it is only half the weight of the conventional component.

Bionic mounts are not just lighter than conventional mounts, they are also more durable Image: DW/F. Schmidt

“Our mount was supposed to bear a weight of 2.4 tons. We inserted it in a testing machine and after a while it wasn't the mount that broke but the testing machine,” said Schäfer. In the end, the component withstood a load of more than six tons. It wasn't only lighter it was also much sturdier. The lesson was that weight could be reduced even more. The weight of single components can be reduced by up to 70 percent, according to the Airbus developer.

Melting in a powder bed

The Airbus mount was produced in a selective laser sintering process in which a laser melts the component layer by layer in a powder bed. This method allows the production of highly sophisticated and detailed components. The disadvantage is that even the production of small parts takes a long time because the layers are so thin.

A welding head applies a layer on a metal plate Image: DW/F. Schmidt

Not as fine and latticed, but much faster, is a welding process known as laser cladding, or deposition welding .A robotic arm passes a laser beam over a surface, while miniscule nozzles blow metal dust into its focus. The particles melt on contact with the laser beam, bonding to the surface, and a new structure is formed. This process is often used today to repair high quality components that are subject to wear and tear.

Serial production is already the reality

Laser printed metals are as durable as conventionally forged metals – even after repair. Every imaginable metal alloy - whether titanium, nickel, cobalt, copper or aluminum alloy - can be processed this way. Engineers are even able to print components made of ceramic materials.

The tips of these turbine blades have been attached by so-called deposition welding, or cladding Image: DW/F. Schmidt

Laser developers are convinced that 3-D printing is the future for the serial production of aircraft parts.

“General Electric (GE) is set to generate 100,000 jet fuel injector nozzles in the near future,” says Wilhelm Meiners from the Frauenhofer Institute for Laser Technology . “That is a mass production to be reckoned in the realm of jet engine construction.”

And GE is not alone. Other major turbine manufacturers, like MTU and Rolls Royce, are also focusing on components made by 3-D laser printers."

COLUMBUS, MS--(Marketwired - May 14, 2014) - Airbus Group today delivered to the Army the service's 300th UH-72A Lakota helicopter. Every Lakota has been delivered -- on time and on budget -- by an American workforce that is more than 50 percent U.S. military veterans.

The Lakota is manufactured at the company's Airbus Helicopters, Inc. facility in Columbus, Miss., where Col. Thomas Todd, Army Project Manager for Utility Aircraft, accepted delivery of the 300th aircraft.

""Airbus has an established record of on time or ahead of schedule aircraft deliveries,"" said Col. Todd. ""Their Columbus facility has recorded a nine year record of excellence.""

Since the UH-72A contract was competitively awarded in 2006, the company has delivered the Lakota in seven different configurations for missions including training, border security, search and rescue, medical evacuation, disaster response, VIP transport and range support. Five aircraft are also in service with the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School, which trains Navy, Marine Corps and Army test pilots.

Army officials have recently indicated plans to modernize the service's rotorcraft training fleet with the UH-72A.

""The Lakota was competitively selected eight years ago because it was an easily adaptable solution for a broad range of mission requirements, with a low-risk design that allowed the Army to save taxpayers millions in development costs,"" said Allan McArtor, Chairman and CEO of Airbus Group, Inc. ""Industry should be in the business of enabling and supporting that kind of smart decision-making for our customer.""

Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant praised the partnership that the state has formed with Airbus Group in delivering a critical capability to the U.S. military. ""Almost a decade ago, Airbus made an investment in Mississippi and its people, raising a world-class aerospace manufacturing facility out of a green field,"" Gov. Bryant said. ""That investment has paid off not just for the company, but for the men and women of the Army and for the Mississippi families who are positively affected by the company's presence in our state.""

Story continues

Members of Congress who spoke at the delivery ceremony commended the Lakota workforce for its commitment to quality and exceptional record of performance.

""I applaud the efforts of Airbus to hire veterans to help build the Lakota here in the United States,"" said U.S. Congressman Jeff Miller, representative for Florida's First District and Chair of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs. ""Veterans prove they can get the job done as a civilian workforce and understand first-hand what our warfighters need and deserve; that shows in the care and performance they put into this program.""

""From day one, you have delivered on your promise to the taxpayer and the warfighter: every aircraft on time and on budget,"" said U.S. Congressman Alan Nunnelee of Mississippi's First District. ""That's the kind of reliable performance that the Department of Defense needs now more than ever. And it's the kind of dedication that is the hallmark of the Mississippi workforce.""

""The Army's Lakota and the proud Americans who build it set an example that all federal acquisition programs should follow,"" said U.S. Congressman Gregg Harper, who represents the state's Third District. ""Particularly at a time of fiscal constraint, performing on time and on cost should be the rule, not the exception.""

The UH-72A offers the lowest cost to buy, own and operate of any U.S. military helicopter in production, with a baseline unit cost of just $5.5 million. The Lakota fleet recently passed the 200,000 flight hour milestone, and it maintains greater than 90 percent availability with full contractor logistics support.

The 300th Army Lakota will serve with the Missouri National Guard. The aircraft was delivered in the Security and Support (S&S) Battalion configuration, which expands the UH-72A's capabilities for missions ranging from disaster response to border security operations.

The S&S configuration includes an electro-optical and infrared sensor, searchlight, digital video recorder, secure data downlink and moving map. Lakotas equipped in the S&S configuration are serving with Army National Guard units across the country, including extensive operations along the U.S. southwest border for border security and drug interdiction.

Included in the KADEX 2014 aircraft displays at Astana International Airport will be two Airbus Helicopters EC145s supplied to Kazakhstan – one operated by the Ministry of Defense, and another with the Ministry of Emergency Situations – which are part of 45 such twin-engine rotorcraft being acquired by the government.

This major fleet build-up is supported by Eurocopter Kazakhstan Engineering, a joint venture of Airbus Helicopters and the Kazakhstan Engineering state company, which assembles EC145s and is developing local maintenance and training capabilities to support their operations in the country, as well as across the region’s new Eurasian Economic Community customs union and throughout central Asia.

“The Republic of Kazakhstan is at the heart of our long-term regional industrial strategy and our projects would enable the country to benefit from state-of-the-art helicopters that meet its vertical airlift needs for all ministries, while also developing sustainable activities in aircraft assembly, maintenance and training,” said Olivier Michalon, Airbus Helicopters’ vice president Europe & Central Asia.

To date, Airbus Helicopters has delivered 20 EC145s to Kazakhstan, which are utilized by the Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Emergency Situations, Ministry of Health, and Ministry of Environment. Six more are to be supplied to government agencies in 2014, with the remaining EC145s being delivered through 2016. At KADEX 2012, a Letter of Intent was also signed between Airbus Helicopters and Kazakhstan for 20 EC725 which marked the expansion of the joint strategic partnership to specialized military aircraft.

The EC145 is a helicopter of choice in its medium-size twin-engine category. EC145s are used in a wide range of missions, including police and public services, on-shore and off-shore airlift for the oil and gas industries, emergency medical services, business and VIP transportation. With more than 650 delivered to some 120 customers in 44 countries and 1 million flight hours accumulated, the EC145 offers flexibility and versatility in worldwide operations – particularly the conditions encountered in Kazakhstan.

Also spotlighted at KADEX 2014 will be Airbus Helicopters’ EC645 T2 and EC725 rotorcraft, which are to be presented as scale models at the event. The multi-role EC645 T2 is a new military version of the EC145, particularly adapted to light attack and scout missions; while the long-range EC725 is a versatile and combat-proven tactical helicopter, adapted for such applications as troop transport, combat search and rescue, close air support, fire-fighting and anti-surface warfare.

KADEX 2014 will be the first major event in Kazakhstan where Airbus Helicopters – previously known as Eurocopter – is appearing in its rebranded identity as part of the Airbus Group parent company. Airbus Helicopters will be on the Airbus Group exhibit (Stand #100/3), with the Eurocopter Kazakhstan Engineering having its own presence on the Air-Electronics stand (Hall 8)."

The NATO Support Agency (NSPA) is NATO’s Integrated Logistics and Services Provider Agency, which executed the procurement process for the service contract on behalf of the German Federal Police.

This service contract covers all 41 EC135 T2i rotorcraft in the Bundespolizei Fliegergruppe (German Federal Police Flying Squadron) fleet, with the initial aircraft to arrive at Airbus Helicopters’ Kassel-Calden, Germany maintenance facility later this month. The agreement has an initial three-year timeframe, with an extension option to five years.

“We are uniquely positioned to support the German Federal Police’s helicopter inventory, bringing our full resources as the manufacturer of the EC135 to ensure their readiness,” explained Ulrich Amersdorffer, Airbus Helicopters vice president – MRO Germany.

Maintenance services covered by the agreement include phase inspections, engine inspections, replacement of operation time limit parts (OTL), component repair and overhaul, the application of service bulletins, the compliance with service letters, the incorporation of engineering orders, as well as helicopter painting.

“Responsiveness is the key to mission success for the German Federal Police. Therefore we are looking forward to benefit from Airbus Helicopters’ MRO competence in keeping the Bundespolizei’s EC135 T2i fleet in the sky” added NSPA’s Senior Contracting Officer.

Airbus Helicopters’ EC135 T2i is a member of the company’s EC135 multi-mission twin-engine rotorcraft family, featuring Arrius 2B2 engines with higher power ratings, an increased maximum take-off weight and other enhancements.

The German Federal Police is Airbus Helicopters’ largest law enforcement customer in Europe, with 85 company-built rotorcraft in its fleet. Their relationship dates back more than 50 years, when the agency’s predecessor – the German Federal Border Guard – began operating its first

Alouette II helicopter in 1962.

In addition to the German Federal Police Aviation Service’s current inventory of EC135s, the other Airbus Helicopter-built rotorcraft types it operates are EC155s, AS332 L1s and EC120s, the latter for training purposes only. Duties performed by the law enforcement agency include border patrol and search-and-rescue missions, along with the transportation of personnel and special forces in national and international environments."

We know it’s not American Airlines because American doesn’t have A380s. But it could be Lufthansa, British Airways, Qantas Airways or Korean Air.

Qatar Airways and Etihad Airways don’t fly to D/FW or fly Airbus A380s, but they both will have their first A380s and a D/FW route by year’s end.

Perhaps we’ll have a new A380 operator enter the market like Air France or Asiana Airlines. But one would assume that it would be a carrier upsizes its equipment rather than entering the market with the need of attracting 400-plus passengers each way every day."

The TrakkaBeam A800 Searchlight will be Type Certified for the EC135, EC145 and EC175. In addition to this, the Trakka Searchlight is already Type Certified by Airbus Helicopters on the EC155, EC225, and is STC’d on the AS350.

Cliff Schwidlewski, Trakka’s engineering manager, stated, “The requirements have been extremely challenging but the close working relationship between Airbus Helicopters and Trakka has been paramount to the success of this project. The extensive testing and Airbus’s Helicopters engineering and quality teams’ process of approval and qualification, has proven that Trakka fulfils the highest quality standards of a product”.

The TrakkaBeam searchlight is a paradigm shift in engineering and design, which has eliminated the inefficiencies of traditional searchlight technology. Trakka has concentrated on producing a system that achieves maximum efficiency and visibility, in a variety of operational situations.

The TrakkaBeam has become the benchmark in aviation searchlight technology, due to its sleek, aerodynamic characteristics, low power draw, low weight, superior mission functionality and reliability and is used internationally by leading ground and airborne law enforcement, security forces, as well as search and rescue agencies, to strengthen their capability to achieve mission objectives.

Its unique internally integrated filter wheel enables the installation of a range of spectral light filters including infrared, visible red and amber. This creates unparalleled visibility and mission capability during night-time operations, in moist or foggy conditions, and during NVG operations.

The advanced optics, only available with the TrakkaBeam, also makes the searchlight far more efficient than any other on the market, resulting in the use of an 800W lamp whilst still achieving outstanding performance and range."
Army asks Airbus to build another 10 UH-72 Lakota utility helicopters in $55.4 million contract - Military & Aerospace Electronics,"Fri, 16 May 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5taWxpdGFyeWFlcm9zcGFjZS5jb20vcmYtYW5hbG9nL2FydGljbGUvMTY3MTkzMjcvYXJteS1hc2tzLWFpcmJ1cy10by1idWlsZC1hbm90aGVyLTEwLXVoLTcyLWxha290YS11dGlsaXR5LWhlbGljb3B0ZXJzLWluLTU1NC1taWxsaW9uLWNvbnRyYWN00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"REDSTONE ARSENAL, Ala., 16 May 2014. Airbus Helicopters in Herndon, Va. (formerly EADS North America), will build 10 UH-72 Lakota utility helicopters for the U.S. Army under terms of a $55.4 million contract awarded Thursday.

The contract from the Army Contracting Command at Redstone Arsenal, Ala., calls for Airbus Helicopters to provide the 10 UH-72A helicopters with Raytheon AN/ARC-231 Airborne Communication System radios. The Army ordered four Lakota helicopters last February in a $22.9 million contract.

The UH-72A Lakota, built in Columbus, Miss., has been designed for the U.S. Army, National Guard, and Navy for missions ranging from disaster response and border patrol to pilot training.

The UH-72 Lakota is a twin-engine helicopter with a four-bladed main rotor, and is a militarized version of the EC145 rotorcraft. The helicopter was selected as the winner of the Army's Light Utility Helicopter (LUH) program in 2006, to replace aging UH-1H/V and OH-58A/C helicopters in the Army and Army National Guard fleets.

Seating capacity of the Lakota is for two pilots and six passengers. Two stretchers can be installed for MEDEVAC missions with a crew of four: pilot, co-pilot and two medics.

The Raytheon AN/ARC-231 Skyfire multimode airborne communications system is an avionics VHF and UHF line-of-sight avionics radio and satellite communications (SATCOM) system for the UH-72 Lakota helicopter, as well as for MH-60L/M and UH-60L/M Black Hawk helicopters, AH-64 Apache helicopter gunships, the Rivet Joint surveillance aircraft, and the Joint Surveillance and Target Attack Radar System (Joint-STARS) aircraft.

The ARC-231 avionics radio operates from 30 to 512 MHz, has frequency-agile modes for electronic counter-countermeasures (ECCM), demand assigned multiple access (DAMA), integrated waveform (IW), and air traffic control (ATC) channel spacing selectable in 5, 8.33, 12.5, and 25 kHz steps.

The aircraft radio has embedded encryption, as well as SINCGARS and HAVE QUICK I and II frequency agile modes. UHF SATCOM and DAMA protocols provide beyond-line-of-sight SATCOM, with IP networking. The ARC-231 is a software definable radio with upgrades available via PC-based software downloads.

Lakota helicopters have night vision goggle-compatible glass cockpits. Its vehicle and engine management display (VEMD) increases situational awareness and reduces pilot workload.

The Lakota helicopter is 33.4 feet long, 11.3 feet high, and 5.7 feet wide, with a 36.1-foot main rotor. It can lift nearly 4,000 pounds, fly as fast as 145 knots at altitudes to 11,300 feet above sea level. The rotorcraft can hover safely at 9,000 feet.

On this contract Airbus Helicopters will do the work in Columbia, Miss., and should be finished by June 2015. For more information contact Airbus Helicopters online at www.airbushelicopters.com, or the Army Contracting Command at Redstone Arsenal at www.acc.army.mil/contractingcenters/acc-rsa."
Can Airbus add seats to the A320 without irritating passengers? - - Runway Girl Network,"Sat, 17 May 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTQvMDUvY2FuLWFpcmJ1cy1hZGQtc2VhdHMtdG8tdGhlLWEzMjAtd2l0aG91dC1pcnJpdGF0aW5nLXBhc3NlbmdlcnMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"With talk spreading in the industry that Airbus is looking to add six to nine more seats to the A320, we asked ourselves whether such a configuration would be technically possible, why the airframer might want to do it, and whether up to nine seats could be added to the A320 without negatively impacting the passenger experience and inducing inflight rage.

While Airbus has confirmed its interest in re-certifying the A320 to add seating capacity, it hasn’t publicly detailed its specific plan. Therefore, we sought insight from multiple industry sources that have deep knowledge of seating design, certification and installation.

There is a consensus that a 189-seat A320 is indeed possible to achieve. Experts explained that Airbus might be committed to such an effort in order to get the passenger numbers on the A320 closer to the passenger capacity of the Boeing 737-800, which can seat up to 189 passengers in single-class configuration. The reasons are entirely competitive, they suggest. Low-cost carrier Vueling reportedly placed its large order for A320s and A320neos with a caveat that the aircraft carry 186 seats. The A320 is currently certified for a maximum seating capacity of 180 seats.

The success of Airbus’ recertification project could hinge on adding seats without having to redesign the cabin cross-section, and/or increase the total number of exits available. From a simple mathematical standpoint, to get the total seats on an A320 close to a 737-800, Airbus would have to add one full row of seats (two seat triples). Just doing this would increase the total passenger count of an A320 to 186, which would, in turn, make an A320 just three seats short of the 737-800’s 189-seat capacity. From here, to get an A320 to 189 seats would only require one additional seat triple.

Conceivably, that final additional seat triple could be added through more efficient use of overall cabin space. As a source indicates: “Along with re-pitch of existing seats [closer together] and the addition of new seats, you can remove and replace existing components with smaller components that perform [the] same function; they just do not take up as much space.” Other elements of the cabin, such as an optimized galley or toilet facility could be introduced – both of these concepts were again showcased as options from designers and manufacturers at this year’s Aircraft Interiors Expo in Hamburg.

A 189-seat A320 would require a 28-inch seat pitch, suggest some insiders, and this is one of the first objections taller passengers are likely to have to such a proposal. However, as Acro Aircraft Seating commercial director Cameron Allan points out, there are seats on the market specifically designed to provide a 28-inch pitch without sacrificing legroom.

“It’s no problem for our seats or indeed any seat which is certified for 28-inch pitch – equating to a 189-passenger layout on a 737-800 for example,” says Allan. However, he does indicate that the principle issue that Airbus and airlines would have to consider is the “impact to passenger satisfaction in such a configuration”.

The prime design objective of a seat, like those Acro produces, is to build the structure so that elements that might get in the way of passengers’ knees and shins, are designed-out. By changing the location and structure of seat-pockets, the built-in recline of the seat, the positioning and design of the tray table, and other key elements of the structure, seats designed for a 28-inch pitch can reduce the negative impact of a tighter seat configuration to the overall passenger experience.

Acro is not alone. Several manufacturers have recently introduced seating options that might accommodate Airbus’ plan. Recaro Aircraft Seating’s BL3520 offers a pitch range from 28 inches to 34 inches. Recaro’s SL3510 offers more cushioning at the seat bottom, and is also designed ergonomically to generate “more living space” for passengers. As Rene Dankwerth, VP of R&D at Recaro Aircraft Seating, tells us: “Both of the seats – the SL3510 and the BL3520 – support such a configuration at a 28-inch pitch and provide great comfort for the passengers at the same time.”

A recent entry into the aircraft seating market – which surprised the industry with a 4kg Titanium-composite seat – Expliseat offers another viable option. The weight advantage might prove attractive to airlines, and the cushioning and optimization of legroom and seat width might satisfy passenger need. This seat has been selected for a 220-passenger configuration on board the A321 fleet of Air Méditerranée.

Speaking to us for this report, Jean-Charles Samuelain, commercial director of Expliseat confirmed: “Our seat is certified at a 28-inch pitch and allows more space and comfort for passengers with 2 inches more legroom.”

In addition to showcasing new seats pitched at 28 inches at the Aircraft Interiors Expo, Zodiac Aerospace revealed seat concepts pitched at an even tighter 27 inches. The manufacturer believes these seats will pass certification. But the consensus among our sources seems to be that Airbus might not need to veer too far into the stuff of possible panic for passengers, in order to add capacity on the A320.

Other certification considerations, however, might prove more challenging. As a source explains: “Seat assemblies must be far enough apart to actually sit in, and yet narrow enough in order to not only meet the various airframe stay-out zone requirements, but the regulatory authority clearance and measurement requirements as well. From a regulatory authority standpoint, with the addition of passengers comes the re-certification of an aircraft, with or without having to modify or add exit doors/hatches. As a result, once an emergency escape test is conducted to see how long it takes [for] 186 or 189 passengers to get off an A320, with its current exit door and window quantity and designs, then the answer to this question will be available.”

So, when might we start seeing higher-capacity A320s in the sky? Runway Girl Network can reveal that an effort to add seats is already underway in the retrofit market. As Allan revealed to us: “Acro [is] likely to implement such a layout on an A320 program next year, should the type certification be revised by Airbus to allow it.” Acro is also moving closer to line-fit offerability with the airframer.

"Airbus selects Fujitsu RFID integrated label technology for management, traceability of aircraft parts - Military & Aerospace Electronics","Mon, 19 May 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5taWxpdGFyeWFlcm9zcGFjZS5jb20vY29tbWVyY2lhbC1hZXJvc3BhY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS8xNDIyNzcwOS9haXJidXMtc2VsZWN0cy1mdWppdHN1LXJmaWQtaW50ZWdyYXRlZC1sYWJlbC10ZWNobm9sb2d5LWZvci1tYW5hZ2VtZW50LXRyYWNlYWJpbGl0eS1vZi1haXJjcmFmdC1wYXJ0c9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Traceability is required for every process that the component is involved in over its several-decade life cycle, from design and manufacturing to servicing and disposal. Making this an even more complex challenge is the fact that the aircraft industry encompasses parts suppliers, airframe manufacturers, airlines, and maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO), so the tracking process needs to cover multiple companies and even multiple countries, often resulting in excess parts in inventory. Ensuring that each of the numerous components is replaced with the correct article during maintenance is also a time-consuming task for technicians. While there is an urgent need in the airline industry to reduce costs in order to compete with other forms of transportation, there is also a need to ensure that component-tracking and maintenance is performed safely and securely.

To enhance transparency and visibility in its parts supply chain, in 2009, Airbus began using RFID labels on components for its state-of-the-art mid-sized A350 XWB, and expanded their use to all Airbus planes in October 2012. In January 2013, the company decided to move forward on its ""Airbus RFID Integrated Label"" project, which aims to replace the nameplates that had been used to display component information with highly traceable RFID labels.

In this project, Airbus will be attaching Fujitsu RFID tags to major aircraft components across all Airbus planes. This will make it possible for Airbus and its parts suppliers to confirm manufacturing and maintenance information for each respective aircraft component. Furthermore, making it possible to check storage information on individual parts and inventories at any time enables a top-level component resupply process that shortens delivery lead times, avoids redundant procurement, and optimizes inventory levels, officials say.

Fujitsu RFID Integrated Labels meet the SAE AS5678 standard, applied to aircraft components for quality, and conform to ATA Spec 2000 standard ver. 2013, the data format standard of the aircraft industry.

The labels are available in two types:

1-KB and 8-KB memory, and in three sizes (large/medium/small). Usable with metal and non-metal items, they can be applied to components produced by hundreds of parts vendors around the world. Read range is approximately 1.5 meter, and the labels support the frequency ranges used in the US and Europe.

Fujitsu has also been working to enhance its solution offerings, such as with RFID readers, encoding and printing solutions, and system integration for customers' existing ERPs. This should lead to greater visibility of component-related operations for the entire aviation industry, including parts suppliers, aircraft manufacturers, airlines, and MROs.

Fujitsu is ready to receive orders for labels and all related products, which will be commercially available in the market from 1 June 2014.

SAE AS5678 standard

Issued by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) in December 2006, SAE AS5678 is a standard defining environmental specifications and test methods for passive RFID labels used in aviation applications. SAE has categorized and defined environmental specifications for using RFID labels in the three environmental categories of ""Standard,"" ""Robust,"" and ""Harsh.""

ATA Spec 2000 standard ver 2013

A standards document promulgated by the Airlines for America that defines information exchange and processing sequences for information regarding aircraft part materials and reliability. Chapter 9 defines requirements for barcodes, 2D codes, and RFID tags affixed to parts."

Airbus Defense and Space has initiated space qualification testing of its Astrix 1090 high-precision Fiber-Optic Inertial Reference Unit in February and will conclude with the Qualification Review milestone in early July 2014.

“The Astrix family of FOGs have well-established flight heritage and a reputation for high performance,” said Jean-Pierre Domenget, head of the Space Platform Electronics business cluster in Airbus Defense and Space. “By leveraging this existing product family technology, the Astrix 1090 is a low risk option that provides the best price-performance ratio on the market. It is ready for delivery only 12 months after order, ideal for short satellite build schedules. Needless to say, the Astrix 1090 has generated immense customer interest.”

The Astrix 1090 joins its siblings, the Astrix 120 and Astrix 200, to supply very high accuracy rotation rate data with extremely low noise, crucial for space systems stabilization, pointing and attitude control.

With its high reliability and powered-on lifetime to exceed 15 years, the 3 axis Astrix 1090 is specifically designed and certified for long-duration missions. It may be used on small to large satellites due to its small volume and only 12 watt power consumption.

Multiple performance levels are available with the Astrix 1000 series, which together with an accelerometer option provides the flexibility to support a range of satellite missions from telecom to interplanetary.

Posted: 18 May 2014 | Peter Esteie, Sebastien Lavina |

With the deployment of the A380 in more and more airports, ground handling logistics are paramount. Peter Esteie and Sebastien Lavina, from Airbus Airport Operations, provide an update of new developments

Much attention has been paid to involve all airport stakeholders early in the development of the A380 to make sure airports all over the world can handle the aircraft1. This article will explain what has happened with the A380 airport network since 2012, touch on new developments in ground handling and focus on the A380 Airport Assessment process.

The airport network

Since 2012, the Airbus fleet has grown by 55 to 128 aircraft, and three new operators (Malaysia Airlines, Thai Airways and British Airways) have started services. As a result, accumulated flying hours and flights have more than doubled to 1.3 million and 160,000 respectively. A380s now span the globe, with more than 170 flights operated per day, and over two million passengers enjoying the experience every month.

From an airport’s perspective, a look at where the more recent deliveries have been deployed provides an indication of the concentrated nature of large aircraft operations in general. In April 2012 the A380 served 25 airports and three more were expecting services imminently. Today, the number has risen to 36 destinations. The eight new destinations / home-bases of Atlanta, Barcelona, Kuala Lumpur, London (Gatwick), Moscow (Domodedovo), Mauritius, Osaka (Kansai), Rome (Fiumicino) however only represent 15 per cent of the increase in weekly departures. The other 85 per cent have come from increases in frequencies to those airports that were already served.

Apart from Dubai (+178 weekly departures), some very significant increases have been seen at destinations like Shanghai Pudong (+18 weekly departures) and Los Angeles (+39 weekly departures). This concentration is set to continue as new operators will, in large part, continue to serve capacity constrained airports that are already part of the A380 network. We will see four new operators (Asiana Airlines, Qatar Airways, Skymark Airlines and Etihad Airways) deploy their aircraft in 2014, considerably increasing the operational footprint of the aircraft. All of the initial routes announced by these airlines are to existing destinations.

The reason behind this very high level of concentration is simple; these airports are not just hubs but essential gateways of massive centres of commerce, industry and population that literally billions of people want to fly between. Today, traffic between just 42 so-called aviation ‘mega-cities’ represents over 50 per cent of all long-haul traffic (see Figures 1a and 1b). These are iconic centres like London, Paris, New York, Dubai, and Singapore. It is not surprising that the A380 is already deployed between 70 per cent of them, with the remainder – including Abu Dhabi, Delhi, Doha, Mumbai, and São Paulo – to be served within a year.

The upshot of this deployment profile is that there will be an increasing demand for A380 stand positions at existing A380 destination airports. The use of Multi Aircraft Ramp Systems (MARS) is a particularly effective solution to achieve the desired flexibility in accommodating multiple aircraft types. The pay-back is significant with the A380 offering stand productivity (number of passengers processed per turnaround) that is up to 60 per cent higher than existing large wide-body aircraft. This is due to the efforts taken in the design of the cabin as well as the ground-servicing concept that targeted a turnaround time of 90 minutes, similar to other large wide-body aircraft, despite the A380 having up to 70 per cent more capacity. The fact that around 30 per cent of all A380 out-station turnaroun

ds are between 80 and 110 minutes is testament to the fact that the initial design target has been met.

Looking to the future, the demand for very large aircraft is set to continue. This is reflected in the increasing order backlog for the A380, which now stands at 196 aircraft. In the last six months alone 70 orders were placed for the A380, 50 additional aircraft for Emirates, and a new order for 20 aircraft

by the leasing company Amedeo. This demand is driven predominantly by increasing urbanisation and the rapid growth of emerging markets, which will see the number of aviation mega-cities grow to 89 by 2032. Air traffic as a whole will more than double in the same time period. As these cities exert more dominance on the long-haul market, the concentration of long-haul traffic between them will correspondingly increase to 75 per cent. It is these lucrative routes, with their already dense traffic and congested airports that are and will continue to be the primary home for the A380.

Ground handling

The use of standard ground support equipment (GSE) and servicing procedures was taken into account very early in the design of the A380. Today, there is a large choice of A380 compatible GSE and this list is still growing. In 2013 we added the GHH AM 500XL to the list of A380 qualified Towbar Less Towing Vehicle (TLTV). There are now six A380 qualified TLTVs from five different manufacturers (Douglas-Kalmar, GHH, JBT, Goldhofer and TLD).

Another GSE development, not restricted to A380, but with great potential for this aircraft, are ground-based Air Conditioning Units delivering pre-conditioned air at temperatures lower than +1°C. The IATA Aircraft Handling Manual (AHM) 974 ‘Functional Specification for Aircraft Air Conditioning Units (ACU)’ defines a temperature range of +1°C (34°F) to +5°C (40°F). In reality however, many ACUs are delivering air to the aircraft at 6 to 8°C (43 to 48°F). The performance of ACUs is therefore not comparable with what can be reached with the aircraft Auxiliary Power Unit (APU). However, for environmental reasons, APU usage is restricted in many airports and we can only expect this to be a growing tendency. Therefore, to maintain the high level of cabin comfort that passengers expect, solutions had to be found to increase the performance of ACUs.

First of all, the AHM 974 minimum temperature limit applies to the air temperature at the aircraft connector and not at the exit of the ACU itself. ACU output temperature should be set such to reach an air temperature at the aircraft inlet as close as possible to +1°C (34°F).

More importantly, a new AHM 997; ‘Functional Specification for Sub-Freezing Aircraft Air Conditioning Unit’ was introduced in 2012. Sub-freezing ACUs are units which can deliver air at temperatures below +1°C at the aircraft interface. The use of sub-freezing equipment is subject to specific conditions (air humidity, pressure, etc.) which are explained in the relevant Aircraft Maintenance Manual.

As an example, when using sub-freezing ACU on A380, the minimum air temperature at the aircraft connector can be as low as -10°C (14°F), allowing for a very quick cabin pull down and a high cabin comfort level even in hot conditions.

Another GSE development is Taxibot. Taxibot equipment can be used for operational towing (moving the aircraft to the runway with engines off), allowing the airport to reduce emissions. The wide-body (A380, A330/A340) compatible Taxibot is expected to be certified late-2015.

Airport compatibility

Well before the launch of the A380, Airbus recognised that besides the requirement to use existing ground handling equipment, the A380 also needed to fit into today’s airport infrastructure with minimal changes.

Of the 36 A380 destinations served today, only a few are fully compliant with the design recommendations of the ICAO Annex 14 Code F, which applies to new airport infrastructure. Most have accommodated the aircraft using an operational approach combined with the modification of existing infrastructure. The challenge aerodromes face today is that the guidance for accommodating large aircraft using an operational-based approach are not consolidated.

The PANS (Procedures for Air Navigation Services) Aerodromes manual is intended to fill the operational gap and address many of these procedural challenges for aerodrome operational management. Airbus is involved in the ICAO Aerodromes Panel and subsequent working and study groups, which are aiming to publish the first edition of the PANS Aerodromes Manual by November 2015.

Pending the availability of the PANS Aerodrome Manual, Airbus can ensure the required information is available and made accessible to Airport Authorities, local Civil Aviation Authorities and airlines to ensure airports are ready in due time for A380 commercial operations. Throughout the years, Airbus has gained valuable expertise in assessing airport infrastructure in relation to the A380. While Airbus is committed to assist all stakeholders, it has to be highlighted that the definition and approval of airport adaptations remains, at all times, the sole responsibility of the airport and the local Civil Aviation Authority.

The Airport Operations team within Airbus can detail the generic infrastructure requirements for A380 operations (be it for destination or alternate airports) and examine the current or future situation at airports, in close collaboration with Airport and Civil Aviation Authorities. The objective is to study, explain and suggest potential adaptations recommended to handle the A380.

Typically, the airport assessment and recommended airport adaptations focus on a few major areas, including:

Regulatory compliance checks: Runway/Taxiway/Taxilanes dimensions and separations, obstacles limitations (OFZ), holding points, etc.

ILS interference studies to assess the impact of any objects (aircraft buildings, cranes) using E.L.I.S.E. 2 , an advanced 3D ILS simulation tool, allowing to improve safety while maintaining/increasing airport capacity

, an advanced 3D ILS simulation tool, allowing to improve safety while maintaining/increasing airport capacity Manoeuvrability: aircraft accessibility to gate or remote position

Engine topics: ground clearance checks, jet blast, etc.

Apron: compatibility check of available contact and remote stands

Pavement loading capability: putting actual airport pavement characteristics in relation with aircraft requirements (depending on actual routes to be flown)

Ground operations and airport safety: availability and suitability of available equipment available (see above), aircraft rescue and fire-fighting category.

Airbus’ longstanding experience in facilitating cooperation between all airport stakeholders, airport authorities, local CAAs, service providers and airlines, ensures airports have been and will be ready on time for A380 commercial operations. The Airbus Airport Operations team will share this expertise with any airport planning to accommodate A380 operations in the near future.

China Southern Airlines Co Ltd on Friday said it has ordered 80 aircraft from Airbus Group NV worth at least $7.3 billion.

China Southern said it will receive 30 A320 and 50 A320neo airplanes from 2016 to 2020, increasing capacity by over 12 percent. The airline will pay for the order using its own funds and bank loans.

China Southern will also sell 6 Embraer SA E145 jets and components to Airbus before year-end, reducing capacity by 0.02 percent, the Guangzhou-based carrier said in a statement on its website.

The China Southern order provides a boost for Airbus in its market-share battle against Boeing Co's rival 737 MAX jetliner.

Both the A320neo and 737 MAX have new engines that improve fuel efficiency. Airbus launched the A320neo program before Boeing launched the 737 MAX, and Airbus has garnered nearly 60 percent of firm orders so far. However, Boeing said the 737 MAX has won a majority of orders since the MAX was launched in July 2011.

Chinese carriers have recently been increasing capacity to add flights and routes in China and beyond.

Earlier this week, 9 Air, a newly founded budget subsidiary of privately owned Juneyao Airlines, ordered 50 Boeing 737 jets."

Russia's VSMPO Says Airbus to Face Fines If Quits $4Bln Titanium Contract - The Moscow Times,"Mon, 26 May 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW1vc2Nvd3RpbWVzLmNvbS8yMDE0LzA1LzI2L3J1c3NpYXMtdnNtcG8tc2F5cy1haXJidXMtdG8tZmFjZS1maW5lcy1pZi1xdWl0cy00YmxuLXRpdGFuaXVtLWNvbnRyYWN0LWEzNTgyMdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"VSMPO-Avisma, the world's largest titanium producer, has warned Airbus it would be forced to pay penalties if the European aircraft manufacturer terminated a $4 billion contract with its Russian supplier.

VSMPO is 25 percent owned by state defense conglomerate Rostec, whose CEO Sergei Chemezov was made the subject of Western sanctions in late April for Russia's role in the Ukraine crisis.

""Contracts remain valid and cannot be canceled for no reason. Otherwise, penalties come into force,"" VSMPO CEO and co-owner Mikhail Voevodin said in an interview with Reuters published Friday.

""A contract until 2020 was signed with us. And it is difficult to assume that the largest European aircraft maker would neglect the terms of the existing partnership,"" Voevodin said.

He declined to comment on the size of the potential penalties.

Airbus chief operating officer Gunther Butschek said this month there were no short-term impacts from the crisis in Ukraine but that the firm was looking to safeguard supplies of titanium, which is used in its A350 jet.

The West has threatened to tighten sanctions should Russia dramatically ramp up aggression against Ukraine by recognizing the separatist referendums that took place in eastern Ukraine earlier this month.

VSMPO and Airbus/EADS struck the $4 billion deal five years ago under which the titanium giant would supply the planemaker with rolled titanium alloys until 2020.

""The advantage of a long-term contract is stable conditions. We always strictly fulfill the terms of the contract, so do our partners. … Politics is politics and business is business: all of our contracts are mutually beneficial,"" said Voevodin.

VSMPO meets 60 percent of titanium products demand at Airbus and 40 percent of demand at its U.S. rival Boeing.

Last year, VSMPO, which exports 70 percent of its output, raised production to 28,855 tons from 26,242 tons in 2012.

Voevodin said that should Airbus quit the contract, it would take the company two to three years to find new buyers for its titanium, which is also used in the energy, chemical engineering and medicine industries.

He also said that it is impossible to find an adequate replacement for VSMPO products in less than three to five years.

Besides VSMPO, U.S.' Timet, Alleghany Technologies, Japan's Toho Titanium, and China's Zunyi Titanium and Pangang and Jinchuan groups are large titanium suppliers.

Gazprombank analyst Maxim Khudalov said Airbus was unlikely to find alternative titanium suppliers anytime soon.

""Despite the increase of titanium production in China, domestic demand is also high there,"" he said."

ANALYSIS: The Airbus A330-300 aircraft report | Analysis | Flight Global - Flightglobal,"Fri, 30 May 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYW5hbHlzaXMtdGhlLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzMwLTMwMC1haXJjcmFmdC1yZXBvcnQvMTEzMzQwLmFydGljbGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Airbus A330-300 programme has now passed 20 years of operations and demand for the type continues to remain strong.

The first A330-300 was handed over to Air Inter in January 1994, which operated most of its fleet on French domestic routes.

Developed as a low-gross weight widebody for regional and medium-haul high density applications, the model has evolved over the years, technically and operationally.

The initial aircraft had a maximum take-off weight (MTOW) of 212t (467,500lb) to 217t, with a range profile between 3,900nm (7,215km) and 4,300nm. These represented roughly the first 75 deliveries between December 1993 and December 1998.

Incremental weight improvements have favoured the type and it has become a more popular choice on intra-regional and long-haul markets.

The A330 family was Airbus's first aircraft programme to be offered with the choice of three engines: the General Electric CF6-80E1s, the Pratt & Whitney PW4170-powered versions, and the Rolls-Royce Trent 772 series.



The Trent 700 series is the market leader, powering 309 units out of the 515-aircraft fleet. Pratt & Whitney equips 108 aircraft, while General Electric powers 98 units.

Market

At 26 May, there were 506 A330-300s in service with 59 operators, according to Flightglobal’s Ascend Online database, with another nine units in storage.

Ascend analyst Maximo Gainza says five stored A330-300s are lower gross weight variants and one aircraft is scheduled to transition to another operator.

Production rate is now at 10 aircraft per month, with most deliveries focused on the A330-300 high gross weight version.

Backlog totals 179 units with deliveries stretching through 2019.

A total of 27 aircraft have been delivered since the beginning of this year, all in high gross weight versions. The Trent-powered aircraft represented 17 units or 63% of the deliveries. The CF6-powered version totalled six deliveries while the remaining four units were Pratt & Whitney aircraft.

Another 48 aircraft are planned for delivery this year. Again Rolls-Royce represent a large majority with 77% of deliveries or 37 units. Pratt & Whitney accounts for four deliveries and General Electric has seven units.

Another 61 units are scheduled for delivery in 2015, followed by 39 aircraft in 2016. However, the delivery pattern then takes a dive with 17 units booked for delivery in 2017, 10 in 2018 and four in 2019.

Of the 179 aircraft on backlog, Africa and the Middle East account for 12 deliveries. There are not any A330-300 deliveries currently planned for the Latin America and Caribbean regions but 15 units are heading to North American customers, mainly Delta Air Lines and operating lessor CIT Aerospace.

The majority of future deliveries is concentrated in the Asia-Pacific region during the next five years. A total of 132 units will be delivered, according to Ascend.

Malaysia leads with 37 future deliveries ahead of China with 31 aircraft and Indonesia with 17 units.

Europe represents 20 future deliveries.

The largest lessor for the type is ILFC with a total of 30 units in service and on order.

AerCap has another 23 aircraft. Other lessors exposed to the A330-300 model are CDB Leasing with 17 units, Intrepid Aviation with 15 units and CIT Aerospace with 14 units.

Rolls-Royce represents 94 future deliveries or 52.5% of the market share through 2019. Pratt & Whitney’s and General Electric’s market share is estimated at 0.5% and 29.5%, respectively. An estimated 23 future aircraft deliveries are yet to have an engine selection.

The Trent-powered fleet totals 306 aircraft in service with 192 units equipped with the 513,676lb MTOW, Ascend shows. Cathay Pacific is the largest operator of the variant with 33 units followed by Singapore Airlines with 27 unit and Lufthansa with 19 units.

Another 41 units equipped with the 772B-60 engine variant with the 513,676lb version are on backlog with 36 aircraft heading to Asia Pacific.

“On the retirement front, one former Aer Lingus and nine ex-Malaysia Airlines A330-300 (lower gross versions) have been confirmed for part-out - 10 of the 75 such aircraft delivered. All were under 20 years old,” says Gainza.

Since its first entry into service in 1994, the A330-300 model has evolved through incremental weight options.

In 1999, the “higher gross weight” A330-300X was introduced, with a 230-233t MTOW. In 2004, Airbus introduced the enhanced version featuring an even higher MTOW of up to 238t in addition to minor aerodynamic improvements, a fly-by-wire rudder and upgraded avionics.

The 242t version, which will deliver next year to Delta Air Lines, will allow missions with a higher fuel capacity option increasing range to 6,100nm.

Last September Airbus launched a lower-weight variant aimed at the Chinese market. The manufacturer has marketed the aircraft, which will have a lower maximum take-off weight of 200t, a reduced range of 3,000nm, and derated engines, as a solution for China's shortage of pilots, congested airports and growth in air traffic.

The regional variant, which will enter into service by early 2015, aims at short-haul markets which do not need the maximum take-off weight capabilities or the standard thrust settings of the long-haul version.

During the next five to 10 years, Airbus expects to sell “not less than a few hundreds” of the variant. The manufacturer also said that besides China, the aircraft will be suited for use in India, the Middle East and Southeast Asia. It is also expecting the aircraft to bring an overall cost reduction of up to 15% because of the lower maintenance costs and increased number of seats.

Gainza argues that the regional A330-300 remain structurally heavy compared to some of its predecessors (the A300 and even the lower gross variant A330-300) and will still fall short of the A340’s range at the upper end.

The market is generally looking reasonable for the A330-300 as the type enjoys a wide operator base and most A330 production now seems to centre on this larger of the two variants, according to IBA’s senior analyst Jonathan Mcdonald.

Collateral Verifications’ vice president of commercial aviation services, Gueric Dechavanne, says part of the A330-300’s success is from not having much competing in-production aircraft at the current time. “The delays on the 787 and the fact that the A350 will not be delivered until 2014 have also helped the maintain demand for the type as many operators acquired the A330 to either compliment such orders or to be used as interim lift.”

Angus Mackay of ICF SH&E says operational capability improvements on the aircraft over time have eclipsed its natural competitor, the Boeing 777-200, and meets most of the mission profiles of the more capable 777-200ER. “The A330-300 is also considered a good replacement candidate for the four-engined A340-300 in the current elevated fuel price environment, and has gained incremental benefit from the current A330 ETOPS limit of 240 minutes giving access to many new routes,” he adds.

The Asian market has driven sales for the A330-300 model during the past few years.Operational flexibility of the A330-300 is evidenced by its utilisation in the region.

Gainza says the A330-300 is ideal for high capacity intra-Asian routes, one of the strongest growth markets.

“A prime example of operational flexibility is in Asia where the A330-300 is predominately deployed,” says Mackay. “Several carriers use the aircraft both as a high capacity short haul aircraft given high passenger volumes but limited emerging market infrastructure as well as for longer Australasian and Transpacific routes with thinner traffic.”

Cargo Conversion

Airbus believes that freight-converted A330s will play an important role in the medium-capacity freighter market over the next 20 years. In its freighter aircraft forecast, Airbus projects that there will be demand for 1,237 midsize freighters with payloads of between 30 and 80t capacity over the next 20 years. It adds that 824 are expected to be converted from passenger aircraft while another 413 will be new build.

The manufacturer launched the ‘P2F’ conversion programme at the 2012 Singapore air show in conjunction with EADS EFW and ST Aerospace, which will offer conversions on both the A330-200 and the -300 variants.

Airbus's vice-president freighters Andreas Hermann said that the time that the project was on track to roll out in 2016 or 2017.

Hermann says that the P2F programme will appeal more to low-utilisation operators who will benefit from the smaller capital costs, while new-build A330-200Fs will be more suited to express operators who have higher utilisation.

He adds that the larger capacity of the A330-300P2F would also appeal to the express freight market, which is expected to grow strongly in the Asia Pacific region over the next 20 years.

No conversion orders have been placed but the A330-P2F programme should be a sensible replacement for A300-600Fs.

A P2F conversion will be in the region of $16 million, sources indicate, and feedstock will have to be priced in the $7 million to $15 million range, depending on the vintage and the engine status.

One source tells Flightglobal that the Garuda Indonesia and Philippine Airlines early models are considered as candidates. According to the source, bids for the Garuda 1996/97-vintage fleet are between $7 million and $12 million. The 1997/98-vintage Philippine Airlines aircraft are expected in the $10-14 million range, says the source.

A330neo?

Airbus is likely to make a decision on whether to move forward with a re-engined A330, dubbed the A330neo, by the middle of 2014, according to Airbus Americas president Barry Eccleston.

A decision on the aircraft is needed in order to ensure that it is competitive with the Boeing 787 but does not erode sales of the European airframer’s own A350 when it enters service, Eccleston said at the Phoenix International Aviation symposium earlier this year.

According to Airbus’s executive vice president of programmes Tom Williams, a re-engined A330 will require the wing to be reinforced. Also, Airbus will need to design a new nacelle and pylon, resulting in another set of flight tests.

If launched the A330neo entry-into-service window could be in the 2017 or 2018 timeframe when there is limited availability of A350s and 787s, based on comments from various lessors and lenders at the ISTAT Americas conference in March.

“There are airlines that are receptive to an A330neo that aren’t going to order the [A350]-800,” said Steven Udvar-Hazy, chief executive of Air Lease, at ISTAT. “Some of them have been converted to the [A350]-900, but the [A330]neo is getting more attention and we will have to see what happens.”

While not naming any carriers, he says: “There is one large US airline that’s, I think, very interested in the re-engined A330. They have a large number of ageing [Boeing] 767s and 747-400s that they need to do something [about] in the next five years.”

Delta Air Lines released a request for proposals for up 50 widebody aircraft to replace its 747-400s and a significant number of its 767-300ERs earlier in April. It is evaluating the A330-200 and -300, A350-900 and -1000, Boeing 777-300ER and 787-8, -9 and -10 with an order possible in the second half of this year.

The Atlanta-based carrier says that it is only considering aircraft currently available in the market under the RFP but does not specifically rule out a possible A330neo.

Asian carriers, especially in China, and major European carriers could also be A330neo customers, said Steve Mason, vice-president of aircraft analysis at CIT Aerospace, at ISTAT. They are expected to need additional 250- to 300-seat aircraft between 2018 and 2021 than are currently available, he said.

DVB Bank’s managing director, aviation research Bert van Leeuwenrecently talked about the potential demise of the A350-800 in the Airbus widebody programme.

“Neither an all-new twin aisle, nor an A322 are realistic options. In the short-term, the much discussed A330neo seems the only affordable quick fix, and it actually may do surprisingly well,” he says.

Van Leeuwen also thinks that the market seems a limited for more than one engine supplier. “While a version of the Rolls Royce Trent seems the obvious choice, General Electric seems to be re-focusing on the A330,” he says.

Lease rates and values

Financing appetite for the A330-300 remains solid with commercial bank funding the preferred financing tool. The sale and leaseback activity is also buoyant with Philippine Airlines recently agreeing a deal with AWAS, Garuda with Avolon Aerospace, Novus Aviation Capital with Malaysia Airlines and Air China selling new deliveries to Chinese lessors.

A sale and leaseback transaction is currently being negotiated at a 0.9% lease rate factor, says a source, with the new aircraft being offered for sale at more than $120 million.

Irish flag-carrier Aer Lingus is in the market for the sale and leaseback of one 2009-vintage General Electric CF6-powered Airbus A330-300 with four years lease terms.

Despite a low inventory, the A330-300 market remains a leasing market.

One leasing source tells Flightglobal that renewals have been agreed in the $600,000 a month lease rate range.

Appraisers examined a Rolls-Royce Trent 772B-60 powered aircraft and MTOW of 233t in most cases. However for the 1994-vintage model, a lower MTOW was assumed.

Ascend says low gross weight A330-300s are leasing in the $265,000 range for a 20-year model and $300,000 a month for a 1998-vintage. Ascend sees a $440,000 lease rate for a 2002-vintage, $525,000 for a 2006-built unit and $645,000 for a four-year-old aircraft and around $925,000 for a new delivery.

MBA expects a $285,000 a month lease rate for a 1994-vintage, $330,000 for a 1998-built, $530,000 for a 2002-vintage, $620,000 for a 2006-built unit, $725,000 for a four-yea- old aircraft and around $850,000 for a new delivery.

IBA has a $225-265,000 a month range for a 20-year old model. Monthly rentals for a 1998-vintage is between $300,000 and $350,000 says IBA. For a 2002-built aircraft, IBA has a $415-475,000 a month range. A 2006-built has a $555-605,000 a month range, $680-760,000 for a four-year-old aircraft and between $810,000 and $850,000 for a new delivery.

ICF SH&E has a new delivery lease rate between $775,000 and $900,000, a four-year-old aircraft between $650,000 and $775,000 a month. For a 2006-built aircraft ICF SH&E has $520-610,000 a month lease rate. A 2002-vintage has a $395,000 to $475,000 monthly lease rental, says ICF SH&E, while a 1998-vintage aircraft leases between $285,000 and $365,000. IBA has a $205-285,000 a month range for a 20-year old model.

Collateral Verifications says a 1994-built aircraft has a $275,000 lease rate. It expects a $350,000 a month lease rate for a 1998-vintage, $455,000 for a 2002-vintage, $590,000 for a 2006-built, $730,000 for a four-year-old aircraft and around $920,000 for a new delivery.

Current market value (CMV) of a 20-year old model is $15.9 million for Ascend, $17.3 million for IBA, $18.5 million for Collateral Verifications, $20.9 million for ICF SH&E and $21.3 million for MBA.

For a 1998-vintage model Ascend also has a $15.9 million CMV for a low gross weight version but $36.8 million for a high gross weight variant.

“Market values of the original A330-300 model, representing lower weight models and build-years 1992-98, last declined at the start of the first quarter by 19-21%,” says Gainza. According to him, market values of the high gross weight variant also last declined at the beginning of 2014, by around 8%, but have remained stable since.

IBA and MBA have values of $27.4 million and $27.6 million, respectively. ICF SH&E has $31.7 million while Collateral Verifications has a $31.2 million CMV.

IBA is the lowest appraiser on a 2002-vintage model. The firm values the aircraft at $42.7 million, while Ascend says $44 million, Collateral Verifications has $45 million and ICF SH&E says $45.1 million. MBA is the highest appraiser with $49.3 million.

An eight-year-old model valuation show more discrepancy. MBA has a $63.7 million and Ascend has $55.6 million. Collateral Verifications has $56.5 million, IBA has $59.5 million while ICF SH&E’s valuation is $61.3 million.

A 2010-vintage model is valued at $70.9 million by Collateral Verifications and $72.8 million by Ascend. IBA has $79.8 million and ICF SH&E has $80.9 million. MBA is the highest with $82.3 million valuation.

A new delivery is estimated at $103.6 million by Ascend and IBA. ICF SH&E is slightly higher with a $104.4 million valuation. Collateral Verifications and MBA are on the higher side with $106.5 million and $107.2 million, respectively.

Dechavanne says Airbus has been aggressive with certain campaigns offering the aircraft for sub-$100 million. “This could affect used aircraft values and lease rates if pricing on sale and leasebacks is reduced due to this more attractive pricing. “We are still seeing sale and leasebacks done well above $100 million as well, which tells us that there is still good appetite for the aircraft from lessors and investors,” he says.

Wall Township-based Zodiac Aero Evacuation Systems and Airbus Celebrate 40 Years of Working Together

On May 6, 2014

Wall Township-based Air Cruisers Company, LLC, d/b/a Zodiac Aero Evacuation Systems, the only company in the world to offer a comprehensive range of inflatable safety products, and Airbus Americas yesterday celebrated more than 40 years of working together to support air transport customers around the world.

On April 3, 1973, Air Cruisers received technical approval for their evacuation slides for Airbus’ first product, the A300. Nearly a year later that product, as well as slide/rafts, life rafts and life vests, entered service with the first delivery of the A300 aircraft to Air France in May 1974. Forty years later, Zodiac Aero Evacuation Systems products can be found on all of Airbus’ single-aisle products and the newest, the A350 XWB.

Daniel Wenninger, Sr. Director-A350 XWB U.S. Program joined several local dignitaries including New Jersey Business and Industry Association members Frank Robinson and George Saliba, and Wall Township Mayor Clint Hoffman and Wall Township Administrator Jeffrey Bertrand at a ceremony yesterday to celebrate the partnership with Zodiac Aero Evacuation Systems employees and leadership.

Wenninger told the employees at the event, “My primary reason for being here today is to say thank you for your support over many years. For 40 years, you have been a strong partner with Airbus and our customers.

"This silent, zero-emissions electric plane could be the future of sustainable air travel - Salon","Tue, 27 May 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhbG9uLmNvbS8yMDE0LzA1LzI3L3RoaXNfc2lsZW50X3plcm9fZW1pc3Npb25zX2VsZWN0cmljX3BsYW5lX2NvdWxkX2JlX3RoZV9mdXR1cmVfb2Zfc3VzdGFpbmFibGVfYWlyX3RyYXZlbC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"One of the first public demonstrations of energy efficient air travel took to the air last week at the Berlin Air Show, in the form of a fully electric airplane.

The E-Fan, engineered by Airbus Group, is propelled by two 30-kilowatt electric motors, themselves powered by a series of lithium-ion batteries fitted into the plane's wings (a 6 kW electric motor in the main wheel gives it some extra thrust on the ground). ""It's a very different way of flying,"" said Jean Botti, chief technical and innovation officer at Airbus Group, told ClimateWire, ""absolutely no noise, no emissions.""

While commercial, emissions-free air travel is still a very long ways off, the successful launch of this tiny two-seater marks a major first step toward that very goal, ClimateWire reports:

Airbus Group's ultimate goal is to make a 70- to 80-person hybrid-electric commuter jet with three hours of range in the 2050 time frame. Initial designs of the E-Thrust aircraft show the plane with six electric-powered fans that will be powered by a gas-fueled energy storage unit during the ascent and cruise phase and then glide using electric power alone while descending. In the next step toward achieving this, Airbus will make a next-generation two-seater electric plane, set for launch in 2017, and a four-seater electric plane with a gas-powered range extender, set for launch in 2019. These advances are steppingstones toward realizing Flight Path 2050, the European Union's aggressive goal to reduce the aviation sector's nitrous oxide emissions by 90 percent, noise pollution by 65 percent and carbon dioxide emissions by 75 percent by 2050.

Right now, the E-Fan can only remain in the air for an hour, which means that range anxiety -- which accompanies electric vehicles of all sorts -- is bound to be a concern: The fear of getting stuck on the side of the road is one thing, while the terror of being in an aircraft when its batteries die is quite another. To that effect, the E-Fan is equipped with a backup battery and a parachute.

ILA: Premium Aerotec gears up to meet the demands of parent Airbus - Flightglobal,"Mon, 19 May 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vaWxhLXByZW1pdW0tYWVyb3RlYy1nZWFycy11cC10by1tZWV0LXRoZS1kZW1hbmRzLW9mLXBhcmVudC1haXJidXMvMTEzMTI0LmFydGljbGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It was a very European compromise. Back in 2007, reeling from a feeble dollar, the A380 debacle and the need to fund development of the A350, bosses of the then-EADS launched a drive to cut costs and streamline the Franco-German group’s cumbersome vertically-integrated organisation. Part of the solution involved divesting aerostructures plants in France, Germany and the UK to chosen suppliers. The idea was that these enterprising and leaner tier ones would introduce efficiencies, while guaranteeing a continuity of supply.

However, while GKN snapped up a facility in Filton, political opposition and wobbles from preferred bidders Latécoère and MT Aerospace put paid to plans to sell the French and German operations. Instead, in 2009, a pragmatic EADS management spun off the two entities as semi-independent businesses, responsible for their own affairs but ultimately owned by, answerable to, and almost entirely reliant on EADS and its Airbus division for their revenues.

Forged from EADS and Airbus plants in Augsberg, Bremen, Nordenham and Varel, as well as a factory in Romania, Premium Aerotec – like its French counterpart, Aerolia – is a sizeable firm in its own right. In fact, with 9,200 employees and revenues of around €1.3 billion ($1.8 billion), it can lay claim to be the largest German aerospace company (just pipping engine manufacturer MTU).

Premium Aerotec contributes to the structures of most Airbus aircraft – specialising in composite and metal fuselage shells but also wing components and floor structures. It also builds the pressure bulkhead for the Airbus A350 and – in its only substantial “third-party” piece of business – for the Boeing 787. The A350 is its most important programme: the company is responsible for most of the front and rear fuselage, including the section 16-18 side shells and the entire section 13-14, together with floorgrid crossbeams for each.

A new factory, set a short drive from its main complex in the Bavarian city of Augsburg, looks quite roomy now but is beginning to fill with jigs and tooling as Premium Aerotec gears up for volume production of the Airbus widebody twinjet. Responsible for the composite rear fuselage sections (Nordenham does the front sections, while the middle part of the fuselage comes from former Boeing business Spirit AeroSystems), Augsberg has delivered more than 20 shipsets for the first variant, the A350-900. It will begin work on panels for the stretch -1000 – each 3.8m (12.5ft) longer at 17.6m – around October, with three sets earmarked for delivery this year.

Premium Aerotec is keen to portray itself as more than a giant workshop for its parent, however. It wants to be known as an innovator, says Klaus Kalmer, head of engineering. Inherited from Airbus, whose engineers helped develop it, the company owns a 28% share in Fokker’s GLARE fibre-metal laminate material, currently only used in the A380. Premium Aerotec also has the patent on vacuum assisted process (VAP) technology, which allows the large-scale manufacturing in a single step of large carbonfibre components such as the 4.5m-diameter pressure bulkheads for the A350 and 787.

The company has its own engineering division in Augsberg and, among its projects, it has been working on carbonfibre surrounds for the doors in its A350 fuselage sections, shedding 70kg from the weight of the -1000, compared with the -900, as a result. “There is an option to roll that technology back into the -900,” says Kalmer. Any decision to invest in larger-scale composite programmes would be Airbus’s, he notes, but “we are prepared to follow what they decide”. Innovation is not only restricted to composites. “Our metal guys have not been sleeping,” says Kalmer. “You will see some important alloy developments too.”

Premium Aerotec is also introducing innovation in some of its organisational practices as it moves towards being a “real company”, says Jens Krüger, head of communications and political affairs. Although the establishment of Premium Aerotec as an independent entity can be seen as a “real success story”, he admits that “cultural challenges” remain, particularly in giving staff a feeling of corporate identity. “Airbus is our shareholder and main customer but we are not part of Airbus,” he says. However, when recent unfounded reports emerged that Airbus Group management planned to reintegrate Premium Aerotec back into the main company, many shopfloor employees welcomed the rumours.

One of the biggest hurdles Premium Aerotec faces is coping with its own success as it moves from producing structures for legacy programmes to scaling up for the A350 and increased production of the A320 and A320neo families. Oiling the cogs of the company’s processes is the job of new chief operating officer Michael Colberg, who joined Premium Aerotec last year from Daimler. “We need to learn lessons from the automotive industry,” he says. “This has been prompted by the ramp-up. We need to create a synchronised flow, with shorter lead times.”

The company is “beginning to see the advantages of what can be achieved in a faster time”, says Colberg. Previously, the Premium Aerotec ethos was very much oriented to quality, but sometimes at the expense of efficiency and speed of delivery. “We never talked about logistics. Quality is a given, of course, but it is not the ultimate objective without other elements,” says Colberg, who admits to only being 25% of the way to a five-year objective to turn Premium Aerotec into a “new environment”.

Under the old EADS and Airbus ownership, individual factory managers had a lot of autonomy, says Colberg. “We are trying to get rid of investment overlaps and control more from the centre.” Another goal is introducing just-in-time philosophies for in-bound and out-bound products – what Colberg calls “lean material flow”. Following the Airbus example, transport organisation and parts warehousing will be outsourced to a haulage and logistics specialist.

The decades-old Augsburg facility will be reorganised. “Our A320 line is very congested and we need to make it a much leaner operation,” he says. The current layout was designed for production of around seven shipsets a month of narrowbody fuselage sections. In a few years’ time, it will need to be producing 44. “Hitting those 44 shipsets will be very difficult,” Colberg acknowledges.

Aside from the 787 bulkhead, Premium Aerotec has carried out other work for Airbus’s arch-rival, including a composite wing spar, incorporating a wave-shaped vertical section to save weight, as part of a two-year technology project for the US airframer. However, while the temptation for Premium Aerotec might be to seek out more third party business, as Spirit Aerosystems did aggressively in the 2000s, Colberg says any broadening of the customer base will have to be closely managed.

“It is important to expand beyond Airbus, but we are facing a ramp-up of legacy programmes and the A350, so we really need to concentrate on delivering to time and quality,” says Colberg. “It would be hard – perhaps even dangerous – to digest third-party work before we reorganise the company.” A glance at the Premium Aerotec website or marketing materials will see no mention of its parent company – there are not even any subtle branding clues. However, until it takes the next step in its development as an independent entity, Premium Aerotec will not be looking too hard for business beyond the demands of its biggest customer.

BAE To Market German Radar Satellite Data to U.S. Government - SpaceNews,"Wed, 21 May 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS80MDY0NGJhZS10by1tYXJrZXQtZ2VybWFuLXJhZGFyLXNhdGVsbGl0ZS1kYXRhLXRvLXVzLWdvdmVybm1lbnQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"BERLIN — BAE Systems Intelligence and Security will market data from Germany’s TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X radar satellites to the U.S. government under an alliance with the satellites’ owner, Airbus Defence and Space, the two companies announced May 20.

The agreement extends to certain commercial and international customers, they said.

Airbus’ Geo-Intelligence, Communication, Intelligence and Security division sells optical and radar satellite data worldwide from a constellation of spacecraft including the two radar spacecraft. A third radar satellite, the Airbus-built Paz owned by the Spanish government, will become in effect a third radar sensor in orbit when it becomes operational.

Paz is tentatively scheduled for launch late this year aboard a Russian-Ukrainian Dnepr converted silo-launched ballistic missile.

Vark Helfritz, director of market and corporate development at Airbus’ Geo-Intelligence division, said during the Berlin Air Show that Airbus and BAE bring complementary assets to the partnership.

BAE Systems has a long relationship with the U.S. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, which is the principal U.S. government buyer of commercial satellite data. BAE Systems provides software integration and other services. Airbus has the global satellite network to furnish the data.

Despite U.S. defense spending cutbacks, the U.S. government remains the world’s single largest buyer of commercial radar satellite imagery and shows no sign of pulling back demand, according to MDA Corp. of Canada, which through its Radarsat division competes with Airbus for U.S. government business. Italy’s e-Geos is a third radar satellite data provider to the U.S. government.

TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X were launched in June 2007 and June 2010, respectively, with service lives estimated at five years each. Airbus and the German Aerospace Center, DLR, jointly developed the two radar satellites, with Airbus granted exclusive commercial use of the data.

Helfritz said a recent analysis by DLR has concluded that the two spacecraft will be able to operate well beyond 2018, likely into 2020, assuring several years of overlap with Paz.

Israeli DIRCM laser to protect German A400M transport planes - Defense Update,"Sat, 24 May 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vZGVmZW5zZS11cGRhdGUuY29tLzIwMTQwNTI0X2lzcmFlbGktZGlyY20tbGFzZXJzLXRvLXByb3RlY3QtZ2VybWFuLWE0MDBtLXRyYW5zcG9ydC1wbGFuZXMuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Set to receive the first MUSIC systems by 2015, the German Atlas would be the first A400M to fly with a DIRCM system

Diehl announced it plans to combine Elbit System´s J-MUSIC (Multi-Spectral Infrared Countermeasure) system into a multi-turret Directed Infrared Counter Measure (DIRCM) system to be integrated into the german A400M Atlas military transport, ensuring complete 360° protection of the aircraft. Diehl and Elbit Systems have signed an exclusive cooperation agreement at the recent ILA Berlin airshow, to equip the Bundeswehr´s Airbus A400M transport aircraft with its self-protection system. J-MUSIC was designed to protect large military and commercial aircraft against man portable infra-red guided anti-aircraft missiles (MANPADS) employed by terrorists worldwide.

In recent months Elbit Systems completed extensive testing of the fiber-laser based J-MUSIC and its the podded version C-MUSIC systems, and has delivered systems to equip several aircraft for customers this year. Several variants of the MUSIC system and modules were already selected to protect the Italian Air Force Lockheed Martin C130J and Alenia Aermacchi C27J military transports and AgustaWestland AW101 CSAR helicopters, as well as the Brazilian Embraer C390 military transports. The cooperation with Diehl further extends Elbit Systems’ access to military and commercial aircraft fleets. In 2013 Boeing and Elbit Systems have also signed a Memorandum of Understanding offering Elbit Systems’ Directed Infrared Counter Measure (DIRCM) systems for a range of Boeing military fixed-wing and vertical-lift aircraft.

By adapting the Israeli solution Diehl will be able to meet the Bundeswehr schedule with operationally-ready DIRCM solution for the A400M in 2015

[ismember]Diehl has also acquired extensive experience with aircraft self protection and DIRCM, as a member of the Franco-German industry group assigned to provide the Closed-Loop laser based DIRCM (DIRCM-CL) as a self protection capability for NATO’s transport and special mission aircraft, and particularly for the Atlas. The group was formed in 2009 and, according to the original schedule, was supposed to deliver the first DIRCMs this year. Until now Diehl planned to use its own Flash DIRCM, designed to jam and disable advanced seeker heads, ‘burning’ their electronics by high-power laser. This concept has been proven through the FLASH developmental program that has been underway since 2005, but the. However, FLASH has yet to mature into an operational ready system, and would not be ready to provide a DIRCM-based solution for the German A400M Atlas in time for its initial operational capability planned for next year.

The FLASH laser DIRCM was designed to protect the Atlas from current MANPADS threats and offer growth potential, to protect the aircraft from non MANPADS threats at a later stage. [/ismember]By adapting the Israeli solution Diehl will be able to meet the Bundeswehr schedule with operationally-ready DIRCM solution for the A400M in 2015. Germany is expected to operate 53 A400Ms positioned to become the largest operator of the Atlas; the first aircraft is currently in assembly and will be delivered to the customer in November 2014.

[/nonmember][ismember]As a modern military transport the A400M has been specifically designed for low detectability, low vulnerability and high survivability. The Defensive Aids Suite that has been integrated as part of the aircraft design incorporate the ALR-400 radar warner from Indra and EADS (Airbus) and MIRAS (multicolour infraRed alerting sensor) missile launch and approach warner developed by EADS and Thales. On board countermeasures include chaff and flare decoys.

The aircraft also benefits from reduced infra-red signature delivered by the four EPI TP 400 turboprops. Other survivability enhancing features include damage tolerant controls, triple redundant fly-by-wire flight controls and four independent control computers. Protection against small arms fire and shrapnels include cockpit armoring, bullet-resistant windscreens, the use of inerting gas in the fuel tanks and segregated routing of hydraulics and wiring.[/ismember]

The first A400M Atlas has been delivered to the French Air Force in 2013, followed by the delivery to the Turkish Air Force earlier this year. The RAF is British Royal Air Force will be next, followed by the German Air Force, both receiving their first Atlas this year.

The current intention of the participating nations is to procure a total of 170 aircraft with delivery schedule extending to 2024. Of the 170 aircraft Germany 53, France 50, Spain 27, Turkey 10, UK 22, Belgium 7 and one for Luxembourg. Malaysia has also ordered four aircraft, with deliveries commencing in 2015. Airbus is expecting a second export order to be signed in 2014.

BAE Systems partners with commercial firms to diversify defense business - The Washington Post,"Tue, 20 May 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuwFodHRwczovL3d3dy53YXNoaW5ndG9ucG9zdC5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvY2FwaXRhbGJ1c2luZXNzL2JhZS1zeXN0ZW1zLXBhcnRuZXJzLXdpdGgtY29tbWVyY2lhbC1maXJtcy10by1kaXZlcnNpZnktZGVmZW5zZS1idXNpbmVzcy8yMDE0LzA1LzIwLzU5ZTU0OWNhLWUwNDEtMTFlMy04ZGNjLWQ2YjdmZWRlMDgxYV9zdG9yeS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"British defense giant BAE Systems announced two partnerships Tuesday, largely aimed at diversifying the company’s American business as military spending slows. The company will team up with fellow European aerospace firm Airbus to launch a line of radar satellites used for mapping and remote sensing BAE also said it would work with New York-based Infor, a commercial software firm, to market IT products to both federal agencies and commercial customers.

For BAE, these partnerships are an opportunity to develop products that have broader applications beyond the federal market, the company said.

Defense contractors are expecting a rough year in the face of declining budgets. Contractors have increasingly focused on moving business overseas or expanding into commercial operations. The information services sector, which provides software support, maintenance and other services to government agencies, has been hit especially hard. The sector lost more than 11,000 positions in the past year, although there have been signs of improvement.

As much as the partnerships help BAE, the deals also allow the contractor to use its existing relationships with the government to help Airbus and Infor drum up more federal business.

“Our goal is to take those areas where we have a leadership position, partner with [other leaders] like Airbus and build something that’s better than the aggregate of both of us,” said Peder Jungck, vice president and chief technology officer of BAE’s intelligence and security division.

In addition, the government increasingly wants to lower the risks of technology work by using tried-and-tested gear and software, said Jungck, which is another reason behind BAE’s tie-ups.

“They’re saying, ‘show me you can already perform the work in question,’ so we’re allowing them to see the product before they have to contract it,” he said.

For example, BAE will upgrade some of its own operations in the United Kingdom using Infor’s software products. The company has also invested in a tech lab in Reston in which BAE analysts will learn how to install and maintain Infor software before providing it to the government.

Earlier this month, BAE Systems said it was closing its support solutions sector to cut costs. It is distributing the work among the company's other three sectors."
Bell 429 selected for Canadian Coast Guard - Vertical Mag - Vertical Magazine,"Tue, 13 May 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYmVsbDQyOXNlbGVjdGVkZm9yY2FuYWRpYW5jb2FzdGd1YXJkL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Bell Helicopter Textron Canada (BHTC) of Mirabel, Que., has been awarded a federal government contract worth up to C$172 million to supply the Canadian Coast Guard (CCG) with 15 light twin Bell 429 helicopters. The manufacturer is also on track to provide the same agency with eight more twin-engine helicopters, medium-lift 412EPI models.

The contract for the light twins was announced May 12 by Fisheries and Oceans Minister Gail Shea and the lead political minister for Quebec, Denis Lebel, Minister of Infrastructure, Communities and Intergovernmental Affairs, despite the fact that the procurement is at the center of a Federal Court lawsuit brought by Airbus Helicopters Canada (formerly Eurocopter Canada).

Plans for up to 24 new helicopters were announced by the government in August 2012, when Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) issued a letter of interest to potential suppliers. The current CCG fleet is comprised of 14 Airbus Helicopters Bo.105 CBS helicopters delivered between 1983 and 1987, three late-1960s Bell 206Ls, and five late-1970s Bell 212s.

Some 65 percent of CCG helicopter operations supports construction and maintenance of navigation aids and telecommunications equipment; 15 percent is for ice reconnaissance as part of the CCG’s icebreaking mission; and the rest involves personnel and cargo transfers, as well as support for scientific research and fisheries enforcement.

At the beginning of the procurement process, other potential contenders for the light twin helicopter contract were the AgustaWestland AW109 and Airbus Helicopters’ EC135 or EC145. Potential medium-lift candidates, in addition to the 412EPI, were the AW139, the EC175 and the Sikorsky S-76D.

The light twin procurement prompted complaints by competitors, notably Airbus Helicopters Canada and AgustaWestland, about the fundamental legitimacy of the competition. The main issue is that Transport Canada allegedly favored the 429 when it granted Bell a 500 pound weight exemption for its light twin helicopter. (The approval, granted in December 2011, increased the maximum gross weight of the 429 from 7,000 lbs. to 7,500 lbs. — putting it 500 lbs. in excess of the weight limit for normal, as opposed to transport, category rotorcraft.) Airbus Helicopters Canada sued the government and with the Federal Court not expected to rule until at least late 2014, the project was expected to remain in limbo.

But in their surprise joint announcement, the ministers made no reference to the court case. Shea said the fleet renewal “will improve the Coast Guard’s air support capability from coast to coast and in Canada’s North,” while Lebel focused on job sustainment in his home province.

For its part, Airbus Helicopters said in a statement from its headquarters in Fort Erie, Ont., that it “deeply regrets that the federal government moved forward and awarded the . . . contract” even though its lawsuit is unresolved.

“Airbus Helicopters Canada maintains that the government’s Request for Proposals . . . was biased to favor one manufacturer and consequently resulted in a sole source tender,” read the statement. “Furthermore, Transport Canada’s awarding of a special weight exemption to Bell Helicopter in 2011 created an unfair competitive advantage and contributed to this RFP attracting only one bid.”

Citing its “strong presence in para-public and defense markets around the world” and its status as “the civil market leader” in Canada, Airbus Helicopters pointed out that it has invested “heavily” in Canada for three decades and said that it expected “to compete in fair, open and transparent public tender processes.”

Airbus Helicopters’ lawyer in the court case, Marc-André Fabien, a senior partner in Fasken Martineau, told Vertical that the government’s approach to the light twins procurement “clearly” had been focused on Bell from the outset. He also suggested that the same is true of the medium-twins procurement. Fabien, whose specialties include litigation against all levels of government, said the contract should not have been awarded at least until a Federal Court of Canada judge rules on the merits of the lawsuit later this year.

As for the medium-lift procurement, AgustaWestland, Airbus Helicopters Canada and Sikorsky all confirmed their withdrawal from the procurement. The two European-controlled companies had advised PWGSC of their decision some months ago, but neither they nor the government confirmed it at the time. PWGSC has since declined comment.

The main issue is weight again, with the CCG’s stipulation of a maximum medium-lift helicopter weight of 11,000 lbs. (4,989 kg). This was determined as the maximum the agency’s current ships could safely accommodate, even though future vessels from which they will operate are still in early design.

The Bell 412EPI has a maximum takeoff weight of 11,900 lbs. (5,398 kg), which implies that it will not be operated at full capacity. The S-76D comes in at 11,700 lbs. (5,307 kg), the AW139 at 14,110 lbs. (6,400 kg); and the EC175 at 16,535 lbs. (7,500 kg).

When Sikorsky announced its decision to withdraw from the medium-lift competition, it disclosed that it had evaluated not only its S-76D but also the H-60 it supplies to the United States Coast Guard. It eventually decided that the S-76D “appeared to be the best fit” but without going into detail, said that “after careful consideration,” it opted not to bid.

The first Bell 429 is scheduled to be delivered in 12 months."
Pratt & Whitney Ships Initial PurePower Engines To Airbus - Indian Defence Review,"Wed, 21 May 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGlhbmRlZmVuY2VyZXZpZXcuY29tL25ld3MvcHJhdHQtd2hpdG5leS1zaGlwcy1pbml0aWFsLXB1cmVwb3dlci1lbmdpbmVzLXRvLWFpcmJ1cy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Pratt & Whitney has delivered its first ship set of PurePower® PW1100G-JM engines on schedule to Airbus for its A320neo aircraft family. The PurePower engines were assembled and tested at the company’s West Palm Beach, Florida, facility – one of three locations that will assemble PW1100G-JM engines for Airbus. Pratt & Whitney is a division of United Technologies Corp. (NYSE: UTX).

“Airbus put its trust in Pratt & Whitney to design, develop and certify the PW1100G-JM engine for the A320neo,” said David Brantner, president, Pratt & Whitney Commercial Engines. “I am pleased to say that Pratt & Whitney has completed more than 75 percent of certification testing and we are on track to meet or exceed all commitments. Our PurePower engine family has now completed more than 9,000 hours of rigorous testing, which is proving the engine’s capability and reliability. We are on track and ready to power the first A320neo aircraft in late summer.”

The PW1100G-JM engine continues to go through its rigorous testing process with certification planned for the second half of 2014. Airline operation or entry into service is planned for the fourth quarter of 2015.

The PW1100G-JM engine successfully completed its first development flight May 15, 2013, on Pratt & Whitney’s flight test aircraft. To date, the company has successfully completed more than 20 development engine builds and three flight test campaigns to validate the PW1100G-JM engine. The first engine was tested in November 2012, less than two years after the Geared Turbofan program was launched.

Compared with an A320ceo without Sharklets, the A320neo powered by PW1100G-JM engine technology will provide customers with up to a 15 percent reduction in fuel-burn with a corresponding reduction in CO2 emissions. The PW1100G-JM engine also provides up to a 75 percent reduction in the A320neo noise footprint, which is also environmentally friendly and allows longer hours of operation at airports that operate under curfew.

To date, the PurePower engine family has more than 5,500 orders and commitments, including options, from more than 50 global customers.

Russell continues, “An essential element of our success is that we can consistently and reliably allow our flight crew to respond to our partner needs. With these EC135 performance enhancements, aircraft capabilities and our IFR/GPS capabilities that allow us to fly in inclement weather, we will be able to more effectively serve our partners and ultimately the patients in this community.”

Chris Giller, general manager for the REACH Marysville and Sacramento bases, adds: “The addition of this new aircraft will improve the level of service and safety to the region while offering the quietest aircraft signature for our neighbors. It is also the most technologically advanced aircraft available today for Emergency Services.”

REACH was the first air ambulance company in the United States to receive approval by the FAA to operate off published instrument airways using its own proprietary GPS routes to specific hospitals. Founded in 1987, REACH currently has bases throughout California, Oregon and Texas. Each base provides 24/7 emergency air service to the surrounding areas. REACH has performed more than 85,000 air ambulance missions since its inception."
Inspired design guides A350 XWB cabin development - Aircraft Interiors International,"Wed, 07 May 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmNyYWZ0aW50ZXJpb3JzaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC5jb20vZmVhdHVyZXMvaW5zcGlyZWQtZGVzaWduLWd1aWRlcy1hMzUwLXh3Yi1jYWJpbi1kZXZlbG9wbWVudC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus knew its A350 XWB had to be a revolutionary aircraft from the design process onward, as discussions with operators of existing widebody jetliners revealed many were interested in something completely new. This spurred the company’s decision to develop a cabin interior the likes of which had never before been seen.

Airbus’ Executive Committee seized the opportunity by proposing what became known as the “chrysalis cabin.” Designers traditionally start work by looking at existing cabins and identifying evolutionary improvements that would add incremental benefits for passengers and airlines. The inspiration for the chrysalis cabin was the potential of new technologies to allow a break with the past, so discussions began with a blank sheet of paper.

“We saw no point in simply tweaking existing cabin designs when the aircraft itself was going to be completely new,” explains Kiran Rao, Airbus’ head of strategy. “The chance to offer customers a substantially better cabin as well as excellent performance, range and efficiency was too good to miss. After all, the quality of the cabin is what matters most of all to passengers.”

Older widebody jetliners are tapered at the front and back, but this places limitations on seat configuration and makes an aircraft feel narrow as passengers look along the cabin. Curved walls also reduce shoulder room in window seats, and for many passengers the view from these windows is quite limited. The chrysalis cabin was designed with no tapering at all between the doors, straighter walls and panoramic windows that are 50% bigger than those on the A330 – setting a new industry standard.

Dropping the floors allowed straighter walls, a change that also increased the feeling of spaciousness, made room for bigger overhead storage bins and meant that crew rest areas could be installed above the passenger deck. “The more seats on the passenger deck and the more cargo in the hold, the better,” Rao adds. “Putting the crew’s bunks above everything else increased the available revenue space even further.” Other proposals included LED lighting, 3D and ultra-HD ready in-flight entertainment, a flat floor and full connectivity.

Determined delivery

“When we saw the chrysalis cabin requirements that arrived from the Executive Committee, we were slightly stunned,” remembers Jochen Mueller, cabin supply module head of engineering. “We didn’t think it was actually possible and neither did some of our suppliers, but being engineers, we soon started thinking in terms of solutions.” The scale of the challenge led to a new way of working. Mueller believes that the key to the team’s successful delivery was their adoption of the requirement-based system, introduced for the first time with Airbus’ A350 XWB.

In the past cabin engineers had worked out exactly what they wanted and then asked suppliers to produce it. For the A350 XWB the process was changed. “Our suppliers became RSPs (risk sharing partners) and we trusted them much more, we let them work out the finer details as long as what they produced met our requirements,” says Mueller.

A prime example of this approach arose with the aircraft’s new LED lighting system, which had to be zonal, programmable and provide the full range of colours – but explaining how bright it should be was a problem. “We could have done a lot of research before giving exact specifications, but instead we said we wanted the rest rooms to be bright enough for passengers to put their make-up on and then left it to the lighting experts to achieve that,” Mueller explains.

Of course, careful, regular, systematic checks were essential to monitor progress, but showing faith in the ability of RSPs to deliver made fast work on the cabin possible.

A quick glance at the new cabin’s credentials confirms Mueller’s assessment. Air pressure and humidity levels are better while state-of-the-art in-flight entertainment (IFE) is delivered through larger, higher quality screens. Mood lighting can help passengers to avoid jet lag, changes to suit each phase of the flight and allows airlines to brand the interior by using colours against the white aircraft walls.

Despite the state-of-the-art IFE, the floor is flat and IFE boxes have been shrunk to have no impact on passengers’ feet. Overhead bins are larger, shoulder room is better and the lack of tapering makes the cabin feel more spacious. And the panoramic windows offer a noticeably better view. Even the hot beverage machines and ovens have their servicing needs monitored by a centralised computer system.

“Being presented with non-negotiable requirements is every engineer’s nightmare but our job was to overcome any problems,” says Mueller. “It took a few years, but with the help of our RSPs I think we did it.”"

But where are they flying?

The Airbus A380 will be touching down at London Heathrow first, operating from Abu Dhabi from the 27th December 2014, operating the EY11/EY12 flight pair. Combined, this forms part of the three daily flights between the two cities

Abu Dhabi – London Heathrow

Etihads Airbus A380 is configured with:

2 Residence – Upper Deck

9 First Apartment – Upper Deck

70 Business Studio – Upper Deck

417 Economy Smart Seats – Lower Deck

All the pretty pictures are at http://www.etihad.com/en-gb/experience-etihad/flying-reimagined/ with 10 of the double-decker planes to join the fleet.

The Residence of course is priced as a premium product, with a return ticket pricing out around £25,456.11

As I said, “Premium”

Looking towards the other new workhorse of the Etihad fleet – the Boeing 787-9 (the first stretch of the Dreamliner), which will be joining the fleet, with services from Abu Dhabi to Düsseldorf, Mumbai and Washington Dulles.

The service from Düsseldorf is currently booked for the month of December 2014, replacing the A330 currently operating that route for that month. After that, the 787-9’s will be will be rolled out further to Mumbai (replacing the A340-600 on EY206/EY205) and Washington Dulles (replacing the existing A340-500) from the 1st January 2015.

41 Boeing 787-9s will be joining the Etihad fleet

Again, these aircraft will be configured with Etihads new product as to be featured aboard the Airbus A380 with:

8 First Suites

28 Business Studio Seats

199 Economy Smart Seats

For those who are looking at Etihad in the future, it would be wise to keep an eye on the seat maps as Business Studio will be rolled out to the Airbus A350, Boeing 777x and more relevantly, Etihads existing Boeing 777 fleet according to Australian Business Traveller.

There are some nice innovations with this product, with the stand-out residence, and new seating, IFE system and WiFi on all these new planes.

All you have to do is find the cash to fly them, or hope the miles can pay for your trip…"
"Juli Inkster, Karen Stupples called the shots at Airbus LPGA Classic instead of taking them - AL.com","Wed, 28 May 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvMjAxNC8wNS9scGdhc19qdWxpX2lua3N0ZXJfa2FyZW5fc3R1cHAuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Kingsmill - Final Round

Karen Stupples reports on the action for The Golf Channel during the first round of the CME Group Titleholders at Tiburon Golf Club on November 21, 2013 in Naples, Fla. She served as the network's lead analyst in the booth for the Airbus LPGA Classic last week. (Photo courtesy of The Golf Channel)

MOBILE, Alabama - They are more accustomed to playing the game than describing it, to being interviewed than conducting interviews, and to making the shots instead of watching shots being made. But Karen Stupples and Juli Inkster are becoming more comfortable in their new media roles.

Both women still play in selected tournaments, but are making transitions into new roles for the Golf Channel. Inkster served as an on-course reporter and interviewer for this week's Airbus LPGA Classic at Magnolia Grove's Crossings Course. It was her second time handling those duties for the network. Stupples served as the lead analyst for the first time this week. She worked alongside Whit Watson.

Both players have participated in Mobile tournaments in the past, but this week they were describing the action of a tournament that featured a fan-friendly leaderboard and lots of low scores. Prior to Sunday's final round, Inkster, who will be captain for the 2015 U.S. Solheim Cup team, and Stupples spoke with Alabama Media Group about their Golf Channel roles this week.

Q: As players, what has it been like for you coming to the ""dark side'' as members of the media?

Juli: This is only my second week and I'm trying to get a feel for it. This is a great group to work with and it's been a lot of fun and I've stayed low-key. I'm learning the ins and outs of how it all works. I'm used to being interviewed, not interviewing someone else. I'm calling shots and I think about them but I don't really talk about them, so I'm learning how to get that out. It's just different. I did what I have been doing for 30 years and now I'm doing this, and I've only been doing this for two weeks. I'm learning.

Karen: I really like it. I've had a little bit more experience, not just on TV but I've done some radio too for the BBC. That's really when I first realized that it was something that I would like to potentially do more of. I like the discussion of golf and the who and why they do it with the media types, just hanging out and the conversations that go on in the media centers I find fascinating a lot of the time. It's a different life for me. I've never - when you're a golfer you're an individual and you just go do your thing and it's all about you and that's it. But it's kind of fun to have other people to talk about it with and to be social with and to have a life that's not just about the golf course and the hotel. I'm very fortunate to have this opportunity with Golf Channel because it's more fun than radio. It's pretty awesome to me. I love it. I like being on the course, now I'm having an opportunity in the booth and that's a lot of fun too. It's very nerve-wracking. I get very nervous before I go out. Your stomach churns and it's like those first-tee nerves all over again. Really? I thought I was over all this. But Juli's right, there is a lot to learn. ... All of a sudden you have to have questions in your head. I always try to think, 'What would you be asked?' and ask those questions. It's different, but fun at the same time. I love it, I really love it.

Q: Having been interviewed so many times in your careers, how much does that help in the jobs you have now?

Juli: I think it helps. Every little bit helps. Listening to other people interview people helps too. My feeling is to ask them about their game (that) day and maybe add a tidbit that someone wouldn't know about them. That's what I've been trying to do. ... Just something relevant to the day. You don't know how many questions you're going to have to ask and you have to bank them. And listen to the answers they give because maybe something will come out of that.

Karen: The tough question, you know how you would feel if you were the player and they were asking that question of you. You'd be like, 'Really?' So you're like, I don't want to ask this question but I have to. That feels somewhat awkward at times, because you know as a player how you would feel being asked that question, and yet it's part of the job and you have to go ahead and ask it. It's somewhat out of the comfort zone every once in a while. In some respects that's pushing the boundaries a bit, but in a way that's also fun because you're extending yourself to see what you can do, and that's cool.

Q: Do you find yourselves sometimes walking that thin line of 'I know you personally, but this is something I need to ask?'

Juli: They know that we have our jobs to do and they have theirs. I would never, ever call on a player because it's harder than people think, playing golf, and you're on an island by yourself. ... When you're putting them it's a whole lot harder than calling the shots. I've been there and I've done that and I know, sometimes you're going to have a bad stroke ... but I would never say, 'She choked' or anything like that. That's just me.

Karen: You just know what you feel like as a player yourself. You've got to be informative. ... You can put it across the right way.

Juli: It's a hard game and I know it's a hard game. My job is, I want to pump these girls up. I want to see how good they are, not what they're doing bad. I think the game needs that. The average Joe sit out there and says, 'nanananan,' but they don't realize some of these girls are driving it 280, 290, with great short games. I want to try to pump up the LPGA game.

Karen: I do too. Ultimately as a player, you know when you've messed it up. You know when you've done that. I think players are generally, 'You know what, she's right, I did mess it up there.' You know when you've made a mistake and it comes up and bites you. You can see it on the faces of the players. I want to say sitting there and watching it, I know some of them are thinking exactly that. You can see it, the agony of missing a putt. You feel it. You can't switch those feelings off. That's why Juli is good at what she does and hopefully I'm good at what I'm doing, because we have those feelings still, we know what that's like.

Juli: I know I'm not good at it yet. Everybody's been really helpful. They're not trying to overlook me. It is a unique thing. There is no right or wrong and no black or white. There's this huge gray arera and you have to try and figure out where that boundary is.

Q: Today there's a lot of branding that's involved and often you are encouraged to bring your on personality out. Do you feel that is important?

Juli: I'm never going to be a Judy Rankin; I wish I could be, but that's just not my personality or whatever. I think that's everyone's uniqueness and I think that's what everyone wants. They want you to bring your own style to the game.

Karen: There's no use in trying to be someone else because ultimately you'll do a better job being who you are. And it's going to be more natural and you come across better that way if you just be yourself. Say things how you see it and say how you would almost talk to yourself. I know when I watch golf on TV I always have a dialogue going on in my head about what's going on anyway. But I'm just watching it. Typically what I'm finding out is that's what's coming out.

Q: How different is the role for you (Karen) to be the lead announcer for the tournament? To go from radio, where I would imagine you have to be more descriptive as to what is going on, to here where the visual is already there? How big of a change is that?

Karen: I've done the on-course (reporting) before, so I had a good grounding already for what goes on in your ear and what you're hearing. ... This is the first time I've been in the booth in this role and I have to say it's been a bit of a buildup for me. You get slightly more nervous getting ready for it because it's a big deal. The first day I was very nervous - Juli said, 'Make a lot of pars, not many bogeys' - and I've gotten more comfortable as the week has gone along. I learn quickly when to jump in and when not to jump in when I have things to say. I've never been a big researcher but I've found out I have to do a little bit of studying. I've never studied for anything in my life but I am studying a little bit. That's somewhat different for me. But we're very fortunate that we're somewhat current and we have played a lot with the girls, so we're able to fall back on our knowledge of that, which really helps out.

Q: Where do you see the LPGA now? There seems to be so many young stars and young players coming up. Do you like where the game is right now?

Juli: I think the game, as far as play-wise, is in great shape. There's a lot good, young players coming up that are athletes. They have good heads on their shoulders and they're competitive. I think if we get just a few more domestic (players), and I know they're working on that, it will help. But I think the quality of golf and the leaderboards - the leaderboard here has been amazing all week and it's going to be a shootout coming down to the end.

Karen: I think this while year has been absolutely amazing in terms of the LPGA. You look at the winners we've had this year; it's been a who's who of LPGA golf. I think it can only mean good things. ... Our ratings are really good and it all comes down to the players. They're young and exciting and they've all got their own personalities. They're not sort of cookie-cutter golfers. They all have their own personalities and their own distinctive styles. Not one them. Michelle Wie is not like Lexi Thompson who is not like Morgan Pressel. They all have their own way about them and their own style of play and that's exciting. There's always something to relate to. ... There's something for everybody to watch, which I always think is good and helps in building fans because you can relate to pretty much everybody out here."
Virgin America gets its gates at Dallas Love Field - Economy Class & Beyond - Kevin Marshall,"Mon, 12 May 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vZWNvbm9teWNsYXNzYW5kYmV5b25kLmJvYXJkaW5nYXJlYS5jb20vMjAxNC8wNS8xMi92aXJnaW4tYW1lcmNpYS1nZXRzLWl0cy1nYXRlcy1hdC1kYWxsYXMtbG92ZS1maWVsZC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Virgin America can finally breathe a sigh of relief, as they finally get the gates they been desiring at Dallas Love Field Airport.



Virgin America Airbus A319 taxing at Dallas Fort Worth – Image GhettoIFE

The airline will sub-lease two gates from American Airlines (which the airline is forced to give up due to the AA/US merger), allowing Virgin America to commence operations from there.

The airline has been selling tickets for routes from Dallas Love Field to Los Angeles LAX, New York-LGA, San Francisco, and Washington DC (DCA) since April, but has been campaigning to actually get the gates it needs. The approval was given by Dallas City Manager – A.C. Gonzalez after a protracted process.

This will make Dallas Love Field a “Focus City” – its first outside its California homes.

In turn, Virgin America will move all its operations from Dallas Fort-Worth (The American Airlines Fortress Hub) to Love Field.

Dallas Love Field is home to Southwest Airlines (who were also vying for the lease of the gates), who control 16 out of 20 gates at the airport.

Virgin America offers a two class service, with the typical Virgin trimmings compared to other domestic carriers, but hasn’t made that much of a splash in terms of size network to rival existing legacy airlines. They operate a fleet of Airbus A319s and A320s – with orders for A320neos and A320s."

LONDON, May 22 (UPI) -- A second full-flight simulator for the Airbus A400M military transport is to be produced by Thales for use by Britain's Royal Air Force. Thales said the contract was issued by Airbus Defense and Space. It gave no specific dollar value but said it was worth millions of dollars. Advertisement

The A400M is a four-engine turboprop airlifter introduced into service last year. It has a cruise speed of 485 miles per hour, a range of 2,450 miles with a 30.4 ton payload. Nine countries, including Britain, have ordered more than 170 of the Airbus produced aircrafts.

Thales' A400M full-flight simulator represents the current cockpit configuration of the plane. It simulates ground and flight operations in a variety of operational environments and features an enhanced field-of-view visual system, air-to-air refueling simulation and low-level tactical operations.

The second simulator will be delivered to Britain's Ministry of Defense this year and will train A400M aircrews at the RAF Brize Norton training school in Oxfordshire, which was built for the RAF by Thales.

""This order follows on previous orders for A400M full flight simulators from Spain, France, Germany and the UK,"" said Peter Hitchcock, Thales's vice president, UK avionics business. ""It confirms Thales as a leading military training service provider for the UK Ministry of Defense""."

A full IFE system is offered to passengers too – along with connectivity by AeroMobile allowing the use of mobile phones for Text, email, etc.

Whilst there will be a capacity cut going down from an A340-600 to an A330-300 (12 less Upper Class, 10 more Premium Economy seats, and 48 less economy seats), it should actually offer a better experience for customers with a newer plane and more up-to-date products.

Air Canada customers angry over bumping to Rouge - CBC.ca,"Thu, 08 May 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9uZXdzL2NhbmFkYS9icml0aXNoLWNvbHVtYmlhL2Fpci1jYW5hZGEtY3VzdG9tZXJzLWFuZ3J5LW92ZXItYnVtcGluZy10by1yb3VnZS0xLjI2MzM4NDXSASBodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYmMuY2EvYW1wLzEuMjYzMzg0NQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The airline switched some passengers to its low-cost carrier

Some Air Canada passengers are seeing red after the airline moved them to its new low-cost Rouge carrier, but the airline denies service is suffering.

Many customers who purchased Air Canada flights months in advance say they have found themselves bumped onto Rouge flights and given no choice but to accept the smaller seats, limited in-flight entertainment and lack of complimentary food.

Jim Noon is furious that his Air Canada flight was switched without his consent to the Rouge service. (CBC)

Jim Noon, who booked a regular Air Canada flight from Vancouver to Los Angeles on points in March, says the company subsequently moved him to a Rouge flight without his knowledge or consent.

""It's frustrating, and it makes you feel deceived,"" Noon told CBC News.

The flight could prove a tight squeeze for Noon, who is six-foot-three: Rouge seats have less legroom than regular Air Canada flights.

For instance, Rouge seats on the Airbus 319-100 have 73.5 cm of pitch, compared with 79-89 cm on the same aircraft on a regular Air Canada flight.

This spacing, and a reduced number of larger premium seats, allows the airline to put in two more rows, for a total of 12 more seats on the Airbus planes.

""I'm a tall guy,"" Noon says. ""My No. 1 concern is that I can fit into that seat for three hours — or eight hours — and not have to crawl off the plane afterwards.""

Access to entertainment and food on Rouge flights also differs from regular Air Canada flights.

On Rouge flights, economy travellers must pay for food and can only access in-flight entertainment if they have their own iPad or are prepared to rent one for the flight.

The experience has made Noon swear off the carrier for good.

""I used to be a loyal Air Canada traveller, and now I am certainly going to look elsewhere.""

Social media reaction also critical

Noon is not alone, based on social media comments.

The travel review site Skytrax has comment forums for every airline and the Rouge board is filled with posters complaining about getting bumped from Air Canada flights.

Customers complain that the seats on Rouge flights are cramped when compared with regular Air Canada flights. (CBC)

And it's not just those who bumped to Rouge flights who are complaining.

The new brand is facing criticism from passengers who have booked with Rouge and argue that not only is it not cheaper than regular Air Canada flights, but the cramped quarters on board make it an unpleasant experience.

""The 319 plane was cramped with uncomfortable seats, absolutely no leg room and no ventilation,"" J. Morton writes.

""Average height people found their knees jammed into the seat ahead of them and it was impossible to bend over to place or retrieve items from under the seat. Heaven help you if the person in front of you reclined their seat even the small degree they move.""

Another poster coined a new term against the airline, saying, ""I got Rouged.""

On Air Canada Rouge's Facebook page, complaints are noticeably absent, but elsewhere on social media, customers are complaining the company is deleting critical Facebook posts.

CBC News also observed that dozens of critical posts spotted on Friday had been deleted from the Rouge Facebook page by Monday.

Air Canada defends Rouge

Air Canada denies the Rouge service is suffering from customer fallout. In a statement emailed to CBC, the company wrote that ""Rouge flights have been very successful and customers tell us they enjoy the service.""

The statement goes on to say that since the launch of Rouge in 2013, ""we have received very few such concerns.""

Air Canada describes Rouge as ""low cost,"" but is careful to avoid the term ""budget airline.""

Air Canada launched Rouge airline is a 'leisure' service in 2013, but some customers are complaining that they have been bumped from Air Canada to Rouge flights without their knowledge or consent. (CBC)

It calls Rouge a ""leisure"" service.

""The fares are largely the same,"" says Renee Smith-Valade, vice-president of customer experience at Air Canada Rouge, who notes that the services offered by the two carriers are also comparable.

""Air Canada has always priced itself competitively,"" she said.

""In the airline industry, the airlines look at what each other is charging for a fare and make sure that they're always competitive.""

'A marketer's nightmare'

""Either Rouge is a real price deal at stripped-down services, or it's not,"" said Lindsay Meredith, a marketing professor at B.C.'s Simon Fraser University. ""Don't try to have your cake and eat it too. High prices and jammed-in service? No.""

Meredith cautions that the company may find itself in trouble if it switches customers from one service to another without offering an alternative.

Simon Fraser University Prof. Lindsay Meredith says that once a brand drives customers away, it's hard to entice them back. (CBC)

""That kind of misrepresentation might catch the attention of somebody like the competition bureau,"" he says.

He also warns against fuelling the increasing disaffection of customers, who may already be looking at other carriers, saying that one truism of marketing is that once you drive customers away, it's extremely difficult to get them back.

""It would be pretty much a marketer's nightmare if somebody talks about being 'Rouged,'"" he said.

""The name of your brand is in the lexicon as being a term for being ripped off? Boy! That would be the kiss of death for any brand name I can think of."""
Emirates taking 'bedroom concept' on Airbus A380 and Boeing 777 fleet - The National,"Tue, 20 May 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW5hdGlvbmFsbmV3cy5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvZW1pcmF0ZXMtdGFraW5nLWJlZHJvb20tY29uY2VwdC1vbi1haXJidXMtYTM4MC1hbmQtYm9laW5nLTc3Ny1mbGVldC0xLjI4Mzc2M9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Arabian Gulf carriers are competing fiercely over creating new concepts of luxury travel, which includes flying bedrooms similar to those found in a yacht or a hotel.

Only weeks after Etihad Airways announced its premium travel experience – which features private suites, apartments and business studios on its aircraft – Emirates Airline said it would match that by introducing a ""bedroom concept"".

“It’s all about privacy. That’s very much in our current first class private suites product, and our new bedroom concept will take it to the next level,” said Tim Clark, the president of Emirates.

“We’re talking fully enclosed rooms, with all the touches and amenities that you’d expect in hotel or a private bedroom on a luxury yacht, room service and so on. It will be on our A380s, and on our new 777s.”

Emirates said that it is in “advanced stages” of developing its bedroom concept. While it did not disclose the cost of a bedroom, it said that its current first class suite costs US$500,000 apiece, and with the 1,500 seats in its current fleet, that is a total investment of $750 million.

Emirates, the world's biggest customer of the Airbus A380 superjumbo, made headlines at the Dubai Airshow in November when it ordered $99 billion worth of aircraft – including 150 Boeing 777X and 50 A380s from Airbus.

The International Air Transport Association (Iata) said in a note yesterday that premium travel in the Middle East has outperformed other markets globally.

In March, global premium travel rose 1.9 per cent year-on-year, slower than the 4.1 per cent in February.

“Middle East premium travel performed solidly in March, particularly routes to Africa, from Europe, and to the Far East,” said Hussein Dabbas, Iata’s regional vice president for Africa-Middle East.

“The Gulf in particular is enjoying an acceleration in economic growth and tourism. It shows once again that this region is one of the strongest aviation markets in the world.”

Analysts said that a key to the success of Emirates new product will be the pricing. Etihad Residence Suite on the upper deck of its A380 costs $20,000 one way on its Abu Dhabi-London route.

“If its high like Etihad’s Residence Suite, then perhaps it may stifle demand leading to discounting. And with high prices, Emirates will not want to discount so early on with a new cabin product,” said Saj Ahmad, the chief analyst at StrategicAero Research.

Other analysts think that airlines need to revisit their business case of having premium travel products, which may not sell as well as business class seats.

“Premium travel is still in important segment in the Gulf market but more so business class than first class. First class is only supported on certain routes and many airlines globally have withdrawn it or offer it selectively,” said John Strickland, the director of London-based JLS Consulting.

“Airlines have to evaluate the cost of investment versus the likelihood of regularly selling the seats and the opportunity cost of having more seats in business class, which on many routes are more saleable.”

Kiran Rao's son James worked with underprivileged children in the city

James Rao stepped out of his Dubai apartment but collapsed a few metres away on April 27. Initial reports suspect deep vein thrombosis to be the reason

It's a shock that Kiran Rao, executive vice president of aircraft major Airbus and arguably the most powerful Indian in the international aviation industry, is still coming to terms with. The sudden death of his elder son James on April 27, just a few minutes after he had stepped out of his Dubai apartment, is still being investigated though initial reports suggest that it could be because of deep vein thrombosis (DVP).

James, who got his Commercial Pilots License in 2012 from FTE in Spain, joined Safi Airways as a First Officer to fly the Airbus A320. Commercial airline pilots undergo a medical screening every six months to keep their certification and James had not been diagnosed with any medical problem.

""We still don't know the real reason,"" Kiran Rao told dna over phone from London. ""He seemed completely fine when he came home. He spent the night at his apartment and was on his way for an assignment after breakfast when he suddenly collapsed on the road a few metres down the street.""

Condolences have been pouring in from the world over, especially India, where the family had made many friends during a short stint. James was barely 4 years old then. Rao's equations with India's past and present aviation czars, including Vijay Mallya, GR Gopinath, Parvez Damania and Naresh Goyal, transcend merely a business relationship — his helping hand was a critical support to their foray into aviation.

Originally from Bangalore, Rao relocated to London after his father CR Rama Rao, a heart surgeon, decided to set up his practice there in the sixties. The connection with India remained strong for the family and even his son James was a frequent visitor during his holidays, sometimes just to work with those who he felt were less privileged.

In fact, during the time he was schooling in France, James organised a group trip to Mumbai to introduce his French classmates to children of the Byramjee Jeejeebhoy Home in Matunga (East). The 12 students stayed at the premises of the foundation and helped upgrade both the classrooms as well as the understanding of the wards there about the world beyond Mumbai.

After a special memorial service on May 19 in London, the family will bring his ashes to India where they plan to set up a Trust in his memory to fund the education of Mumbai's underprivileged children. ""That's a dream he always had,"" said his father who has aptly decided to name it 'Live Your Dream' foundation."

On landing, the superjumbo was given a 'water-salute' by the fire brigade at the airport run by the Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL) which made special arrangements to handle the large number of passengers and their baggage.

The passengers were welcomed by the SIA staff with gifts and bouquets.

The SIA's aircraft has a total seating capacity of 471 seats with 399 in economy, 60 in business class and 12 first class suites.

Immigration and customs departments had made special arrangements for handling such a large number of passengers.

Major Gulf carrier Emirates would become the second airline to deploy these Airbus A-380s from Mumbai in July.

Late January, government had cleared the deck for A-380 operations from Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad and Bangalore, lifting a five-year-old ban.

The restriction, which was lifted by the Civil Aviation Ministry after several years of demands by major foreign carriers, was imposed in 2008 as the government had then felt these massive jets would help foreign airlines take away a large chunk of global traffic which could be detrimental to Indian carriers' interests.

Delhi and Mumbai airports had received DGCA certification and have made preparations to receive the superjumbos in terms of various services required to handle the large number of passengers these planes can carry when they land or take off.

""The A-380 has received an overwhelming response from the Indian travellers. This reiterates our belief in the Indian market and their aspirations to travel the world which has been the key factor for Singapore Airlines' growth story in India,"" SIA general manager David Lau said in Singapore at the launch of the A-380 operations to India."
Largest passenger jet to fly from May 30 in India - Business Today,"Wed, 07 May 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzdG9kYXkuaW4vaW5kdXN0cnkvYXZpYXRpb24vc3RvcnkvYWlyYnVzLWEtMzgwcy10by1zdGFydC1vcGVyYXRpbmctZnJvbS1tYXktMzAtaW4taW5kaWEtNDY1ODQtMjAxNC0wNS0wN9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The first Airbus A-380 planes would start flying in and out of India from May 30 with the Singapore Airlines (SIA) on Wednesday becoming the first carrier to introduce daily superjumbo flights from Delhi and Mumbai.

The move comes barely four months after the government allowed operation of the world's largest aircraft late January at Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore and Hyderabad airports which are capable of handling arrival and departure of large number of passengers in one go.

The SIA A-380s can fly 471 passengers in a three-class configuration of first class suites, business class and economy.

The superjumbos would operate daily to Mumbai and Delhi from May 30, taking over from two daily flights that currently serve each city using smaller Boeing 777s, SIA's General Manager (India) David Lau told reporters.

He said another daily flight would continue to be operated with B-777s and in total, 14 flights would serve these cities per week.

""We have been keen to operate the Airbus A-380 to India and are glad that the Air Services Agreement (ASA) between Singapore and India now allows us to do so,"" he said. The prevailing bilateral ASA allows SIA to fly 6,000 seats per week from Delhi and Mumbai.

He said India was a particularly important market for SIA and ""we are very pleased that more of our customers will soon be able to experience the spaciousness and comfort of the world's largest aircraft.""

The Singaporean national carrier was the first airline in the world to operate the A-380 in October 2007 between Singapore and Sydney. The superjumbo now also serves Frankfurt, Hong Kong, London, Los Angeles, Melbourne, New York, Paris, Shanghai, Tokyo Narita and Zurich.

With the introduction of the A-380s, the SIA official said the Indian operations would be carried out by diverting these superjumbos from Australia. These planes on the India route would be replaced by new ones as soon as more of them are inducted.

SIA expected 13 per cent rise in passenger numbers from Delhi. Of the 6,000 seats allowed per week, the airline estimated to use about 5,800 from Delhi and Mumbai, he said.

From July, while the A-380s would continue to operate, Boeing 777s would be replaced by A-330s which would allow the airline to increase capacity by over 15 per cent, Lau said.

The aircraft would be ""a solid value proposition for the (Indian) customers"", a large chunk of whom were youth and willing to travel, he said, adding, ""It is the shortest time that SIA has taken to launch these services from India.""

On the overall performance of the airline, Lau said despite strong currency fluctuations, SIA had registered ""a strong single-digit growth in India"".

Asked about Air India which is slated to join the global grouping Star Alliance in July of which SIA is a major member, he said, ""We have been partnering with Air India for over four years"" and this cooperation would continue to grow in future.

To questions, Lau said ""the only constraint we see is in ground handling"" with the turnaround time likely to be greater in Mumbai than in Delhi. SIA has a fleet of 19 A-380s and five more on confirmed orders.

Lifting a five-year-old ban, the government had cleared the decks for A-380 operations from Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad and Bangalore in January.

The restriction on their operations was lifted after demands by major foreign carriers, including SIA and Emirates.

It was imposed in 2008 as the government then felt these double-decker, wide-body and long-haul jets would take away a large chunk of global traffic to the detriment of the Indian carriers' interests.

Both Delhi and Mumbai airports have received DGCA certification and are making preparations to receive the superjumbos in terms of various services required to handle the large number of passengers these planes can accommodate.
