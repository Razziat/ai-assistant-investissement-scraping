Airbus demonstrates aircraft inspection by drone at Farnborough - Airbus,"Wed, 13 Jul 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxNi0wNy1haXJidXMtZGVtb25zdHJhdGVzLWFpcmNyYWZ0LWluc3BlY3Rpb24tYnktZHJvbmUtYXQtZmFybmJvcm91Z2jSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Summary

Innovation and digitalisation for production ramp up

Aircraft quality inspection by drone on A350 XWB

Airbus has demonstrated aircraft visual inspection using a drone at the Farnborough Airshow.The drone, equipped with a high definition camera, performs visual inspection for the upper part of the aircraft. It is flown using an automatic flight control system supervised by a human pilot. The Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) follows a predetermined flight path and takes a series of pictures automatically. All these images and especially those showing any potential non-quality such as scratches, dents and painting defects, are compiled in a 3D digital model, recorded in a database and then analysed. This data helps improve traceability, prevention and reduction of damage.The benefits of this innovative tool and process are significant. Aircraft downtime for inspection is reduced. Data acquisition by drone only takes 10 to 15 minutes, instead of 2 hours using conventional methods.“The use of this new technology offers better working conditions including improving the safety and comfort for the quality inspectors”, says Nathalie Ducombeau, Airbus head of quality.Operators no longer need to go up on a telescopic handler to perform the visual inspection, sometimes in poor weather conditions. In addition, picture analysis can be done anytime afterwards and in an office.Aircraft visual inspections are an important part of the production process. It is part of the Airbus quality standards.A full-scale industrial test is being conducted on A330 aircraft. Airbus is working on implementation on other programmes."
Airbus to Sharply Cut Production of A380 Jumbo Jets (Published 2016) - The New York Times,"Tue, 12 Jul 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMTYvMDcvMTMvYnVzaW5lc3MvaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC9haXJidXMtY3V0cy1kZWxpdmVyeS1nb2FsLWZvci1hMzgwLWp1bWJvLWpldHMuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Airbus said on Tuesday that it would sharply curtail production of the A380 superjumbo jet, the world’s largest passenger plane, as airline demand dwindles for supersize aircraft.

In what it described as a “prudent, proactive step,” Airbus said it had slashed its plans for annual A380 deliveries to 12 planes per year beginning in 2018, roughly half the number it expects to deliver this year.

“We are establishing a new target for our industrial planning, meeting current commercial demand but keeping all our options open to benefit from future A380 markets,” Fabrice Brégier, the Airbus chief executive, said in a statement.

Introduced with great fanfare in 2007, the A380 was marketed to airlines as a new industry flagship that would help relieve congestion at the world’s busiest aviation hubs while restoring cruise-ship style glamour to intercontinental air travel. More than 500 seats can be packed into the A380’s two decks, and several airlines have capitalized on its generous proportions to introduce lavish amenities for its first-class passengers, including opulent lounges, health spas and “apartments” equipped with double beds and private showers."

Airbus launches A380-focused flight search engine - Runway Girl Network,"Mon, 11 Jul 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTYvMDcvYWlyYnVzLWEzODAtaWZseWEzODAtZm9jdXNlZC1mbGlnaHQtc2VhcmNoLWVuZ2luZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A new player is joining the online travel search engine business and it is a most unlikely candidate. Airbus will launch its iflya380 web site this week (it is expected to go live on 13 July), hoping to capitalize on what the airframer sees as strong customer preference for travel on the super jumbo A380 aircraft.

In advance of the launch, Airbus today provided a preview of the search engine’s portal to media at the Farnborough Airshow, demonstrated its capabilities and talked about the justification for the project.

The new site is not just about A380 routes or destinations, though those details drive its underlying operation. Selecting a flight in the search results brings up content that is focused on inflight amenities, in addition to the flight duration and price. Of course, the results are limited to routes that offer A380 service, either non-stop or via a connection.

“We have witnessed a true appetite for the [A380] aircraft. The silence and space of the cabin is making it unique for competing in the airline space for something that is not fare only, for the experience. We are answering passenger demand to make sure that they can select the cabin they want which is the A380 today,” explained Airbus digital transformation officer Marc Fontaine in today’s briefing.

For those travelers who feel a sense of wanderlust but do not have a specific destination in mind, the iflya380 site offers up what the company calls “inspirational information about each city” to go with the list of all the A380 routes and operators available. For those who prefer to fly with a specific airline, the site presents all 13 A380 operators and allows travelers to see the cabin amenities and routes available. And if it’s just aeroporn you’re after, there are photos from across social media channels with the #A380 hashtag on the site, too.

Ultimately Airbus does not particularly care which A380 route or airline a traveler chooses; it simply wants passengers to treat the aircraft type as their primary focus when shopping, a stiff challenge given that travelers typically pay attention to fare and schedule first. It is an uphill battle but the airframer is not alone in fighting for passengers to consider their comfort and overall #PaxEx first (and there is plenty of unscientific evidence to suggest that tech-savvy travelers are paying very close attention, and planning accordingly: see the comments section of this article on the 9-abreast 787).

Fortunately, even though travelers may be slow to adopt ‘aircraft-type first’ booking habits, Airbus was able to secure buy-in from its airline partners relatively easily. Stephane Dupont, the project lead, today described the offering as a “win-win for Airbus and the A380 operators”, and suggested that securing their participation was relatively easy.

We visited with the 13 operators and had the support of all of them. For Airbus it was new but for the airlines they are familiar with [metasearch engines]. For them it is an opportunity to showcase their product.

The underlying technology is built on the QPX search engine from Google’s ITA Software group. Bookings are handled directly through the operating airlines with deep-link click-through available on nine of the 13 carriers. Airbus is not looking to take a direct commission on the sales or otherwise participate financially in the process. The goal is simply to drive more A380 bookings and use that as a carrot to attract more airlines to the product while also helping passengers find those flights, something the airframer believes travelers are looking for and having trouble finding.

And, while it is possible for similar sites to be built for other aircraft types, Fontaine does not see that as likely, at least for now, noting, “We think that the A380 has a unique value proposition.”"
India Cancels Deal for Six Airbus Tankers - Defense News,"Fri, 29 Jul 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS9haXIvMjAxNi8wNy8yOS9pbmRpYS1jYW5jZWxzLWRlYWwtZm9yLXNpeC1haXJidXMtdGFua2Vycy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"NEW DELHI — India has withdrawn the tender for a much-awaited contract for the purchase of six multi-role tanker transport (MRTT) aircraft with Airbus Defence and Space, worth more than $1 billion, on grounds of the planes' high operational cost.



This is the second MRTT aircraft global tender to be cancelled by the ministry of defense since 2006.



""We have [recently] cancelled the MRTT deal with Airbus because platforms are too expensive and not economically viable to operate"", said an MoD official who declined to be identified.



""We have examined this deal very carefully and the [budgetary] approval has been rejected thrice by the Indian finance ministry,"" the MoD official said.

""This is indeed a setback to us, as we want the MRTT aircraft desperately, and a fresh [global] procurement will take at least five more years"", said a senior air force official said who requested anonymity.

The A330 MRTT came out on top of a Russian offering twice in the technical evaluation and, according to the air service, would have proven comparatively economical to operate over its lifespan.



Airbus Defence and Space executives here were unavailable for comments.

Airbus lands $12.6B AirAsia deal | Arkansas Democrat Gazette - Arkansas Online,"Wed, 13 Jul 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFya2Fuc2Fzb25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMTYvanVsLzEzL2FpcmJ1cy1sYW5kcy0xMi02Yi1haXJhc2lhLWRlYWwtMjAxNjA3MS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Group SE left Boeing Co. trailing on the second day of the 2016 Farnborough International Air Show after landing a $12.6 billion jetliner deal from AirAsia Bhd.

The order may prove a knockout blow in the competition for contracts at the year's biggest aviation expo.

AirAsia, the Malaysian discount carrier, signed a firm agreement Tuesday to buy 100 A321neos in a deal that swells its already-record order tally for Airbus' single-aisle family to 575 aircraft, 170 of which are already in the fleet.

After an accord to sell 72 A320neos to Go Airlines India Pvt., the deal takes Airbus' Farnborough tally to 223 aircraft valued at $28.3 billion. That's more than double the 121 orders worth $13.7 billion at Boeing, excluding the signing of final terms on a 747 deal already announced.

Boeing had earlier taken a lead over Toulouse, France-based Airbus with a spate of morning accords involving carriers in China and tour operator TUI AG.

The U.S. company agreed to provide an unidentified Chinese client with 30 737 single-aisle jets it said would be a mix of the current model and the re-engined Max version, worth more than $3 billion at list prices. It also secured a deal to supply Kunming Airlines with 10 Max 7s valued at $902 million after saying Monday the jet would get more seats to help spur sales.

In Europe, TUI agreed to convert options on 10 Max 8s into firm orders worth $1.1 billion, and will also add another 787-9 Dreamliner to its fleet, valued at $265 million. Boeing also sealed terms on 20 747-8 freighters with Russia's Volga-Dnepr Group, though the deal isn't new and some of the planes have already been delivered.

Tuesday morning, before the announcement of the mammoth AirAsia order, Airbus revealed a pending deal with Berlin-based Germania for 25 A320neo narrow-bodies -- the main rival to the Max -- with a total list price $2.68 billion. In the early afternoon, it announced a four-plane accord for A321s from Iceland's Wow, followed by the $7.73 billion GoAir deal. The AirAsia haul is the event's biggest contract to date.

Economic growth is driving demand for new routes in Asia. The trend is prompting low-cost operators that have already amassed large order backlogs to add even more planes.

""The Asia Pacific is going to account for at least a third of all aircraft demand over the next 20 years"" based on planemakers' forecasts, said Simon Elsegood, an analyst at CAPA Centre for Aviation in Sydney. ""There's particularly strong demand for intra-regional connectivity in Southeast Asia and North Asia, and then there's very, very strong demand within China itself for domestic flights.""

The bulk of deals at Farnborough and the Paris show with which it alternates come on the first two business days, though more announcements are possible today.

Boeing's orders on the expo's first day were also dominated by China, with Xiamen Airlines agreeing to take 30 Max 200s, a high-density version of the Max 8, with a value of $3.39 billion, and Donghai Airlines signing an outline deal for 25 Max 8s worth $2.75 billion and five 787-9s priced at $1.32 billion.

The leasing arm of Standard Chartered Plc also bought 10 current generation 737-800s valued at $960 million it said were destined for ""northeast Asia.""

Airbus' first day was marked by Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd. signing a long-awaited deal for 12 A350-1000s valued at $4.4 billion, including four to be sourced from Air Lease Corp. Air Lease separately announced orders for three A350-900s and an A321, and Jetstar Pacific of Vietnam signed an outline accord for 10 current-generation A320s.

Airbus said Tuesday it sees lower production for its A380, the world's biggest passenger plane.

The company said it expects to deliver 12 of the planes per year starting in 2018, down from 27 in 2015.

Airbus has delivered 193 of the A380s, which can carry more than 500 passengers. But demand has been soft lately, and airlines including Air France-KLM indicated they don't plan to take all the A380s they have ordered.

The company said the plane will be needed to handle growing passenger traffic at congested airports. But it said that reducing production is a prudent step in view of current order trends.

Airbus said it reached break-even financially at 27 deliveries last year and hopes to cut production costs to lower its break-even point.

Airbus Is Running Out of Buyers for Its Enormous A380s - Bloomberg,"Thu, 07 Jul 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDE2LTA3LTA4L2FpcmJ1cy1pcy1ydW5uaW5nLW91dC1vZi1idXllcnMtZm9yLWl0cy1lbm9ybW91cy1hMzgwc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Since its commercial introduction in 2007, the Airbus A380 has brought a long-lost sense of glamour back to travel. Its first-class cabins feature private showers and buttery leather armchairs. It sports in-flight lounges where bartenders mix bespoke cocktails. A broad staircase reminiscent of a 1920s ocean liner links the two decks. Financially speaking, it’s a disaster of similarly grand proportions.

An initial flood of interest from airlines has turned into a slow drip, and Airbus is leaning heavily on one customer, Emirates , for sales. Not a single U.S. carrier has bought one, and Japanese airlines, among the biggest cheerleaders for huge planes, have taken just a handful. Airbus has delivered 193 A380s—early on it predicted airlines would buy 1,200 supersize planes over two decades—and has only 126 in its order book, to be built over the next five years or so. Worse, many orders appear squishy, because airlines are shifting away from superjumbos. As the aviation world starts gathering on July 11 for the Farnborough International Airshow in England, where carriers often announce big orders, there’s little indication any A380 contract will be unveiled."

Airbus to cut back production of A380 aircraft - The Guardian,"Tue, 12 Jul 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDE2L2p1bC8xMi9haXJidXMtdG8tY3V0LWJhY2stcHJvZHVjdGlvbi1vZi1hMzgwLWFpcmNyYWZ00gFfaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMTYvanVsLzEyL2FpcmJ1cy10by1jdXQtYmFjay1wcm9kdWN0aW9uLW9mLWEzODAtYWlyY3JhZnQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus is to dramatically cut production of the A380 superjumbo, highlighting the lacklustre performance of the biggest passenger jet ever built.

The plane-maker aims to cut production to just 12 A380s in 2018, compared with 27 deliveries in 2015.

The announcement will raise concerns among staff at Broughton in north Wales, where Airbus makes the wings for the A380. It also threatens to cast a shadow over the Farnborough airshow for Airbus, which has attracted orders for its mid-sized A350 aircraft and its short-haul A320 family of jets.

The A380 had its first flight in 2005. At present, 193 planes are in service, with 319 ordered by airlines. However, demand for the plane has been lower than expected as airlines have focused on smaller, more fuel-efficient planes.

The plane was launched as a high-profile European project to rival Boeing’s 747. However, it has been dogged by problems. It ran billions of pounds over budget and years behind schedule. When the A380 went into service, a Qantas plane suffered an engine blow-out in mid-air. No one was hurt, but Airbus had to ground the fleet of A380s until it established what was wrong with the Rolls-Royce engines.

There has been speculation that Airbus could scrap the project, although the latest announcement secures its short-term future.

Cutting production to just 12 aircraft could be financially damaging for Airbus. The Franco-German company broke even on the A380 last year when it delivered 27 planes and is aiming to achieve break even at 20 aircraft next year. Airbus said it will target “additional cost reduction initiatives” to lower the breakeven point further.

However, the decline in A380 is being offset by an increase in sales of the A350 and A320, which will reassure the company’s 15,000 UK staff.

Fabrice Brégier, chief executive of Airbus’s commercial aircraft division, said: “With this prudent, proactive step we are establishing a new target for our industrial planning, meeting current commercial demand but keeping all our options open to benefit from future A380 markets, which we consider in the environment of ongoing aviation growth and constrained airport capacity as a given.



“We are maintaining, innovating and investing in the A380, keeping the aircraft the favourite of passengers, the airlines and airports – today and in the future. The A380 is here to stay.”"
Virgin Atlantic buys Airbus A350 to be its 'future flagship' - USA TODAY,"Mon, 11 Jul 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS90cmF2ZWwvZmxpZ2h0cy90b2RheWludGhlc2t5LzIwMTYvMDcvMTEvdmlyZ2luLWF0bGFudGljLWZseS1haXJidXMtYTM1MC84Njk0MTE3Mi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Virgin Atlantic buys Airbus A350 to be its 'future flagship'

Virgin Atlantic will buy eight of Airbus’ new A350 widebody jets and plans to lease another four, calling the jet its “future flagship.”

The first of the A350-1000s will begin arriving to the carrier in 2019. The A350-1000 is the largest variant of the widebody jet, the newest in Airbus’ lineup of commercial passenger aircraft types. The first A350 -- the smaller -900 variant -- entered commercial service for the first time in January 2015.

The deal would be worth more than $4 billion at list prices, though airlines typically negotiate substantial discounts on such orders.

“The size of this order demonstrates our absolute focus on investing in the future for our customers and our people, and confirms the strength of our business,” Virgin Atlantic CEO Craig Kreeger says in a statement, adding “the A350-1000 plays a pivotal role in our fleet program.”

Virgin Atlantic's A350s will initially fly from its hub at London Heathrow in what the carrier calls an effort “to strengthen the trans-Atlantic network on existing business routes.” Virgin Atlantic will later expand A350 service to London Gatwick for leisure-oriented routes to the Caribbean.

Virgin Atlantic owner RIchard Branson tells The Wall Street Journal that the new A350-1000s will largely go toward phasing out the airline's aging Boeing 747s.

Reuters writes ""Kreeger said the airline still had options over six A380 jets and continued to consider that aircraft for its fleet in future,"" though there's industry observers are skeptical that Virgin Atlantic will ever fly that aircraft.

The A350 order was announced Monday during the first day of the Farnborough Airshow near London. The week-long show alternates years with the Paris Airshow and is one of the biggest annual events in the aviation industry.

The announcement of splashy aircraft deals have been common at the Paris and Farnborough shows in recent years. But industry observers predict 2016 will be a spartan year for the the big blockbuster orders that have come to define previous shows.

Another common theme at the airshows has been the rivalry over airline deals between Europe’s Airbus and U.S. jetmaker Boeing.

Airbus touted its deal to sell the A350 to Virgin Atlantic, a development that comes less than two years after Virgin Atlantic began flying its first models of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner.

“This agreement allows Virgin Atlantic to set the standard on its network by being amongst the first airlines into service with the A350-1000, with an Airspace by Airbus cabin, offering superior comfort including industry leading 18"" wide seats in‎ economy,” Airbus CEO Fabrice Brégier says in a statement. “These modern, efficient A350s will complement Virgin Atlantic’s existing fleet of 10 A330-300s and offer Virgin Atlantic crews the advantage of familiarity with Airbus operating procedures around the network”

The 787 is one of Boeing’s direct competitors to the A350.

""It is safe to call (the 787) a flagship aircraft for Virgin Atlantic,"" Kreeger told Today in the Sky in October 2014 as the airline prepared to put its first Dreamliner into service.

F-35 to Tap Airbus for Data Protection Technology - Defense News,"Sun, 10 Jul 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS9kaWdpdGFsLXNob3ctZGFpbGllcy9mYXJuYm9yb3VnaC8yMDE2LzA3LzEwL2YtMzUtdG8tdGFwLWFpcmJ1cy1mb3ItZGF0YS1wcm90ZWN0aW9uLXRlY2hub2xvZ3kv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LONDON - British F-35s will use Airbus technology to help store, distribute and protect encrypted information on the combat jet when it comes into operation in 2018.

Airbus Defence and Space has secured a deal to supply what's known as local key management system (LKMS) technology for the strike aircraft and two other British military aircraft types – the Voyager A330 inflight refuelling jet and Hercules C-130J airlifters – in a deal recently struck with the British Ministry of Defence.

The deal could open the door to sales of the technology to a restricted list of other air forces, including F-35 customers.

""I see no reason why we cannot offer this technology to other F-35 users,"" said Phil Jones, the head of cyber security operations for Airbus Defence in the UK.

The high sensitivity of the ITAR-free technology may mean Airbus will have to develop an export version for all but a handful of countries,he said.

Airbus is already supplying the technology, developed at its south Wales facility, to British Typhoon combat jets and A400M airlifters.

LKMS receives, translates and packages cryptographic keys so that they can be loaded using a single hand held device into what are known as end crypto units (ECUs) on the aircraft. Input of the crypto information is through a single plug and socket rather than the seven or eight interface points and different handheld devices required previously.

Company officials said the technology permits prolonged out-of-area operation through providing the ability to store and distribute multiple cryptographic keys.

The technology also provides high levels of protection for encrypted data by preventing data compromise that could threaten the safety and security of an aircraft mission, they said.

The crypto technology is likely to eventually find it's way on to helicopters, unmanned air vehicles and other platforms, but company officials were unwilling to comment on potential discussion with the UK MoD about adding the technology to other aircraft. It did however confirm initial conversations with the MoD about the technology's suitability for the new Boeing P-8 maritime patrol aircraft being purchased for the Royal Air Force.

Jones said the use of technology is not just confined to aerospace applications.

""The technology has maritime applications in surface ships and submarines and we are in the early stages of looking at it for critical infrastructure and industrial control systems use as well,"" he said.

"Netherlands, Luxembourg Pitch In Two Airbus Tankers For NATO Fleet - Defense News","Thu, 28 Jul 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE2LzA3LzI4L25ldGhlcmxhbmRzLWx1eGVtYm91cmctcGl0Y2gtaW4tdHdvLWFpcmJ1cy10YW5rZXJzLWZvci1uYXRvLWZsZWV0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LONDON — A deal to equip NATO with a fleet of A330 MRTT air-to-air refueling aircraft has been signed by Airbus and OCCAR, the European organization that manages cooperative weapons programs.

Two of the multi-role aircraft have been purchased by the Netherlands and Luxembourg in what is hoped will become a pooling and sharing arrangement, which would also include Belgium, Germany, Norway and Poland.

The Dutch Ministry of Defence (MoD), which is largely bankrolling the initial procurement of aircraft, informed the Parliament in The Hague on July 28 that it had signed a memorandum of understanding with Luxembourg to proceed with the procurement of the two aircraft.

At the same time, OCCAR — operating on behalf of the NATO Support & Procurement Agency — struck a deal with Airbus Defence and Space for the delivery of two aircraft with options for up to six more if other nations join the Multinational MRTT Fleet (MMF) program.

The first two aircraft have been purchased by the Netherlands and Luxembourg but will be the property of NATO.

Poland, Norway and the Netherlands announced in December 2014 they were opening negotiations with Airbus to acquire four A330 aircraft. But to date only the Netherlands among the mainstream military nations interested in the capability has signed up.

A European Defence Agency spokesman said that while the Dutch were now ready to sign, the other nations were not at that stage yet.

""We expect more positive news around October or November [on other nations signing up],"" he said.

Some NATO members already have a similar arrangement to pool Boeing Sentry airborne early warning aircraft assets, and earlier this year 15 countries agreed to purchase five Northrop Grumman Global Hawk UAV as part of it's Alliance Ground Surveillance system.

Until the MMF is expanded, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, which doesn't have an air force, will have exclusive user rights, the Dutch MoD said.

The aircraft will be stationed at the Dutch base at Eindoven, and delivery will begin in 2020 — in parallel with the Royal Dutch Air Force decommissioning the two KDC-10 tankers it presently has in service.

The new multi-role aircraft will also help ease capability shortages in cargo lift and troop transport in Europe.

""The purchase of the A330 is an important contribution in addressing the scarce tanker and transport capability of the European Union in particular,"" the Dutch MoD said.

A study is to be carried out to see whether the European Air Transport Command (EATC), which is also stationed at Eindoven, would supervise the operations of the MRTT aircraft, the Dutch ministry said.

Established in 2010, ETAC pools and shares the air transport and air-to-air refueling assets of seven European nations. The group includes the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany and Luxembourg; but Poland and Norway, who may yet sign up for MMF, are not members of ETAC.

The deal to acquire the A330 comes nearly five years after the European Defence Agency, an arm of the European Union, initiated the program to establish an air-to-air refueling capability among allies in the region as a priority.

The move followed NATO's Libyan air campaign against the Gaddafi regime, which showed up the shortfall in air-to-air tanking across most European alliance members. The US provided 80 percent of the tanking missions during the campaign.

Britain and France are the only European NATO nations with substantial fleets of tanker aircraft. Italy operates four modified 767 tankers.

The British already operate the A330 MRTT, and France is under contract with Airbus to buy a fleet of the jets beginning 2018 to replace its aging Boeing aircraft.

The Dutch MoD said in a statement they were examining the possibility of collaborating with the UK and France on training and maintenance of their jets.

"Airbus set for Virgin, Germania order boosts at Farnborough - CNBC","Mon, 11 Jul 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMTYvMDcvMTEvYWlyYnVzLXNldC1mb3ItdmlyZ2luLWdlcm1hbmlhLW9yZGVyLWJvb3N0cy1hdC1mYXJuYm9yb3VnaC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus is set to announce a key order for 8-10 of its biggest twin-engined model, the A350-1000, from Virgin Atlantic after beating Boeing to a scarce order for big jets as economic and political uncertainties overshadow the Farnborough Airshow. The order, worth some $3 billion at list prices, could perk up Monday's opening of an event clouded by geopolitical uncertainty, including Britain's decision to leave the European Union and concerns over the state of the global economy.

British Prime Minister David Cameron will attend the opening day, where he is expected to finalise multi-billion dollar deals with Boeing to buy nine P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol planes and to upgrade 50 Apache helicopters.

Industry sources said Airbus's A350-1000 deal with Virgin Atlantic provided a shot in the arm to a 366-seat model promising greater efficiency but whose sales have slowed as Boeing develops a larger version of its 777, prompting a game of leapfrog between the only two makers of long-haul jets. Airbus declined to comment and Virgin Atlantic was not available to comment. Airbus and Boeing have enjoyed years of strong demand, helped by rising airline travel particularly in Asia and the Middle East and new, more fuel-efficient planes. But with the industry's order backlog standing at a record 13,500 planes at the end of 2015, or 9.6 years of production at current rates, analysts are worried that economic risks - from slowing growth in China to Britain's move to leave the EU - could see orders dry up and some even cancelled.

watch now

Larger, more expensive twin-aisle planes are likely to be most at risk. Indeed, industry sources said Virgin Atlantic, which has long deferred an order for six of Airbus's A380 superjumbos, looked set to finally cancel it. The head of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, Ray Conner, said the company was facing slower demand for wide-body jets and would be vigilant about matching supply to demand, though it was too early to say whether it would again cut output of its 777.

Single-aisle competition

Separately, industry sources said privately held German airline Germania was close to placing an order with Airbus for around 25 A320-family jets, worth over $2.5 billion.

That deal for Airbus's top-selling single-aisle plane, if confirmed, would also be a disappointment to Boeing, which is trying to wrestle back such customers after losing market share.

Germania operates both Airbus and Boeing jets but has said it aims to harmonise its fleet by switching to all-Airbus aircraft when it takes older Boeing 737-700s out of service.

Germania officials could not immediately be reached for comment. An Airbus spokesman said: ""We do not comment on confidential talks which may or may not be happening with our customers."" Among other potential deals at Farnborough, Boeing is expected to firm up at least part of a deal for up to 20 747-8 freighters from Russia's Volga Dnepr, boosting its declining jumbo jet programme, and could announce a new Asian customer for its high-density 737 MAX 200 jet aimed at low-cost carriers. The U.S. company announced a preliminary deal with Volga Dnepr last year."

In January, LNC in its annual production rate forecast projected the A380 rate coming down to 12/yr by 2020. More recently Leeham Co. LLC told clients Airbus needed to figure out how to achieve a break-even at one a month (12/yr) and bring rates down sooner.

All this was based on the current backlog and customer quality.

Lower break even needed

In a press release issued after La Tribune’s report, Airbus aid it’s achieved break even at the rate of 20/yr in 2017. The company “targets additional cost reduction initiatives to lower the breakeven further,” it said.

Airbus is sticking to its plan to maintain production of the A380 until future traffic demand catches up to the size of the airplane. In the Global Market Forecast issued Monday by Airbus at the Air Show, the company is sticking with its long-held belief that the Very Large Aircraft market will support 1,500 Airbus and Boeing passenger and freight aircraft during the next 20 years. Boeing’s forecast, also released Monday, is a fraction of the Airbus forecast.

In a statement, Airbus Commercial CEO Fabrice Bregier said, “We are establishing a new target for our industrial planning, meeting commercial demand but keeping our options open to benefit from future A380 markets….”

Will there be a charge?

Airbus did not say if it will take a charge to the program. Officials are meeting Wednesday morning in London with investors.

The move was long seen coming. While some critics, such as consultant Richard Aboulafia of the USA’s Teal Group, believe the A380 is “dead,” Airbus believes the future airport constraints and congestion will prove demand for the aircraft.

Boeing’s competing 747-8I is doing poorly as well. Boeing insists the 747 has a future, but now talks of it as a freighter, not a passenger model.

Recognizing reality

The move recognizes reality of the current market, driven by necessity. It also gives Airbus time to decide whether to re-engine the airplane at a later date, a persistent request from Tim Clark, the president and COO of Emirates Airlines.

Airbus has been unwilling to commit to an A380neo. More recently, Clark expressed concern that Airbus will simply keep producing the airplane.

This rate reduction answers the question, at least for now.

The A380 may face additional challenges, however, should Boeing decide to proceed with a third member of the 777X family. The plane, already dubbed the 777-10 (though not by Boeing), would seat about 50 more passengers than the 777-9. Boeing is doing studies on the prospective -10 now.

Airbus Press Release

Airbus Targets Delivery of Twelve A380 Per Year From 2018

Airbus expects future traffic growth to drive demand

A380 only solution for sustainable growth

London, 12 July 2016 – In line with the current order intake, Airbus has decided to target 12 A380 deliveries per year from 2018.

“With this prudent, proactive step we are establishing a new target for our industrial planning, meeting current commercial demand but keeping all our options open to benefit from future A380 markets, which we consider in the environment of ongoing aviation growth and constrained airport capacity as a given,” says Fabrice Brégier, Airbus President & CEO. “We are maintaining, innovating and investing in the A380, keeping the aircraft the favourite of passengers, the airlines and airports – today and in the future. The A380 is here to stay!”

Airbus reached breakeven at 27 aircraft deliveries in 2015. The company will continue to improve the efficiency of its industrial system to achieve breakeven at 20 aircraft in 2017 and targets additional cost reduction initiatives to lower breakeven further.

With passenger traffic doubling every 15 years, the A380 is the one and only solution for sustainable growth at congested airports. Today, 18 global leading airlines have ordered a total of 319 A380s so far, building their brand with this flagship aircraft. The 193 megaliners that have been delivered to 13 operators serve over 100 routes on an ever expanding global network. Today every three minutes an A380 takes off or lands. In 2016, 14 aircraft have been delivered so far and underlines a stable production performance with the backlog standing at 126.

The 193 A380s in operation today are serving 38 of the 55 global aviation megacities (47 of which are either growth or schedule-constrained). The number of megacities will rise to 93 by 2035, serving 2.5 million daily passengers and 95%+ of long-haul traffic.

Passengers love the A380 and the aircraft is clearly the passengers’ aircraft of choice. Independent studies show that 60 percent of passengers make an extra effort to fly on the comfort-leading double-deck mega-liner. Airbus is supporting this distinctive travel behaviour through a new, unique IflyA380.com booking assistant launched at Farnborough Airshow this year. Operated in full partnership with the A380 airlines around the world the website enables passengers to prioritize and select the A380 when making their travel arrangements.

Airbus expects that based on the flexibility within the wider Airbus programme ramp up environment and also opportunities within other Airbus Group Divisions, the impacts on employment will be mitigated.

"Airbus Signs With Roketsan To Add Missiles, Bombs to C-295 - Defense News","Thu, 14 Jul 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZWZlbnNlbmV3cy5jb20vZGlnaXRhbC1zaG93LWRhaWxpZXMvZmFybmJvcm91Z2gvMjAxNi8wNy8xNC9haXJidXMtc2lnbnMtd2l0aC1yb2tldHNhbi10by1hZGQtbWlzc2lsZXMtYm9tYnMtdG8tYy0yOTUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"FARNBOROUGH, England — Airbus and Turkey's Roketsan have signed to arm Airbus' C-295 aircraft with laser-guided missiles and bombs, part of Airbus' drive to give the widely sold transport plane new roles.

The two firms signed a memorandum of understanding at the Farnborough International Airshow on Wednesday to team on the design, integration and testing of Roketsan weapons, including the 70mm laser-guided Cirit missile and the long-range, laser-guided L-UMTAS anti-tank missile, as well as the Teber laser-guided bomb.

""There is a clear opportunity for us to address the global requirement for a cost-effective, armed utility aircraft, and Roketsan's product range and proven expertise make them the obvious partner,"" said Airbus' head of military aircraft, Fernando Alonso.

The move forms part of Airbus' expansion program for the C-295, which is already used as a maritime patrol aircraft by four customers.

The next step is to introduce an electronic intelligence and communications intelligence version, as well as an aircraft with early-warning capabilities, said Fernando Ciria, Airbus' head of marketing for tactical airlifters and ISR.

Also on the list is a ground surveillance version for border control missions, with a radar offering ground moving target indicator and synthetic aperture radar functions yet to be selected, said Ciria.

""Some customers are also interested in strike capabilities,"" he said, adding that pylons now fitted for torpedoes on the maritime patrol versions would be used for the Roketsan munitions, with target designators also added.

To date, Airbus C-235 aircraft obtained from the Spanish Air Force have been turned into gunships by ATK for use by Jordan.

As further evidence of its move to extend the use of the C-295, Airbus used the air show to show off an aircraft rigged to provide in-flight refueling to other slow-moving aircraft or helicopters.

The roll-on, roll-off system contains 90 feet of tubing and a refueling basket, which can be extended from the open ramp at the rear of the aircraft, with the capacity to provide 6 tons of fuel, said Ciria.

New Airbus Site Helps You Easily Find A380 Flights - The Points Guy,"Mon, 18 Jul 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS8yMDE2LzA3L25ldy1haXJidXMtc2l0ZS1maW5kLWEzODAtZmxpZ2h0cy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus launched its first A380 in 2007, and since then, the company has built and delivered nearly 200 of the massive aircraft. Over this decade, it has fast become a passenger favorite — from Etihad's Apartment, to Singapore's business class and even Malaysia's economy cabin. It's safe to say that the largest commercial aircraft has built quite the large fan base.

If you're one of those fans — or want to try out the A380 for the first time — there haven't been any good options to find itineraries that specifically include flights operated by the A380. You could check Airbus' site listing the A380 routes, but you'd be on your own to find and book flight options. If you used ITA Matrix's advanced routing codes to restrict flight options to only A380 flights, you wouldn't be successful at finding fares if you needed to make a connection before or after your A380 flight.

Quickly and easily find A380 flight options through Airbus' new I Fly A380 website.

Airbus has now solved this issue with its new I Fly A380 website. In addition to having information and photos of the A380 — in case you need to be sold on the benefits of this aircraft — this website helps you easily find A380 flight options and includes a link to book the itinerary you find.

We tested the website to make sure it's coming up with the best options and fares — checking nonstop, one-stop and two-stop options. The I Fly A380 website found the cheapest published fares on each of the sample itineraries we checked. Although there were slightly less expensive options found through Momondo, beware that some of the OTAs (Online Travel Agencies) that Momondo links to have quite poor customer satisfaction ratings.

I Fly A380 quickly found A380 options for my sample search of Austin (AUS) to Zurich (ZRH).

While the I Fly A380 website will give you the cheapest A380 fares, you should check flight options on Google Flights so you know how much extra you're paying to fly the A380.

For example, when I searched Austin (AUS) to Zurich (ZRH) in October, I Fly A380 presented a decent $795 round-trip option. This itinerary included flying Air France A380s both ways across the Atlantic, but the itinerary required two stops each way. When I checked Google Flights for the same dates, I found non-A380 options starting at $680 round-trip with only one stop. In this example, make sure you're okay with paying the $115 premium and making extra stops to fly the A380.

Airbus A380 orders from airlines haven't taken off, so Airbus is using tools like I Fly A380 to drive more A380 bookings. Image courtesy of Toulouse's tourism office.

Airbus has seen a sharp drop in A380 orders from airlines, even threatening the future of the A380 program. When I toured the A380 production facility in Hamburg earlier this month, it was eerily quiet. Some A380 factory space had even been re-purposed for the much more popular A320 family of aircraft.

Now back to the tool, we noticed that the this Airbus website wisely links you directly to the operating airline's website for you to book your A380 tickets. Unfortunately, not all of these links worked during our testing, requiring manual searching and finding the A380 options on the airline's website.

I Fly A380 has a special landing page for each A380 destination and airline.

If you're looking for more detail on just one A380 destination or airline, the website has a landing page for each of the 56 destinations served by A380s and the 13 carriers currently utilizing A380s.

airspace by airbus cabin concept: committed to passenger experience

an innovative new concept in jetliner cabins was was spotted at farnborough international airshow 2016 this week with the ‘airspace by airbus’ brand, bringing together an enhanced technological experience for passengers and optimum performance for airlines based on four dimensions: comfort, ambience, service and design.

introduced with airbus’ super-widebody ‘A330neo’, airspace cabins offer a more relaxing, attractive and functional environment for travellers and optimises the use of cabin space for operators.

‘the A380 already offers the best comfort of any aircraft, and the A320 is the top in its single-aisle category,’ explained kiran rao, executive vice president of airbus’ marketing + strategy. ‘airspace is another step forward, reflecting our decision to bring consistency on our two best-selling widebody aircraft: the A350 XWB and A330neo’.



passengers find themselves comfortable in the cabin

signature design elements recognisable throughout all airspace cabins include wider seats; larger overhead storage bins; spacious, contemporary lavatories with antibacterial surfaces; along with unobstructed under-seat foot space. other features are a unique and customisable welcome area at the main passenger boarding door, the latest in LED technology for ambient lighting, as well as clean shapes and surfaces throughout the interior.



the interior has an open, welcoming appearance with LED lighting

features for operators include a range of new galley/lavatory options such as modular ‘space-flex’ to maximise trolley capacity, wheelchair-accessible lavatory configurations to suit individual airline requirements, and freeing up of main deck space to allow for additional seating.



all seats are wider in the aircraft concept

‘such signature details and iconic elements will add to passengers’ enjoyment of flight, while offering a flexible canvas to which the airlines can project their own brand’, rao concluded.

Airbus Is Using Drones to Inspect Airplanes - Fortune,"Fri, 15 Jul 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAxNi8wNy8xNS9haXJidXMtaW50ZWwtZHJvbmVzLWFpcnBsYW5lLWluc3BlY3Rpb24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Drones are potentially dangerous to commercial airplanes if they happen to collide. But in some cases, drones can also be helpful to planes and the companies that make them.

Airbus (AIRBUS-GROUP-N-V) showed off this week at the Farnborough International Airshow in England how it uses drones to inspect airplanes.

The aircraft manufacturer outfitted the drone with a camera so it could take pictures of one of its airplanes and look for scratches, dents, and other damages. Airbus can then use those images to construct a 3D digital model of the plane that the company said can help prevent and reduce additional airplane damage.

“The use of this new technology offers better working conditions including improving the safety and comfort for the quality inspectors,” Airbus head of quality Nathalie Ducombeau said in a statement.

Ducombeau explained in a video demonstration that using the drone to take pictures instead of a human inspector cuts down the inspection time from two hours to 10 to 15 minutes.

Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.

She said that once Airbus is finished testing its drone inspection program for its A350 aircraft, which should conclude by year’s end, the company plans to expand the drone testing to its A330 aircraft in early 2017. Airbus wants to use drones to test its entire family of airplanes, Ducombeau explained.

Drone company Ascending Technologies, which Intel (INTC) bought for an undisclosed amount in January, built the AscTec Falcon 8 drone that Airbus used for its test program. The drone was outfitted with Intel’s RealSense 3D camera technology that enables drones to avoid obstacles and navigate surroundings.

“This collaboration and demo with Airbus showcases the advancements and innovation Intel brings to the drone industry,” Anil Nanduri, a vice president and general manager of Intel’s new technology group, said in a statement.

Although the drone flew autonomously, a human drone operator monitored the testing process.

In May, Airbus Group CEO Tom Enders told the Wall Street Journal that the airliner wants to become a leading company in the drone industry and plans to roll out more drone-related projects.

Airbus Patented an Aircraft to Carry Other Planes Up Above the Clouds - Popular Mechanics,"Mon, 25 Jul 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvcHVsYXJtZWNoYW5pY3MuY29tL2ZsaWdodC9hMjIwMjkvYWlyYnVzLXBhdGVudC1jYXJyeS1vdGhlci1wbGFuZXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Concept art of the Airbus Zephyr S (bottom) and Zephyr T (top), High Altitude Pseudo-Satellites (HAPS) powered by solar panels that would fly above commercial air traffic for months at a time to provide communication and surveying services.

Flying up in the stratosphere is great. It offers thin air where planes can cruise with less drag and turbulence, which makes this layer of the atmosphere the perfect place for a light, unmanned aircraft to operate for long periods of time. But it's tough for planes to get up that high in the first place. The stratosphere starts at about 30,000 feet, and climbing that high in a plane puts large mechanical demands on the aircraft, requiring a reinforced airframe and a lot of engine power.

Airbus recently filed a patent for a type of carrier aircraft, known as a high-altitude platform system, that could transport heavier planes with more equipment up above 60,000 feet and deposit them there. The advantage to this strategy is that the aircraft deposited by the carrier platform would not need the thrust capabilities required to reach the stratosphere on its own, allowing it to carry more science and communications payloads.

Some aerospace companies, including Airbus, are working on plans to put unmanned aircraft up in the stratosphere that would operate for months or even years on end, conducting research or offering utilities similar to satellites. Solar drones make sense for this purpose, but an aircraft powered by solar panels needs to be incredibly light to ascend up into the placid stratosphere.

Airbus's patent is fairly vague, describing multiple options for an auxiliary aircraft that could attach to the top, bottom, or sides of the primary aircraft. The design of the carrier would depend on the aircraft that is being carried, so it will likely be some time before we know how Airbus plans to move forward with these ideas.

In one of their fun and goofy videos, PatentYogi imagines the auxiliary aircraft carrying what looks like a space zeppelin up into the stratosphere and deploying it there.

This isn't an entirely new idea. Aerospace company Scaled Composites is currently developing a massive aircraft to carry SpaceX rockets up into the atmosphere where they could then launch to space after being dropped, requiring less fuel. When launching something requires a lot of fuel, the best way to make it more efficient is apparently to add another airplane.

Airbus DS Prepares To Sign Contract for 2-Year Drone Study - Defense News,"Mon, 11 Jul 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS9pbmR1c3RyeS8yMDE2LzA3LzExL2FpcmJ1cy1kcy1wcmVwYXJlcy10by1zaWduLWNvbnRyYWN0LWZvci0yLXllYXItZHJvbmUtc3R1ZHkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Airbus Defence and Space expects to sign this month a contract for a two-year definition study for a European medium-altitude long-endurance (MALE) drone, seen as a key capability for four partner countries, according to Jana Rosenmaan, the head of the company's unmanned aerial systems division.

Airbus DS, Dassault and Leonardo-Finmeccanica, who are partners in the initiative, are ""well on track"" for a contract in July, she told reporters June 20 in Munich.

The study opens the door to discuss with France, Germany and Italy their operational needs, draw up a cost/benefit analysis, and draft specifications to prepare for a potential launch of the development phase.

There is ""harmony"" between the industrial partners, she said.

OCCAR, the European procurement agency, will sign the definition contract, a followup to the May 2015 signing of a declaration of intent by the three prospective client countries.

The key missions will be intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance, with the study exploring issues such as single or twin engine, jet or propeller, and specific options. The definition work is due to deliver the system requirement and preliminary design for a program seen as critical for securing European political sovereignty.

Germany will take the lead role for the MALE UAV, formerly named MALE 2020, with Berlin holding a 31 percent stake with funding of €18.6 million (US $20.5 million) for the definition work, Germany's Federal Ministry of Defence said in December. Spain joins as a partner, with France, Italy and the former each contributing €13.8 million. Development cost is estimated at some €1 billion.

Airbus DS has canceled its development work on Tanan, a vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) drone aimed at navies, following a company review of UAV projects, Rosenmaan said. Airbus DS and Airbus Helicopter will partner to draw up a new proposal and pitch that to the market.

Tanan, which was the product of two years' company work, was effectively too costly for the French Navy, too light and too sophisticated, website Le Journal de l'Aviation reported.

The company will draw on lessons learned on Tanan and pursue work on a VTOL drone with Airbus Helicopter, exploring market requirements that might lead to a heavier aircraft carrying more weapons and payload, an industry source said. Airbus DS worked on Tanan with DCNS, a naval systems company.

Airbus DS is developing a twin-tail ""T"" version of its Zephyr high-altitude pseudo-satellite, which aims to boost payload to 20 kilograms from the 5 kilograms on the single-tail ""S"" model, Rosenmaan said. The British Ministry of Defence has ordered two of the ""S"" versions, with an option for a third. A demonstration flight is due in 2017.

A twin-tail model boosts solar energy power, increasing options for payload and range.

The Bombardier C-Series is Airbus and Boeing's greatest threat - Business Insider,"Mon, 18 Jul 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vYm9tYmFyZGllci1jc2VyaWVzLWFpcmJ1cy1ib2VpbmctdGhyZWF0LWVudGVyLXNlcnZpY2Utc3dpc3MtMjAxNi030gFmaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9ib21iYXJkaWVyLWNzZXJpZXMtYWlyYnVzLWJvZWluZy10aHJlYXQtZW50ZXItc2VydmljZS1zd2lzcy0yMDE2LTc_YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Swiss Bombardier CS100. Swiss

Bombardier's long-awaited C-Series entered service with Swiss Global Airlines on Friday.

The state-of-the-art Canadian airliner opened its career with a short flight from Zurich to Paris.

The Swiss Global Bombardier is the first of 30 C-Series jets the airline has on order, split evenly between the smaller CS100 and the larger CS300.

""I am extremely proud that we are the first airline in the world to put this totally newly developed aircraft into service,"" Swiss Global's Chief Commercial Officer Markus Binkert said in a statement. ""The Bombardier CS100 is a class act in every respect: comfort, economics, and environmental credentials.""

According to Airways Mag Managing Editor Chris Sloan, the CS100's first flight with Swiss went flawlessly, apart from a slight delay caused by a glitch while switching from ground power to onboard electricity. Passengers were served a snack of trout mousse and black forest roulade, reported Sloan, who was on the 54-minute flight.

Swiss Global's Bombardier CS100 is outfitted with 101 seats (30 business-class and 71 economy-class) and will be replacing the airline's aging Avro RJ100 regional jets.

The Bombardier C-Series is positioned to compete against the two best-selling airliners of all time — the Airbus A320 family and the Boeing 737 family. Capable of ferrying between 100 and 150 passengers, the Canadian jet is the most viable threat Airbus and Boeing have encountered in 20 years.

Over the the next few years, several manufacturers from around the world will launch aircraft aimed to compete with Airbus and Boeing. But Bombardier is the first to enter service and the only one that will compete head-to-head within one of their most important market segments.

Not since the demise of McDonnell Douglas and its MD-80 and MD-90 in the late '90s has there been a third major player to challenge the Airbus-Boeing duopoly. (McDonnell Douglas was purchased by Boeing for $13 billion in 1997.)

With the C-Series, Bombardier is poised to do just that. However, the Quebec-based firm has a long way to go. Currently, Bombardier has more than 300 firm orders for the plane, while Airbus and Boeing each have backlogs with 10 times that amount for their latest A320 and 737 variants.

What Bombardier has going for it is the fact that the C-Series is widely viewed as a great plane — receiving critical acclaim for its fuel efficiency, range, and advanced technology.

""The CS300 kills the Boeing 737 MAX 7 and the Airbus A319neo in terms of ability and efficiency,"" Airways senior business analyst Vinay Bhaskara told Business Insider in an interview last year.

Swiss

Unfortunately, Bombardier has also been plagued by development and financial setbacks caused by the multibillion-dollar C-Series program. At the same time, the company struggled to find buyers for the state-of-the-art jet — especially among the world's A-list airlines.

With the CS100 in service, a major commitment from Air Canada, and a $5.6 billion order from Delta, things are looking up for Bombardier.

Air Canada and Delta's show of support for the aircraft and its manufacturer should allay the fears of smaller customers who are hesitant to buy because of Bombardier's precarious financial condition.

In addition, the CS300 is expected to be delivered to AirBaltic by the end of the year."

- Launched in 1995 - Originally meant to last 2 years, will operate at least until December 2016 - Mission: To study the Sun and help predict space weather - Airbus Defence and Space led the team that built the SOHO spacecraft

In 1995, SOHO, the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, set out to study the Sun and the solar wind. Originally a two-year long joint missionbetween NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA), it has been operational for more than 20 years.

SOHO has been monitoring the Sun with 11 different instruments from a vantage point 1.5 million km out in space, on the sunward side of the Earth. It has brought about a revolution in solar science. Apart from discoveries about flows of gas inside the sun, giant 'tornadoes' of hot, electrically charged gas, and clashing magnetic field-lines, SOHO has proved its worth with early warning of eruptions that could affect the Earth’s climate.

Researchers came close to losing the spacecraft, built by Airbus Defence and Space-led team, in June 1998, after a sequence of incorrect commands during what should have been a routine maneuver. SOHO was in the wrong position to receive communications from Earth and not responding to commands.

It took about three months to recover and the spacecraft lost two gyroscopes responsible for attitude control. The remaining gyroscope failed a few weeks later, forcing mission managers to develop a new way of keeping SOHO stable. The observatory has operated flawlessly ever since, delivering images and data that have substantially advanced our understanding of the Sun and the solar-terrestrial relationship.

SOHO’s mission has been extended once again to December 2016. When its work is done, it will be followed by Solar Orbiter. This new spacecraft, which is being built by Airbus Defence and Space, is expected to take mankind closer to the Sun than any space probe to date."

- Spacecraft launched in 2004 - Mission extended to September 2016 - Mission goal to unlock the mysteries of comets - Airbus Defence and Space led the industrial team that built Rosetta

The European Space Agency (ESA) has extended its Rosetta mission by nine months to 30 September 2016, when it perform a controlled descent down to the surface of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko.

Rosetta, built by Airbus Defence and Space-led industrial team, was launched in 2004. Ten years later and after a journey of six billion kilometres, it reached comet 67P.

The small lander Philae lost power just 60 hours after landing in in a canyon in late 2014 where sunlight could not reach its solar panels to generate power. However, the data it collected during its first days included carbon and nitrogen-rich compounds, suggesting that complex processes and the building blocks for life were present in the early solar system.

Rosetta watched the comet’s increasing activity as it made its closest approach to the Sun on 13 August 2015. Continuing the study in the year following perihelion is giving scientists a fuller picture of how the comet’s activity waxes and wanes along its 6.5-year long orbit.

“By comparing detailed ‘before and after’ data, we will have a much better understanding of how comets evolve during their lifetimes,” says Matt Taylor, Rosetta’s Project Scientist.

During the extended mission, the team will carry out some new and potentially riskier investigations, including flights across the night-side of the comet to observe the plasma, dust, and gas interactions in this region as well as to collect dust samples ejected close to the nucleus.

As the comet 67P moves away from the inner Solar System towards the orbit of Jupiter, the amount of light falling on Rosetta's solar panels is gradually diminishing. As a consequence, it has less power day by day to run its instruments and sub-systems.

Engineers put the satellite into hibernation mode for 31 months in 2011 on the most distant leg of its journey away from the Sun. But with Rosetta’s much-reduced fuel load, it makes little sense to place it into hibernation again.

The landing, on the other hand, offers the opportunity to gather unique data at unprecedentedly close distances.

In August the operations team will make the first trajectory changes to put the spacecraft in a series of elliptical orbits where the closest approach gets nearer and nearer to the comet surface. “Planning this phase is in fact far more complex than it was for Philae’s landing,” says Sylvain Lodiot, ESA Rosetta spacecraft operations manager. “The last six weeks will be particularly challenging as we fly eccentric orbits around the comet – in many ways this will be even riskier than the final descent itself.

The final few months of the mission promise to be the most exciting as Rosetta gets close enough to make unique and dangerous measurements, including very-high-resolution imaging, increasing the science return of this inspiring mission.

Airbus Helicopters and Mahindra Group are proposing the Panther for India’s Naval Utility Helicopter programme

Airbus Helicopters has awarded a contract to Mahindra Aerostructures to make airframe parts for the AS565 MBe Panther. These parts will be produced at the Mahindra facility in Bengaluru. They will be shipped directly to the Airbus Helicopter production line in Marignane, France where they will be integrated with the rest of the airframe assembly and will form a critical part of the Panthers sold worldwide.The contract positions Mahindra Aerostructures as the first Indian company to receive adirect manufacturing contract from Airbus Helicopters as a Tier 1 supplier. MahindraAerostructures will gradually emerge as the global single source supplier to AirbusHelicopters for these parts. This work package is the first amongst a series of work packages which would embed Mahindra Group firmly in the Airbus Helicopters’ global supply chain and bind the two companies in a long-term ‘Make in India’ partnership.“We are playing an active role in the development of a helicopter-focused Indian industrial eco-system, and are embedding Indian suppliers into our global supply chain,” said Fabrice Cagnat, Director - Make in India, Airbus Helicopters. “The contract will allow us to qualify Mahindra Aerostructures as a Tier 1 supplier, establish a manufacturing relationship with them on the Panther, and also lay the ground work for a rapid acceleration in terms of industrializing production in India, in case we are selected for the Naval Utility Helicopter programme,” he added.“We believe this manufacturing relationship will allow us to demonstrate the quality andcompetitiveness of Mahindra Aerostructures to Airbus Helicopters. We are alreadycommitted to become a trusted partner and supplier to the Airbus Group for airframe parts and assemblies. This contract with Airbus Helicopters signals our further commitment to work with them to develop a robust Indian ecosystem for both design and build capabilities in aerospace,” said Arvind Mehra, Executive Director & CEO, Mahindra Aerospace.As announced earlier, Airbus Helicopters and Mahindra Defence are in the process offorming a joint venture to target India’s military helicopter programmes such as the Naval Utility Helicopter, the Naval Multi-Role Helicopter and the Reconnaissance and Surveillance Helicopter. The AS565 MBe Panther is competing for the Naval Utility Helicopter programme. In case the Indian Government selects the Panther, Airbus Helicopters will establish India as a global hub for Panther production in partnership with Mahindra Defence.Airbus Helicopters’ Panther is an all-weather, multi-role light rotorcraft, designed foroperation from ship decks, offshore locations and land-based sites. It is made for a multitude of naval warfare and coast guard missions such as maritime surveillance, search and rescue, casualty evacuation, EEZ Surveillance & control counter-terrorism and Anti Surface / Antisubmarine warfare. Some 250 Panther are operated in more than 20 countries by military customers, including 100 in service with the US Coast Guard. Recently, Panther has won contracts in Indonesia and Mexico. With an unmatched state of the art 4-axis digital autopilot, high temperature performance, capability to carry 2 x torpedoes / depth charges and long range radar, the combat proven AS565 MBe Panther is the perfect candidate for the Indian Navy’s Naval Utility Helicopter programme.Mahindra Aerospace has led the Mahindra Group’s foray into utility aircraft and aerostructure manufacturing since 2008.

Allegiant buys new planes for the first time ever - USA TODAY,"Fri, 29 Jul 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS90cmF2ZWwvZmxpZ2h0cy90b2RheWludGhlc2t5LzIwMTYvMDcvMjkvYWxsZWdpYW50LWJ1eXMtbmV3LXBsYW5lcy1maXJzdC10aW1lLWV2ZXIvODc3MDAxMzYv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Allegiant buys new planes for the first time ever

Allegiant Air has ordered brand-new aircraft for the first time in its history.

The leisure carrier announced on Friday it had reached a deal to buy 12 current-generation models of Airbus’ A320 narrowbody jets. Allegiant called the order “another step towards (its) planned transition to an all Airbus fleet by 2019.”

BOOKMARK: Go directly to the Today in the Sky homepage

Since its founding in 1997, Allegiant has filled out its fleet entirely with used aircraft that could be purchased inexpensively. That business model served the carrier well, allowing it to post profits as it carved out a unique niche by connecting smaller markets to leisure destinations on nonstop flights. Including its latest profit announced on Friday, Allegiant has posted a profit in 54 consecutive quarters.

For many years, Allegiant’s fleet was comprised mostly of aging MD-80 jetliners bought used from other airlines. Allegiant still has about 50 of those jets in its fleet, but is rapidly phasing those out in its switch to an all-Airbus fleet.

It’s against that backdrop that Allegiant has bought new aircraft for the first time ever. The company had already acquired more than 30 used Airbus models, but the new A320s also will likely come at a significant discount from list prices. They will be among the last current-generation variants to roll off the assembly line before Airbus switches to production of an updated variant of the jet.

“The fact that these planes are new is notable, but should not be seen as a change in our fundamental strategy,” Allegiant CEO Maury Gallagher says in a statement. “We have always looked at building our fleet opportunistically, and this agreement is no exception. With Airbus preparing to transition production of its current engine option models to new engine option models, we were able to negotiate an order for twelve end-of-line slots.”

Gallagher offered more on the order in the company's quarterly earnings report, also out Friday.

""While we have historically purchased used aircraft, these new A320s will be a small component of our Airbus aircraft fleet in 2019,"" he says. ""Moreover, these aircraft have their own economic advantages - nine more seats and 5%-7% fuel savings over our current used A320s. These features will allow us to maintain our model’s low cost structure and low-frequency schedule, all of which have differentiated us from other carriers.""

The new A320s are expected to enter service for Allegiant between 2017 and 2018. The deal gives Allegiant a total of 77 Airbus aircraft either already in service or committed for future delivery.

“This purchase agreement is an important step in transitioning to a single fleet type,” Jude Bricker, Allegiant’s chief operating officer, adds in the statement. “Streamlining our fleet will increase efficiencies across our entire operation and bring economic advantages in fuel savings and a higher number of seats – allowing us to continue offering the industry’s most affordable fares, while increasing reliability.”

By the end of 2016, the company's in-service Airbus fleet will number 33, consisting of 16 A320s and 17 A319s. At the end of this year, Allegiant says it will have a total of 85 aircraft in revenue service.

Airbus proposes denser A380 premium economy cabin to airlines - Runway Girl Network,"Sat, 02 Jul 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTYvMDcvYWlyYnVzLXByb3Bvc2VzLWRlbnNlci1hMzgwLXByZW1pdW0tZWNvbm9teS1jYWJpbi10by1haXJsaW5lcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus is developing its proposals for a nine-abreast premium economy cabin to airlines as part of what it calls ‘cabin enablers’, and which it is suggesting “to boost revenue” for its A380 aircraft.

The 3-3-3 premium economy cabin comes in the context of noteworthily varied messaging from the airframer as it balances both the #PaxEx appeal of B2B2C aspirational marketing in its Airspace cabin and the need to sell A380s in the very real world of airline economics. There is obvious tension between these two often divergent requirements.

“The context,” Ingo Wuggetzer, Airbus’ vice president of cabin marketing, told RGN, “is airline desire to tailor class products to different passenger populations – something which the A380 is particularly well-placed to do – and more specifically the increase in interest of premium economy products. This particular premium economy configuration on A380 supports some of the best optimized multi-class layouts.”

“The A380 main deck premium economy at nine-abreast represents a great location and positioning in the front of the main deck providing a spaciousness environment for the passenger and giving the seat size and functionality typically expected for Premium Economy. This configuration offers also the benefit for flexible segmentation due to leaving the upper deck free for a First and/or Business class cabin.”

All existing A380 premium economy operators either offer a 2-4-2 configuration on the lower deck (Singapore Airlines, Lufthansa) or a 2-3-2 configuration on the upper deck (Qantas, British Airways, Air France, et al).

This fits with premium economy’s standard configurations on other aircraft types: 2-4-2 on a 747 or 777, 2-3-2 on an A330, A340, 787 or A350. Wuggetzer’s suggestion that the seat size and functionality in 3-3-3 can be “typical” in 3-3-3 on an A380 is thus something of a reach. While it is true that the A380 is wider than a 747, it’s not that much wider — 6.5m according to Airbus, which is the same number as Boeing quotes for the 747-8 [PDF], although Boeing seems to be measuring from the outside of the aircraft rather than the inside of the cabin walls, and the A380’s more vertical walls do give additional room to play with.

“In terms of linear dimensions the nine-abreast premium economy represents 19” wide seat with 4”/2” armrest width (4” shared armrests, 2” non-shared armrests) and 21.5” aisle width,” Wuggetzer suggested. Those dimensions do not strike me as “typical”. 19” seat width is fairly narrow: 20-21” is more frequently seen, especially as airlines slim down the armrests and consoles to give more hip room. British Airways’ first World Traveller Plus cabin was infamous for feeling narrow, and these seat dimensions strike me as very similar to those.

“The seat pitch being the airline’ choice, we see here different approaches although the majority of studied configurations is based around 38” seat pitch. Existing premium economy seats can be installed on the A380 with the minor adaptations typically necessary for any new aircraft application,” Wuggetzer said, adding that “There is no specific monuments/galley space implication for A380 premium economy nine-abreast arrangement.”

A 3-3-3 cabin in premium economy, requiring the double-stepover from the window seat, may well be a greater stumbling block. “It’s true that this situation is not typical of Premium Economy,” Wuggetzer admitted, but argues that, “as window seats in general are clearly the most favoured, and the A380 window seats are particularly spacious, the double-climbover issue is in some sense balanced by that.” For the ultra-longhaul segments that the A380 enables, though, this balance is less in equilibrium.

RGN asked Wuggetzer whether, as a result, a 2-4-3 configuration, as seen recently in Japan Airlines’ refit economy class on the Boeing 777-200ER aircraft, which provides opportunities for travelling parties of two, three and four to sit together, might be a possibility. “Probably not,” Wuggetzer said. “We are skeptical that airline interest is sufficient to justify the additional complexity.

There will be implications for the seat track system of a 3-3-3 premium economy, although Wuggetzer classified these as “minor, and we’ve developed an easy to implement and very lightweight technical solution for seat rails (track) in order adapt the nine-abreast configuration in both linefit and retrofit cases.”

Interestingly, “two seat manufacturers have expressed their interest to us for providing seat models,” Wuggetzer said.

‘Optimised layouts’ for existing inflight service products are about as popular among passengers as ‘enhanced frequent flyer programmes’, but kudos to Airbus for having this discussion. The trick in terms of avoiding blowback will be in terms of pricing: if premium economy fares are constant between an airline with 2-4-2 A380 premium economy and another with a 3-3-3 configuration, questions will understandably be raised about whether Airbus has shot itself in the spacious cabin marketing foot.

Yet with premium economy tending to price above the 1.5-2x economy that has previously been the norm — and has been quoted by various Airbus execs in recent briefings — there may well be a call for redefining premium economy on the A380.

The question is whether the “comfort canyon” between the superjumbo’s spacious 3-4-3 economy seats and a 3-3-3 premium economy product is wide enough, or whether it only makes sense in the context of a 3-5-3 economy option.

Designed for the future: Sizing up Airbus' new Beluga XL transporter - Airbus,"Tue, 19 Jul 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDE2LTA3LWRlc2lnbmVkLWZvci10aGUtZnV0dXJlLXNpemluZy11cC1haXJidXMtbmV3LWJlbHVnYS14bC10cmFuc3BvcnRlctIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus’ new A330-based Beluga XL will incorporate newly-developed elements including its lowered cockpit, cargo bay structure, and rear and tail section

With development of the new Beluga XL airlifter, Airbus is creating a platform tailored to meet its evolving transport needs in the decades to come – particularly to support future production ramp-ups for the company’s range of modern single-aisle and widebody jetliners.The Beluga XL programme was launched in November 2014, with this oversized transporter to be utilised for carrying complete sections of Airbus aircraft from different production sites around Europe to the final assembly lines in Toulouse, France and Hamburg, Germany.Based on the airframe of the versatile A330 jetliner, a total of five Beluga XL airlifters are to be built, with the first to enter operational service in mid-2019. They will gradually replace the existing fleet of Beluga ST aircraft, which were derived from the shorter-fuselage A300.“The Beluga XL is really a patchwork,” said Olivier Delmas, Head of Overall Aircraft Design for the programme, in explaining how elements of two A330 jetliner versions are combined for the Beluga XL. “Geometrically, it is the forward part of an A330-200F freighter, with the aft part of an A330-300 variant.”A large “bubble” airframe section added to the fuselage’s lower portion takes the Beluga XL’s diameter from 5.6 metres for an A330 up to 8.8 metres. The cockpit has been lowered to make space for a main deck with direct cargo loading/unloading capabilities above it.Delmas explained this approach was chosen because no existing aircraft answered Airbus’ criteria for a new-generation transporter, and it allowed the company to create an aircraft capable of handling its requirements based on the proven, robust A330 jetliner family.“We needed the cargo hold to be 45-metres long with an internal diameter of 8 metres, and a payload capability of 50 tonnes,” he added. “These dimensions can accommodate fuselage sections and allow us to transport a pair of A350 XWB wings – something we can’t do today by air.”Increasing the Beluga XL’s volume by 30 percent compared to the existing Beluga ST will make the new airlifter much more cost effective. Further enhancements are to reduce the time needed for unloading, refuelling and reloading the aircraft while making its stopovers at locations across the Airbus production network."
Dedrone partners with Airbus to bring drone detection to wide open spaces including airports - TechCrunch,"Fri, 29 Jul 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vdGVjaGNydW5jaC5jb20vMjAxNi8wNy8yOS9kZWRyb25lLXBhcnRuZXJzLXdpdGgtYWlyYnVzLXRvLWJyaW5nLWRyb25lLWRldGVjdGlvbi10by13aWRlLW9wZW4tc3BhY2VzLWluY2x1ZGluZy1haXJwb3J0cy_SAYMBaHR0cHM6Ly90ZWNoY3J1bmNoLmNvbS8yMDE2LzA3LzI5L2RlZHJvbmUtcGFydG5lcnMtd2l0aC1haXJidXMtdG8tYnJpbmctZHJvbmUtZGV0ZWN0aW9uLXRvLXdpZGUtb3Blbi1zcGFjZXMtaW5jbHVkaW5nLWFpcnBvcnRzL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A startup that helps businesses determine when drones are flying unwantedly or otherwise into their airspace, Dedrone, has partnered with the electronics division of civil aircraft manufacturers Airbus to bring drone detection to wide open spaces and remote locations.

Through their partnership, Dedrone will integrate Airbus’s long range radar technology into its systems which are comprised of ground-based sensors and data analytics and reporting software in the cloud.

The radar (and data from it) expands the range of the startup’s drone detection systems to a radius of up to 3 kilometers in open spaces, according to Dedrone CEO Joerg Lamprecht.

Dedrone’s standard hardware is more for distributed use. The sensors are set up all around data centers which are often surrounded by trees, embassies, corporate campuses, or stadiums where a small drone could fly not just overhead but indoors and near windows attempting to capture images or hack into internal systems.

But if a business owns and operates something like an airport, water treatment facility, nuclear power plant, or test tracks where new vehicles are driven and safety-tested, Dedrone hardware with long-range communication capabilities via Airbus radar could allow a more centralized set up.

Lamprecht noted, “We have always integrated the best available technology on the market into our systems. We have had surveillance cameras, mics, frequency scanners and now we have the power of the Airbus radar, which will allow us to reach into new industries.”

Dedrone focuses on drone detection and monitoring, not counter measures to bring unmanned aerial vehicles down, or block them from entering a particular space.

Opening up its systems, and integrating with new hardware and data sources like those from Airbus, allows Dedrone to work increasingly in conjunction with other physical and aerial security systems, for example, jamming units that could force a drone to land before crashing into critical infrastructure."

No more waiting in the aisle? Airbus plans to install urinals on planes - The Guardian,"Tue, 12 Jul 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDE2L2p1bC8xMi9haXJidXMtcGxhbnMtaW5zdGFsbC11cmluYWxzLXBsYW5lcy1uby1tb3JlLXdhaXRpbmctaW4tYWlzbGXSAW1odHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAxNi9qdWwvMTIvYWlyYnVzLXBsYW5zLWluc3RhbGwtdXJpbmFscy1wbGFuZXMtbm8tbW9yZS13YWl0aW5nLWluLWFpc2xl?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The end of the line could finally be in sight for the embarrassing air travel ritual of waiting in the aisle to go to the toilet.

Airbus, the manufacturer of the A380 superjumbo, is working on a plan to install urinals into its planes.

The company is talking to Zodiac, a French company and key supplier, about developing urinals and other new toilet designs for its planes, including disabled lavatories.



Airbus is aiming to optimise space and help passengers save time by reducing queues for the toilet during a flight. The installation of urinals could free up room for additional women’s toilets and disabled loos.

An Airbus source said: “Options for urinals are being developed and are being looked into by a number of airlines.”

Toilets have long been a dilemma for airlines and plane manufacturers because of the space they take up. Michael O’Leary, the boss of Ryanair, threatened to charge passengers for using the toilet on his planes or even get rid of them altogether, complaining they were taking up space that could be used for extra seats.

Airbus has been dogged with its own toilet troubles on its new aircraft, the A350. Delays in the delivery of the toilets for the plane by Zodiac have led to slower than expected production of the A350. In an unusual move, Airbus publicly shamed Zodiac earlier this year for causing delays to production of the plane.

Urinals have been installed in the past in the first class area of some planes, such as Lufthansa’s A380s. However, a lack of technological developments has prevented their widespread use and some airlines prefer the privacy of traditional toilets.

Additional A320neo to boost its capacity

Private signature Côte d'Ivoire at Farnborough 2016 (DAY 2)<br /> <br /> Air Côte d’Ivoire expands its Airbus fleet to accelerate its growth

At the opening of the Farnborough Air Show, held in the United Kingdom from July 11th to 17th, Air Côte d’Ivoire, Ivory Coast’s national airline based in Abidjan, signed a firm order for the purchase of an additional A320neo to complete its fleet. Air Côte d'Ivoire already distinguished itself in the spring by becoming the first African airline to order the A320neo.“This additional A320neo will allow Air Côte d’Ivoire to truly differentiate its product by offering a higher level of comfort to its customers with new aircraft. Thanks to this new Airbus aircraft, Air Côte d’Ivoire will also improve its operating efficiency to better meet the need for traffic growth,” said General Abdoulaye Coulibaly, Chairman of the Board.In three years, Air Côte d’Ivoire has tripled its number of passengers, and, with its new fleet, will position itself as the leader in this highly competitive region. It currently flies to 23 international destinations located in West and Central Africa, and to five domestic destinations. Air Côte d’Ivoire already operates six Airbus aircraft (four A319s and two A320), and this new commitment follows its previous order for four aircraft placed in April.“This vote of confidence from Air Côte d’Ivoire is further proof of the rapid traffic growth in Africa, and of the leading role that this dynamic airline aims to play in the development of air transport on this continent. Airbus is delighted to contribute to this,"" highlighted John Leahy, Airbus Chief Operating Officer, Customers.The A320 Family is the world’s best-selling single aisle product line with over 12,500 orders since launch and more than 7,000 aircraft delivered to some 400 customer and operators worldwide. Thanks to their widest cabin, all members of the A320 Family offer unmatched comfort in all classes and Airbus’ 18” wide seats in economy as standard. With one aircraft in four sizes (A318, A319, A320 & A321), the A320 Family, seating from 100 to 240 passengers, seamlessly covers the entire single-aisle segment from low to high-density domestic to longer range routes."

Then Airbus has a website for you.

Airbus (EADSF) has launched a booking site dedicated solely to A380 flights, hoping to capitalize on the popularity of the aircraft among some passengers.

""Booking systems today do not allow the passengers to easily choose their preferred aircraft and we decided to fill that gap by easing the access to the iconic A380 aircraft, for everybody,"" said Marc Fontaine, Airbus Digital Transformation Officer.

The A380 super jumbo jet operates on 102 routes to around 50 destinations globally, including New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, London, Paris, Frankfurt, Dubai, Tokyo and Sydney.

The new website, http://iflya380.com, allows passengers to pick any A380 flight operated by one of the 13 airlines that fly the super jumbo.

Airbus said the aircraft has proven to be a hit with travelers, but the company is struggling to convince more airlines to buy it.

The A380, designed to challenge Boeing (BA) in the super large aircraft market, took 15 years to develop at a cost of $25 billion. But orders have not matched Airbus' expectations.

Airlines are now moving towards more fuel efficient planes, rather than super large aircraft, to cut down costs. Fuel is the second biggest expense for airlines, behind staff costs.

The company announced it is cutting down production of the aircraft. It said it will build only 20 of the twin-deck A380 next year, and only 12 per year from 2018. That's down from 27 it delivered in 2015."

Bombardier's long-awaited C-Series entered service with Swiss Global Airlines on Friday.

The state-of-the-art Canadian airliner opened its career with a short flight from Zurich to Paris.

The Swiss Global Bombardier is the first of 30 C-Series jets the airline has on order, split evenly between the smaller CS100 and the larger CS300.

""I am extremely proud that we are the first airline in the world to put this totally newly developed aircraft into service,"" Swiss Global's Chief Commercial Officer Markus Binkert said in a statement. ""The Bombardier CS100 is a class act in every respect: comfort, economics, and environmental credentials.""

According to Airways Mag Managing Editor Chris Sloan, the CS100's first flight with Swiss went flawlessly, apart from a slight delay caused by a glitch while switching from ground power to onboard electricity. Passengers were served a snack of trout mousse and black forest roulade, reported Sloan, who was on the 54-minute flight.

Swiss Global's Bombardier CS100 is outfitted with 101 seats (30 business-class and 71 economy-class) and will be replacing the airline's aging Avro RJ100 regional jets.

Swiss Bombardier CS 100 first flight

The Bombardier C-Series is positioned to compete against the two best-selling airliners of all time — the Airbus A320 family and the Boeing 737 family. Capable of ferrying between 100 and 150 passengers, the Canadian jet is the most viable threat Airbus and Boeing have encountered in 20 years.

Over the the next few years, several manufacturers from around the world will launch aircraft aimed to compete with Airbus and Boeing. But Bombardier is the first to enter service and the only one that will compete head-to-head within one of their most important market segments.

Not since the demise of McDonnell Douglas and its MD-80 and MD-90 in the late '90s has there been a third major player to challenge the Airbus-Boeing duopoly. (McDonnell Douglas was purchased by Boeing for $13 billion in 1997.)

Story continues

With the C-Series, Bombardier is poised to do just that. However, the Quebec-based firm has a long way to go. Currently, Bombardier has more than 300 firm orders for the plane, while Airbus and Boeing each have backlogs with 10 times that amount for their latest A320 and 737 variants.

What Bombardier has going for it is the fact that the C-Series is widely viewed as a great plane — receiving critical acclaim for its fuel efficiency, range, and advanced technology.

""The CS300 kills the Boeing 737 MAX 7 and the Airbus A319neo in terms of ability and efficiency,"" Airways senior business analyst Vinay Bhaskara told Business Insider in an interview last year.

Bombardier C Series Swiss

Unfortunately, Bombardier has also been plagued by development and financial setbacks caused by the multibillion-dollar C-Series program. At the same time, the company struggled to find buyers for the state-of-the-art jet — especially among the world's A-list airlines.

With the CS100 in service, a major commitment from Air Canada, and a $5.6 billion order from Delta, things are looking up for Bombardier.

Air Canada and Delta's show of support for the aircraft and its manufacturer should allay the fears of smaller customers who are hesitant to buy because of Bombardier's precarious financial condition.

In addition, the CS300 is expected to be delivered to AirBaltic by the end of the year.

Should the Airbus 225 Super Puma be grounded for good? - Offshore Technology,"Wed, 13 Jul 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9mZnNob3JlLXRlY2hub2xvZ3kuY29tL2ZlYXR1cmVzL2ZlYXR1cmVzaG91bGQtdGhlLWFpcmJ1cy0yMjUtc3VwZXItcHVtYS1iZS1ncm91bmRlZC1mb3ItZ29vZC00OTM5MTkxL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Puma” class=”fullwidth” src=”https://www.offshore-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/image-digitalinsightresearch/Active/2016Q3/2.NRI/Offshore/Features/super Puma.jpg” /> Puma” class=”fullwidth” src=”https://www.offshore-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/image-digitalinsightresearch/Active/2016Q3/2.NRI/Offshore/Features/super Puma.jpg” />

In late April, in the wake of a crash near Bergen, Norway involving an Airbus H225 Super Puma that killed 13 people, oil worker David Winder began a petition to remove the helicopter from service.

What began with a single signature has since become a stirring example of populist outrage that the UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) cannot ignore. At the time of writing, over 27,000 people, some of them relatives of those killed in other Super Puma incidents, have put their names to the petition.

Offshore safety: a top priority

As union bosses in the UK renewed calls for the government to reconsider its decision to refuse a public inquiry into offshore helicopter safety, the CAA responded by claiming that a blanket decision to remove Super Puma helicopters from active service could only be taken at the European level.

""Aircraft and helicopters are given safety clearance on a European-wide (rather than national) basis by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA),"" the CAA said in a statement in May. ""A permanent grounding of a type of helicopter would require EASA to withdraw the helicopter's overall approval, affecting all European Super Puma helicopters.

""Aircraft and helicopters are given safety clearance on a European-wide (rather than national) basis.""

""The safety of those who rely on offshore helicopter flights is one of our top priorities and we will continue to work with the helicopter operators, the offshore industries, international regulators, unions and pilot representatives to enhance offshore safety standards still further,"" it added.

Jill Seymour MEP wrote to EASA executive director Patrick Ky in support of the petition asking for all versions of the Super Puma airframes to be permanently removed, a move backed by Audrey Wood, the mother of 27-year-old oil rig worker Stuart Wood who lost his life in a Super Puma crash in 2009.

""Seven years on and my life has stood still,"" Wood said. ""Wouldn't wish this heartache on my worst enemy. All variants of Puma should be removed from the oil industry, men should feel safe travelling to work not fear if they will ever see their loved ones at home again.""

Chequered history: accidents involving the Airbus Super Puma fleet

The helicopter, which costs in the region of $18m (£12.8m), involved in the latest crash was flying from Statoil's Gullfaks B platform to Bergen when it crashed near the small island of Turoey. On board were one British man, 11 Norwegians and an Italian.

Operator CHC Helicopter revealed that the Airbus EC225LP Super Puma had been forced to return to Flesland in Norway just days before the accident after a cockpit warning light came on minutes into a flight.

A part was replaced, but the warning light reappeared during a test flight the following day, after which a component was changed and a second test flight was successfully completed. CHC claims that none of the parts that were replaced was ""physically connected"" to the rotor or gearbox.

A preliminary report released in June by the Accident Investigation Board Norway (AIBN) said that it had found ""features strongly consistent with [metal] fatigue"" in parts of the aircraft's main gearbox.

The report urged European aviation safety officials to take immediate action to ensure that Super Puma H225 helicopters are safe and warned that current measures to detect faults may be inadequate.

The aircraft remains grounded in the UK and Norway, but Airbus has lifted a recommendation that flights be suspended worldwide, stating that initial evidence suggested no link with two main rotor gearbox ditchings in Scotland in 2012 involving the Super Puma H225, formerly known as the EC225.

In 2009, an accident involving a different model of Super Puma, the AS332, claimed the lives of 14 workers and two crewmen on a return flight to Aberdeen from BP's Miller oilfield in the North Sea. The tragedy was blamed on gearbox failure. Four years later, another AS332 crashed near Sumburgh Airport off Shetland, killing four people; a report published in March cited pilot error as the cause.

Examining the evidence: Step Change in Safety and public inquiry

Tragic coincidence or systemic failure? According to Step Change in Safety, the industry body set up in 1997 to improve safety on the UK Continental Shelf, eye-witness accounts and video footage from the Bergen crash suggest that the main rotorhead of the H225 detached from the fuselage. Accident investigators have ruled out pilot error and therefore the crash was likely caused by a technical fault.

Step Change on Safety also states that, based on headline safety statistics, there is no clear evidence that the Super Puma safety record is worse than other aircraft and that this is the first fatal accident involving the H225. The CAA will determine if it is safe to restart commercial flights and individual operators will then determine with their helicopter operator if and when to re-introduce the 225.

In the last decade there have been eleven reportable helicopter incidents in the UK, three of them fatal. Super Pumas are responsible for many of the 140,000 annual helicopter passenger flights in the UK.

""In the last decade there have been eleven reportable helicopter incidents in the UK, three of them fatal.""

In light of this, manufacturer Airbus and aviation safety officials in the UK and Norway cannot afford to ignore the groundswell of opinion from victims' relatives, the public, the media and worker unions demanding a public inquiry into helicopter safety with a view to removing Super Pumas from service.

In October 2014, the UK Government rejected calls for such an inquiry into helicopter safety in the UK in the wake of a report published by the House of Commons Transport Select Committee.

The government said: ""We are pleased to note that the committee has found no evidence that the Super Puma helicopter is any less safe than other helicopters used in the UK offshore sector and that there is also no evidence to suggest that UK operations are any less safe than operations conducted by other states, particularly Norway, who operate under a similar safety regime in the same hostile North Sea environment.

""With regards to commercial pressure, neither the CAA, industry nor government has seen evidence to suggest that safety is being compromised as a result of commercial pressure from the industry.""

Industry response: collaborative helicopter safety programmes

In 2013, the CAA announced a forensic review of offshore helicopter operations in the North Sea in collaboration with the Norwegian CAA and EASA, and advised by a panel of independent experts.

The initiative followed a comprehensive analysis of offshore helicopter reportable accidents from 1976−2012, in which the CAA established that the main causal factors were operational (pilot performance), technical (rotor and transmission failures) and environmental (lightning strikes).

The accident offshore Shetland in Au/gust 2013 prompted Britain and Ireland's largest union, Unite, to launch the 'Back Home Safe' campaign calling for various safety improvements to offshore flights.

Offshore trade association Oil & Gas UK responded by inviting Unite, the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) and the British Airline Pilots' Association (BALPA) to work alongside its Step Change Helicopter Safety Steering Group (HSSG) and the Helicopter Task Group.

Less than three years later, it has again taken a tragic accident to propel helicopter safety in general, and the airworthiness of the Super Puma fleet in particular, back to the top of the industry agenda.

""This petition is for all North Sea offshore oil workers and their families, and the public at large, to finally say enough is enough with the Super Puma airframe,"" stated David Winder.

""We call on the CAA to put the lives of offshore oil workers and the pilots before vested interests, and revoke the air worthiness certificates for this aircraft. Failure to do this we feel will result in more needless deaths."""
Dedrone & Airbus are joining forces to protect the airspace against dangerous drones - EU-Startups,"Wed, 27 Jul 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1LXN0YXJ0dXBzLmNvbS8yMDE2LzA3L2RlZHJvbmUtYWlyYnVzLWFyZS1qb2luaW5nLWZvcmNlcy10by1wcm90ZWN0LXRoZS1haXJzcGFjZS1hZ2FpbnN0LWRhbmdlcm91cy1kcm9uZXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus DS Electronics and Border Security (EBS) and Dedrone have concluded a cooperation agreement to combine their skills to protect lower airspace from small drones. The partners intend jointly to offer drones defense systems that can reliably detect and defend against the unauthorized entry of drones in critical airspaces.

Dedrone was founded in 2014 in Kassel (Germany) and moved its headquarters to San Francisco in the beginning of this year.

Thomas Müller, Managing Director of Airbus DS Electronics and Border Security (EBS) stated: “All over the world, incidents with universally available small drones have revealed a security gap with regards to major events or critical installations such as airports. By pooling the capabilities of Airbus, with our long-range radar and jamming functions, and those of Dedrone, with their market-leading multi-sensor platform, we have a wide deployment range covering both urban and rural areas.”

Dedrone’s CEO Jörg Lamprecht adds: “Small drones have until now conquered lower airspace as criminals discovered this technology for smuggling, espionage and terrorist attacks. We offer an effective solution for this new threat that secures lower airspace once again. Airbus’ and our systems complement each other perfectly, and combine early detection of drones in near and far fields with the ability to initiate effective countermeasures automatically.”

The drone defense system from Airbus and Dedrone uses different sensors – cameras, radars, microphones, and directional scanners – that combined can secure the airspace up to 6 miles away. The information is merged with advanced data fusion and signal analysis technologies. The result is compared to a comprehensive database of drone patterns and signatures, along with real time analysis of the control signal. When connected to a jammer, communication between the drone and the pilot can be interrupted and navigation disturbed to repel or disable the drone. Additionally, the location of the pilot can be determined for further investigation.

Dedrone also developed a product called DroneTracker – a unique drone warning system consisting of optimized hardware and intelligent software. DroneTracker is already available and is being used successfully in prison and stadium installations, to name a few. Mounted on facades, DroneTracker recognizes flying drones with various visual and acoustic sensors and frequency scanners. Detected signals such as noise, movement patterns, silhouette, and frequencies are processed and evaluated by Dedrone software. DroneTracker identifies drones reliably in a radius up to one kilometer and alerts security forces. Dedrone’s detection solution combined with the jamming technology from Airbus can automatically activate defense mechanisms.

"For Airbus and Boeing, the sales party could be over - Yahoo Finance","Sat, 09 Jul 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHA6Ly9maW5hbmNlLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FpcmJ1cy1ib2Vpbmctc2FsZXMtcGFydHktY291bGQtMTkzMDAwMDc4Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus A350 Qatar Farnborough

For Airbus and Boeing, the Farnborough Air Show marks the halfway point of the sales calendar.

Over the past few years, Farnborough, along with other midsummer air shows such as Paris and Berlin, has been a hotbed of sales activity.

It's where deals ranging from the two-to-200-plane variety are announced.

But this year, buzz has been quiet. And rumors of potential megadeals have been virtually nonexistent.

At a time when airlines are experiencing great profitability and with air travel expanding rapidly, it looks like sales of Airbus' and Boeing's next generation of airliners are facing two significant headwinds.

Fuel

The airline industry is a capital-intensive, high-cost, low-margin business. Airlines try to do whatever they can to cut costs. Generally, that means saving on their most significant expense — fuel. With state-of-the-art aerodynamics and fuel-sipping, high-bypass-ratio turbofan engines, Airbus and Boeing's next generation jets, such as the A320neo and the 737MAX offer airlines a way to do this.

However, they also require the airlines to make a significant financial commitment.

Boeing's most affordable next-generation jet — the 737MAX 7 — carries a list price of $90 million, while the top-of-the-line 777-9X wide-body lists at $400 million. Airbus' low-end A319neo comes with a $98.5 million sticker price, while the top-end A350-1000 twin-aisle jet $355.7 million.

Even with significant bulk-order discounts common in major orders, the investment for an airline still runs in the billions of dollars.

Unfortunately for airplane makers, at just over $46 a barrel, oil is the cheapest it's been in years. All of the sudden, Airbus and Boeing's most important customers are reporting 40% to 50% reductions in fuel costs — much more than the roughly 20% improvement its planes could deliver.

Boeing 737 MAX Southwest Airlines

As a result, customers are shying away from booking new orders for the pricey, but more efficient jets. Instead, airlines are gravitating t0 less efficient, but more cost-effective, current-generation jets: the Boeing 737NG and the Airbus A330.

Story continues

Last month, Southwest Airlines, the Boeing 737's largest and most important customer, pushed back the delivery of 67 737MAX jets by as long as six years — allowing the airline to delay spending $1.9 billion. At the same time, Southwest bumped up the delivery date of six current-generation 737-800 from 2018 to 2017.

Although Southwest will remain the 737MAX's launch customer when it enters service next year, the airline's decision is indicative of the hurdles airplane-makers face.

""With fuel where it's at, the current 737NGs are perfectly economical, and Southwest sees a way to boost profits and cash flows by a few billion dollars,"" Airways senior business analyst Vinay Bhaskara told Business Insider.

""Even though (Southwest CEO) Gary Kelly will bluster about the pilots and the 737 Classic issue being the rationale, this is the primary driver,"" Bhaskara added, noting the airline's ongoing labor dispute with its pilots and need to replace old aircraft.

Airbus seems to be encountering the same issues. While the A320neo is outselling the current-gen A320ceo 68 to 18 this year, the current-gen A321ceo is beating out the A321neo 52 to 21. At the same time, the current-gen A330ceo is outselling the next-gen A330neo 24 to 14.

Booming sales

Compounding the difficulties posed by cheap fuel, Airbus and Boeing may also be victims of their own success. Over the past few years, Airbus' and Boeing's sales teams have been firing on all cylinders — sales record after sales record has fallen.

Airbus A320neo

As a result, Airbus now has a 6,716-aircraft backlog, while Boeing's backlog currently sits at 5,693 planes. Even with Airbus and Boeing delivering a record-setting 635 and 762 planes respectively in 2015, customers will have to wait on their orders.

Based on last year's rate of delivery, it would take Boeing seven and a half years to clear its backlog. At the same time, it'll take Airbus more than a decade to work through its waitlist.

So airlines are becoming increasingly hesitant to tie up their cash in planes that will take up to a decade to arrive. In addition, carriers also run the risk of having the market, the economy, and demand for their services change drastically in the time between the order and delivery of aircraft.

While it is likely Airbus and Boeing will book orders at Farnborough in 2016, don't expect a repeat of the monster 100-plane deals that have become common over the past few years.

Considering JetBlue's IFE options for the Airbus A320neo - Runway Girl Network,"Fri, 08 Jul 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTYvMDcvY29uc2lkZXJpbmctamV0Ymx1ZXMtaWZlLW9wdGlvbnMtZm9yLXRoZS1haXJidXMtYTMyMG5lby_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"When JetBlue launched service 16 years ago – and provided complimentary DirecTV at every seatback – the offering was revolutionary. With the launch of JetBlue’s new A320 cabin in 2017, a new Thales Inflyt product called STV+ will be introduced, combining on-demand content and live TV in a seat-back Android device, with the option to stream to passenger devices. Starting in 2018, however, JetBlue will begin taking delivery of is first re-engined A320neo-family jets and these are not currently under contract to any seatback IFE provider. And so the company can take a (small) amount of time now to shop around and see what the field is able to offer for its needs. Word on the street is that the shopping has begun – one of many contracts in play for US airlines.

The 36-channel seatback ‘LiveTV’ product on JetBlue’s A320s and Embraer 190s, and the nextgen 100-channel solution on offer on its A321s, are supported by Thales, which acquired LiveTV in 2014. Thales is also lead on JetBlue’s inflight connectivity contract; the connectivity is powered by ViaSat’s high-capacity Exede Ka service.

Panasonic Avionics, Global Eagle Entertainment and Gogo all offer competing live television solutions, but via IPTV (television delivered via IP). And ViaSat is even working on IPTV seatback integration with Virgin America’s IFE hardware provider Panasonic. With multiple options from which to choose, JetBlue is in a strong position to play vendors off one another, raising an interesting opportunity for the New York-based carrier: What should it do next?

There are many reasons to believe that JetBlue will not offer the direct broadcast solution on the A320neo that is now on offer on its A320ceos and E-190s. Among other things, the hardware has significant acquisition and carrying costs. Running a dual satellite solution to address different apertures and technologies (separate Ku and Ka antennas beneath the radome hood for TV and broadband connectivity, respectively) means added complexity and challenges, though getting both spectrum bands under a single radome is becoming more common; for instance, ViaSat recently received certification for a hybrid Ku/Ka-band antenna configuration to fly on A320s for Virgin America.

The expense over time to transmit via IPTV over the same antenna used for broadband connectivity is competitive, and demand is strong especially when television content is free. But is demand 100-plus channels strong, (as offered now on the A321s, and as will be offered when the A320ceos are refurbished)? Some vendors don’t think so.

In 2014, when Thales first teased a streaming DirecTV product for United to RGN, the firm indicated that an aircraft will almost never see more than 25 unique channels in use, even on a plane with 150 passengers and 99% usage of the system. Rival Panasonic agrees. The company has nine IPTV channels available today for its airline customers and expects to see that expand to 20 in the very near future. “You start to get down to very small percentages that watch things above 20,” Panasonic VP Global Communications Services David Bruner recently told RGN.

Whether JetBlue chooses to do a streaming only or (more likely) keep an embedded IFE offering for its A320neos, the number of channels necessary to meet consumer demand may not be as high as the carrier is delivering at present.

Geography also plays a role in the discussion for JetBlue. The carrier cannot provide DirecTV on international flights today because most of the flight time is spent outside the coverage area of the DirecTV satellite. Switching to an IPTV solution will solve that problem, though it also introduces others, namely in the area of content licensing. One of the reasons Panasonic has a limited set of channels available is because it negotiates global broadcast rights for the content. That’s critical to being able to deliver the content to all its customers’ flights. With JetBlue now operating roughly 30-35% of its daily capacity outside the US, content licensing should be a consideration for the carrier.

Of course, there’s also the argument that passengers will simply use the Fly-Fi-branded broadband inflight connectivity on board and choose the content they want to watch on the Internet. One industry executive believes that approach will not meet the demand of today’s traveling public suggesting, “[TV] is as important and maybe even more so than broadband because people love to be entertained and they want it all the time. They also like to do these things simultaneously. So it is not like an either or kind of choice. But I see this being a monster separator and change agent over the next few years.”

As the incumbent with a passenger base that is generally very satisfied with the onboard offerings Thales certainly has a strong position to hold onto the future JetBlue A320neo business, perhaps with STV+. But split fleets and shifting between operators is far from uncommon these days. There will be a competition to win the new JetBlue business. That should be good news for passengers. And given the lead times necessary for installations a decision is likely coming soon."
Full speed ahead on UK MFTS - Airbus,"Thu, 28 Jul 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDE2LTA3LWZ1bGwtc3BlZWQtYWhlYWQtb24tdWstbWZ0c9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Demanding targets are being met in the build-up to delivery of Airbus Helicopters’ commitment to the UK Military Flying Training System (MFTS).Today, the company has carried out the first flight of the initial UK MFTS aircraft, bringing delivery one step closer.With 12 UK MFTS aircraft already in production at the company’s site in Donauworth, the programme is meeting the challenging deadlines by delivering key programme events to time including production ramp up and initial ground runs of the first UK MFTS H135, which took place at the end of June.Airbus Helicopters will deliver 29 H135s and 3, hoist-equipped H145s to the UK MoD. These aircraft will be factory fitted with wire cutters and Safran’s Arrius 2B2Plus and Arriel 2E turbines for the H135 and H145 respectively. The schedule will see early deliveries in the latter part of this year, the majority of aircraft delivered during 2017 and final aircraft in early 2018.The aircraft will be delivered to the company’s UK headquarters for completion, which will see the aircraft fitted with the final configuration of equipment, including communications, sensor and access equipment to meet the customer’s requirement, before handover to the customer in time to meet the delivery of flight hours for Ascent’s UK MFTS’ training schedule.The UK MFTS programme will benefit from the latest enhancements available to the H135 and H145 family of aircraft, including lower maintenance burdens, reduced noise levels and intuitive avionics which provide pilot assistance enabling safe full use of the flight envelope.The benefits of this latest generation aircraft became apparent to the customer and to the end –user when AVM Andy Turner, AOC 22 Gp responsible for flight training across the armed forces, and Paul Livingston, Ascent Flight Training Managing Director, visited the Donauworth site and had their first experience of and H145. After the flight AVM Turner, a helicopter pilot, who had the opportunity to fly the aircraft, said, “There is no doubt that we have a strong, committed, capable and dedicated partner in Airbus Helicopters. The aircraft have a tremendous pedigree with 20 years and 4m flight hours behind them. The innovations are superb, the flight dynamics are excellent, the Helionix instrumentation is incredibly intuitive and the platform will be an excellent lead in to Apache, Chinook, Merlin, Puma and Wildcat”.Selection for UK MFTS of the H135 and H145, already the aircraft of choice for utility, law enforcement and emergency medical services, reinforces the role of these aircraft as the global reference in military flight training."
Airbus cuts A380 delivery target from 2018 - DW (English),"Wed, 13 Jul 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmR3LmNvbS9lbi9haXJidXMtY3V0cy1hMzgwLWRlbGl2ZXJ5LXRhcmdldC1mcm9tLTIwMTgvYS0xOTM5NjUyMdIBS2h0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmR3LmNvbS9lbi9haXJidXMtY3V0cy1hMzgwLWRlbGl2ZXJ5LXRhcmdldC1mcm9tLTIwMTgvYS0xOTM5NjUyMQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The aircraft manufacturer has reduced its forecast for A380 deliveries to avoid a production glut. But the company's chief executive appeared optimistic, saying the four-engine jet ""is here to stay.""

Europe's Airbus on Tuesday announced that it reduced its A380 target delivery to 12 per year starting in 2018.

""With this prudent, proactive step we are establishing a new target for our industrial planning, meeting current commercial demand but keeping all our options open to benefit from future A380 markets, which we consider in the environment of ongoing aviation growth and constrained airport capacity as a given,"" Bregier added.

The announcement comes at a moment when airlines have shunned the industry's four-engine behemoths for twin-engine jets.

AirAsia, the region's largest budget carrier, ordered 100 single-aisle fuel-efficient A321neo jets, valued at $12.5 billion (11.3 billion euros), while India's low-cost Go Air signalled its intention to buy 72 of them, amounting to $7.7 billion (6.96 billion euros).

However, Bregier appeared optimistic about the A380's future despite the production cutback.

""We are maintaining, innovating and investing in the A380, keeping the aircraft the favorite of passengers, the airlines and airports - today and in the future. The A380 is here to stay,"" said Airbus CEO Fabrice Bregier.

The company said it aims to raise profits in the meantime by reducing the costs of building the A380.

""Airbus reached breakeven at 27 aircraft deliveries in 2015. The company will continue to improve the efficiency of its industrial system to achieve breakeven at 20 aircraft in 2017 and targets additional cost reduction initiatives to lower breakeven further,"" Airbus said in a statement.

Airbus reveals radical wingless stratospheric planes that could circle the Earth - Daily Mail,"Tue, 26 Jul 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvc2NpZW5jZXRlY2gvYXJ0aWNsZS0zNzA5MzMwL0FpcmJ1cy1yZXZlYWxzLXJhZGljYWwtd2luZ2xlc3Mtc3RyYXRvc3BoZXJpYy1wbGFuZXMtY2lyY2xlLUVhcnRoLTY1LTAwMC1mZWV0LXllYXJzLXRpbWUuaHRtbNIBmQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvc2NpZW5jZXRlY2gvYXJ0aWNsZS0zNzA5MzMwL2FtcC9BaXJidXMtcmV2ZWFscy1yYWRpY2FsLXdpbmdsZXNzLXN0cmF0b3NwaGVyaWMtcGxhbmVzLWNpcmNsZS1FYXJ0aC02NS0wMDAtZmVldC15ZWFycy10aW1lLmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has invented a new device that could one day carry high-altitude planes more than 65,000 feet into the air, according to a patent spotted by YouTube channel PatentYogi.

This ‘support vehicle’ would detach from the second craft once it reaches the stratosphere, allowing the high-flying plane to soar for months or even years miles above Earth’s surface.

Once deployed, a stratosphere plane can be used like a satellite to make observations of Earth over long periods of time, or even to beam Internet down to the ground.

Airbus has invented a new device that could one day carry high-altitude planes more than 65,000 feet into the air. This ‘support vehicle’ would detach from the second craft once it reaches the stratosphere, allowing the high-flying plane to soar for months or even years miles above Earth’s surface

HOW IT WOULD WORK The device would be independent from the plane itself, attaching beneath or on the sides of the plane, and detaching based on the force of gravity once it has achieved the desired altitude. Stratosphere planes typically fly at 12 miles above Earth. Then, the auxiliary device would return to Earth on its own to be reused. This device could take the form of an airplane that sails back down to Earth or returns with the use of the drive force. Advertisement !- - ad: https://mads.dailymail.co.uk/v8/fr/sciencetech/none/article/other/mpu_factbox.html?id=mpu_factbox_1 - ->

According to the patent, this ‘auxiliary device’ improves the capabilities of the high-altitude plane on its way up into the stratosphere.

This is the second layer of Earth’s atmosphere, and begins between roughly five miles at the poles, and 11 miles at the equator, stretching to an altitude of more than 31 miles.

‘Such vehicles rise up into the stratosphere, where they perform tasks like satellites for a long period of time in comparison with a conventional airplane,’ the patent explains.

This could be from weeks to months, or even years.

Stratosphere planes are lightweight and typically fly at 12 miles above Earth, powered by solar energy.

But, the ascent into this layer of the atmosphere requires a lot of engine power.

‘The object of the present invention is to structurally and/or functionally optimize the operation of a high-altitude airplane both during its ascent into the stratosphere and during its operation in the stratosphere,’ according to the patent.

The device would be independent from the plane itself, attaching beneath or on the sides of the plane, and detaching based on the force of gravity once it has achieved the desired altitude, as pictured above. Stratosphere planes are lightweight and typically fly at 12 miles above Earth

The device would be independent from the plane itself, attaching beneath or on the sides of the plane, and detaching based on the force of gravity once it has achieved the desired altitude.

Then, the auxiliary device would return to Earth on its own to be reused.

The patent explains that this device could be designed in a number of different forms, one being an airplane that sails back down to Earth, or returns with the use of the drive force.

Its drive force would be stronger than that of the stratosphere craft, helping to optimize the airplane’s structural and functional performance.

According to the patent , this ‘auxiliary device’ improves the capabilities of the high-altitude plane on its way up into the stratosphere. The High-Altitude Pseudo-Satellite 'Zephyr T' from Airbus is pictured above

‘Such vehicles rise up into the stratosphere, where they perform tasks like satellites for a long period of time in comparison with a conventional airplane,’ the patent explains. The Zephyr S, another HAPS from Airbus, is pictured

Without this support, the patent explains, the airplane must carry more weight than is necessary for its mission in order to achieve its ascent.

‘Due to the proposed auxiliary device, this problem can be bypassed in that the auxiliary device is detachably connected to the airplane prior to the start of the airplane and is separated from the airplane again at a predefined altitude,’ the patent explains.

‘The auxiliary device is thus carried ‘piggyback’ with the airplane.’"
The Airbus Tanker Adds a New Customer: The Dutch Air Force Joins the Global Fleet - Second Line of Defense - Second Line of Defense,"Sun, 31 Jul 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vc2xkaW5mby5jb20vMjAxNi8wNy90aGUtYWlyYnVzLXRhbmtlci1hZGRzLWEtbmV3LWN1c3RvbWVyLXRoZS1kdXRjaC1haXItZm9yY2Utam9pbnMtdGhlLWdsb2JhbC1mbGVldC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"2016-07-29 By Robbin Laird

An insertion force is characterized by strike, defense, lift, tanking and air battle management that can be effectively integrated to get to an objective area, and then to operate over and within until mission success.

Sustainable reach is a fundamental operational objective.

This means that lift and tanking assets are much more than “support” assets, they are part of the overall sustainable assault force.

For 21st century airpower, several changes are underway with regard to capabilities, and few can be more important than the arrival of new tankers, especially when adding multi-mission capabilities to its core function.

A virtual global fleet of Airbus tankers is emerging based on this need.

Now the Dutch Air Force is joining the virtual global fleet.

According to a press release by the Dutch Ministry of Defence, dated July 28, 2016:

The Netherlands is ready to purchase 2 Airbus tanker/transport aircraft with Luxembourg. The aircraft will be NATO property and will be stationed at Eindhoven Air Base for pooling and sharing. Belgium, Germany, Norway and Poland intend to join the agreement at a later date.

The MRTT (Multi Role Tanker Transport) project is an example of the type of future-oriented collaboration between European countries that the government advocates. Minister of Defence Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert wrote to the House of Representatives to that effect today.

The purchase of the MRTT A330 type aircraft is an important contribution in addressing the scarce tanker and transport capability of the European Union in particular. In addition to refuelling aircraft and strategic transports, MRTT aircraft can also be used for carrying out medical evacuations, if necessary in intensive care units.

Netherlands leading

The fleet will be NATO property. The European Defence Agency (EDA) and the European materiel organisation Organisation Conjointe de Coopération en matière d’ARmement (OCCAR) are closely involved in the purchase of the aircraft, on behalf on the NATO Support & Procurement Agency (NSPA). Luxembourg and the Netherlands will have exclusive user rights. In addition to the purchase, the MRTT project also covers maintenance and operational deployment. The Netherlands is the lead nation in this multinational collaboration project.

The new aircraft will be stationed at Eindhoven Air Base. The Netherlands will also be responsible for registering the aircraft and monitoring their airworthiness. A study will be carried out to determine whether European Air Transport Command, which is also stationed in Eindhoven, will be able to supervise the MRTT pool.

Costs and personnel will be allocated on the basis of the number of flying hours that each country needs. The expected life span of the fleet is 30 years and the investment budget is between €250 million and €1 billion.

Expansion

The Netherlands and Luxembourg recorded the agreement in a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). The contract with Airbus was signed today. If Belgium, Germany, Norway and Poland decide to take part in the agreement, both the MoU and the quotation given by Airbus allow for expansion. If more countries do indeed decide to join, the design costs will be shared with these countries too, leading to lower costs for Luxembourg and the Netherlands. The number of A330 MRTT aircraft to be purchased could eventually rise to 8. According to the National Aerospace Laboratory, Eindhoven Air Base has sufficient room for manoeuvre in its allotted noise zones to accommodate 8 A330 MRTT aircraft.

Collaboration

The 2 participating countries are examining the possibility of collaboration with France and the United Kingdom, among others, in relation to training and instruction as well as maintenance. France is set to receive its first A330 aircraft in 2018. The United Kingdom already has A330 MRTTs in service.

The 2 aircraft will be delivered from 2020. In the same year, the Royal Netherlands Air Force will start to gradually decommission its 2 KDC-10 aircraft. This will ensure that tanker/transport capability will remain available to the Netherlands Defence organisation.

MMF Background White Paper

I have visited the KC-30A fleet at Amberly in Australia, and we have discussed the aircraft with RAAF personnel during a period of testing at Edwards AFB earlier this year.

I am currently in Australia and hope to re-visit Amberly next week to get an update on both the KC-30A and then the Wedgetail at Williamtown Air Base as well.

https://sldinfo.com/an-update-on-the-aussie-tanker-milestone-passed-in-middle-east-operations/

In 2008, the USAF selected the Airbus A300MRTT tanker. It was a clear winner from the standpoint of what the USAF wanted from a tanker.

But politics and the anomalies of the US acquisition process intruded and the next Administration picked a Boeing tanker, one which has yet to enter the USAF inventory.

For the USAF leadership, the Airbus tanker was clearly better, with its size and its ability to hold fuel in its wings, the potential for using the space on the aircraft, inside and out was especially compelling, notably with the introduction of the F-22 and the coming of the F-35 and its data rich generating capabilities.

The tanker could become part of the battlespace and work with fifth generation aircraft in a compelling manner.

There was much comment generated by the GAO, the press, analysts and pundits on that selection and that competition.

But the reality is the reality.

It is not just about points of view.

The A330 tanker has won every competition worldwide since the loss in the United States with the single exception of the recent announcement by Japan of adding the new Boeing tanker to their original order of a different variant of the 767 tanker.

And the Australians, as the lead nation, have already demonstrated what a capable platform it is, and a centerpiece for the global reach of the RAAF.

With the USAF not becoming the lead nation for the new Airbus tanker, that task fell to Australia.

88682 random 1.0 5.0

The Aussies normal acquisition path is to buy a foreign product, and work with the service or services who have put that platform into practice, and then work the platform into operations leveraging the work of the lead or operating force using the platform.

This was different.

The RAAF now was in the lead and worked with Airbus to bring the tanker into operation.

At the recent Airbus Defence and Space Trade Media Brief, an update was provided on the tanker from the operational and developmental point of view.

2016-06-26 Second Line of Defense attended the Airbus Defence and Space Trade Media Brief held in Munich Germany on June 20 and 21st 2016.

We will be reporting on a number of the presentations and the launch discussion of the new H Force weapons system by Airbus Helicopters.

In this first piece, we will focus upon the presentation by Jerónimo Amador, the head of marketing for the A330 MRTT and other Airbus derivatives.

The first day started with the head of Airbus Defence and Space, Dirk Hoke, greeting the journalists attending the two event. The CEO told the gathering that the new strategy of the sector would be announced in the Fall and launched then. But clearly, the presentations, which followed, highlighted elements of that strategy and foreshadowed the way ahead.

Probably, no two presentations highlighted this more than the one on the tanker or from a group perspective the H force weapons presentations and demonstration on day two. They did so in a core way: these are very flexible, modular, and upgradeable systems, with software upgradeability playing a key role.

The tanker is in the hands of several operational air forces, and as such is becoming an established global fleet.

The user groups are key drivers for further change in the program, and the correlation with the A330 means that innovations driven from the commercial sector can be applied as well to the military derivative, the A330 tanker.

The global nature of the fleet and its operations means that shared experiences are being generated and shared by the users….

An overview on the tanker was provided by Airbus Defence and Space in a press release dated July 2016:

The Airbus A330 MRTT Multi Role Tanker Transport Aircraft is the only new generation tanker/transport flying, and certified today, and is battle-proven in recent coalition operations.

In service with the air forces of Australia, UAE, Saudi Arabia and UK, the A330 Multi Role Tanker Transport (MRTT) provides military strategic air transport as well as air-to-air refuelling capabilities.

It is based on the latest medium to long range, twin-aisle, commercial aircraft of the Airbus fly-by-wire family, the A330. More than 1,600 of these have been sold to over 100 customers and nearly 1,300 are operated all around the globe, ensuring easy support and many years of commercial life ahead.

The civil version from which the A330 MRTT is derived, the A330-200, already benefits from the most up-to-date design and manufacturing techniques, and integrates the most advanced avionics as well as proven fly-by-wire control systems which allow total flight envelope protection.

Representing the state-of-the-art in its category, the A330-200 has a maximum range of 8,000 nm/ 14,800 km, with a maximum speed of Mach 0.86. It is the primary choice as a platform for a tanker/transport, offering the best performance at the lowest investment and costs, and has won every major competition outside the USA that it has entered since launch.

Critically, the A330-200 wing is large enough to hold all the fuel needed in the tanking role without requiring any additional fuel tanks and so avoiding any reduction in its ability to carry passengers or cargo.

For air-to-air refuelling missions, the A330 MRTT is provided with the advanced Airbus Defence and Space Aerial Refuelling Boom System (ARBS), to refuel receptacle-equipped aircraft such as the F-16 Fighting Falcon, F-35 Lightning II, or even the A330 MRTT itself (when fitted with an UARRSI).

The Airbus Military ARBS is the only new generation boom in service, permitting the fastest fuel transfer rate and greatly reducing the refuelling operation time. Refuelling can be performed at any altitude up to 35,000 ft while cruising at speeds between 180 kt and 300 kt.

To refuel probe-equipped receivers such as Eurofighter, Tornado, Mirage and Sukhoi models, the A330 MRTT is fitted with two Cobham 905E under-wing hose and drogue pods.

All the AAR (Air to Air Refuelling) systems are controlled from an advanced Fuel Operator Console that is positioned in the cockpit and features an Enhanced Video monitoring System to perform day and night refuelling.

To go further or stay longer on station, the A330 MRTT can be fitted with a Universal Aerial Refuelling Receptacle Slipway Installation (UARRSI) which allows refuelling from another tanker’s boom.

Able to refuel any receiver, the A330 MRTT can carry up to 111 tonnes / 245,000 lb of fuel in its tanks. In a deployment mission, the A330 MRTT enables four Eurofighters, to fly 3,600 nm / 5,794 km by refuelling them en-route, or, when carrying 20 tonnes / 44,800lb of payload, to deploy four fighters a distance of 2,800 nm / 4,500km.

The A330 MRTT can also be used on “towline” missions, whereby it can be on station at about 1,000 nm /1,600km from its base for some four hours 30 minutes, with the capability to provide 50 tonnes of fuel to receivers. Or it can provide 60 tonnes /2,170 pounds of fuel while remaining on station for five hours at 500 nm / 800 km from base. This exceeds by far what any other current tanker can offer.

With its true widebody fuselage, the A330 MRTT is ideal to carry a wide range of military or humanitarian payloads on strategic missions. Its cabin is designed to ensure optimum seating configurations in every class, maximising both capacity and comfort. It can accommodate a large variety of layouts, ranging from 253 seats in a three-class configuration, through 298 passengers in two classes, or more than 300 in a single class layout. The cabin is furnished with an attractively modern design.

These features enable a complete range of configurations, from pure troop transport to the complex customization required for VIP guests.

The A330 MRTT is also designed to carry a payload of up to 45 tonnes/99,000 lb.

Thanks to its optimised fuselage cross section, the cargo can conveniently be carried under-floor in any of the standard containers and pallets, ranging from the LD1 to LD3 and LD6, as well as the standard 88×108 inch 463-L NATO military pallets, which can be loaded onto the aircraft through a proven semi-automatic cargo loading system. Some of the cargo can also be carried as non-palletised “bulk”.

The main deck cargo compartment can also be used for cargo, as required, when the aircraft is specified as a freighter. In this instance the main deck is fitted with a large upper deck cargo door and cargo loading devices in the main deck floor. This allows the A330 MRTT to carry up to 26 88×108 inch 463-L NATO military pallets.

Furthermore, the aircraft can also be configured as a combi, to carry freight in the forward part of the main deck and passengers in the aft part.

The A330 MRTT can also be used for medical evacuation (MEDEVAC), as its cabin can easily be converted to accommodate up to 130 stretchers.

It is offered with a customised suite of military avionics and a mission system integrated with civil avionics. A comprehensive survivability package including a Defensive Aid System, fuel tank inerting system and an armoured cockpit are all available.

Already ordered by Australia, France, Korea, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, United Arab Emirates and United Kingdom, the A330 MRTT has also been selected by India and Qatar.
