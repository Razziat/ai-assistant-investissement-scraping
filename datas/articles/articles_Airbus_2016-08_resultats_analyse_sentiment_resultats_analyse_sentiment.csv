Airbus explains how Cabin-Flex enables dense A321neo layouts - Runway Girl Network,"Thu, 18 Aug 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTYvMDgvYWlyYnVzLWV4cGxhaW5zLWhvdy1jYWJpbi1mbGV4LWVuYWJsZXMtZGVuc2UtYTMyMW5lby1sYXlvdXRzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"If the Airbus A321neo is to reach its ultra-high density target of 240 seats, it will need to change the location, layout and number of emergency exit doors. But on the other side of the coin, the aircraft’s role (especially in its A321LR, formerly A321neoLR guise) in replacing the Boeing 757-200’s long-and-thin, often transatlantic routes, means that there are less dense operations where it will not need all four sets of existing doors to be active for evacuation purposes.

Airbus calls this “Cabin-Flex”.

Opening up to RGN, Airbus senior VP of marketing François Caudron explains that “these doors’ configuration flexibility are there to enable all customers’ operational needs without compromising on cabin comfort (18” seats).” Airbus, of course, has for several years emphasised the passenger experience benefits of wider seats, and that — for high density operators — this means that pitch can be reduced to a level below competitor aircraft without the same level of degradation in perception of space.

The crux of the matter is adding a pair of smaller overwing window exits, while deactivating some or all of the A321neo’s four sets of doors. This enables computer-simulated certification of ultra-high-density 240-passenger aircraft.

For the A321neo, this provides a number of passenger count options, of which Airbus has identified four to RGN.

At the most dense, 240 passengers can be accommodated if there are two overwing window exits and three sets of doors are enabled, removing doors 2 in what Airbus terms a “permanently deleted” process.

A step below that is the 220 passenger level, which can be achieved if no overwing window exits are installed but all four sets of doors are enabled.

A step below that is 195 passengers, at which level the first overwing window exit and doors 4 are deactivated.

Below that is an option for a 165-seater that seems to be very much a 757 replacement, taking advantage of the changed density that results from spacious flat business class seats up front, an extra legroom section in the middle and economy down the back.

In essence, fewer people up front means less pressure on the forward evacuation doors, and the density of evacuation options can be moved backwards to match the density of passenger seating.

Airbus notes that this 165-seat model would permanently delete doors 2, activation of one or two of the overwing window exits, moving doors 3 back four frames, and indeed potentially deactivating doors 3.

“‎When door 3 is deactivated it is physically replaced by a door plug covered with a normal side wall lining,” Airbus’ Caudron elaborates to RGN. “It is not visible from the passenger. In that case the A321neo ACF max pax capacity is 165 pax with one single overwing exit and 195 pax with two overwing exits activated.”

If required, Caudron says, “the two pairs of overwing exit doors are permanently and physically installed, and the operator can choose to have one or both activated. Again in case of deactivation a continuous interior lining will be installed.”

“The ability to reconfigure doors is indeed developed to provide in-service flexibility to our customers. On its own it could be done overnight but in reality a customer is likely to change the doors configuration when changing the cabin configuration,” Caudron notes. “It is likely to be carried out in conjunction with the cabin re-arrangement (SB) in a usual 1 week downtime.”

With significant votes of confidence from airline customers this year at the Farnborough Air Show, and the numerous options that the A321neo Cabin-Flex opens up, Airbus seems in a remarkable place of strength in the re-engined narrowbody market.

The sound of innovation: Airbus studies noise reduction at a new acoustic lab - Airbus,"Tue, 02 Aug 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDE2LTA4LXRoZS1zb3VuZC1vZi1pbm5vdmF0aW9uLWFpcmJ1cy1zdHVkaWVzLW5vaXNlLXJlZHVjdGlvbi1hdC1hLW5ldy1hY291c3RpYy1sYWLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Acoustic Flight Lab at ZAL Hamburg

Airbus has a long history of pioneering advanced technology that creates new and better ways for people to fly – and now, with one new facility, innovation at Airbus has never sounded so good.This resource is an acoustic lab in Hamburg, Germany that for the first time allows it to investigate cabin noise and vibrations using a representative fuselage segment that approximates an A320-sized aircraft. The new test platform at the Centre for Applied Aviation Research (ZAL) is a breakthrough in noise testing – which previously was evaluated by studying isolated components or during test flights.""Noise is a highly sensitive topic,"" explained Henning Scheel, who is co-leading research at the acoustic lab. “Some noises are easy to ignore, even at high volumes. Others are deeply annoying.”Established to help facilitate advances that will continue to make Airbus aircraft cabins the quietest and most comfortable in the sky, the ZAL’s 8.5-metre-long fuselage demonstrator can be subjected to sound waves around its full circumference via a system of 128 individually controllable speakers. This setup was designed to replicate engine noise from existing and future propulsion concepts.""The acoustic lab accurately reproduces conditions that apply in flight,” Scheel said. “This allows us to examine new noise reduction measures in the cabin, rendering expensive test flights unnecessary. The acoustic chamber also offers us the opportunity to perform detailed comparisons between simulation models and real-world physics.""With the expertise gained at the ZAL acoustic lab, Airbus’ interior noise teams are pinpointing where noise enters the cabin and how it is spread and transmitted. They then can explore how background noise can be reduced – for example, by making minor structural modifications, using different types of insulation, or applying new materials such as embedded vibration dampers that absorb noise in a specific frequency range.""We will significantly shorten the development cycle for new solutions with the help of this demonstrator,"" added Martin Wandel, who co-leads the research with Scheel.The ZAL chamber can accommodate fuselage demonstrators of up to eight metres high and 15 metres long, including for Airbus’ A350 XWB and A330 widebody product lines. The initial fuselage mock-up will be thoroughly investigated before work begins on representative cabin interior components. Tests with passengers also are planned in the acoustic lab’s future.Across the company, Airbus employees in Hamburg and Toulouse, France work on interior noise – studying the cabin, cockpit and crew rest compartments. In addition, experts in Toulouse are investigating solutions for reducing engine noise.At Hamburg, the acoustic lab is part of a newly-created infrastructure at the ZAL, which opened earlier this year as the technological research and development network for the Hamburg metropolitan region’s civil aviation industry. The ZAL functions as an interface between the aviation sector, academic and research institutions, and the City of Hamburg – with Airbus Operations GmbH being one of the three largest shareholders.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.8067359328269958}",neutral,0.8067359328269958,0
Airbus and Boeing Brace for a Crucial Phase in Their Subsidies Dispute - Fortune,"Tue, 16 Aug 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAxNi8wOC8xNi9haXJidXMtYm9laW5nLXN1YnNpZGllcy1kaXNwdXRlL9IBQ2h0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAxNi8wOC8xNi9haXJidXMtYm9laW5nLXN1YnNpZGllcy1kaXNwdXRlL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The world’s two largest jetmakers are bracing for the next round in a transatlantic spat over billions of dollars of aircraft subsidies, amid accusations of widening U.S. support for Boeing and persistent European aid to Airbus.

After a year-long lull, the world’s biggest trade dispute will enter a crucial phase in coming months, potentially casting a shadow over faltering efforts by the European Union and United States to negotiate a wider free-trade deal.

At stake are mutual claims of unfair subsidies to the two planemakers that raise the prospect of $22 billion a year in threatened trade sanctions, though many say a resolution remains years away and could ultimately involve a negotiated settlement.

The dispute, said to be the biggest in terms of value and time, dates back to 2004 when the U.S. urged the World Trade Organization (WTO) to act against European government loans to help Airbus develop jets such as the A380, followed by a counter-claim from the EU over federal and local aid for Boeing.

In separate rulings, the WTO found that both planemakers had benefited from billions of dollars of unfair subsidies.

The case is now bogged down in arguments over whether each side complied with orders to withdraw illegal subsidies and undo the effects of the majority of aid which, although not banned, can be challenged if it can be proved to be damaging.

After a three-year delay due to the strain placed on its resources by the marathon dispute, the WTO is expected to rule within weeks on whether the EU obeyed its rulings, followed by a similar report on U.S. compliance early next year.

Both sides claim the other ignored the thousands of pages of judgements and appeal findings in each case and have sought WTO permission to draw up sanctions, with the U.S. calling for up to $10 billion in counter-measures and the EU $12 billion.

U.S. sources have said they are confident the WTO will find the EU flouted its decisions, while the European side has called U.S. accusations “empty.”

TAX-BREAK CHALLENGE

Together, the cases affecting tens of thousands of aerospace jobs are seen as the biggest test of a multilateral system for resolving trade disputes since the WTO was founded in 1995.

Any sanctions could further complicate relations as the U.S. and EU remain bogged down in differences over a proposed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), amid growing anti-trade sentiment on both sides of the Atlantic.

As the two existing Airbus-Boeing cases that have dominated the WTO’s disputes forum for more than a decade creep towards a conclusion, a third WTO dispute affecting the world’s two largest planemakers is simultaneously gathering pace.

Last year, the EU complained that Boeing was set to receive unfair support for its latest plane, the 777X, from Washington state thanks to an $8.7 billion package of expanded tax breaks.

In a confidential draft report, a WTO panel found Boeing would get some fresh subsidy from the tax decision, although it rejected several EU arguments, three people familiar with the case said.

One European source called it an important win for the EU.

A U.S. source denied this, saying claims that the EU is poised to win the case are “false,” and a distraction from its inaction over earlier WTO rulings, but declined further comment.

The WTO and all the parties declined comment.

No publication date has been set for the interim findings, but they are typically released a few months after parties see a copy.

Previous WTO rulings on aircraft subsidies have been bitterly disputed, with both sides finding support for their arguments in the trade body’s decisions and there are no signs that this report will be any different when it is published.

In parallel previous rulings, the WTO found both sides had doled out subsidies worth billions of dollars to their leading planemakers, sparking feuds between Airbus and Boeing over which side had won a greater percentage of the arguments in each case.

The latest dispute over Washington tax measures adds a third pillar to the sprawling trade dispute and, just like earlier cases, is expected to take years of legal arguments and appeals.

The EU argues that the 2013 package of preferential business tax rates, tax credits and tax exemptions represented subsidies to Boeing in return for securing the coveted 777X jetliner work.

It also claims the support falls into the WTO’s most severe category, that of “prohibited” subsidies, because it depends on the use of domestic over imported goods.

U.S. industry sources argue the measures are available to any aerospace company in the state, including even a few suppliers to Airbus, and don’t fall into the WTO’s subsidy net.

Washington state’s 2013 tax package for aerospace companies is largely the same as an earlier 2003 package, which the WTO found caused “serious prejudice.”

The 2013 law extended all of the 2003 benefits from 2024 to 2040, and added exemptions for sales and use taxes on new plants used to manufacture airplanes, wings or fuselages.

In 2011, the WTO ruled earlier versions of the incentives from Washington state were subsidies that caused “serious prejudice” to Airbus, but rejected Europe’s claim that they crossed the line of support that is prohibited automatically.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9983648657798767}",neutral,0.9983648657798767,0
Will United's new president open door for Airbus? - Leeham News and Analysis,"Tue, 30 Aug 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNi8wOC8zMC93aWxsLXVuaXRlZHMtbmV3LXByZXNpZGVudC1vcGVuLWRvb3ItYWlyYnVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Aug. 30, 2016, © Leeham Co.: Will Scott Kirby’s move from president of American Airlines to the same position at United Airlines lead to a major shift in fleet acquisition at the Chicago-based carrier?

This is an intriguing question that may take some time to answer.

Kirby spent 20 years with American CEO Doug Parker through their careers at America West Airlines, US Airways and American.

Airbus vs Boeing

While at America West, the airline evolved from an exclusive Boeing customer to an exclusive Airbus customer. US Airways was already an exclusive Airbus customer

by the time Parker, Kirby and team acquired the airline, adopting the US Airways name over America West.

(We’re talking about new orders in this context.)

American Airlines was for decades an exclusive Boeing customer. American broke this mold in 2011 with huge orders for Airbus A320-family ceo and neo aircraft. (Boeing received a large 737 MAX order at the same time), pre-dating US Airways’ acquisition of American, retaining the latter’s name.

United Airlines

Today’s United is the product of a merger with Continental Airlines. Legacy United was a major Airbus customer, favoring the A320 over the 737. UAL also ordered the Airbus A350-1000.

Continental was an exclusive Boeing customer. Following the merger, the Continental management assumed control of United, Except for increasing the A350-1000

order, the new United remained loyal to Boeing.

Fleet planning and key people in finance are still legacy Continental, but the top management now has changed.

Chairman and CEO Oscar Munoz, who was on the board of directors, replaced Jeff Smisek, who was forced out in a scandal involving the Port of New York and New Jersey, operator of the Newark (NJ) Airport, UAL’s largest hub.

Munoz’ position about fleet acquisition and any loyalty to Boeing isn’t known.

But Scott Kirby’s position clearly is. He’s been a customer of Airbus for years.

Fleet Planning

The Continental-born-and-bred fleet planners and finance people told LNC on various occasions that they aren’t opposed to Airbus aircraft. Boeing simply offered better commercial terms when technical evaluation has been close.

Still, new United remained loyal to Boeing up to now. Whether Kirby steers a different course remains to be seen.

Middle of the Market

His first opportunity might come as early as next year. That’s when Boeing may launch the New Mid-range Airplane (NMA) program for the Middle of the Market sector.

Although the MOM airplane concept began life as a Boeing 757 replacement, today the generally accepted specifications are more aligned with a replacement for the Boeing 767-200/300. United still has a large fleet of 757s and 767s. It, along with American and Delta Air Lines, are prime targets for a Boeing NMA.

Airbus, however, appears to be waiting to see what Boeing will do. Its approach to a MOM airplane appears much less clear than Boeing’s.

UK military orders third high-altitude pseudo satellite from Airbus - SpaceNews,"Thu, 18 Aug 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS91ay1taWxpdGFyeS1vcmRlcnMtdGhpcmQtaGlnaC1hbHRpdHVkZS1wc2V1ZG8tc2F0ZWxsaXRlLWZyb20tYWlyYnVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"HALIFAX, Nova Scotia – The British Defence Ministry on Aug. 17 said it had exercised an option for a third solar-powered, high-altitude surveillance and communications platform from Airbus Defence and Space, with flight trials to begin in mid-2017.

The Airbus Zephyr-S aircraft, one of several designs of what are called high-altitude pseudo satellites, or HAPS, is designed to operate for up to 45 days before landing for refurbishment and to provide a range of persistent surveillance and communications services.

The Defence Ministry has not disclosed how it intends to use the vehicles, the first two of which were purchased in February under a contract valued at 13 million British pounds ($17.4 million).

“The additional Zephyr-S will allow 2 airframes to be tested simultaneously and demonstrate operational handover to show that the capability could be sustained indefinitely,” the ministry said in a statement. “The OCD (Operational Concept Demonstrator) trials, which will be held in 2017, will inform Defence’s decisions around how best to provide next-generation battlefield intelligence to the UK Armed Forces.”

Airbus said the Zephyr-S version, with a 25-meter wingspan, is 30 percent lighter than its predecessor and can carry 50 percent more batteries, boosting the amount of surveillance or communications payload it can carry.

The company said Zephyrs, to operate at 65,000 feet in altitude above air traffic, “can be used for humanitarian missions, precision farming, environmental and security monitoring, and to provide internet coverage to regions of poor or zero connectivity,” in addition to military missions.

British Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said in a statement:

“Zephyr is a cutting-edge, record-breaking piece of kit that will be capable of gathering constant, reliable information over vast geographical areas at a much greater level of detail than ever before.

“They are part of our plan for stronger and better defence, backed by a budget that will rise each year of this decade. That means more ships, more aircraft, more troops available at readiness, better equipment for special forces, more being spent on cyber – to deal with the increased threats to our country.”

Zephyr is one of several HAPS designs being developed in Europe and the United States. The French government is providing funds to develop a stratospheric HAPS called Stratobus, whose initial market is expected to be for Earth observation. The U.S. Army has contracted with Lockheed Martin to test Lockheed’s High Altitude Long Endurance-Demonstrator (HALE-D) in view to development of a larger, operational High-Altitude Airship.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9995610117912292}",neutral,0.9995610117912292,0
Kuwait Orders French Airbus Transport Helicopters in $1.1 Billion Deal - Defense News,"Tue, 09 Aug 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS9haXIvMjAxNi8wOC8wOS9rdXdhaXQtb3JkZXJzLWZyZW5jaC1haXJidXMtdHJhbnNwb3J0LWhlbGljb3B0ZXJzLWluLTEtMS1iaWxsaW9uLWRlYWwv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Paris – Kuwait on Tuesday ordered 30 Airbus Helicopters Caracal military transport helicopters in a deal worth more than €1 billion ($1.1 billion), the latest step in a long-term tie between the Gulf nation and France, the French ministry of defense said.

""This contract, worth more than €1 billion, reflects a strategic relationship between Kuwait and France built on more than 30 years of French commitment to the Emirate, notably in the conflict following the 1990 invasion of Kuwait,"" the ministry said in a statement.

The Kuwaiti defense minister signed the deal with his French counterpart Jean-Yves Le Drian attending, the ministry said. France still has a defense agreement with Kuwait.

Airbus Helicopters signed the contract with the Kuwait defense ministry for 30 H225M Caracal helicopters, including service and support, the company said in a statement. The Kuwait Air Force and National Guard will fly the helicopters for combat search and rescue, and naval operations.

A first delivery of the Caracal is due in 29 months, with the last in 48 months, said an official in the French ministerial team, France 24 reported, citing Agence France-Presse. The helicopters will be delivered with machine guns, and a contract for anti-ship missiles could be negotiated later, the official said. The deal includes training for crews and maintenance staff as well as two years' worth of support service.

Meanwhile, business daily Les Echos reported bilateral talks are nearing conclusion on the sale of 120 Sherpa light vehicles from Renault Trucks Defense, modernization of eight Kuwait patrol boats, and missiles for the 28 Eurofighter Typhoon fighters already ordered. The total amount of the Kuwaiti orders for French weapons could be €2.5 billion, or $2.78 billion.

The French president's office said June last year that talks with Kuwait for 24 Caracals were expected to lead to a contract soon, Reuters reported then. The order for that smaller number would be worth about €1 billion, a defense ministry official said at the time.

The Kuwaiti military contract is seen as vital to maintaining production at Airbus Helicopters' Marignane factory, southern France, as the civil side has been reeling after a crash in April in Norway of a Super Puma, with the loss of 13 lives.

Caracal is the military version of Super Puma, seen as a workhorse for the offshore oil industry, which has cut helicopter orders due to weakness in the oil price.

""By this decision, Kuwait strengthens the strategic partnership which has tied our two countries together for many decades and we are today engaged side-by-side in the struggle against Daesh in Iraq and Syria,"" said Le Drian.

Kuwait has more than 40 years of ties with Airbus Helicopters, with the armed forces flying the Super Puma, Puma and Gazelle, chief executive Guillaume Faury said in a statement.

On April 5, the Gulf state signed a contract worth €7.957 billion, or $8.83 billion, for 28 Eurofighters, of which 22 will be single-seat and six twin-seat.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999516010284424}",neutral,0.9999516010284424,0
Airbus Helicopters braces for post-Turøy impact - Vertical Magazine,"Wed, 31 Aug 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLWhlbGljb3B0ZXJzLWJyYWNlcy1wb3N0LXR1cm95LWltcGFjdC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters is reviewing its options after the H225 (EC225 LP) crash that killed 13 people on April 29 in Turøy, Norway, further damaging the reputation of the Super Puma heavy twin family among the offshore workforce. While the root cause of the accident is not yet known, the impact of the accident on the Marignane, France-based manufacturer is palpable.

“[Our] helicopters [division] is still very much impacted by the tragic accident in Norway,” said Airbus Group CEO Tom Enders during an analysts call in late July.

At the time, an Airbus Helicopters spokesman told Vertical that “it is too early for us to talk about implications” for the long-term future of the H225 following the crash and resulting grounding of much of the aircraft’s worldwide fleet. Rather, the company is endeavoring to communicate with customers — a lesson learned from previous crises.

The manufacturer is striving to keep proactive. Norwegian investigators have stated their belief that the initiating event in the main gearbox was a fatigue failure, which Airbus is addressing with emergency alert service bulletins (EASBs). An example is a precautionary measure for those helicopters still flying, such as in search-and-rescue or parapublic operations. Two types of epicyclic module second stage planet gears are in service. One has been deemed more reliable. The EASB describes how to replace one with another.

Despite Airbus Helicopters’ efforts, in early June, CHC, the operator involved in the crash, announced a major restriction for the type. It said it no longer intends to use the H225 from Aberdeen, U.K. — its largest base in the North Sea. Only for those customers who “wish to fly the aircraft” will the company “appropriately adjust the mix of aircraft.”

However, this will only take place after civil aviation authorities lift flight prohibition on the H225 and AS332 L2 Super Puma. “We are engaged in discussions with EASA to see when we can release the Super Puma fleet again,” Enders said. He added that 80 percent of the worldwide fleet is grounded. The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) estimate 340 and five aircraft, respectively, are affected by their airworthiness directives. The AS332 L1 — 450 helicopters under the EASA’s oversight — is not affected.

In the history of aviation, very few situations are comparable, said Teal Group analyst Richard Aboulafia. He pointed to the FAA withdrawal of the type certificate for the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 for five weeks in 1973, following the discovery of a serious design deficiency after a fatal accident in Chicago. The tragic event was not the only one in the early years of the program, and contributed to a loss of confidence from airlines at the time, Aboulafia noted.

For Airbus Helicopters, regaining trust from customers, pilots and passengers will be a daunting task. A Norwegian source familiar with the local industry’s reaction said Super Puma safety remains “a big issue among pilots.” The source also said industry members in the country would have liked to have seen more of Airbus Helicopters CEO Guillaume Faury in the media; he gave only one interview to a Norwegian TV news channel, the source said.

The U.K.’s National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) has numerous members working on offshore rigs and thus commuting by helicopter. The RMT heard widespread, strong backlash about the aircraft after the accident — the RMT’s regional organizer in Aberdeen received over 70 related emails in just six days, and all were expressing negative feelings about the Super Puma. This sentiment was echoed in a change.org online petition, purportedly representing North Sea Offshore Oil Workers and their families, which called for the H225 to be permanently removed from service. It received over 27,000 signatures.

Such groups, different from airline passengers, are concentrated and coordinated. They could have some influence, Teal Group’s Aboulafia believes.

Les Linklater, the executive director of Step Change In Safety, an organization dedicated to safety improvement in the offshore oil-and-gas industry, warns against the idea of singling out a type. In an column published on Energyvoice.com on May 13, he noted the loss of two Sikorsky S-76s in a six-month period in 2015-2016 in Nigeria, with six fatalities in the first accident. No regulatory response was seen in the U.K. “There was no call to ban this aircraft or the operator from transporting workers to and from offshore installations in S-76s, despite the fact that we continue to use them in the U.K,” Linklater wrote.

The Sikorsky S-92 is the preferred H225 alternative by many in the workforce, he went on. However, the S-92’s gearbox has had its share of trouble. In 2009, 17 people lost their lives off the coast of Canada on board this model of aircraft due to gearbox issues, Linklater wrote. An improved main gearbox for the S-92 has been in development since 2013 or even earlier. In February this year, Sikorsky could not give a target date for entry into service.

Asked about the Super Puma’s design, Aboulafia says it has been serving “so well and for so long” that he doubts the problem can be “a fundamental design flaw.”

At the Marignane factory, H225 production is running at a slow pace. But this would likely have been the same without the accident. The offshore market is “completely down, meaning that not a single order was booked worldwide by any manufacturer in the medium-heavy segment for the oil-and-gas business in the first half of the year,” according to Airbus Group’s Enders.

As for the other members in Super Puma family, the H215, which combines the AS332 C1/L1’s older dynamic systems with the H225’s modern avionics, is not affected by the grounding. The first example is to roll out next year from Airbus’s new factory in Romania.

In terms of the military versions of the Super Puma, Airbus hopes to conclude more sales campaigns this year. Poland is the number one prospect, after Kuwait inked a contract in early August (see sidebar). French forces have kept the Cougar (the equivalent of the AS332 C1/L1) and the H225M Caracal (the H225’s military variant) in service.

The Airbus Helicopters spokesman would not confirm reports that Singapore has postponed, due to the ongoing investigation and grounding, a decision on a $1 billion military helicopter purchase.

The airframer is proceeding with the development of the HForce generic weapon system that can be adapted to its range of commercial rotorcraft. A firing campaign took place recently with an H225M. One could see this is as evidence the manufacturer trusts its design.

The spokesman could not give an update, however, on the development of the upgraded H225. Formerly known as the EC225e, it features an increased maximum takeoff weight and further automation in the cockpit. In February, Airbus Helicopters was planning on a first delivery by year-end.

Further up the design pipeline, the firm has been preparing a replacement for the Super Puma under the X6 codename. Unveiled last year, the X6 is in a two-year “concept phase” until 2017. And, as we’re still in the early stages of fallout from the current Super Puma situation, it’s unlikely the X6’s development will be sped up any time soon. Such an acceleration would also be costly.

In Aboulafia’s view, the current circumstances illustrate the benefit of being part of a larger corporation for Airbus Helicopters. When parent company Airbus Group released its first-half financial results on July 27, CFO Harald Wilhelm said that “the financial impact [of the H225 situation] cannot be reliably estimated at this stage.” And, in addition to the 11 fewer Super Puma deliveries recorded in the first half of the year, “this is going to impact the support business,” he predicted.

Kuwait orders 30 H225Ms

On Aug. 9, Airbus Helicopters signed a contract with the Kuwait Ministry of Defense for 30 H225Ms. The deal includes associated support and services.

The order can be seen as a token of confidence from a long-term customer. “I would like to personally thank the Kuwait Air Force which placed its trust in our products,” CEO Faury said. The first delivery, however, will not take place until 2018, thus not boosting the production rate for the short term, according to a union source.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.528112530708313}",neutral,0.528112530708313,0

Airbus wants to make the flying car a reality.

The aircraft manufacturer is designing a flying taxi, named CityAirbus, that can fly itself to make commuting easier in traffic-heavy cities. Airbus wrote on its website that the flying taxi will be part of a fleet so you can summon it on your smartphone.

""Techies in Silicon Valley invent high-tech products every day. However, they still do not have a solution for one of their biggest problems: rush hour,"" Airbus wrote on its website announcing the project. ""In response, Airbus Group experts are looking skywards to develop radical concepts that will relieve urban congestion.""

The biggest challenge is creating the system that will allow the CityAirbus to fly autonomously, Airbus wrote on the website. Airbus said that the taxi will first be operated by a pilot, but will fly autonomously once federal regulations are put in place that allow that.

Airbus is also creating an electric, autonomous helicopter that can be used for commercial or personal use called Project Vahana. Airbus is aiming to conduct its first flight tests of the Vahana prototype vehicle by 2017 — a goal Rodin Lyasoff, the engineer leading the project, said sounds ambitious but is entirely feasible. ""Many of the technologies needed, such as batteries, motors and avionics are most of the way there,"" he wrote on the website.

""I’m no big fan of Star Wars, but it’s not crazy to imagine that one day our big cities will have flying cars making their way along roads in the sky,” Airbus CEO Tom Enders said in the announcement. “In a not too distant future, we’ll use our smartphones to book a fully automated flying taxi that will land outside our front door – without any pilot.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999048709869385}",neutral,0.9999048709869385,0

""The discussions are going on,"" said a French defense official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""They are extremely active.""

Talks on the technology transfer are crucial as they will allow local industry to assemble the utility helicopter, which Poland picked over competing offers from Leonardo-Finmeccanica and Lockheed Martin's Sikorsky.

The Polish Ministry of Defence selected the Caracal, but the country's Ministry of Development is now negotiating with Airbus Helicopters on the technology transfer.

The Polish requirement is highly specific and will require development to equip the helicopter to meet the multirole needs. Poland wants to arm the helicopter with a missile, a specification which Airbus Helicopters can meet. Sikorsky was denied permission to build an armed version of its Black Hawk by its previous parent company, United Technologies. Lockheed Martin, which has signed up a client for its design for an armed Black Hawk, displayed the helicopter with weapons at the Farnborough International Airshow.

Separately, Airbus Helicopters is responding to a Polish request for information for a combat helicopter and is offering its Tiger helicopter.

Poland also has a requirement for a light utility helicopter, an aircraft along the lines of the Lakota aircraft, which Airbus has delivered to the US Army. The Polish authorities have yet to issue a request for information for the light helicopter.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999622106552124}",neutral,0.9999622106552124,0

Airbus Helicopters delivers first H175 to be operated in the Americas - Vertical Magazine,"Wed, 24 Aug 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2FpcmJ1cy1oZWxpY29wdGVycy1kZWxpdmVycy1maXJzdC1oMTc1LW9wZXJhdGVkLWFtZXJpY2FzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The new seven-ton class helicopter has now arrived in Mexico, where it has joined the fleet of Transportes Aéreos Pegaso, a company specialized in air transport services for the energy industry in the Gulf of Mexico.

This makes Transportes Aéreos Pegaso the first company to operate this new helicopter on the American continent. A second H175 will be delivered in 2017.

The new aircraft will not only be providing transport services for the oil industry but also supporting seismic exploration activities in the Mexican waters of the Gulf of Mexico.

“We have many years of experience with Airbus Helicopters and we are very proud to be among the first to operate this new helicopter, which has become the industry’s benchmark medium-sized twin-engine rotorcraft,” said Pegaso CEO Enrique Zepeda Navarro.

“We are proud to offer our customers a safe, comfortable and quiet helicopter that is also highly cost-effective and easy to maintain.”

Transportes Aéreos Pegaso has a fleet of more than 30 Airbus Helicopters rotorcraft, mainly H145s and H135s but also H130s and H155s. A few months ago Pegaso signed a framework agreement for 10 H145s and will be among the first Latin American customers to operate this most advanced light twin.

“This delivery reaffirms the relationship of trust that Airbus Helicopters and Transportes Aéreos Pegaso have built up over more than three decades,” said Francisco Navarro, general manager of Airbus Helicopters in México. “Our customers are a vital part of what we do at Airbus Helicopters; this is why the delivery we are now celebrating comes with our commitment to provide Transportes Aéreos Pegaso with a service that meets all the quality and safety standards that characterize our company.”

The H175 destined for Transportes Aéreos Pegaso is equipped with the most advanced version of the Helionix avionics suite – which includes a four-axis autopilot designed to ease crew workload while offering high safety levels.

New avionics features include the auto-hover function and LPV function (localizer performance with vertical guidance) to provide pilots with state-of-the-art piloting and navigation aids.

Since its entry into service in December 2014, the H175 has been flying in support of the oil and gas industry in the North Sea — one of the world’s harshest operational environments — and in Western Africa.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.6547840237617493}",positive,0.6547840237617493,1
Autonomous Airbus drones could be flying us to work by 2027 - New Atlas,"Thu, 18 Aug 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3YXRsYXMuY29tL2FpcmJ1cy1wcm9qZWN0LXZhaGFuYS80NDk4MS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Congestion in cities is at an all-time high, and there seems to be no respite in sight for exasperated motorists. One solution, aside from getting on board a packed train, is to avoid the chaos by taking to the skies. Personal flying cars remain something of a pipe dream, but Airbus belives autonomous commuter aircraft could be a solution to our congestion woes. What's more, the company is actively working to make it happen within the next decade.

Airbus isn't the first company to dip its toe into the aerial commuting waters. Joby is working on a 16-rotor commuter aircraft, Ehang has been cleared to test its 184 taxi drone in Nevada and Volocopter made its first manned flight in April this year. The idea of hopping into a multi-rotor autonomous taxi and flying to work might seem a bit Jetsons now, but there are plenty of people out there working to make it happen.

Details about the electric multi-rotor being developed at Airbus' Silicon Valley-based innovation outpost, A3, through the Vahana project are currently still under wraps. Even so, Airbus Project Executive Rodin Lyasoff says ""many of the technologies needed, such as batteries, motors and avionics are most of the way there.""

Although the hardware is almost ready, the main thing slowing project Vahana down is sense-and-avoid technology. Reliable systems are only just finding their way into cars, and Lyasoff says making them work in autonomous aircraft is ""one of the bigger challenges [the team] aims to resolve as early as possible.""

Skyways is one of Airbus' projects involving commuter aircraft

Exciting as it is, Vahana is still in its infancy. Work started in February this year, with flight testing set to start at the end of 2017. In spite of its relative youth, Airbus is optimistic about when commuters will be able to hop on a drone for their morning commute.

""We believe that global demand for this category of aircraft can support fleets of millions of vehicles worldwide,"" Lyasoff says. ""In as little as 10 years, we could have products on the market that revolutionize urban travel for millions of people.""

In addition to the Vahana project, Airbus also has teams based in Germany and France developing a helicopter-style ""CityAirbus"" to carry multiple passengers. The futuristic design – rendered in the hero image at the top of this article – would initially be operated by pilots, before transitioning to autonomous control when regulations catch up.

Unlike Vahana, CityAirbus is aimed at taking multiple passengers at once, in an attempt to keep passenger costs down. Lessons learned in the multi-passenger craft's development will be passed on to Vahana and Skyway, which is a drone-delivery trial set to take place in Singapore next year.

So, how would all of this work in an ideal world? Well, the zenAIRCITY concept dreamt up by Vassilis Agourdas and Benjamin Struss at Airbus Helicopters imagines travellers ordering a ride on their zenHOP app, choosing a zenHUB in the city to land on while their bags are whisked to the zenHUB using the zenLUGGAGE system. Watching over things is zenCYBER, which will make sure the ride isn't ruined by hackers. (In case you're wondering, the ""zen"" prefix stands for zero emissions and noise.)

It might be science fiction at the moment, but Airbus is convinced such visions will become a reality in the not too distant future.

""I'm no big fan of Star Wars, but it's not crazy to imagine that one day our big cities will have flying cars making their way along roads in the sky,"" says Airbus Group CEO Tom Enders. ""In a not too distant future, we'll use our smartphones to book a fully automated flying taxi that will land outside our front door – without any pilot.""

Lufthansa Premium Economy Review I - One Mile at a Time,"Thu, 04 Aug 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vb25lbWlsZWF0YXRpbWUuY29tL2x1ZnRoYW5zYS1wcmVtaXVtLWVjb25vbXktcmV2aWV3L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"I wanted to introduce my friend Daniel, who will be contributing to the blog going forward. Daniel runs one of the most popular YouTube aviation channels, Dantorp Aviation, which I’ve been watching for years. Daniel will be sharing his travel experiences, including through trip reports. Since he’s based in Sweden, he has more of a European perspective on promotions, travel deals, etc.

With premium economy becoming increasingly popular, below is a trip report from Daniel about his experience in Lufthansa premium economy between Munich and Dubai. I’ve still yet to fly premium economy, so was especially interested in this report.

Thanks for the report, Daniel!

Correction: Lounge access is not free of charge for premium economy passengers. They have the option to purchase access, which is not available to economy class passengers, although I see limited value this perk.

Hello OMAAT readers, let me introduce myself briefly: my name is Daniel and I run a YouTube channel about airplanes and airlines. If you’re interested in either, I’m sure you’d love my channel!

I’ve long been a Lufthansa admirer, much like Ben. Since 2009, I have flown them more than any other airline, partly thanks to the efficiency of traveling from Sweden to the US via Frankfurt or Munich, and partly because of my past loyalty to the Star Alliance through United. Until now, I had never tried anything but economy and their old business class, so I figured it was time to give their premium economy a go.

Lufthansa Flight 638

Munich (MUC) to Dubai (DXB)

16 December 2015

Depart: 10:40PM

Arrive: 07:50AM (+1 day)

Duration: 6hr10min

Aircraft: Airbus A340-600

Seat: 26K (Premium Economy)

Booking

The great thing about Lufthansa premium economy is that it is often reasonably priced – they were selling upgrades for as little as €200 at the gate. It may be worth keeping in mind that upgrades bought at the gate do not earn extra miles, since your booking class will not change. On the other hand, Lufthansa recently introduced an online tool that lets you bid for upgrades, which might be a better option.

Luckily, my friend Julia and I were able to snag the last two available seats together, 26H and 26K.

Transfer and Senator Lounge

Lufthansa’s second biggest hub is Munich, which happens to be the only 5-star airport in Europe. The concourses in terminal 2 are heavily branded by Lufthansa, since they own a 40% stake in the buildings. Transferring in Munich is a breeze, especially now that the new satellite has opened, since there are far less bus gates than before.

I won’t be reviewing the Lufthansa Senator Lounges in the old concourse since Ben has already covered them, but as is generally the case with the Lufthansa Senator/Business Class Lounges, they were pretty nice. Lounge access is included when traveling in premium economy, although you must buy your upgrade before you receive access.

Boarding

As is the norm, Lufthansa starts by boarding first class, followed by business, premium economy and lastly, cattle class economy class. My friend Julia joined me on this trip, and together we boarded through the second boarding door and turned right toward our seats in row 26.

My initial thought was that the cabin looked incredibly stylish, especially when placed in front of infinite rows of blue and yellow economy seats. The premium economy cabin is rather small, with only 32 seats. There is no real divider between the two cabins, so there is a slight loss of intimacy. As opposed to the back of the bus though, there is one less seat per row, but the seat width still only measures up to Airbus’ 18-inch economy standard. As for leg room, it seems about equivalent to the extra leg room seating on US airlines.

Awaiting us at each seat was an amenity kit, headphones, a blanket and a “larger” pillow. As soon as we sat down we were asked if we’d like a pre-departure beverage. While I thought I’d chosen orange juice off the tray, it turns out I had a more exotic orange and mint mix, which was so delicious I was devastated when they didn’t have it on my return flight.

I was positively surprised by the amenity kit as well, which came in a nice little bag, which my friend Julia, as the nerds we are (were 😉 ), suggested we use as pencil cases upon our return to school after Christmas break. It contained all the essentials, plus some extras…

Onboard

The flight was full in all cabins but first and at 10:40pm the purser came on the PA and welcomed us onboard, telling us our flight time would be six hours. We pushed back shortly thereafter and were soon on our way out of a dark and cold European winter.

Shortly after departure, a small snack along with a beverage was served. I opted for the delicious orange juice again, which came with a pretzel mix.

A warm dinner was served about an hour into the flight. Premium economy flyers are usually provided with menus, but as it turned out the menus we’d received were only valid for the previous flight of this aircraft. If you’re still interested in what that might look like, it’s in my video review!

I chose a spinach and ricotta cheese ravioli with mushroom sauce, which came with a basic salad and an apple pie dessert. It was all served with real cutlery, bowls and plates, which was a nice touch. The absence of a menu means that I can’t speak for the other meal options, although I can say that mine was great.

Before the meal, and during the meal, and after the meal, I enjoyed my go-to inflight TV show: Parks and Recreation. Once I’d exhausted the offering of five or six episodes, I decided to call it a night. When I reclined, I had a strange feeling I was in a recliner at home. Lufthansa’s economy class recline usually feels pretty generous. The additional premium economy recline, combined with my tiredness and the late departure of the flight, ensured I slept like a baby.

When doing a six-hour redeye, i.e. NYC-LON, it’s hard to get a good night’s sleep. Even after sleeping three hours, I felt exhausted. Obviously, this was no fault of Lufthansa, but a daytime departure (Lufthansa has a 1pm flight out of Frankfurt to Dubai) could always be worth considering.

The purser woke us up around two hours before landing telling us it was time for our tour of the crew rest. There was no way I could object to that!

Upon returning to our seats, the breakfast service had started. Everyone in premium economy received the same cheese wrap. Few foods are appealing when it’s 4am at your origin, and I rarely find an airplane breakfast that excites me.

That’s when I opened my window blind and saw this – WOW!

Suddenly, I was in the magical Middle East and my morning snack became the perfect wake-up companion.

We slowly started our descent into Dubai International Airport. The views on approach were magnificent, and I couldn’t have had a better welcome to this desert region.

The taxi to the gate took about 10 minutes, and we were on the stand right on schedule. It’s worth noting that when people praise Dubai Airport, they’re most likely talking about terminal 3, not terminal 1, which is used by most foreign carriers.

We bid goodbye to the crew and left for immigration. After a 15 minute walk, we were greeted by a bunch of immigration officials in traditional Arab dress. All I can say is that New York immigration officials should take a hospitality lesson from these guys…

Bottom Line

Overall, I’d say Lufthansa premium economy class is exactly what you would expect from one of the best airlines in Europe. The service was amiable, the food was great and the seat was very comfortable. The biggest benefit is the cost-benefit ratio of this new cabin. As opposed to business class upgrades, which at the cost of €500 each way, would give you a “real” premium experience, upgrades to premium economy start at half that amount. I definitely wouldn’t hesitate to book Lufthansa premium economy again.

For those interested, here’s my full video review of the flight.

Have you flown Lufthansa premium economy before? If so, on which route/aircraft and did you enjoy it as much as I did? Leave your thoughts in the comments below!","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999890327453613}",neutral,0.9999890327453613,0

Too expensive? No, zenMOVE has found three other travellers who also want to get to the city centre. As a result, the flight costs no more than a taxi ride. On top of that, no need to worry about your luggage – zenLUGGAGE takes care of that – or your security, as zenCYBER protects your flight against hacker attacks.""

Boeing may kill the 747 as widebody aircraft fall from favor; Airbus A380 also at risk - ExtremeTech,"Mon, 01 Aug 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5leHRyZW1ldGVjaC5jb20vZXh0cmVtZS8yMzI3MDktYm9laW5nLW1heS1raWxsLXRoZS03NDctYXMtd2lkZWJvZHktYWlyY3JhZnQtZmFsbC1mcm9tLWZhdm9yLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzgwLWFsc28tYXQtcmlza9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"When Boeing introduced the 747, the four-engine jet quickly became an icon of modern air travel. The 747 was designed at a time when Boeing felt it might be quickly replaced by supersonic aircraft -- the distinctive double-decker hump at the front of the plane that now typically offers additional first-class seating was intended to allow for an external cargo door if passengers shifted to faster aircraft. Now, with orders falling, Boeing is considering halting production on one of the most successful and long-lived jet families in history.

Boeing 747 at first roll-out.

The current version of the 747 is known as the 747-8. It's a 250 ft jet with a redesigned wing, raked wingtips, additional internal fuel capacity, and fly-by-wire capability for lateral controls. According to Boeing, the new international version of the 747, the 747-8I, is 30% quieter, 16% more fuel efficient, and offers 13% lower seat costs per mile. The problem, for Boeing, is that not enough customers are actually ordering the 747-8. The company has therefore warned that ""If we are unable to obtain sufficient orders and/or market, production and other risks cannot be mitigated, we could record additional losses that may be material, and it is reasonably possible that we could decide to end production of the 747.""

Customers have been moving away from four-engine widebody aircraft and towards more efficient twin-engine planes with lower operating costs. Boeing's 777 and 787 continue to be popular, and it's not the only widebody company facing a large-scale slowdown. The Airbus A380 may also be headed for an early retirement(Opens in a new window), thanks to a near-total lack of interest in the world's largest jet.

The Airbus A380 is a true double-decker jet and the world's largest passenger jet, but airports that use it had to build new facilities to handle the plane. While it sits between 525 and 853 people depending on the class configuration, its bulk means that relatively few airports can handle the plane. Many US carriers prefer to fly multiple times per day between destinations as a way to meet demand for aircraft, rather than flying a smaller number of flights with a higher number of passengers per plane. As of May, only 319 Airbus A380s had been ordered, with 142 of them ordered by Emirates. Virgin Atlantic and Quantas have both booked aircraft, but the manufacturer has acknowledged that these planes may never be built if the market for the A380 doesn't improve. While Boeing spent much less on their 747-8 extension than Airbus invested in the enormous A380, neither plane may be very profitable. That's particularly true for Airbus, which is expected to eat the estimated $25 billion it cost to build the A380 in the first place.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.8207917213439941}",neutral,0.8207917213439941,0

Cebu Pacific Airbus A330-300 – Image, Airbus

Currently, Cebu Pacific operate a fleet of six A330-300s, using them on destinations from the Philippines to the Middle East and Australia, as well as domestic and regional routes.

For the passenger – these are operated in a high-capacity economy class layout. Seats are in a 3-3-3 formation or 9 across (a break from the normal 2-4-2 formation and Airbus’s 18″ seat width dream). This in turn leads to a rather crushed 16.5 seat width and 30″ seat pitch.

This allows for up 436 passengers at a time to be flown aboard their A330-300s.

Cebu Pacific intends to use these for expansion to the USA – with Lance Gokongwei, Cebu Pacific President and Chief Executive Officer stating

“The A330 has proven to be the right choice for our long haul low fare product,”

“The newly ordered aircraft will enable us to add more long haul routes, including the launch of our first flights to the US. We are excited to be expanding our widebody fleet, offering more low fare options for our customers to fly further than ever before.”

As a prelude to further US services, Cebu has launched a four-times weekly services to Guam.

The growth of the fleet doesn’t seem to be excessive – rather measured as it evaluates its next long haul options, one at a time and with each destination a considered decision.

Where those A330-300s will end up next – will be the interesting part to see.

Kuwait Air Force and Kuwait National Guard to operate 30 H225M Caracal multirole utility helicop



Marignane, 9 August 2016 – Airbus Helicopters has signed a contract with the Kuwait Ministry of Defence for the purchase of 30 H225M Caracal multirole utility helicopters as well as an associated support and services package, during the visit of the French Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian to Kuwait today.



“We are greatly honored that the Kuwait Ministry of Defence has chosen the H225M Caracal as the best platform to fulfill its demanding operational requirements” said Guillaume Faury, CEO of Airbus Helicopters. “Our relationship with Kuwait dates back more than 40 years with Super Pumas, Pumas and Gazelles having been delivered to the Armed Forces of the State of Kuwait over the past decades. This H225M Caracal contract opens a new chapter in our cooperation. I would like to personally thank the Kuwait Air Force which placed its trust in our products to renew its helicopter fleet, and I am also grateful for the confidence of the Kuwait National Guard which has decided to create its helicopter squadron with the support of Airbus Helicopters”, Guillaume Faury added.



During the visit, Airbus Helicopters representatives recognized the key role played by French Minister of Defence Jean-Yves Le Drian who provided his continued support to the realization of this project, in line with the existing France-Kuwait strategic relationship.



Kuwait’s fleet of H225M Caracal will be used for a wide variety of missions such as combat search-and-rescue, naval operations, medical evacuation and military transportation. The helicopters will be operated by the Kuwait Air Force and the Kuwait National Guard. A combat-proven platform with exceptional payload, a world-class automatic flight control system and long endurance, the H225M Caracal has demonstrated its versatility and performance even in the harshest operational environments.



The H225M Caracal is the latest evolution of the successful Super Puma / Cougar family of military helicopters, with more than 500 units delivered worldwide. Kuwait is the latest nation to join the community of Caracal users with 138 H225M Caracal having been ordered so far by France, Brazil, Mexico, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, and Kuwait.

Airbus designed and 3D printed a motorbike inspired by a skeleton - Boing Boing,"Thu, 04 Aug 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vYm9pbmdib2luZy5uZXQvMjAxNi8wOC8wNC9haXJidXMtZGVzaWduZWQtYW5kLTNkLXByaW50ZWQuaHRtbNIBSWh0dHBzOi8vYm9pbmdib2luZy5uZXQvMjAxNi8wOC8wNC9haXJidXMtZGVzaWduZWQtYW5kLTNkLXByaW50ZWQuaHRtbC9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Aerospace corporation Airbus's Light Rider concept motorbike looks a bit like something HR Giger would draw (although his, of course, would be much cooler). In reality, the 3D-printed frame was inspired by skeletal structures that enable its bare-metal frame to weigh just 13 pounds but support a 220 pound rider. From the BBC News:



To design the bike's frame and swingarm rear section, (Airbus's) APWorks team collaborated with Altair Engineering, a US-based consulting company whose structural-design software works through the principle of ""morphogenesis"" — which in biology refers to process of environmental forces defining a natural organism's form and structure. Morphorgenetic software is written to create forms that achieve maximum strength with minimal mass, and Altair's system has contributed to the designs of such boundary-pushing machines as the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, the Volvo Ocean 70 racing yacht, and the jet-powered Bloodhound SSC, which next year will attempt to break the land speed record…



The 3D-printing process employed to produce the Light Rider's frame is a marvel unto itself. The system uses a laser to melt powdered aluminium alloy in thousands of layers, each only 60 microns thick — about the width of a human hair. Airbus Group Innovations, the company's research arm, developed the frame's aircraft-grade alloy, called Scalmalloy, which it claims matches the specific strength of titanium. The fabrication process — and the strength of the material — allows the morphogenetic software to specify finer and thinner structures than traditional tooling or moulding methods of manufacturing can produce. In fact, notes Gruenewald, the Light Rider's frame even features hollow branches that hide cables and other components.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999985933303833}",neutral,0.999985933303833,0

On February 2016, the international company, Airbus Helicopters (formerly Eurocopter), which is a division of Airbus Group, a global leader in aeronautics, space and related services that provides civil and military helicopter solutions, opened a large factory in the Mexican state of Querétaro with an investment of $100 million USD.

According to Aviation week network, a multi-channel based publication that provides aviation industry services, decisions and marketplace, the French-German company said that Mexico is a prize sales territory. “It’s the most promising economy in the region, perhaps more promising than Brazil,” said President/CEO Lutz Bertling, naming Eurocopter’s other hot new growth market in world sales.

The groundbreaking ceremony of this new facility took place almost five years ago, in October 2011, during the IX Business Summit in Queretaro.

On July 16, 2015, Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto along with the president of France, Francois Hollande, toured the Airbus Helicopters facility in Marsella, France, where they flew over the Calanques National Park. The aim of this state visit was to strengthen the relations and economic ties with the French government and Eurocopter.

During the opening ceremony, on February 2016, Peña Nieto stated Mexico does not have to close its borders or put obstacles to trade relations with foreign countries.

Finally, the Secretary of Transports and Communications, Gerardo Ruiz Esparza, said that 100 million dollars were invested in the construction of the new plant, where 200 direct jobs were generated.

Ruiz Esparza also estimated a total investment of 550 million dollars for this project in a 30 year period of time, and finished saying that this enterprise could attract other significant investments from company suppliers.

E-Fan hybrid plane could help develop future electric airliners - CNN,"Sat, 06 Aug 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vdHJhdmVsL2FydGljbGUvb3Noa29zaC1lbGVjdHJpYy1wbGFuZXMvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBPmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uL3RyYXZlbC9hcnRpY2xlL29zaGtvc2gtZWxlY3RyaWMtcGxhbmVz?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Story highlights Airbus unveils new hybrid experimental electric plane Tiny E-Fan 1.2 may help develop a regional airliner that carries 100 people by 2030

Oshkosh, Wisconsin CNN —

Of the 2,800 show planes at America’s biggest airshow, the aircraft that may have had the most impact on aviation’s future didn’t even leave the ground.

It was Airbus Group’s experimental E-Fan 1.2 hybrid electric airplane being unveiled for the first time in the U.S.

The red, white and blue European single-seater — which flies on batteries and regular aviation fuel — is so new and untested that U.S. aviation authorities wouldn’t allow it to fly last month at the Experimental Aircraft Association’s famous AirVenture — more commonly known as “Oshkosh.”

“We’re just at the beginning — the seventh test flight,” said Didier Esteyne, the plane’s lead test pilot and designer. “We still have a lot of work to do in front of us.”

Dirt and noise

So, with the price of traditional fossil fuels so low these days, why so much attention on electric planes?

Large commercial jets are blamed for 11% of all global transportation emissions, according to the federal government, and that number is predicted to explode by 50% by 2050. The E-Fan hybrid could help engineers make key breakthroughs to developing cleaner, quieter electric airliners that travelers might be flying on in less than two decades.

Crossing the Channel, cleanly and quietly

Esteyne made news last year when he flew an all-electric version of the plane — the E-Fan 1.1 — across the English Channel.

It was a meaningful moment for him and for everyone who helped develop the aircraft. “Even though I was flying alone, we were many people together when I crossed the Channel,” Esteyne recalled.

Esteyne was at Oshkosh to introduce his newest plane to America. Curious air show attendees gathered around him asking questions about how the E-Fan hybrid worked.

Take a tour of the E-Fan 1.2

He told them about how the combustion engine gives the plane a 2-hour-15-minute range — extending the flight time of the previous version – the 1.1 – by an hour and 15 minutes.

He explained how the combustion engine sits behind the cockpit, and is only used to charge the plane’s lithium-ion batteries which are embedded in the wings. The combustion engine doesn’t provide any of the plane’s thrust.

The two ducted fan engines that do give the plane its thrust are mounted on each side of the fuselage.

The plane takes off and lands on electric power only — to make it as quiet as possible.

The combustion engine will charge the batteries only during the cruise portion of each flight.

Big challenges

Let’s not kid ourselves. Lots of technological hurdles stand in the way between the E-Fan and developing electric airliners — challenges like developing lightweight batteries that can store enough electricity for long distance flights.

Boeing conducted a small experimental electric hybrid plane program last year in the UK and finished a study with NASA that showed hybrid electric propulsion as having good potential for “air vehicles in the 2030 to 2050 timeline.”

What the future holds

Airbus is collaborating with Siemens and Daher to build an all-electric two-seater called E-Fan 2.0. It’s first flight is expected sometime next year.

But perhaps more importantly, this technology is sowing the seeds for passenger electric planes that we could be flying on as soon as 14 years from now.

In April, Siemens announced that it hopes to be selling hybrid electric passenger planes with Airbus by 2030 that will carry up to 100 passengers up to about 620 miles — that’s about the distance from New York to Detroit.

Related story: Airbus hopes to launch hybrid planes by 2030

The planes would burn 25% less fuel by running electric power during takeoff and landing, Siemens said, making them almost silent at airports.

Cutting CO2 emissions is critical, but also, cities will need to build more airports as passenger traffic increases. And that brings with it concerns about noise.

“For me, reducing the noise is very important,” Esteyne said. “We know that in cities when you add airports, the noise and pollution are very important. This is the only way to do it.”

Noise and CO2 levels are only expected to rise, because in the next 20 years 3.2 billion additional airline passengers are predicted to fly worldwide, according to the International Air Transport Association. Those passengers are going to need more airplanes and airports.

It’s a statistic that only puts more pressure on airlines, airports, aviation authorities and governments to find cleaner and quieter ways to fly.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999634027481079}",neutral,0.9999634027481079,0

The H135 (formerly known as EC135 P3) is the latest version of the EC135 family of helicopters and TAS will be the first operator to introduce this variant in Japan.

Currently, TAS is operating two EC135 P2+s, which are used mainly for power line patrols. The types of mission will expand to include aerial works, including aerial photography and survey. The new H135 will join the two EC135 P2+s to perform similar missions.

TAS has eight years of operational experience of the type and it has been operating Airbus Helicopter’s aircraft for 25 years since its establishment.

“We are very pleased to introduce the new H135 variant in Japan. Having been operating helicopters produced by Airbus Helicopters over the last 25 years, we are convinced that this fuel-efficient and eco-friendly aircraft is ideal to serve our missions,” said Hisashi Nagahama, president of TAS.

“The acquisition of an additional H135 will contribute to achieving our ambitious plans of developing our home base, the Tohoku region, in a sustainable manner.”

“TAS is one of our most important customers in Japan who has shown their continued confidence and support in our aircraft. Their introduction of the H135 demonstrates the reliability of this product and confirms the strong and long-standing relationship between TAS and Airbus Helicopters,” said Stephane Ginoux, president of Airbus Helicopters Japan.

“With its state-of-the-art technology, the versatile H135 will play a key role to strengthen the company’s services. We are committed to providing quality products and full support services that fit our customers’ needs.”

The H135 is one of Airbus Helicopter’s most successful light twin-engine helicopters in the three-ton class, with a seating capacity of seven to eight passengers. It provides higher payload over longer distances than other rotorcraft in its category, and delivers supreme performance envelope along with low fuel consumption.

Other features include the use of a bearingless main rotor and Airbus Helicopters’ signature Fenestron shrouded tail rotor. The results are enhanced cost effectiveness, noise reduction and ground safety.

In Japan, there are currently 85 H135s operating for emergency medical services, police work, electronic news gathering, VIP transport and business aviation. Globally, nearly 1,200 H135s are delivered and in operation, having logged more than three million flight hours.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9895557761192322}",positive,0.9895557761192322,1

The unnamed RAF pilot will face court-martial charges in February of 2017 for negligently performing a duty, perjury, and making a false record, according to The Times.

In the February 2014 incident, the pilot had jammed his personal DSLR camera between his seat and the left-hand side-stick controller during a flight from the U.K to Afghanistan. When he moved his seat forward, the camera pushed the side-stick fully forward, sending the tanker into a steep dive that resulted in a 4,400-foot elevation decrease in 27 seconds. The aircraft was saved from a catastrophic crash by the flight envelop protection system, according to a U.K. Military Aviation Authority (MAA) report of the incident.

Twenty-four of the 198 passengers onboard, as well as all seven members of the cabin crew, were injured in the dive as they were thrown into the ceiling of the aircraft. Three RAF service members on the flight were medically discharged from the armed forces following the event, and eight men and two women are now suing the Ministry of Defense, claiming they suffer flashbacks, nightmares, and mood swings as a result of the incident.

The captain's oral report of the event ""alluded only to a possible fault with the autopilot,"" according to Aviation Week. The Voyager aircraft made an emergency landing at Incirlik Air Base, Turkey, and was grounded for 12 days before returning to service.

Etihad currently operate two out of their three rotations between Abu Dhabi and London Heathrow with an A380 – the final rotation to change EY017/EY018.

This will be operated 6 times a week with an Airbus A380. The remaining one time a week (Wedensdays) will be operated with an Airbus A340-600.

EY11/12, EY19/20 remain as A380 operations.

The revised timetable is shown below:

It’s a bold move by Etihad – as throws practically three A380s a day to London. In terms of seating, as usual, it’s The Residence up front of the plane, followed by nine First Class Apartments, 70 business class seats and 415 economy class seats.

That’s a lot of seats to fill.

Emirates converted London Heathrow to A380 some time ago (and instead, sends A380s to other UK destinations such as Gatwick, Manchester and Birmingham). Qatar Airways operates two of its six flights a day between London and Doha with A380s (with the rest operated by A330-200s, Boeing 777-300ERs and Boeing 787 Dreamliners).

It adds more capacity between the Middle East and London – with a variety of options to go further south or east.

While the news sending shocks in the already struggling Indian Air Force.

The the Indian Air Force first acquired mid-air refueling tanker aircraft from TAPA (Tashkent Aviation Production Association) in 2001 the same t. The six Il-78 were bought for an estimated price of $50 million each. The tankers before being converted and stripped was Il-76 aircraft assembled in Uzbekistan. The aircraft were stripped, repaired and refurbished and then fitted with avionics and systems,sub-systems along with Israeli refueling systems after that it went through two months of rigorous tests and training. Finally the first Gajraj (Named by the Indian Air Force) made it’s public appearance on 8th October, 2003 during the Air Force Parade.

Later in 2013 the Indian Air Force decided to expand the reach of it’s multi-role fighters by inducting at least six more MRTT aircraft or something of comparable standard. A RFP was issued and two companies responded. The Airbus with it’s A330 MRTT and the TAPA with it’s IL-78 MRTT. After exhaustive calculations and meeting it was decided that the A330 MRTT would be selected with a price tag of $2 billion for six aircraft along with life cycle costs. Although the initial purchase would be expensive but it would go easy on the pockets of the government on a long term when compared to it’s Russian Counterpart.

After the news broke out that the Indian government has decided to cancel the tender due to the issues with Airbus regarding the Airbus scam that took place in the 1990’s. The former government envisaged a plan to acquire six more tankers and place them in the Eastern part of India specifically Panagarh in West Bengal so, In case of an outbreak of conflict with China the Tankers can assist the Indian Air Force aircraft to increase their legs allowing them to stay longer in the air and carry out deeper attacks. Although new reports have started emerging that the Indian government would soon sign a deal with Russia for the sale of 6 Il-78 MKI aircraft with upgraded engines and systems and the aircraft in service with the Indian Air Force would be upgraded to the latest standard.

Although if the Airbus M330 aircraft would have been acquired it would’ve given the Indian Air Force in the region with advanced technology when compared to other tanker aircraft in the region. Yes,it would’ve added to the already logistical nightmare faced by the Indian Air Force due to it’s acquisition policy of having the best of both worlds namely the Russian and the West. But, since we are facing a dilemma here the IL-78 is not a bad option. The Pilot training and service infrastructure is already present with Russia now being more frank with giving the license to build spares and important parts to the Indian government which it was an still is an issue. In a similar way the Indian Air Force can look at IL-79MD-90A heavy transport aircraft for strategic airlift purposes since the production line of the C-17 Globemaster has closed down and the decision to purchase more aircraft came a tad bit late.

Virgin Atlantic currently has 39 aircraft in its fleet: 13 787-9s, 10 A330-300s, 8 A340-600s and 8 747-400s. The airline also has a long-standing order in place for 6 Airbus A380s. However, Virgin Atlantic CEO Craig Kreeger was quoted in the aviation press as saying, “It is an order [for the A380s] that we have the right not to exercise. Whether or not [Virgin Atlantic] will actually take delivery of the aircraft will be the subject of future evaluation.”

The A350-1000s will replace Virgin Atlantic’s remaining Boeing 747-400s and Airbus A340-600s and further underlines the airline’s strategy of moving away from its previous policy of only flying four-engined aircraft on long-haul flights (using the slogan “4 engines 4 long haul”). The A350 aircraft will operate on both business and leisure routes for Virgin Atlantic worldwide and will be based both at London Heathrow and London Gatwick. Initially the aircraft will fly to key US destinations from London Heathrow.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999982118606567}",neutral,0.9999982118606567,0
Allegiant announces new planes and an employee-approved livery - Airline Reporter,"Thu, 25 Aug 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAxNi8wOC9hbGxlZ2lhbnQtYW5ub3VuY2VzLW5ldy1wbGFuZXMtYW5kLWFuLWVtcGxveWVlLWFwcHJvdmVkLWxpdmVyeS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Late last month Allegiant announced plans to acquire twelve new Airbus A320s. Airlines make fleet announcements often, but this one was of particular significance for a number of reasons.

Allegiant’s order for new A320s:

First, this order for brand-new planes, direct from Airbus, signals a change in standard operating procedure for the Las Vegas-based ultra-low-cost carrier (ULCC). Historically, Allegiant had shirked the trend of its ULCC peers, both domestically and abroad, of adopting fuel-efficient, modern aircraft. Instead, the airline has had a well-known preference for less costly mid-to-late life secondhand McDonnell Douglas MD-80 series planes. Cheaper planes equate to lower fares, and higher margins. This concept is not new; many budget carriers have used that model and benefited greatly from it (some have not). Allegiant is no exception. The airline is so well known for this preference, in fact, that few realize that the airline began acquiring Airbus aircraft in 2013. I myself was surprised to learn that the number of available seat miles flown by Allegiant’s Airbus fleet is nearly tied with that of their larger McDonnell Douglas fleet. Jude Bricker, Allegiant Travel Company senior vice president of planning, confirms expectations that the Airbus fleet will tip the scales by the close of 2016.

Older, used Airbus planes are known for being attractively priced. This is something Allegiant saw as early as 2012 when the airline announced plans to acquire its first batch of A319s. Then-President Andrew C. Levy stated, “A319 asset values have significantly declined and now mirror the environment we saw when we first began buying MD-80s.” While Airbus has focused much of its attention on pushing its newer and higher priced NEO (new engine option) models, it seems existing Airbus variants and future current engine option (CEO) deliveries are well positioned to become as ubiquitous as the much loved, budget friendly, long-lived MD-80s they are slowly but steadily replacing.

Allegiant’s newest (employee-approved) livery iteration:

Alongside this announcement, the airline unveiled plans for an incremental livery modification. Two final contenders were chosen, and employees were given an option to vote on which would be adopted.

Which did the employees choose?

From a design perspective, both liveries are incremental adjustments over the existing “Sunburst Tail” livery. After a quick polling period, the airline quietly announced that the new livery will be comprised of the forward leaning sun-stripes, represented by concept “A” above.

BONUS: PHOTOS OF THE FIRST AIRBUS A319 IN ALLEGIANT AIR’S LIVERY

The choice will likely come as a relief to enthusiasts (this writer included) who have a general distaste for the growing proliferation of “Eurowhite” liveries which have slowly crept into the North American skies. However, more non-white paint and increased complexity typically equates to higher costs, and longer paint shop time, something Allegiant and their industry peers have become experts at avoiding.

Allegiant has in the past struggled with updated liveries, such as the “Travel is our deal” iteration. The photo above, taken in November 2013 shows a (then) newly acquired, and partially painted A319 used to inaugurate service from the small Kansas town of Manhattan to Phoenix, Arizona. N310NV continued to fly with partial paint for nearly a year before finding the time to visit the shop for completion.

Upon contacting the airline for comment on the updated livery and roll-out plans, Brandon Myers, Public Relations Specialist confirmed the newest iteration of the livery will be used as the go-forward standard for future deliveries, including the 12 new A320 CEOs. While a timeline for receiving these new planes is not yet available, the company has shared their aggressive plans to transition to an Airbus-only airline by 2019 on at least a few occasions.

BONUS: FLYING ON AN ALLEGIANT MD-83 TO ST PETERSBURG & BACK

In any case, there is no better time to get out and enjoy the excitement of flying on a classic “mad dog.” Do it while you still can; the MD-80’s days are limited.

First THAI Airbus A350 lands at Suvarnabhumi - Bangkok Post,"Wed, 31 Aug 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJhbmdrb2twb3N0LmNvbS9saWZlL3RyYXZlbC8xMDc1MTQxL2ZpcnN0LXRoYWktYWlyYnVzLWEzNTAtbGFuZHMtYXQtc3V2YXJuYWJodW1p0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A new Airbus A350 has been delivered to Thai Airways International (THAI) as part of the airline's plans to expand the number of routes it offers.

THAI board chairman Areepong Bhoocha-oom said Wednesday that a new Airbus A350 XWB (Extra Wide Body) was officially handed over to the airline at the Airbus Delivery Centre in Toulouse, France, on Tuesday.

The new aircraft was royally bestowed with the name Wichian Buri.

The new Airbus is among 14 planes purchased by THAI amid plans to offer new routes to Russia, China and several countries in Europe.

Of the 14 aircraft, twelve are Airbus A350 XWB and two are Boeing 787.

Of these, another Airbus will be delivered to THAI this year, five other Airbus aircraft and the two Boeings will be delivered next year and the other five Airbus planes will be delivered in 2018.

Meanwhile, THAI president Charamporn Jotikasthira said the new aircraft will also be used on existing routes which are facing a surge in passenger numbers as a means to increase flight frequency.

Mr Charamporn said Wichian Buri will fly a round-trip route, Bangkok-Melbourne, Australia, on Sept 16. Flight tests will also be conducted on the aircraft on a domestic round-trip flight, Bangkok-Chiang Mai, between Sunday and Sept 15.

THAI currently operates 23 Airbus aircraft on various routes and the airline has sold one Airbus A340 with 13 other planes waiting to be sold, Mr Charamporn added.

In the second quarter of this year, the airline had reported a 0.2% drop in average cabin factor — a measurement of capacity utilisation — to 69% compared to the same period last year.

Second-quarter losses were lower this year due to a 3.18-billion-baht, or 21.3%, reduction in fuel expenses, he said.

As part of its expansion plans, THAI aims to bolster sales through its alliances which offer flights to destinations where the national carrier does not operate.

Negotiations are under way with 10 airlines flying to Europe to increase ticket sales to that market, he added.

EARLIER REPORT

The first Airbus A350 XWB to be bought by Thai Airways International, which it plans to use on its Australia route from next month, has landed in Thailand.

The royally bestowed Wichian Buri aircraft touched down at Suvarnabhumi airport after a long haul flight from the Airbus delivery centre in Toulouse, France.

The airline said the A350 XWB, regarded as the most modern aircraft from the European plane maker, will be used on flights between Bangkok and Melbourne in September.

It is one of 12 A350s ordered by THAI, which involves four firm orders and eight leases.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999608993530273}",neutral,0.9999608993530273,0
Thai Airways International takes delivery of first Airbus A350 XWB - Sydney Morning Herald,"Wed, 31 Aug 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zbWguY29tLmF1L3RyYXZlbGxlci9pbnNwaXJhdGlvbi90aGFpLWFpcndheXMtaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC10YWtlcy1kZWxpdmVyeS1vZi1maXJzdC1haXJidXMtYTM1MC14d2ItMjAxNjA4MzEtZ3I1M2tqLmh0bWzSAYQBaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuc21oLmNvbS5hdS90cmF2ZWxsZXIvaW5zcGlyYXRpb24vdGhhaS1haXJ3YXlzLWludGVybmF0aW9uYWwtdGFrZXMtZGVsaXZlcnktb2YtZmlyc3QtYWlyYnVzLWEzNTAteHdiLTIwMTYwODMxLWdyNTNrai5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Pay offs for passengers Thai's 3-3-3 economy-configured A350 cabin include an 18-inch (46cm) seat width, one inch more than most economy-class seats. More than half the fuselage and wings of the A350 are made from carbon composite material, which allows for higher cabin pressure, about 2000 feet lower than the standard 8000 feet, which means more oxygen, and a more comfortable passenger experience.

In service only since January 2015, the A350 XWB – the initials stand for Extra Wide Body – is branded the world's most advanced twin-aisle aircraft, Airbus' response to the Boeing 787 Dreamliner.

Sydney is among the other cities slated for an A350 XWB service to Bangkok when Thai Airways expands its A350 fleet to 12 aircraft, scheduled to happen by the end of 2018.

Melbourne will be the first city to welcome Thai Airways International's brand new Airbus A350 XWB aircraft, the airline's first. Scheduled to commence on 16 September, Thai Airways will operate a daily Melbourne-Bangkok service aboard the Airbus A350 XWB, replacing one of the Boeing 777-200s the airline currently flies on the route. This is the precursor to a twice-daily A350 XWB Melbourne-Bangkok service when the airline takes delivery of its second A350 in September.

Other pluses include the biggest overhead bins of any aircraft, allowing every passenger to stow a standard cabin-compliant case of maximum dimensions, a draught-free circulation system, 11-inch video screens on the inflight entertainment system and glowing LED lighting that enables the airline to curate its own colour scheme. The A350 bills itself as the quietest passenger aircraft, aside from the giant A380 superjumbo. The A350 is six decibels quieter than the Boeing 787, a point the aircraft's marketing director Francois Obe was keen to emphasise to the international press hosted by Thai International at Toulouse on the delivery flight on 30 August.

The A350 is also the aircraft that in its future ""Ultra Long Range"" configuration holds the promise of non-stop flights from Australia to Western Europe. As well as long legs, one of the factors that facilitates this is regulatory approval for the aircraft to fly on just one engine for up to six hours, three hours more than usual, allowing it to operate over long overwater routes far from landing sites that might be required in case of an emergency diversion. ""In its ULR variant, the A350 is capable of taking you right around the globe with just one stop on the way,"" according to Obe.

The A350 acquisition is part of a turnaround strategy for Thai, which lost $US700 million ($A931 million) in 2014 according to Thai Airways international president Charamporn Jotikasthira. The airline has suffered from a chaotic aircraft choice, passenger loads well below average and stubborn adherence to routes that were costing it millions of dollars every year. ""2015 was the year we stopped bleeding,"" Jotikasthira said shortly before boarding the delivery flight from Toulouse to Bangkok.

Jotikasthira has taken the broom to the airline since he came on board at the end of 2014, streamlining the fleet with less aircraft types, selling off aircraft, cutting unprofitable routes and instituting an early retirement scheme.

Strategies to bring passengers back include an upgraded first and business class service, new routes such as a direct Frankfurt-Phuket service, a resumption of the service to Moscow and the revival of another to Tehran that was abandoned during the sanctions era – plus the new fleet of Airbus A350s.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998008608818054}",neutral,0.9998008608818054,0
Airbus leads £17m project to design aircraft wings of the future - Wales Online,"Fri, 26 Aug 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndhbGVzb25saW5lLmNvLnVrL2J1c2luZXNzL2J1c2luZXNzLW5ld3MvYWlyYnVzLWxlYWRzLTE3bS1wcm9qZWN0LWRlc2lnbi0xMTgwNTMwM9IBYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndhbGVzb25saW5lLmNvLnVrL2J1c2luZXNzL2J1c2luZXNzLW5ld3MvYWlyYnVzLWxlYWRzLTE3bS1wcm9qZWN0LWRlc2lnbi0xMTgwNTMwMy5hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Something went wrong, please try again later.

Planemaker Airbus is to head a new project that will attempt to design the aircraft wings of the future.

Experts predict that up to 30,000 new commercial aircraft will be needed between now and 2032. The new aircraft will have to be more sustainable than their predecessors and will use emerging technologies such as 3D printing in their construction.

The defence giant, which makes aircraft wings at Broughton, has previously filed patents for 3D construction in airliners.

The Wing Design Methodology Validation (WINDY) project will investigate the innovative design techniques that will need to be developed to build such futuristic wings.

“Aircraft wing design is a hugely complicated process and this project will look at ways we can increase the robustness of the design and test process while also reducing the time this takes,” said Airbus COO, Tom Williams.

“Developing state-of-the-art technology will be at the heart of achieving these improvements and this investment is vital for that.”

Government funding

The £17.7m project is partly funded by Innovate UK, the Government's innovation agency which is sponsored by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.

Innovate UK is contributing £8.8m towards the project which runs until October 2019.

The project is also being supported by the Aerospace Technology Institute (ATI), and other participants include the University of Bristol, Renishaw, Cranfield University and Future Advanced Manufacturing.

“One of the key aims of the ATI’s UK national aerospace strategy is to sustain and grow the UK’s global leadership in aircraft wings,” said Simon Weeks, CTO of ATI.

“The WINDY project is a key element of this aim, securing essential wing design and integration capabilities in the UK and opening the way to innovative 3D-printed wing components. These will lead to lighter and more efficient wings, which will be needed for future generations of greener airliners.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9987678527832031}",neutral,0.9987678527832031,0
Airbus is working on this flying car project - The New Daily,"Mon, 22 Aug 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW5ld2RhaWx5LmNvbS5hdS9saWZlL2F1dG8vMjAxNi8wOC8yMi9mbHlpbmctY2Fycy1haXJidXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"French aerospace company Airbus has turned its attention from long-haul passenger aircraft to finding a solution for a more local problem: traffic congestion in large cities.

Its answer: a flying car. FINALLY!

Airbus calls it Project Vahana, “an autonomous flying vehicle platform for individual passenger and cargo transport”, and the consortium’s feasibility studies have listed the success of the project as being favourable.

The vehicle is best described as a passenger-sized drone and flight tests are slated for the end of 2017 as the majority of technology required is already available.

The biggest challenge comes from an airborne detect and avoidance system, similar to that used in cars like the Tesla Model S and Mercedes-Benz E-Class. We would all agree that it is a pretty crucial component to get right.

While there are no legal or technical precedents to allow the flying of ‘pilotless’ aircraft over population centres, the Airbus team is forging ahead with the project and has an agreement with the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore to conduct scale testing of drones over the University of Singapore in mid-2017.

The full-scale vehicle, called CityAirbus, would feature multiple propellors to exhibit flying behaviour similar to a drone or helicopter. The CityAirbus will initially be flown by a pilot, but will be developed with autonomous flying in mind.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9292328953742981}",neutral,0.9292328953742981,0

The deal signed on Tuesday is part of 2.5bn euros in French defence contracts announced last year by the Gulf emirate.

The long-range H225M tactical transport helicopters, each seating 28 troops in addition to crew, are destined for the Kuwaiti army and national guard, the French ministry said, with deliveries to begin early in 2019.

Airbus confirmed the order in a statement.

The Kuwaiti order is a much-needed boost for the Airbus Group’s helicopter division, which has been hit by weaker demand from the oil and gas industry.

It has also suffered in the wake of April’s fatal crash of a H225 Super Puma, the model’s civilian version, blamed on gearbox metal fatigue in a preliminary report.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9889378547668457}",neutral,0.9889378547668457,0

Nagpur as hub for aerospace biz

NAGPUR: Tata Group’s TAL Manufacturing Solutions , which started off as a unit to make floor beams for Boeing Dreamliners in Mihan , inaugurated a facility for making spares to be used in Airbus ’ aircraft, on Saturday.The event coincided with a function to deliver the 5000th floor beam to Boeing. This makes TAL probably the only unit which is catering to both Boeing and Airbus, the two aviation giants and also rivals, under a single roof.The supply to Airbus will be through Switzerland-based Ruag Aviation, a tier one supplier to the aircraft maker.The ceremony was attended by chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and union minister for surface transport as well as Member of Parliament (MP) from Nagpur, Nitin Gadkari TAL, which is a subsidiary of Tata Motors, eyes to take its turnover to Rs1,000 crore in the next five years as against the current Rs200 crore. A chunk of the business is expected from the Mihan plant.“There are plans to start another workshop for making generic components for original equipment makers (OEMs) in the coming two years,” said TAL’s chief executive officer Rajesh Khatri For Ruag, the company will be making sheet metals, machine parts and assemblies. TAL has evolved in this sector with time. “The additional workshop, which has been planned two years from now, is likely to be used for making advanced components,” said Khatri.The TAL chief sees a major opportunity in the sector. If the global average is 4%, in India aviation sector has seen a growth of 22%. TAL will have also have an early mover advantage. So far the company has pumped in Rs400 crore which includes Rs300 crore for the floor beam unit.“The new workshop is likely to have an investment of another Rs100 crore. Better air connectivity can add to the company’s advantage as it will lead to faster movement of components, many of which have to be brought under controlled temperature,” he said, adding, “It is hoped Mihan emerging as a cargo hub will lead to it.” Dinesh Keskar , the president of Boeing India, said recent forecast on Indian aviation sector released by the company says that the country will need 1850 new aircraft worth $265 billion in the next 20 years. The purchase of Boeing 787s has also led to India add new routes.Gadkari urged Boeing to develop sea planes which he said can make transportation much easier. He recalled the time when the project was being wooed to Mihan and there were issues over allotment of land to TAL. “It was in 2007, and the site where TAL’s unit stands now was a farm with a standing crop of soyabean. The owner was reluctant to leave but was finally convinced. A private businessman having invested in Mihan also gave him Rs20 lakh from his pocket,” he said.An emotional Dinesh Keskar ended his speech with Jai Vidarbha, Jai Maharashtra and Jai Hind. The president of Boeing India, who hails from Amravati, graduated in engineering at the erstwhile VRCE (now VNIT) in the city.After starting in English, Keskar ended his speech in Marathi. He said: “I could repay what Vidarbha my homeland gave me by bringing the Air India MRO and TAL to Nagpur. It was here that I got the opportunity to get educated enough to work in the US and achieve so much.”Interestingly, the Jai Vidarbha comment came in the presence of CM Devendra Fadnavis and Union minister Nitin Gadkari. The BJP, which fought the last elections on the plank of Vidarbha statehood, is today not making any move for its creation. Keskar’s comment hardly raised any eyebrows at the venue.CM Devendra Fadnavis said Nagpur is fast emerging as a hub for aerospace industry. The Maharashtra Airport Development Company (MADC) is in advanced talks with one more company to set up an aircraft maintenance repair and overhaul (MRO) depot in Mihan-SEZ. Later, sources said it was the Gurgaon-based Airworks which is likely take up 20 acres of land.“The Air India MRO built by Boeing is already functional, but initially business was not much. It was originally planned to be run by Boeing itself. But due to certain circumstances it was handed over to Air India. I had urged that Boeing should take it back. Though this could not happen so far, Dinesh Keskar has ensured that business goes up. Now Spice Jet will be getting its aircraft overhauled at the Air India MRO,” said Fadnavis.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.994746208190918}",neutral,0.994746208190918,0

In the modern fight, those platforms have to become ‘smarter’, able to process and share more information than ever before.

Nigel Pittaway | Munich

Alonso was speaking to journalists from around the world in Munich in June, as part of the European defence company’s annual Trade Media Briefing. Together with group partner Airbus Helicopters, the company outlined its sales campaigns, gave product overviews and program updates, but also provided a glimpse into the future with detailed presentations on some of the technology it is harnessing to make its products smarter.

Through Airbus DS and Airbus Helicopters, the Airbus Group is very active in the Asia Pacific region, delivering A400Ms to Malaysia, C-295s to Vietnam, H145M helicopters to Thailand this year, and has begun work on the supply of A330 multi role tanker transport aircraft to Singapore and South Korea.

Here in Australia, Airbus Helicopters is delivering H135 training helicopters to Boeing, the prime contractor for the ADF’s Helicopter Aircrew Training System (HATS under JP9000 Phase 7) and the conversion of a further pair of KC-30A tankers for the RAAF is underway in Madrid.

Tanker upgrades

Airbus DS head of Engineering Miguel Ángel Morell said that the RAAF is also interested in two key developments the European manufacturer is developing for its international MRTT program, which will significantly enhance operational capability and situational awareness.

The company is developing an automatic air to air refuelling system for the KC-30As Aerial Refuelling Boom System (ARBS), which Morell says will remove the requirement for complex manual boom operations, thereby reducing risk and permitting an increased number of receivers to be supported during each mission.

Airbus DS has completed simulator testing of the automatic system and some in-flight evaluation (without contact) has been conducting using a Portuguese Air Force F-16 fighter. Morell said that the company will begin an incremental flight test campaign at the end of the year, which will culminate in fully automatic contacts.

The second development is the integration of Link 16 Joint Range Extension (JRE) which will allow the KC-30A to act as a Link 16 data relay, to enable information to be accessed by tactical aircraft which may be operating beyond line of sight (BLOS).

Morell said that the JRE upgrade will offer the relay capability via IP SATCOM (joint range extension applications protocol, JREAP-C) or through UHF DAMA (demand assigned multiple access) radio (JREAP-A). The system has completed laboratory integration testing and will shortly begin flight testing aboard one MRTT aircraft fitted with wideband SATCOM.

“The first aircraft to be fitted with JRE Link 16 will be an MRTT for France and the second customer is likely to be Australia,” Morell said.

Special Forces helicopters

Besides building the H135 for HATS, Airbus Helicopters is eying off the ADF’s future requirement for the Australian Army requirement for a fleet of armed, light reconnaissance and attack helicopters, which can be readily deployed by RAAF C-17As, to provide mobility support for special operations.

First announced in the Integrated Investment Program, between $2 and $3 billion has been allocated for acquisition beginning around 2025.

Airbus Helicopters has developed an armed version of its H145 (previously EC145 T2) helicopter, known as the H145M, and is currently delivering aircraft to the German Special Forces (15 aircraft), and the Royal Thai Navy (five helicopters).

The H145M is capable of being armed with door mounted machine guns, such as the ubiquitous MAG-58 7.62mm weapon, or Dillon M134 minigun, as well as a 12.7mm FN HMP400 gun pod and/or FZ233 7-shot rocket pod under side-mounted pylons.

The two pylons are each capable of carrying 210kg of external stores and H145M program manager Mark Henning said that work is underway to integrate the Raketsan CiRiT 2.75in (70mm) laser-guided rocket at the request of a customer. A laser designator will also be integrated into the nose-mounted Wescam MX-15HD EOS, enabling a range of future laser-guided weapons to be used. Henning said that Airbus Helicopters are also working on the integration of a Nexter 20mm cannon pod.

The H145M is also one of three Airbus Helicopters platforms to be integrated with the company’s new HForce weapons system initiative.

HForce

HForce is an Airbus Helicopters-led innovation, which adds a flexible and fully integrated weapons system to its H215M (Squirrel), H145M and H225M (Super Puma) helicopters, according to senior operational marketing manager Christian Fanchini.

The system is a collaborative effort between Rockwell Collins (hardware) and Airbus Helicopters (software) and incorporates a Thales Scorpion Helmet Mounted Sight Display (HMSD). Armament includes a range of air to ground and air to air missiles, rockets and guns.

“The system is a ‘plug and play’ weapons system that is designed to be incremental and modular,” Fanchini said. “The crew captain is the gunner, firing through the EOS both day and night. The pilot flies, the gunner fights, just like an attack helicopter.”

HForce is available in four basic options: Option ‘0’ is where the helicopter is fitted ‘for but without’; where the fixed parts and harnesses are installed but weapons are not added until a later requirement dictates. Option 1, 2 and 3 are incremental increases in capability, up to laser guided rockets and air to air weapons.

Fanchini said that the first firing campaign, using an H225M, was conducted in Belgium in May and June of this year, the first flight of a H145 fitted with HForce is expected to occur early in 2017 and qualification of the system on all three helicopters is scheduled for completion by the end of 2017.

Airbus DS’ head of marketing and sales Jean-Pierre Talamoni said the company forecast is for a global market for aircraft types it has in its portfolio of over 1,300 aircraft over the next 10 years. This is broken down into approximate requirements for 150 heavy transport aircraft, 85 tankers, 750 combat aircraft and 350 ‘mission’ aircraft (ISR, maritime patrol, AEW&C etc), totalling 107 billion Euros.

“Two thirds of the new military aircraft opportunities are in Asia and the Middle East and Asia represents about half of what is achievable,” Talamoni said. “Asia alone will account for around 42 per cent of that market.”

Talamoni said that the total defence procurement budget across the world is estimated to be approximately 400 billion Euros per year with an annual growth forecast out to 2020 of 2.4 per cent.

“The defence procurement budget in the Asia Pacific region will grow at around six per cent per annum to 2020, to around 140€,” he predicted. “Aircraft platforms represent the biggest defence segment by far, accounting for a quarter of defence procurement budgets worldwide. The UAV segment represents a small portion of defence expenditure for the time being but this segment will see the highest growth in coming years.”

Britain's Serious Fraud Office launches criminal probe into Airbus Group - India.com,"Mon, 08 Aug 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGlhLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9icml0YWluLXNlcmlvdXMtZnJhdWQtb2ZmaWNlLWxhdW5jaGVzLWNyaW1pbmFsLXByb2JlLWludG8tYWlyYnVzLWdyb3VwLTEzOTA4Mjgv0gFyaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW5kaWEuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2JyaXRhaW4tc2VyaW91cy1mcmF1ZC1vZmZpY2UtbGF1bmNoZXMtY3JpbWluYWwtcHJvYmUtaW50by1haXJidXMtZ3JvdXAtMTM5MDgyOC9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Home

Britain’s Serious Fraud Office launches criminal probe into Airbus Group

Britain’s Serious Fraud Office launches criminal probe into Airbus Group

The authority said it opened the investigation in July and asked anyone with relevant information to come forward.

London, August 8 (AFP): Britain’s Serious Fraud Office said on Sunday it had opened a criminal probe into Airbus Group, investigating allegations of fraud, bribery and corruption. “These allegations relate to irregularities concerning third party consultants,” the SFO said in a statement.

The authority said it opened the investigation in July and asked anyone with relevant information to come forward. A spokesperson for the SFO said additional details of the probe would not be made public until charges were brought or the investigation is dropped. European planemaker Airbus said it was aware of the probe and the aviation firm was working with investigators.

“Airbus Group has been informed by the SFO that it has opened a criminal investigation into allegations of fraud, bribery and corruption in the civil aviation business of Airbus Group relating to irregularities concerning third party consultants,” the company said in a statement. “Airbus Group continues to cooperate with the SFO,” the statement concluded. The company was informed on Friday that the authority had launched an investigation, an Airbus spokesman told AFP.

“We ourselves detected this issue and self-disclosed it to the authorities”.

“This is as an effort of our enhanced anti-corruption (policy). Management has taken robust action and is determined to resolve this issue in cooperation with the authorities,” spokesman Jeremy Greaves said. Airbus informed authorities of the irregularities in April. The same month the UK Export Finance decided to suspend export credits to the firm, a move followed by France and Germany.

The aviation firm said at the time it hoped to resolve the financing problem as soon as possible. The current SFO investigation is expected to take years. The probe was described by the Financial Times newspaper as a “severe blow to the European aircraft maker” which would be exploited by its US rival Boeing.

Airbus is the largest commercial aerospace company in Britain and last month said its net profit rose 15 per cent in the first half of the year. Profits were up 1.76 billion euros (USD 1.94 billion), but the gain was due to exceptional items that masked a slide in operating earnings.

The company was hit by charges of just over 1 billion euros related to its troubled A400M military cargo transporter programme, while adverse currency movements and charges on its widebody A350 aircraft totaled nearly 900 million. However these were compensated for by the sale of shares in Dassault Aviation and the creation of a rocket launcher joint venture with Safran that generated a net gain of nearly 1.9 billion euros.

AirZim holds talks with Airbus over new planes | - New Zimbabwe.com,"Thu, 18 Aug 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3ppbWJhYndlLmNvbS9haXJ6aW0taG9sZHMtdGFsa3Mtd2l0aC1haXJidXMtb3Zlci1uZXctcGxhbmVzLz9hbXA9MdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Spread This News

HARARE: Representatives from French-based plane maker, Airbus have held discussions with Zimbabwean government authorities over a possible sale of planes to Air Zimbabwe, Transport Minister Joram Gumbo said on Thursday.

Gumbo told reporters that discussions were still at a level where full disclosure would not be wise.

“Yes, Airbus were here,” Gumbo said at a function to present the airline’s new chief executive, Ripton Muzanda, a former pilot with the airline.

“They are looking to sell their planes. We are courting other manufacturers as we seek a strategic partner which will help us to turnaround the airline. We cannot disclose the progress that we have had now.”

He said procurement of new planes was at the core of ongoing discussions with potential suitors to recapitalise AirZim.

AirZim predominantly operates a fleet of Boeing planes — two 767-200 jets and three 737-200 planes. It also operates two Airbus A320s and has a fleet of three Chinese made MA60s.

Muzenda assumed duties on August 15 after the airline had gone for about three years without a substantive CEO.

Edmund Makona had been the acting CEO since 2013, after former boss, Peter Chikumba left AirZim.

Gumbo said there were still opportunities for Zimbabwe on the domestic market, which the new CEO and the recently appointed AirZim board must work to capture.

“The fact that regional and international airlines are submitting applications to fly into Harare and Victoria Falls while existing players are increasing frequencies is indicative of the existence of viable business models,” said Gumbo.

“It is these models I want the board to research on and bring to my Ministry for implementation.”Advertisement","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999403953552246}",neutral,0.9999403953552246,0
First British Airbus H135 military training helicopter takes off - UK Defence Journal,"Thu, 04 Aug 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vdWtkZWZlbmNlam91cm5hbC5vcmcudWsvZmlyc3QtYnJpdGlzaC1oMTM1LW1pbGl0YXJ5LXRyYWluaW5nLWhlbGljb3B0ZXItdGFrZXMtb2ZmL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters has carried out the first flight of the initial UK MFTS aircraft, bringing delivery closer.

Airbus Helicopters will deliver 29 H135s (pictured) and 3, hoist-equipped H145s to the UK MoD.

The H135 is a twin-engine civil helicopter produced by Airbus Helicopters (formerly known as Eurocopter). It is capable of flight under instrument flight rules and is outfitted with digital flight controls. It entered service in 1996; over a thousand aircraft have been produced to date. It is widely used by police and ambulance services and for executive transport; by 2013, more than 500 EC135s were providing helicopter emergency medical services across the world. While the EC135 is primarily used by civil operators, a combat-capable military-orientated variant of the EC135, designated as the Eurocopter EC635, has also been produced.

The UK Military Flying Training System (UKMFTS) takes UK armed forces aircrew from initial training through, elementary, basic and advanced flying training phases preparing them for their arrival at their designated operational aircraft units. It is operated by Ascent Flight Training, a consortium of Lockheed Martin and Babcock International under a 25-year Private Finance Initiative (PFI) contract for the UK’s Ministry of Defence (MoD). Apart from the overall contract, the main elements of the system include fixed-wing elementary, basic, multi-engine and fast-jet pilot training, rear crew training and rotary-wing (helicopter) training.

In October 1996 a contract was placed with FBS, a company formed between Flight Refuelling Aviation, Bristows Helicopters Ltd and SERCo. This 15-year contract not only covered the engineering and supply aspects already in place, but also included the provision of the 35 Squirrel HT1 and Griffin HT1 helicopters for the Defence Helicopter Flying School at RAF Shawbury. In practice, FBS now sub-contracts the support of the DHFS and RAF Shawbury to FB Heli Services (formerly FR Aviation Services) thus maintaining the partnership between the company and RAF Shawbury forged over the 5 years previous to that contract. Also included in the contract was the provision of 40% of the helicopter instructors, Operations Support staff and Flight Systems Operators in the Central Air Traffic Control School.

The UKMFTS training helicopters acquisition program had been shelved by mid 2012, but a four-year extension was granted to the FB Heliservices contract to run the DHFS at RAF Shawbury. FB Heliservices, which had already run DHFS for 15 years, was a joint venture between Cobham and Bristow Helicopters.

In 2013, Ascent proposed modified versions of the bids originally provided by the two contestants for the requirement: AgustaWestland and Alphar (a Eurocopter, FB Heliservices and CAE consortium). The contract was for a ten-year interim period rather than the full life of the MFTS PFI.

The Defence Equipment and Support (DE&S) organisation announced, in September 2014, that six companies had been invited to bid on the new Rotary Wing Training Programme (RWTP) that will replace the old Defence Helicopter Flying School (DHFS) out-sourcing contract, in place since 1997.

The MoD anticipated selecting the winning bid in 2016, with the new service becoming operational in 2018.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999974966049194}",neutral,0.9999974966049194,0
Korean Air flies Airbus A380 to Sydney from October - Executive Traveller,"Mon, 29 Aug 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4ZWN1dGl2ZXRyYXZlbGxlci5jb20va29yZWFuLWFpci10by1mbHktYWlyYnVzLWEzODAtdG8tc3lkbmV5LWZyb20tb2N0b2JlctIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"SkyTeam alliance member Korean Air will upgrade its daily Sydney-Seoul flights to its flagship Airbus A380 aircraft from October.

Replacing the current Airbus A330s plying the route, the A380 brings with it almost 50% more seats to offer 12 suites in first class, 94 fully-flat business class beds and 301 seats in economy, topping out at 407 passengers.

The superjumbo will appear on all KE121 flights (ex. Seoul) from October 30 and KE122 services (ex. Sydney) from October 31, returning to the current Airbus A330 from March 26 and 27 2017, respectively.

Up front in first class, you'll find the airline's 'Kosmo' suites...

... offering every passenger direct aisle access in a 1-2-1 layout (as you'd expect), in an open 'semi-cubicle' design:

They're wide, lie-flat sleepers surrounded by a hard plastic shell shaped somewhat like a bathtub – a comparison that's hard to resist when the reading lamp looks a bit like a designer tap.

The entire upper deck is given over to 94 'Prestige' business class seats in a 2-2-2 layout.

These extend into fully-flat beds, although passengers in the window seats must step over their seatmates in order to access the aisle.

There are also two on-board lounges: a smaller space at the front of the aircraft...

... and the more spacious Celestial Lounge at the rear of the upper deck.

This area includes a bar which serves, among other things, six Absolut-based cocktails.

Unique to Korean Air's A380 is the world's first flying duty-free store, found at the rear of the lower deck.

Korean Air's daily Sydney-Seoul flight, KE122, will leave the gate at 9am to reach the South Korean capital at 5:40pm, while the return journey, KE121, is an overnight service: departing at 6:45pm and touching down at 6:55am the next day.

These Airbus A380 flights are now open for booking on the Korean Air website: Competitor Asiana Airlines will fly its Airbus A380s between Seoul and Sydney in November 2016 as well, but for six flights only, in place of the usual Airbus A330s and Boeing 777s.

Korean Air also upgraded its Brisbane-Seoul flights to its newest Airbus A330 aircraft with fully-flat beds in business class and new suites in first class: the same jets that will return to Sydney after the A380 completes its run.
