"Airbus Design Linked To AA 587 Crash - The Wave - The Wave, Rockaway's Newspaper Since 1893","Fri, 13 Aug 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJvY2thd2F2ZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvYWlyYnVzLWRlc2lnbi1saW5rZWQtdG8tYWEtNTg3LWNyYXNoL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Nearly nine years after American Airlines Flight 587 crashed into the intersection of Beach 130 Street and Newport Avenue in Belle Harbor, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said this week that the crash that killed 265 people was caused in part by a rudder system design which still exists in many Airbus aircraft.

The Airbus A-300-600 augured into Belle Harbor at about 9:16 a.m. on November 12, 2001, killing all 260 aboard the aircraft and five Rockaway residents on the ground, making it the second worst aircraft accident in American history.

According to an NTSB recommendation issued last week, the plane’s vertical stabilizer likely separated and fell into Jamaica Bay because of “the first officer’s unnecessary and excessive rudder pedal inputs,” as well as the “characteristics of the Airbus rudder system design.”

Previously, the blame had fallen completely on First Officer Sten Molin, who was flying the departure from John F. Kennedy Airport on the morning of the fatal crash.

The NTSB said that the new finding comes in the wake of another “upset” involving an Air Canada Airbus aircraft.

That aircraft, an Airbus A319, which has similar controls to the A300, experienced an in-flight upset after encountering wake turbulence from a 747 while climbing in early January of 2008.

Flight 587 was climbing from JFK when it encountered wake turbulence from a Japan Airlines 747 just prior to its crash in Rockaway.

The NTSB says that the pilot of the Air Canada flight tried to use the rudder pedals to get out of the wake turbulence, just as the first officer of Flight 587 attempted to do.

Even though the significant rudder movements stressed the tail structure of the Air Canada flight, the crew managed to get the plane back on the ground.

In the Flight 587 accident, the overstressed tail ripped from the aircraft shortly before the engines popped off and it crashed.

“Because of the severity of the upset, following the emergency landing the airplane was grounded pending an investigation by Airbus engineers,” the finding adds. “The vertical stabilizer was removed from the airplane and scanned to inspect for damage to the stabilizer’s composite components. No damage was found.”

After the AA 587 crash, there was lots of conjecture that the bonding material holding the tail to the aircraft had disbanded, allowing the stabilizer to fall from the plane.

The NTSB added, “the similarities between the Air Canada Flight 190 and American Airlines Flight 587 crewmember’s response to wake encounters indicate that the Airbus 320 family is also susceptible to potentially hazardous rudder pedal inputs at higher airspeeds. In both events, the vertical stabilizer load limits were exceeded by a large margin as a result of alternating rudder inputs.

In the American Airlines accident, the pilot applied four full alternating rudder inputs; after the fourth input, the loads in the stabilizer exceeded design load and it separated from the aircraft. In the Air Canada accident, the pilot applied three alternating rudder inputs and exceeded the limit load by 29 percent.”

Shortly after the American Airlines Flight 587 crash, a spokesperson for the Airline Pilots Association told The Wave that designing an aircraft so that the tail would fall off if the pilot used too much rudder is like designing an automobile so that the tires would fall off if somebody hit the brake too many times.

The NTSB, however, calls for airline officials to institute a training program that would teach pilots of the Airbus aircraft in question to get out of a wake turbulence situation without overflying the rudder. That warning has gone out to both the Federal Aviation Administration in the United States and to European agencies.

The latest warning does not, however, satisfy Stan Molin, the first officer’s father, a former pilot for Eastern Airlines and an instructor-pilot himself.

“It’s been perfectly clear that the NTSB gave way to Airbus pressure eight years ago, and it is still doing that today,” Molin told The Wave on Monday.

“In 2002, some NTSB and FAA officials went to the Airbus factory in France and programmed an Airbus 300 to believe it was in the air. No matter how they programmed the plane, a series of three experienced pilots could not make the rudder do what the NTSB said that it had done on AA 587.”

“It’s about time, however, that the NTSB has made clear what it should have made clear eight years ago – that the aircraft’s rudder system was at fault, and said that the rudder was the primary cause of the accident, and not the way my son flew the aircraft.”

Molin says that tests subsequent to the NTSB’s finding seven years ago show that his son followed procedures for flying the aircraft out of a wake turbulence situation.

“The right wing was dropping and he used full aileron to bring the wing up. When it didn’t happen, he instinctively pushed the rudder pedal.

The plane began to yaw violently and he pushed the rudder in the other direction to stop the yaw. Then, the plane began to yaw in the other direction,” Molin said. The fifth time he hit the rudder pedal, the tail came off. It was the system’s fault.”

Patience, America. The Boeing 787 Dreamliner is coming.

Big windows. High ceilings. Overhead bins that will hold those overstuffed carry-ons. Wireless entertainment (and office e-mail) to your seat. More natural air so your face doesn't feel like it spent six hours in the Sahara Desert.

It's coming. Someday. No more aging airliners on domestic routes, where the average age of a major jet is nearly 15. No more busted arm rests, 1990s-era TV sets hanging from the ceiling, duct-taped carpet and banged-up bathrooms. No more wasted space for kitchen galleys from the era before airlines decided to starve their customers. No more tiny windows that you have to crane to see out. All gone.

Starting … someday.

When? Maybe the end of this year. In Japan. All Nippon Airways gets the first 787. (Click here to see 787 feaures.)

When will Americans be able to fly this American-made aircraft on routes within America?

Someday.

It likely will be on an airline that doesn't even exist yet — the newly merged United and Continental awaiting approval from the feds. Maybe late next year.

And don't look for it at mid-size airports — it's too big and heavy.

Still, the Dreamliner is likely going to be part of your traveling for most of the rest of your life. With more than 800 on order, it will fill the skies until well toward the middle of the century.

I had hoped to be flying regularly on the Dreamliner by now — it's two years behind schedule. So I had to travel up to Seattle, Boeing's home (if no longer its headquarters, which moved to Chicago several years ago) to take a look.

I could have gone to the assembly plant in Everett, Wash., to see the engineering marvels of the swept-wing jet, it's thrifty General Electric GEnx (bet the engineers didn't come up with the cutesy name) and lightweight composite body. I could have heard how mechanics on the ground could monitor the plane while it was in the air via wireless updates.

Great stuff. But I wanted inside. Where I and the rest of the traveling public would spend hundreds or even thousands of hours for the rest of our traveling lives.

I came away impressed — and disappointed.

To see the inside the Dreamliner, I didn't board a plane but instead went inside an office park. Boeing operates the equivalent of an interior furnishings showroom for customers off a wooded road in Reston, just south of Seattle.

Kent Craver, the ""regional director of passenger satisfaction and revenue,"" showed me around a mock-up of the 787 interior. He's a cool, smart, calm-voiced evangelist for Boeing's goods.

Craver said Boeing knows that any aircraft manufacturer has a built-in problem with their customers.

""No one would choose to sit for several hours on a plane,"" he said. ""They're bored or angry when using our product.""

The company consulted with psychologists, cultural anthropologists — and Disney — to improve the passenger experience without getting in the way of the revenue stream of their real customers, the airlines.

The key is trying to get people away from the feeling that they are being forced into a very large toothpaste tube. With airports a source of traveler anxiety, the move onto the airplane should also signal a switch in attitude.

""We want to create a psychological separation so people leave their ground experience on the ground and feel welcomed,"" Craver said.

It starts with an open lobbylike area at the aircraft doorway. On entry, there's a lot to like. Sculpted design and LED lights give the interior a feeling — perhaps illusion — of height, width and light. I was pleased to see that individual overhead air blowers were back, so your seatmate's garlic-soaked carry-on lunch can be counterattacked.

""As much as possible, people want a personal space that they can control,"" Craver said.

Bathrooms are bigger, so passengers can change clothes without squirming around like a crazy man in a straightjacket.

Even the big bins are psychologically calming. No worries that you won't be able to store your bag over your seat. The powerful hinges don't require Herculean strength on your tippytoes to close.

Up front, it's a wonderful world of fold-flat first-class seats and fat business-class seats that look like flying La-ZBoy recliners designed by the Jetsons. Boeing expects that the 787 will become the go-to airliner of the high-end flier.

""The business traveler knows his or her aircraft because they spend so much time on them,"" Craver said. ""This plane will be preferred, extremely preferred, by business travelers.""

Great! And how about the rest of us?

Welcome back to reality. No matter what designers pull out of their bag of tricks, the crush of economy-class seats, even when empty in a showroom, brings on shudders. Boeing has suggested to airlines that they use a civilized ""3-2-3"" seat layout of eight seats per row, separated by two aisles.

Sorry. Most airlines have opted for the ""other"" option of adding one more seat per row for an elbow-crunching, nine-across ""3-3-3"" layout. The future of flight might be brighter and more colorful, but it comes with the nightmare of 17.2-inch-wide seats creating the familiar sardine effect in economy class.

""It all comes down to revenue,"" Craver said. ""In economy class, it is all about price, and most passengers are not willing to pay a dime for extras, including space.""

Craver said the 787 will be an improved flight experience, even for those in the airliner equivalent of steerage. And if the day dawns when economy passengers are willing to pay more for comforts, Boeing's designers are ready.

""If the market wants it, we will come up with it,"" Craver said.

Someday.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999910593032837}",neutral,0.9999910593032837,0

Expected to be contracted under a public-private partnership funding arrangement, the A400M training service deal should run until at least March 2030, according to details released by the UK’s Defence Equipment & Support organisation.

“The UK is seeking the provision of an A400M synthetic training service for all military personnel who will operate, maintain and support the aircraft,” it says in a 3 August notification. This will include pilots, loadmasters and maintainers, plus “aerial despatch and aero-medical personnel, paratroopers and miscellaneous support staff.”

New training premises will be constructed at the Royal Air Force’s main operating base for the A400M at Brize Norton in Oxfordshire as a result of the programme.

© Andrew Linnett/Crown Copyright The A400M made its first visit to RAF Brize Norton last month

The MoD in mid-July issued an invitation to negotiate to Airbus Military and its selected UK partner, Thales Training and Simulation for the proposed deal. An expression of interest is required by 29 October, with DE&S due to sign a contract in October 2011.

The UK had been due to acquire 25 A400Ms under the European programme’s May 2003 launch contract, but earlier this year signalled its intention to reduce the RAF’s eventual fleet “to at least 22”. The service should receive its first example of the delayed transport in 2014, with the type currently expected to enter operational use in 2015.

France and the UK are pursuing a possible joint support model for their combined fleets of the 37t-capacity airlifter. The former is committed to buying 50 A400Ms, and will be the first nation to field the type.

In Jul-2009, Boeing forecast demand for 1,000 aircraft worth approximately USD100 billion over the 20-year period.

Boeing India President, Dinesh Keskar, commented: ""There is strength and resilience in the Indian commercial aviation sector over the long term. The potential for future growth of air travel, both domestically and internationally, is among the greatest in the world and Boeing will continue its efforts to be India's preferred partner and aerospace provider.""

Mr Keskar added that air travel in India, tied closely to the country's economic growth, is expected to largely recover by 2011, adding that the operating environment for India's carriers shows a positive turn, with passenger numbers, load factors and yields showing an upward trend on domestic and international services.

Mr Keskar continued: ""We went through the deepest recession in the history of aviation but now India's recovery is one of the fastest"", adding: ""If you take a broad look at the India market, what resonates is more positive than negative and the prospect for continued long-term growth remains high.""

Total Passengers on Indian carriers: 2001/01 to 2008/2009

Strong economic growth to continue

India's economy is slated to grow at 8.5% annually over the forecast period, and remains among the strongest in the world. Meanwhile, the IMF is forecasting GDP growth of 9.4% in 2010, and 8.4% in 2011. The country's growth has averaged more than 7% p/a since 1997.

Airbus anticipates need for 1,030 new aircraft

Airbus, in Mar-2010, also raised its forecast for Indian aircraft demand, with the manufacturer estimating the need for 1,032 new aircraft, valued at USD132 billion, in the 2009-2028 period, with these new aircraft valued at USD132 billion, making India the world's fifth largest aviation market.

Airbus Top Ten countries by passenger aircraft demand and value

The fleet requirement is expected to comprise 538 single aisle aircraft (A320 family), 287 twin aisles (A330 and A350 equipment) and 68 very large aircraft (A380), with 39 new freight aircraft (A330-200F) anticipated.

Airbus commented that Indian freight traffic is expected to grow almost four fold over the next 20 years, with Airbus forecasting that 164 cargo aircraft will operate within and from India by 2028. The current fleet is limited to only 12 aircraft.

Airbus India domestic and international freight forecasts

Airbus had previously stated India would require 992 aircraft between 2008 and 2027, valued at USD105 billion (both estimates based on orders for passenger and freight aircraft).

Airbus also anticipates that India domestic travel will be the fastest growing market for air travel over the next two decades, with domestic traffic increasing by an average 12.2% annually, to be seven times the 2008 traffic level. Overall traffic growth will be among the world's highest, averaging 7.3% over the next 20 years compared with the currently global average of 4.7%, according to Airbus, which added that ""long term, the potential for growth in India's aviation sector remains exceptional"".

Travel propensity remains low; large potential exists

Travel propensity remains low in India, as the following graphics from both Airbus and Bombardier highlight. This indicates the large potential for increased travel demand in the country.

Bombardier expecting 5% of deliveries to go to India

Meanwhile, Bombardier in its 20-year outlook, released in Jul-2010, stated it expects, in the next 20 years, that there will be a geographic shift in delivery demand, with China and India to be the two growth regions.

Specially, India, from a small base today, is expected to take 5% of the deliveries and will grow to 4% of the 20- to 149-seat fleet, up from 1% today. This will result in growth from 120 to 650 of these aircraft type by 2029, according to Bombardier. Overall, India is predicted to take 600 deliveries, representing 36% of the total deliveries within the Asia/Pacific region.

Bombardier added that India is a key driver of economic growth in the Asia/Pacific regional with a GDP growth rate of 6.3% expected over the next 20 years.

SpiceJet announces order for 30 B737-800s

Such is the optimism at SpiceJet, the carrier's Board this month approved a new order for 30 B737-800 aircraft, with deliveries to commence in 2014 for a period of four years. The carrier did not specify how the purchase would be funded. The existing fleet of aircraft are all leased. The carrier plans to add 15 aircraft over the next two years.

SpiceJet currently has a fleet of 21 B737-800/900s with seven more deliveries scheduled up to 2012 (one more in 2010, and two each in 2011 through 2013 according to Ascend). SpiceJet added that it is evaluating ""a far more aggressive fleet expansion"" over the next 18 to 24 months than originally planned, with acting CEO and Director, Kishore Gupta, adding: ""The current pending orders with Boeing, the more aggressive short-to-medium term fleet expansion and this fresh order for 30 aircraft will ensure that Spice not only continues to be ahead of industry growth, but also consistently offers value-for-money fares to its customers"".

The carrier has previously commented: ""With Maran coming in, we have the money now; earlier, with Wilbur Ross, the aim was to consolidate and break even. The company was earlier planning to bring in four aircraft, but we will add three more to the tally. For the next financial year, we will require about eight more"".

Mr Gupta, commented: ""We are currently seeing a strong resurgence in domestic air traffic growth on the back of robust macro-economic growth. We expect domestic demand to grow at 16% during the current year and to sustain a 12-14% annual growth going forward in the medium term. The growth will necessitate significant capacity induction and the fresh order announced by us today will ensure that SpiceJet will remain at the forefront of the growth story in the Indian skies"". The carrier's revenues, meanwhile, are expected to increase in the 15-20% range in FY2011.

India's LCCs on rapid expansion trajectory

India's independent LCCs - IndiGo, SpiceJet and GoAir - are set to nearly double their fleet capacity over the next 17 months from 56 to 104 aircraft. Currently, Indian air carriers offer 115,000 domestic seats per day, of which LCCs (including the economy units of Jet Airways and Kingfisher) comprise approximately 70% of the total.

Go Air, Indigo and SpiceJet current and future fleet orders

IndiGo, the largest LCC, is scheduled to receive 21 A320s over the next 17 months, with seven of these scheduled for delivery in 2010. GoAir, currently operating a fleet of eight aircraft, plans to add two new aircraft in 2010 and has stated it may advance deliveries of ten aircraft currently scheduled for delivery in 2011/2012.

Outlook: Emergence of a more favourable environment

After the dramatic changes of the last five years, the Indian aviation industry is now seeing the emergence of a more favourable environment, supported by an economic recovery, which has boosted demand levels in the domestic market. Looking forward, there is large scope for continued and rapid growth, with a large and increasing population, coupled with a low propensity to travel, improved infrastructure in the country and increased international connectivity as foreign airlines seek greater access to the world's second most populous nation.

Accordingly, Civil Aviation Minister, Praful Patel, stated he expects India will be ""in the top five civil aviation markets all across the world"" within the next five years, up from ninth largest currently, adding: ""That, I think, is a great achievement in the remarkably short period of time.""","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999998807907104}",positive,0.9999998807907104,1
American Airlines Offers Express Seats – The Cost Worth It? - Airline Reporter,"Mon, 23 Aug 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAxMC8wOC9hbWVyaWNhbi1haXJsaW5lcy1vZmZlcnMtZXhwcmVzcy1zZWF0cy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airlines have to start getting pretty creative to come up with new fees to help increase their revenue. Even though I get frustrated to have to pay the fees myself, I at least understand why I am paying them. American has started charging a new fee and I am not sure if it is worth it.

Depending on the length of the flight, you can now pay anywhere from $19 to $39 to sit in the first few rows in economy and be one of the first ones to board. There is no question being one of the first to board to make sure you have room for your carry-ons and it is nice to get off the plane instead of waiting in the back for everyone else to. However, I am not sure if the added cost is worth it.

United has something similar called EconomyPlus, but at least when you pay more for those seats, you also get additional legroom. With United, you can purchase the seats at the time of booking, but with American’s Express Seats, they can only be purchased from a kiosk starting 24hrs before a flight to 50 minutes before take off.

Virasb Vahidi, Chief Commercial Officer for American Airlines states, “Express Seats highlights American’s focus on offering customers what they value most.” I am not sure if passengers really value paying more to sit in the front the most. However, I haven’t done the research and spoke with a lot of American passengers about it, which I assume American has and they got positive feedback. The nice thing for American is there is no need to change the layouts of their aircraft to make this work, which means it will be cheap to test and cheap to pull the plug if it doesn’t work out.

Etihad holds high hopes for new planes - The National,"Mon, 09 Aug 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW5hdGlvbmFsbmV3cy5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvZXRpaGFkLWhvbGRzLWhpZ2gtaG9wZXMtZm9yLW5ldy1wbGFuZXMtMS41NzI1OTPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"With the safety checks complete, Capt Oliver Iffert taxis the gleaming new Etihad A330-200F cargo aircraft towards the runway. After a quick wave to the ground crew on the apron, the plane accelerates and rises into the sky above Toulouse in France on its maiden flight to Abu Dhabi International Airport where it will become another vital component of the airline's cargo capabilities.

The A330-200F is the latest addition to Etihad's burgeoning fleet of cargo aircraft it hopes will enable it to carve a bigger slice of business for not only the carrier but Abu Dhabi by strengthening global trade flows. Capt Iffert and his co-pilot Capt Francois Lacombe have been flying an increasing number of cargo flights in recent months as demand steadily builds in Europe and the Middle East for everything from the latest flat-screen TVs to car spare parts.

Etihad carried a company record of 23,000 tonnes of cargo last month. Increased volumes to Pakistan, Australia, China and Bangladesh contributed to more than 30,000 shipments being made. The UAE was the top destination for cargo. ""Cargo is not a few tonnes here and there; it's a major part of our business,"" said Roy Kinnear, the senior vice president of Etihad Crystal Cargo. ""There's no sign of the cargo business slowing down.""

While Dubai is looking to cement its reputation as a regional trading centre through the cargo facilities offered by the new Al Maktoum International Airport, adding to its existing trade infrastructure at the nearby Jebel Ali Port, Abu Dhabi is also raising its capacity. Phase one of the capital's Khalifa Port is scheduled to open in 2012, replacing the existing main port of Mina Zayed. The new port will have an initial capacity of two million 20-foot equivalent units of containers and nine million tonnes of general cargo. ""With the infrastructure projects going on there's enough trade competition for both Abu Dhabi and Dubai,"" said Michael Tomalin, the chief executive of National Bank of Abu Dhabi. ""Dubai represents a bigger part of our trade credit business at the moment but I suspect that will change over the next 20 years.""

Etihad has already experienced a 21 per cent growth in cargo tonnage in the year to date compared to the same period last year. From September 1, its latest freighter will begin flights between Abu Dhabi and Beijing, Hong Kong, Tripoli, N'djamena and Nairobi in Africa and Milan and Frankfurt in Europe. In October it will be joined on the route by a second A330-200F, which will arrive from Airbus next month with Etihad taking delivery of a Boeing 777 freighter in June next year.

Etihad has been relying on leasing aircraft for its Etihad Crystal Cargo business arm and operates two Airbus A300-600s and two Boeing MD-11s. The Toulouse-based Airbus says the A330-200F is the most efficient freighter flying. Capable of holding up to 64.9 tonnes of goods, Etihad's A330-200F will be packed with goods on most of its trips. On the first flight on Monday, however, the vast chasm of the cargo hold was almost empty apart from seven tonnes of produce stored at the back of the aircraft in pallets resting on roller-flooring designed to enable quicker loading and unloading of goods. Red onions, leeks and aubergines sealed in cardboard boxes bound for Chad sat alongside boxes containing high-tech electronic goods bound for the Indonesian capital Jakarta, giving a flavour of the diversity of demand the airline aims to tap into.

EGYPTAIR receives first Airbus A330-300 - defenceWeb,"Mon, 30 Aug 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuY2V3ZWIuY28uemEvYWVyb3NwYWNlL2Flcm9zcGFjZS1hZXJvc3BhY2UvZWd5cHRhaXItcmVjZWl2ZXMtZmlyc3QtYWlyYnVzLWEzMzAtMzAwL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"EGYPTAIR has received its first Airbus A330-300 aircraft from the Airbus facility in Toulouse, France. Powered by Rolls Royce Trent 700 engines, the aircraft seats 301 passengers with 265 in Economy Class, and 36 in Business Class.

Joining EGYPTAIR’s existing Airbus fleet of 17 A320 family aircraft, seven A330-200s and three A340-200s, the new A330-300 will be the first EGYPTAIR aircraft to feature onboard communications technology, enabling passengers to benefit from in flight mobile phone services and WI-FI internet access.

“This delivery is an important milestone in the history of EGYPTAIR .We will continue to bring the latest to our customers who deserve this premium and highly competitive product” said Eng. Hussein Massoud, Chairman and CEO of EGYPTAIR Holding Company. He added “we are determined on the ambitious plan for fleet expansion and modernisation.”

Captain Alaa Ashour, the Chairman and CEO of EGYPTAIR Airlines, who flew the new aircraft himself to Cairo said “the delivery of the first Airbus A330-300 will add value to our customers and launches new services for the first time in EGYPTAIR.”

“We are proud to be partnering with EGYPTAIR as they launch their new onboard communications offering on the A330,” said John Leahy, Airbus Chief Operating Officer, Customers. “Passengers can now use these innovative services from the unparalleled comfort of the A330 cabin whilst the airline will benefit from the excellent reliability and economics offered by the aircraft.”

Airbus aircraft share a unique cockpit and operational commonality, allowing airlines to use the same pool of pilots, cabin crews and maintenance engineers, bringing operational flexibility and resulting in significant cost savings.

In the Middle East and North Africa region (MENA), Airbus has sold around 1000 aircraft and has a backlog of over 500. More than 500 Airbus aircraft are flying with 48 MENA operators, representing around 40% percent of the fleet in service in the region.

The A330 is one of the most widely used widebody aircraft in service today. To date, Airbus has won more than 1,000 firm orders for the various versions of the aircraft. Over 700 A330s have already been delivered and the aircraft is currently flying with over 80 operators worldwide.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999810457229614}",positive,0.9999810457229614,1
Goldenrod and Ragweed - Urban Jungle - The Washington Post,"Tue, 10 Aug 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHA6Ly93d3cud2FzaGluZ3RvbnBvc3QuY29tL3dwLXNydi9zcGVjaWFsL21ldHJvL3VyYmFuLWp1bmdsZS9wYWdlcy8xMDA4MTAuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"More birds, more flights, more strikes

Aircraft collisions with birds reach a yearly peak in August

A summer's worth of breeding has swollen bird populations, with many of them gathering in flocks that increase hazards for pilots.

""There are at least twice as many birds in the population as in June,"" says Richard Dolbeer, a science adviser to the USDA Wildlife Services Program. ""Recently fledged birds are inexperienced flyers and foragers . . . and are more likely to be struck by aircraft than the more experienced adults.""

In the past 20 years, populations of large birds such as pelicans, eagles and geese have been steadily increasing, which has led to many more reported collisions with an ever-expanding fleet of airliners. Since 1990, 24 people have died in 10 such strikes in North America.

Airliners have become more vulnerable to the effects of colliding with birds. The more engines an airliner has, the less likely it is to be brought down by striking a flock. In the past two decades, two-engine aircraft have all but replaced three- and four-engine jets.

In January 2009, a US Airways flight departing New York's La Guardia Airport narrowly averted disaster when the Airbus 320's two engines failed after thrusting through a flock of Canada geese. Pilot C.B. ""Sully"" Sullenberger managed to land in the Hudson River; all aboard were rescued before the jet sank.

In the past 20 years, more than 1,200 Canada geese have been been hit by civil aircraft.

The abundance of nonmigratory giant Canada geese (a nine-pound jumbo subspecies) has mushroomed fourfold since 1990. Unlike their smaller migratory cousins, these geese generally stay put year-round, creating constant jeopardy for air traffic.

The USDA's Airport Wildlife Hazards Program assists with several methods for reducing goose hazards:","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.7105093598365784}",negative,0.7105093598365784,-1
Work on Bellary airport to be launched on Aug 20 - Deccan Herald,"Fri, 06 Aug 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlY2NhbmhlcmFsZC5jb20vaW5kaWEva2FybmF0YWthL3dvcmstb24tYmVsbGFyeS1haXJwb3J0LXRvLWJlLWxhdW5jaGVkLW9uLWF1Zy0yMC04MzYyOC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The State Government, on Friday, signed an agreement with Chennai-based Marg Ltd, a construction firm, for the construction of greenfield airport that will be named after the erstwhile Vijayanagara ruler Krishnadevaraya.



The government will organise the bhoomi pooja for the project on August 20, the same day the ruling BJP is holding a rally in Bellary to counter the Congress padayatra. Leader of the Opposition in Lok Sabha Sushma Swaraj will take part in the programme.



G R K Reddy of Marg and Manjula Geetha, Under Secretary, Infrastructure Department, signed the agreement in presence of Tourism and Infrastructure Minister G Janardhana Reddy. The airport is being developed on a build, operate and transfer (BOT) basis.

The first phase of the project accommodates ATR 72 flights. In the second, it will be upgraded to accommodate Airbus 320.



The company was selected for the project through an open bid system. It will be paying annually Rs 36,000 per acre to the government. The initial agreement is for 30 years. And, the agreement is extendable by a further 30 years.



Speaking with reporters, Janardhana Reddy said Friday was “historic” for the people of Bellary people.



“Many people had opposed the project. Former prime minister H D Deve Gowda, KPCC President R V Deshpande and activist Medha Patkar came to Bellary to oppose the project. But people of Bellary favoured the project, and farmers parted with their land for it,” he said.



The minister said Bellary had attracted investment to the tune of Rs two lakh crore. The district attracting such huge investments needed an airport. The government had released Rs 110 crore towards the land purchased from farmers.



As much as Rs 93 crore had already been distributed among those losing land.

The rest of the amount would be distributed in a week’s time. G R K Reddy said the airport would be constructed in 24 months. Business might not pick up from the day one, but it would be gradually as many steel industries would come up in the district.

Moreover, Hampi would become a major tourist attraction. “I am hopeful the project is viable”, he said.
